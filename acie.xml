         <title>Substrate Tumbling in a Chemisorbed Diastereomeric &#945;&#8208;Ketoester/1&#8208;(1&#8208;Naphthyl)ethylamine Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) data for &#945;&#8208;ketoester/1&#8208;(1&#8208;naphthyl)ethylamine complexes on Pt(111) reveal a tumbling motion that couples two neighboring binding states. The interconversion, resulting in prochiral inversion of the &#945;&#8208;ketoester, occurs in single complexes without breaking them apart. This is a surprising observation because the overall motion requires rotation of the &#945;&#8208;ketoester away from the surface without branching exclusively into diffusion away from the complex or desorption. The multi&#8208;step interconversion is rationalized in terms of sequences of bound states that combine transient H&#8208;bond interactions with the chiral molecule and weakened adsorption interactions with the metal. The observation of tumbling in single long&#8208;lived complexes is of relevance to self&#8208;assembly and directed molecular motion on surfaces, to ligand&#8208;controlled surface reactions, and most directly to stereocontrol in asymmetric heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Access to 1,3&#8208;Oxazepine&#8208;Containing Bridged Biaryls via Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclosed herein an atroposelective synthesis of novel bridged biaryls containing medium&#8208;sized rings via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalysis. The reaction starts with addition of carbene catalysts to aminophenols&#8208;derived aldimine substrates. Subsequent oxidation and intramolecular desymmetrization lead to the formation of 1,3&#8208;oxazepine&#8208;containing bridged biaryls in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. This novel bridged biaryl products can be readily transformed to chiral phosphite ligands. Preliminary density function theory calculations suggest that the origin of enantioselectivity arises from the more favorable frontier molecular orbital interactions in the transition state leading to the major product.</dc:description>

         <title>C(sp3)&#8208;H Hydroxylation in Diiron &#946;&#8208;Hydroxylase CmlA Transpires by&#160;Amine&#8208;Assisted O2 Activation Avoiding FeIV2O2 Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through QM/MM modelings, we discover that the C(sp  3  )&#8208;H  &#946;&#8208;  hydroxylation in the diiron hydroxylase CmlA transpires by a traceless amine&#8208;assisted O  2  activation. Different from the canonical diiron hydroxylase sMMO, this aliphatic amine&#8208;assisted O  2  activation avoids generating the high&#8208;valent diferryl Fe  IV  2  O  2  species, but alternatively renders a diferric Fe  III  2  O species as the reactive oxidant. From this unprecedented O  2  activation mode, the derived C(sp  3  )&#8208;H hydroxylation mechanism in CmlA also differs drastically from the toluene aromatic C(sp  2  )&#8208;H hydroxylation in the diiron hydroxylase T4MO. This substrate&#8208;modulated O  2  activation in CmlA has rich mechanistic implications for other diiron hydroxylases having amine group adjacent to C&#8208;H bond under hydroxylation in substrates, e.g., hDOHH. Furthermore, the adapted coordination environment of the diiron cofactor upon O  2  binding in CmlA, also opens up more structural and mechanistic possibilities for O  2  activation in non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bifunctional CdS/MoO2/MoS2 Catalyst Enhances Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and Pyruvic Acid Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The best use of photogenerated electrons and holes is crucial to boosting photocatalytic activity. Herein, a bifunctional dual&#8208;cocatalyst&#8208;modified photocatalyst is constructed based on CdS/MoO2  /MoS2  hollow spheres for hydrogen evolution coupled with selective  pyruvic acid (PA) production from lactic acid (LA) oxidation. MoS2  and MoO2  are simultaneously obtained from the conversion of CdMoO4  in one step. In a photocatalytic process, the MoS2  and MoO2  function as the reduction and oxidation centers on which photogenerated electrons and holes accumulate and are used for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and PA synthesis, respectively. By monitoring the intermediates, a  two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron  route for PA production is proposed, which is initiated by the cleavage of the &#945;&#8208;C(sp3  )&#8211;H bond in the LA.  The conversion of LA and  the selectivity of  PA can reach  ca. 29% and 95% after a five&#8208;hour reaction, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>The Microscopic Origin of Second Harmonic Generation Response: The Spatial Structure of Instantaneous Dipole Moments in Electron Excitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A deep understanding on the crucial factors of the enhanced macroscopic second harmonic generation (SHG) in some deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is needed to design new NLO materials. Since an optical process relates to the electron excitation and polarization simultaneously, the instantaneous dipole moments and their structures in excitation should be seriously taken account to seek the principal factor in SHG response. In this work, we study the Ba  4  B  11  O  20  F (BBOF), a NLO material, by using the orbital projection technique. From the projected SHG of our theoretic calculation, we recognize the principal dipole moment of the dominant influence on SHG and the relevant atom groups between which the dipole moment is accommodated. With the conclusion that the dipole moment with the most significant influence on SHG is the one between the oxygen&#8211;boron polyhedral anion group and barium cation, we predict that Ba  4  Al  11  O  20  F (BAOF) has a comparable SHG response.</dc:description>

         <title>Decarboxylative Sulfinylation Enables a Direct, Metal&#8208;Free Access to Sulfoxides from Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling of carboxylic acids and sulfinates provides a direct and modular access to sulfoxides by a photocatalytic process that has unveiled the unexplored chemoselective radicalophilic reactivity of intermediate sulfinyl sulfones and enabled the conjunctive coupling of two carboxylic acids, revealing broad new chemical space accessible by the merger of the two coupling partner classes of emergent synthetic importance.







Abstract
The intermediate oxidation state of sulfoxides is central to the plethora of their applications in chemistry and medicine, yet it presents challenges for an efficient synthetic access, limiting the structural diversity of currently available sulfoxides. Here, we report a data&#8208;guided development of direct decarboxylative sulfinylation that enables the previously inaccessible functional group interconversion of carboxylic acids to sulfoxides in a reaction with sulfinates. Given the broad availability of carboxylic acids and the growing synthetic potential of sulfinates, the direct decarboxylative sulfinylation is poised to improve the structural diversity of synthetically accessible sulfoxides. The reaction is facilitated by a kinetically favored sulfoxide formation from the intermediate sulfinyl sulfones, despite the strong thermodynamic preference for the sulfone formation, unveiling the previously unknown and chemoselective radicalophilic sulfinyl sulfone reactivity.

         <title>[Ph4P]+[Cu(CF2H)2]&#8722;: A Powerful Difluoromethylating Reagent Inspired by Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful difluoromethylating reagent [Ph4P]+[Cu(CF2H)2]&#8722; that was able to difluoromethylate a variety of aryl and alkyl electrophiles was developed. In the presence of an oxidant, complex 2 also reacted with various lithium nbutyl arylboronic acid pinacol esters, alkyne and heteroarene. Moreover, complex 2 could transmetalate the difluoromethyl reagent to other metals such as [Ph4P]+[Cu(Cl2)]&#8722; and [(DPPF)Pd(Cl)2].







Abstract
The quest of the active species in copper&#8208;mediated difluoromethylation of aryl halides led to the discovery of a powerful difluoromethylating reagent [Ph4P]+[Cu(CF2H)2]&#8722; 2. Complex 2 was able to difluoromethylate a variety of electrophiles including electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich aryl iodides, heteroaryl iodides, activated heteroaryl bromides, chloride and aryl bromides with a directing group, as well as other electrophiles such as alkenyl iodide, benzyl bromides, allyl bromides, alkyl iodide, allyl carbonates and acid chloride. In addition, in the presence of an oxidant, complex 2 reacted with various lithium nbutyl arylboronic acid pinacol esters, alkyne and heteroarene. Moreover, complex 2 could transmetalate the difluoromethyl reagent to other metals such as [Ph4P]+[CuCl2]&#8722; and [(DPPF)PdCl2].

         <title>3D Blockage Mapping for Identifying Familial Point Mutations in Single Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Peptides with a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accurate discrimination of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides containing familial point mutations would advance the knowledge of their roles in early&#8208;onset Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Herein, we simultaneously identified the mutant A21G, E22G, E22Q, and the wild&#8208;type (WT) A&#946;  18&#8208;26  peptides with aerolysin nanopore using a 3D blockage mapping strategy. The standard deviation of current blockade fluctuations (  &#963;  b  ) was proposed as a new supplement to current blockage (  I  b  /  I  0  ) and duration time (  t  D  ) to profile the blockage characteristics of single molecules. Although the WT and A21G A&#946;  18&#8208;26  are indistinguishable in a traditional  I  b  /  I  0  &#8208;  t  D  2D description, ~87% of the blockade events can be accurately classified with half reduction of false identification using a combination of  I  b  /  I  0  ,  t  D,  and  &#963;  b  . This work offers an easy and reliable strategy to promote nanopore sensitivity of peptide mutants, leading to a more precise analysis of pathogenic mutations for developing effective diagnosis and treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Complex Chirality Evolution in DNA&#8208;Assembled High&#8208;Order, Hybrid Chiroplasmonic Superstructures from Multi&#8208;Scale Chirality Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical, chiral hybrid superstructures of chromophores and nanoparticles are expected to give rise to intriguing unveiled chiroptical responses originating from the complex chiral interactions among the components. Herein, DNA origami cavity that could self&#8208;assemble into one&#8208;dimensional (1D) DNA tubes was employed as a scaffold to accurately organize metal nanoparticles and chromophores. The chiral interactions were studied at the level of individual hybrid particles and their 1D hybrid superstructures. Complex chirality mechanisms involving global structural chirality, plasmon&#8208;induced circular dichroism (PICD) and exciton&#8208;coupled circular dichroism (ECCD) were disentangled. The multiplexed CD spectrum superposition revealed the chirality evolution at different length scales. These results can offer a model for boosting the theoretical understanding of classical&#8208;quantum hybrid systems, and would inspire the future design of optically&#8208;active substances across length scales.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;driven overall water splitting beyond 800 nm remains a high&#8208;priority target yet great challenge. Here we report that efficient utilization of photogenerated electrons in a photosensitized system prepared by site&#8208;selective photodeposition of platinum single atoms/clusters (Pt&#8208;SACs) on Ni&#8208;phytate (PA&#8208;Ni)&#8208;sensitized polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The optimal catalyst presents simultaneous hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) evolution with an H2 evolution amount of 1.4 &#956;mol at &#955; &gt; 800 nm for 24 hours, which its activity was approximately 140 times higher than that of a system without Pt&#8208;SAC modification (PA&#8208;Ni1.1@PCN). This work represents the first NIR&#8208;light responsive photosensitized system for overall water splitting, and may open an avenue for precisely manipulating cocatalyst positions at the atomic level to improve NIR&#8208;light&#8208;driven overall water splitting via photosensitization.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Access to Vicinal Diamines by Metal&#8208;Free Photosensitized Amidylimination of Alkenes with Oxime Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free photosensitized protocol for regioselective diamination of alkene feedstocks over a single step was developed based on the rationally designed bifunctional diamination reagent, thus affording a range of differentially protected 1,2&#8208;diamines in moderate to high yields. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction is initiated with a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer between thioxanthone catalyst and diamination reagent, followed by fragmentation to simultaneously generate long&#8208;lived iminyl radical and transient amidyl radical. The excellent regioselectivity presumably stems from the large reactivity difference between two different  N  &#8208;centered radical species. This protocol is characterized by excellent regioselectivity, broad functional group tolerance, and mild reaction conditions, which would enrich the diversity and versatility of facilitate the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of 1,2&#8208;diamine&#8208;containing complex molecule scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Ti&#8208;doped CeO2 Stabilized Single&#8208;Atom Rhodium Catalyst for Selective and Stable CO2 Hydrogenation to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of effective and stable catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation into ethanol remains a challenge. Herein, we report that Rh1/CeTiOx single&#8208;atom catalyst constructed by embedding monoatomic Rh onto Ti&#8208;doped CeO2 support has shown a super high ethanol selectivity (~99.1%), record&#8208;breaking turnover frequency (493.1 h&#8208;1), and outstanding stability. Synergistic effects of Ti&#8208;doption and monoatomic Rh contribute to this excellent catalytic performance by firstly facilitating oxygen vacancies formation to generate oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;Rh Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;base pairs, which favor CO2 adsorption and activation, cleavage of C&#8208;O bonds in CHxOH* and COOH* into CHx* and CO* species, subsequent C&#8208;C coupling and hydrogenation into ethanol, and secondly generating strong Rh&#8208;O bond by Ti&#8208;doping&#8208;induced crystal reconstruction, which contributes to striking stability. This work stresses the importance of support elaborating regulation for single&#8208;atom catalyst design to improve the catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Strategy for Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescent Material Based on Cross&#8208;Linking&#8208;Induced Emission. Application in Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Versatile strategy for smart&#160;fluorescent materials is lacking&#160;due to their diverse responding mechanisms and incompatibility of responsive behaviors. Herein presents an adaptable strategy&#160;toward multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material with stage&#8208;by&#8208;stage responsive behavior by blending linear polymers&#160;modified with different&#160;stimulus&#8208;responsive moieties and AIE cross&#8208;linker. Under stimuli, the linear polymer can&#160;cross&#8208;link with the cross&#8208;linker to form networks, which intrinsically restrict the intramolecular rotation of the AIE&#160;molecule&#160;to induce strong emission. A unified stimuli&#8208;responsive&#160;mechanism is involved in that various stimuli are transferred through the organized "stimulus&#8208;crosslink&#8208;emission" process.&#160;This strategy ensures the&#160;compatibility of different stimuli&#8208;responses&#160;and the adjustability of stimulus&#8208;response behavioral logic.&#160;These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent materials have exhibited strong accessibility and adaptability for information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>sp2 to sp3 Hybridization Transformation in Ionic Crystals under Unprecedentedly Low Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Under cold pressure sp1/sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 hybridization transformation has been exclusively observed in covalent or molecular crystals overwhelmingly above ~10 GPa, and the approaches to lower the transition pressure are limited on external heat&#8208;treatment and/or catalyzers. Herein we demonstrate that, by internal&#8208;lattice stress&#8208;transfer from ionic to covalent groups, the transformation can be significantly prompted, as shown in a crystal of LiBO2 under 2.85 GPa for the first case in ionic crystals. This unprecedentedly low transformation pressure is ascribed to the enhanced localized stress on covalent B&#8208;O frames transferred from ionic Li&#8208;O bonds in LiBO2, and accordingly the corresponding structural feature is summarized. This work provides an internal structural regulation strategy for pressure&#8208;reduction of the s&#8208;p orbital hybridization transformation and extends the sp1/sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 transformation landscape from molecular and covalent compounds to ionic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Surface Reaction Kinetics through Ligand Field Effects for Fast and Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing water&#8208;deficient solvation sheath of Zn2+ by ligand substitution is a widely used strategy to protect Zn metal anode, yet the intrinsic tradeoff between Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and the side hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a huge challenge. Herein, we find boric acid (BA) with moderate ligand field interaction can partially replace H2O molecules in the solvation sheath of Zn2+, forming a stable water&#8208;deficient solvation sheath. It enables fast Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and substantially suppressed HER. Crucially, by systematically comparing the ligand field strength and solvation energies between BA and the ever&#8208;reported electrolyte additives, we also find that the solvation energy has a strong correlation with Zn nucleation/dissolution kinetics and HER inhibition ability, displaying a classic volcano behavior. The modulation map could provide valuable insights for solvation sheath design of zinc batteries and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Radical NHC Catalysis: Divergent Difunctionalization of Olefins through Intermolecular Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis, typically leading to the formation of acyl azolium reactive intermediates, constitutes one of the most important activation strategies for the NHC&#8208;catalyzed chemical transformations. Here, we report an unprecedented oxidative radical NHC catalysis by using peroxyester as the external single&#8208;electron oxidant to realize divergent difunctionalization of olefins. The key to success of this chemistry is the catalytic generation of oxygen radicals that could trigger an intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer to activate the inert C&#8208;H bonds, thereby enabling the productive radical relay process. With this protocol, commonly used general chemicals could serve as radical precursors to allow efficient synthesis of value&#8208;added products in a straightforward and cost&#8208;effective manner. Preliminary mechanistic investigations, including control experiments and DFT calculations, shed light on the NHC organocatalytic radical reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Assembly of Multivalent DNA&#8208;Protein Superstructures for Tumor Imaging and Targeted Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Programmable DNA materials hold great potential in biochemical and biomedical researches, yet the&#160;complicated synthesis, and the low stability and targeting efficacy in complex biological milieu&#160;limit their clinical translations. Here we show a one&#8208;pot assembly of DNA&#8208;protein superstructures as drug vehicles with specifically high affinity and stability for targeted therapy. This is achieved by biomimetic assembly of programmable polymer DNA wire into densely packed DNA nanosphere with an alkaline protein, protamine. Multivalent DNA nanostructures encoded with different types and densities of aptamers exhibit high affinity to targeted cells through polyvalent interaction. Our results show high cancer cell selectivity, reduced side effect, excellent therapeutic efficacy, and sensitive tumor imaging in both subcutaneous and orthotopic non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer murine models. This biomimetic assembly approach provides practical DNA nanomaterials for further clinical trials and may advance oligonucleotide drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Greatly Enhanced Accessibility and Reproducibility of Worm&#8208;like Micelles by in situ Crosslinking Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Worm&#8208;like micelles have attracted great interest due to their anisotropic structures. However, the experimental conditions for obtaining worm&#8208;like micelles are very restricted, which usually causes seriously poor reproducibility. In this work, significantly enhanced accessibility of worm&#8208;like micelles is realized by in situ crosslinking polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). The reproducibility of worm&#8208;like micelles is greatly improved due to the significantly enlarged experimental windows of worm&#8208;like micelles in the morphology diagram. Moreover, the reliability of the methodology to enhance the accessibility of worm&#8208;like micelles has been demonstrated in various in situ crosslinking PISA systems. The greatly enhanced accessibility and reproducibility of worm&#8208;like micelles is undoubtedly cost&#8208;effective especially in scale&#8208;up production, which paves the way for further application of worm&#8208;like micelles with various compositions and functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Singlet Oxygen Delivery: A Bioorthogonal Metabolic Shunt Linking Hypoxia to Fast Singlet Oxygen Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet oxygen can be generated by thermal cycloreversion of aromatic endoperoxides.&#160; However, for any practical potential of chemically generated singlet oxygen within a therapeutic context, the time and place of the release of this cytotoxic species must be tightly regulated.&#160; We now show that using a bimodular design with a hypoxia responsive unit and fluoride&#8208;triggered endoperoxide unit, a bioorthogonal metabolic shunt can be established, where enzymatically generated submicromolar fluoride signal plays a crucial role.&#160; Thus, cellular nitroreductase is repurposed in a bioorthogonal enzymatic activity, where it releases fluoride ions upon the reduction of a targeted compound. The fluoride ions released in the initial reaction, remove the silyl stopper, yielding a highly accelerated release of singlet oxygen.&#160; The result is a remarkable difference in cytotoxicity between hypoxic and normoxic conditions as evidenced by microscopy, viability assays and the use of control compounds..</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing and Shape Memory Hypercrosslinked Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra Polymers via Coordination Post&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination&#8208;driven crosslinking networks with reversible and dynamic characteristics are gaining increasing interest in diverse application fields. Herein, we use a coordination crosslinking approach using metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as high&#8208;connectivity building blocks to post&#8208;assemble a class of coordination hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP) polymers. The introduction of 12&#8208;connected MOP nodes to the polymeric networks is critical to producing membranes that overcome the trade&#8208;off between mechanical properties and dynamic self&#8208;healing, and meanwhile possess multifunctionalities including shape memory, solution processability, and 3D printing. The CHMOPs can also be used for anticorrosion coating and achieve function couplings, e.g., shape memory&#8208;assisted self&#8208;healing (SMASH), which have not been achieved in the MOP&#8208;based hybrid materials yet. This work not only offers a feasible strategy to construct new multifunctional materials but also greatly expands the application scopes of MOPs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of temperature&#8208;controlled mechanochemistry to enable the mechanochemical nickel&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling is herein described. Transitioning from a capricious room&#8208;temperature protocol, through to a heated, PID&#8208;controlled programmable jar heater manifold was required to deliver an efficient method for the coupling of aryl sulfamates (derived from ubiquitous phenols) and aryl boronic acid species. Furthermore, this process is conducted using a base&#8208;metal nickel catalyst, in the absence of bulk solvent, and in the absence of air/moisture sensitive reaction set&#8208;ups. This methodology is showcased through translation to large&#8208;scale twin&#8208;screw extrusion methodology enabling 200&#8208;fold scale increase, producing decagram quantities of C&#8208;C coupled material.</dc:description>

         <title>Activity&#8208;based Photoacoustic Probes Reveal Elevated Intestinal MGL and FAAH Activity in a Murine Model of Obesity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Obesity is a chronic health condition characterized by the accumulation of excessive body fat which can lead to and exacerbate cardiovascular disease, type&#8208;II diabetes, high blood pressure, and cancer through systemic inflammation. Unfortunately, visualizing key mediators of the inflammatory response such as monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in a selective manner is a profound challenge owing to an overlapping substrate scope that involves arachidonic acid (AA). Specifically, these enzymes work in concert to generate AA, which in the context of obesity, has been implicated to control appetite and energy metabolism. In this study, we developed the first selective activity&#8208;based sensing probes to detect MGL (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;MGL) and FAAH (PA&#8208;HD&#8208;FAAH) activity via photoacoustic imaging. Activation of PA&#8208;HD&#8208;MGL and PA&#8208;HD&#8208;FAAH by their target enzymes is 1.88&#8208;fold and 1.50&#8208;fold higher, respectively. Due to their exceptional selectivity profiles and deep&#8208;tissue photoacoustic imaging capabilities, these probes were employed to measure MGL and FAAH activity in a murine model of obesity. Contrary to reports suggesting levels of MGL should be attenuated, our results revealed a marked increase of both targets in the gastrointestinal tract. These key finding sets the stage to uncover the role of the endocannabinoid pathway in obesity&#8208;mediated inflammation.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective 1,2&#8208;Oxyhalogenation of Non&#8208; Conjugated Alkynes via Directed Nucleopalladation: Catalytic Access to Tetrasubstituted Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalytic 1,2&#8208;oxyhalogenation method that converts non&#8208;conjugated internal alkynes into tetrasubstituted alkenes with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity is described. Mechanistically, the reaction involves a Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalytic cycle that begins with a directed oxypalladation step. The origin of regioselectivity is the preference for formation of a six&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate, which is facilitated by a N,N&#8208;bidentate 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)isopropyl (PIP) amide directing group. Selectivity for C(alkenyl)&#8211;X versus &#8211;N (X = halide) reductive elimination from the Pd(IV) center depends on the identity of the halide anion; bromide and iodide engage in C(alkenyl)&#8211;X formation, while intramolecular C(alkenyl)&#8211;N reductive elimination occurs with chloride to furnish a lactam product. DFT calculations shed light on the origins of this phenomenon.</dc:description>

         <title>Conferring BiVO4 Nanorods with Oxygen Vacancies to Realize Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the high depth of tissue penetration, non&#8208;invasiveness, and controllability, ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has shown broad application prospects for tumor treatment. However, the electron&#8208;hole separation inefficiency of sonosensitizers and the tumor hypoxia remain two major challenges limiting the effect of SDT. Here, ultrafine photoetched bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) nanorods modified with DSPE&#8208;PEG2000 (PEBVO@PEG NRs) were fabricated to achieve in situ self&#8208;supply of oxygen (O2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) for hypoxic tumor therapy. The photoetching approach could enhance the charge separation by inducing enriched oxygen vacancies on the surface of BiVO4, thereby improving the generation efficiency of ROS and O2. The PEBVO@PEG overcome the main obstacles of traditional sonosensitizers in the SDT process and show promising sonodynamic therapeutic effects, thus providing new strategies for improving the performance of sonosensitizer and hypoxic tumor elimination.</dc:description>

         <title>An Atypical Acyl&#8208;CoA Synthetase Enables Efficient Biosynthesis of Extender Units for Engineering a Polyketide Carbon Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acyl&#8208;CoAs are key precursors of primary and secondary metabolism. Their efficient biosynthesis is often impeded by the limited substrate specificity and low in vivo activity of acyl&#8208;CoA synthetases (ACSs) due to regulatory acylation of the catalytic important lysine residue in motif A10 (Lys&#8208;A10). In this study, we identified an unusual ACS (UkaQ) from the UK&#8208;2A biosynthetic pathway that naturally lacks the Lys&#8208;A10 and exhibits an extraordinarily broad substrate specificity. Protein engineering significantly improves its stability and catalytic activity, enabling it to synthesize a large variety of acyl&#8208;CoAs with highly robust activity. By combining it with permissive carboxylases, we produced  a large arrays of polyketide extender units  and obtained six novel halogenbenzyl containing antimycin analogs via an engineered biosynthetic pathway. This study significantly expands the catalytic mode of ACSs and provides a potent tool for the biosynthesis of acyl&#8208;CoA&#8208;derived natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Interfacial Bonding in Reduced Graphene Oxide Fiber Cathodes Containing Polypyrrole@sulfur Nanospheres for Flexible Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible lithium sulfur batteries with high energy density and good mechanical flexibility are highly desirable. Here, we report a synergistic interface bonding enhancement strategy to construct flexible fiber&#8208;shaped composite cathodes, in which polypyrrole@sulfur (PPy@S) nanospheres are homogeneously implanted into the built&#8208;in cavity of self&#8208;assembled reduced graphene oxide fibers (rGOFs) by a facile microfluidic assembly method. In this architecture, sulfur nanospheres and lithium polysulfides are synergistically hosted by carbon and polymer interface, which work together to provide enhanced interface chemical bonding to endow the cathode with good adsorption ability, fast reaction kinetics, and excellent mechanical flexibility. Consequently, the PPy@S/rGOFs cathode shows enhanced electrochemical performance and high&#8208;rate capability. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are conducted to elucidate the enhanced electrochemical performance. In addition, a flexible Li&#8208;S pouch cell is assembled and delivers a high areal capacity of 5.8 mAh/cm  2  at 0.2 A/g. Our work offers a new strategy for preparation of advanced cathodes for flexible batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Square Planar Cu4 Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polynuclear reaction sites catalyze some of the most challenging transformations in chemistry. Programmatic assembly of atomically&#8208;precise cluster compounds is challenging. Here we describe the synthesis of supramolecular ligands designed to nucleate well&#8208;defined square planar tetranuclear copper clusters, establishing metal&#8208;metal interactions capable of delocalizing oxidation stress across the cluster.







Abstract
Template&#8208;assisted synthesis of well&#8208;defined polynuclear clusters remains a challenge for [M4] square planar topologies. Herein, we present a tetraamine scaffold RL(NH2)4, where L is a rigidified resorcin[4]arene, to direct the formation of C4&#8208;symmetric RL(NH)4Cu4 clusters with Cu&#8722;Cu distances around 2.7&#8197;&#197;, suggesting metal&#8208;metal direct interactions are operative since the sum of copper's van der Waals radii is 2.8&#8197;&#197;. DFT calculations display HOMO to HOMO&#8208;3 residing all within a 0.1&#8197;eV gap. These four orbitals display significant electron density contribution from the Cu centers suggesting a delocalized electronic structure. The one&#8208;electron oxidized [Cu4]+ species was probed by variable temperature X&#8208;band continuous wave&#8208;electron paramagnetic resonance (CW&#8208;EPR), which displays a multiline spectrum at room temperature. This work presents a novel synthetic strategy for [M4] clusters and a new platform to investigate activation of small molecules.

         <title>Small&#8208;Molecule Quenchers for F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer: Structure, Mechanism, and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule (dark) quenchers have been widely used as acceptors in FRET&#8208;based probes to monitor various physiological processes with minimum background signal. Herein, we focus on the quenching mechanisms, types, and biomedical applications of these quenchers. We give an in&#8208;depth discussion of their structure&#8211;property relationship and discuss the potentials and challenges of the quenchers in biomedical applications.







Abstract
For fluorogenic probes, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is one of the most widely used mechanisms to realize the detection of biochemical activities. Dark quenchers relax from the excited state to the ground state non&#8208;radiatively, and are promising alternatives to fluorescent FRET acceptors. Small&#8208;molecule (dark) quenchers have been widely used as acceptors in FRET&#8208;based probes to monitor various physiological processes with minimum background signal. Herein, we summarize the relevant advances of small&#8208;molecule quenchers that are used in FRET&#8208;based probes. This Review is intended to provide suggestions regarding the rationale design and selection of appropriate fluorophore&#8211;quencher FRET pairs, which are fully compatible with challenging analytical applications in various biological systems. Finally, an outlook of the future biomedical applications and developments of this field is presented.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogues and Their Oxide Family as Sulfur Hosts for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) from binary to high&#8208;entropy was fabricated by a facile coprecipitation method. When used as sulfur hosts, high&#8208;entropy PBA can act as polysulfide immobilizers and catalysts to achieve high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Moreover, metal oxides derived from high&#8208;entropy PBA possess good electronic properties, which can prompt the further research of high&#8208;entropy PBA derivatives.







Abstract
The introduction of high&#8208;entropy into Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) has yet to attract attention in the field of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery materials. Herein, we systematically synthesize a library of PBAs from binary to high&#8208;entropy by a facile coprecipitation method. The coordination environment in PBAs is explored by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, which together with elemental mapping confirm the successful introduction of all metals.

     alt="High-Entropy Prussian Blue Analogues and Their Oxide Family as Sulfur Hosts for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A library of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) from binary to high-entropy was fabricated by a facile coprecipitation method. When used as sulfur hosts, high-entropy PBA can act as polysulfide immobilizers and catalysts to achieve high-performance lithium-sulfur batteries. Moreover, metal oxides derived from high-entropy PBA possess good electronic properties, which can prompt the further research of high-entropy PBA derivatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of high-entropy into Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) has yet to attract attention in the field of lithium-sulfur battery materials. Herein, we systematically synthesize a library of PBAs from binary to high-entropy by a facile coprecipitation method. The coordination environment in PBAs is explored by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, which together with elemental mapping confirm the successful introduction of all metals. Importantly, electrochemical tests demonstrate that high-entropy PBA can serve as polysulfide immobilizer to inhibit shuttle effect and as catalyst to promote polysulfides conversion, thereby boosting its outstanding performance. Additionally, a variety of nanocubic metal oxides from binary to senary are fabricated by using PBAs as sacrificial precursors. We believe that a wide range of new materials obtained from our coprecipitation and pyrolysis methodology can promote further developments in research on PBA systems and sulfur hosts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reimplementing Guest Shape Sorting of Nonporous Adaptive Crystals via Substituent&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Solid&#8208;Vapor Postsynthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, as a proof of concept we report that guest adsorption selectivity in nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs) can be readily and precisely tuned via a facile substituent&#8208;size&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;vapor postsynthetic modification method. Comprehensive structural analyses confirm that the intermolecular interactions between the host and guest are the major factors in determining the guest selectivity.







Abstract
Postsynthetic modification (PSM) has been widely used in porous crystalline materials to gain better performance in adsorptive separation of gases or hydrocarbons. We here report that guest adsorption selectivity in a kind of nonporous crystalline materials, namely nonporous adaptive crystals (NACs), can be readily and precisely tuned via a facile substituent&#8208;size&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;vapor PSM method. Before PSM, NACs of pillar[4]arene[1]quinone EtP4Q1 show negligible selectivity for C5 hydrocarbons. PSM with a larger substituent, cyclopentylamine, onto EtP4Q1 NACs does not improve the selectivity, while EtP4Q1 NACs after PSM with a slightly smaller substituent, cyclobutylamine, is endowed with very high preference of n&#8208;pentane over cyclopentane. Comprehensive structural analyses confirm that the intermolecular interactions among the host compounds and host&#8211;guest interactions between the adsorbent and the adsorbate are the two major factors in determining the guest selectivity.

         <title>Energy Transfer Chemiluminescent Spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;Dioxetane Probes for Bioanalyte Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy transfer from chemiluminescent spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetane scaffolds to dyes in the proximity allows signal amplification while affording luminescence in the biologically relevant red/near infrared region. Strategies to promote such donor&#8211;acceptor interactions include polymeric entrapment, host&#8211;guest encapsulation, and direct tethering of organic and inorganic fluorophores.







Abstract
Chemiluminescence imaging of bioanalytes using spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes has gained significant attention due to improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and imaging depth compared to excitation&#8208;based probes, as well as their modifiable scaffolds that offer analyte&#8208;specific responses and tunable emissive properties. Among several strategies employed to amplify signals under aqueous conditions and to shift the emission into the bio&#8208;relevant red region, energy transfer to an adjacent fluorophore is a popular and effective method. This Minireview highlights spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;based probes that operate via an energy transfer mechanism to detect bioanalytes both in vitro and in vivo. Probes that display both non&#8208;covalent and covalent interactions with fluorophores, as well as their applications in imaging specific analytes will be discussed.

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Oxidative Azidation/Heterocyclization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides under Buffer Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage derivatization was used to construct azide&#8208;substituted tetrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]indole&#8208;containing peptides through a radical azidation/heterocyclization cascade. This electrochemical oxidative strategy could be conducted under mild, efficient, and environmentally friendly conditions in buffer solution.







Abstract
As the aromatic tryptophan (Trp) side chain plays a pivotal role in influencing the structure and function of peptides and proteins, it has become an attractive target for the late&#8208;stage modification of these important biomolecules. Herein, we report an electrochemical approach for late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides containing a Trp side chain through manganese&#8208;catalyzed tandem radical azidation/heterocyclization. This electrochemical oxidative strategy provides access to azide&#8208;substituted tetrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]indole&#8208;containing peptides with broad functional group tolerance, high site selectivity, and good yields of products (up to 87&#8201;%) under mild buffer conditions. Moreover, the modified Trp&#8208;containing peptides bearing an azide functionality are promising building blocks, paving the way for the construction of various derivatives, such as &#8220;click&#8221; chemistry products.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Hydrogenation of Electron&#8208;Poor Alkenes and Dienes Enabled by a Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydride Addition/Protonolysis Mechanism
</title>

         <dc:description>
Rh(CO)2acac/xantphos in methanol catalyzes the selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor dienes and related substrates at low metal loadings via a hydride addition/Rh&#8208;enolate protonation pathway.







Abstract
The transition metal catalyzed hydrogenation of alkenes is a well&#8208;developed technology used on lab scale as well as on large scales in the chemical industry. Site&#8208; and chemoselective mono&#8208;hydrogenations of polarized conjugated dienes remain challenging. Instead, stoichiometric main&#8208;group hydrides are used rather than H2. As part of an effort to develop a scalable route to prepare geranylacetone, we discovered that Rh(CO)2acac/xantphos based catalysts enable the selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes, enones, and other polyunsaturated substrates. D&#8208;labeling and DFT studies support a mechanism where a nucleophilic RhI&#8208;hydride selectively adds to electron&#8208;poor alkenes and the resulting Rh&#8208;enolate undergoes subsequent inner&#8208;sphere protonation by alcohol solvent. The finding that (Ln)Rh(H)(CO) type catalysts can enable selective mono&#8208;hydrogenation of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes provides a valuable tool in the design of related chemoselective hydrogenation processes.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical Carboxylation of Organic Halides in the Presence of Catalytic Amounts of an Organomediator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and metal&#8208;free method for the electroreductive carboxylation of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds has been developed to obtain carboxylated compounds in the presence of catalytic amounts of naphthalene as a mediator. This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope, and is shown to be a powerful approach for the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of natural product and drug derivatives.







Abstract
Herein, an electroreductive carboxylation of organic carbon&#8208;halogen bonds (X=Br and Cl) promoted by catalytic amounts of naphthalene as an organic mediator is reported. This transformation proceeds smoothly under mild conditions with a broad substrate scope of 59 examples, affording the valuable and versatile carboxylic acids in moderate to excellent yields without the need of costly transition metal, wasted stoichiometric metal reductants, or sacrificial anodes. Further late&#8208;stage carboxylations of natural product and drug derivatives demonstrate its synthetic utility. Mechanistic studies confirmed the activation of carbon&#8208;halogen bonds via single&#8208;electron transfer and the key role of naphthalene in this reaction.

This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope, and is shown to be a powerful approach for the late-stage carboxylation of natural product and drug derivatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, an electroreductive carboxylation of organic carbon-halogen bonds (X=Br and Cl) promoted by catalytic amounts of naphthalene as an organic mediator is reported. This transformation proceeds smoothly under mild conditions with a broad substrate scope of 59 examples, affording the valuable and versatile carboxylic acids in moderate to excellent yields without the need of costly transition metal, wasted stoichiometric metal reductants, or sacrificial anodes. Further late-stage carboxylations of natural product and drug derivatives demonstrate its synthetic utility. Mechanistic studies confirmed the activation of carbon-halogen bonds via single-electron transfer and the key role of naphthalene in this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Static and Dynamic Gradient Based Directional Transportation of Neutral Molecules in Swollen Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral molecules are transported along a pre&#8208;defined pathway via static and dynamic chemical gradient respectively. A static hexyl to hydroxyl functionalized gradient could pull the neutral ambipolar nerve agent surrogate diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate towards hydroxyl&#8208;rich region. A dynamic gradient (a &#8220;travelling wave&#8221;) formed by a coupled reaction&#8208;diffusion process was utilized to drive the neutral non&#8208;polar molecule pyrene.







Abstract
Materials which selectively transport molecules offer powerful opportunities for concentrating and separating chemical agents. Here, utilizing static and dynamic chemical gradients, transport of molecules within swollen crosslinked polymers is demonstrated. Using an &#8776;200&#8197;&#956;m static hydroxyl to hexyl gradient, the neutral ambipolar nerve agent surrogate diethyl (cyanomethyl)phosphonate (DECP) is directionally transported and concentrated 60&#8208;fold within 4&#8197;hours. To accelerate transport kinetics, a dynamic gradient (a &#8220;travelling wave&#8221;) is utilized. Here, the non&#8208;polar dye pyrene was transported. The dynamic gradient is generated by an ion exchange process triggered by the localized introduction of an aqueous NaCl solution, which converts the gel from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. As the hydrophilic region expands, associated water enters the gel, and pyrene is pushed ahead of the expansion front. The dynamic gradient provides about 10&#8208;fold faster transport kinetics than the static gradient.

         <title>Megalo&#8208;Cavitands: Synthesis of Acridane[4]arenes and Formation of Large, Deep Cavitands for Selective C70 Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedentedly large structural platform, named acridane[4]arene (diameter approx. 14&#8197;&#197;), synthesized in only six steps, has been shown to be suitable for the construction of cavitands with volumes of up to 814&#8197;&#197;3. These megalo&#8208;cavitands serve as size&#8208;selective hosts for fullerenes with sub&#8208;&#956;M binding affinity for C70.







Abstract
Deep cavitands, concave molecular containers, represent an important supramolecular host class that has been explored for a variety of applications ranging from sensing, switching, purification and adsorption to catalysis. A major limitation in the field has been the cavitand volume that is restricted by the size of the structural platform utilized (diameter approx. 7&#8197;&#197;). We here report the synthesis of a novel, unprecedentedly large structural platform, named acridane[4]arene (diameter approx. 14&#8197;&#197;), suitable for the construction of cavitands with volumes of up to 814&#8197;&#197;3. These megalo&#8208;cavitands serve as size&#8208;selective hosts for fullerenes with mM to sub&#8208;&#956;M binding affinity for C60 and C70. Furthermore, the selective binding of fullerene C70 in the presence of C60 was demonstrated.

         <title>Orthogonal Charge Transfer by Precise Positioning of Silver Single Atoms and Clusters on Carbon Nitride for Efficient Piezocatalytic Pure Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient piezocatalytic systems for two&#8208;electron water splitting (TEWS) with producing H  2  and H  2  O  2  shows great promise to meet the industrial demand. Herein, Ag single atoms (SAs) and clusters are co&#8208;anchored on carbon nitride (Ag  SA+C  &#8208;CN) to serve as the multifunctional sites for efficient TEWS. The Ag SAs enhance the in&#8208;plane piezoelectric polarization of CN that is intimately modulated by the atomic coordination induced charge redistribution, and Ag clusters afford strong interfacial electric field to remarkably promote the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane migration of piezoelectrons from CN. Moreover, Ag  SA+C  &#8208;CN yields a larger piezoresistive effect that elevates carrier mobility under strain. Consequently, a superior H  2  and H  2  O  2  evolution rate of 7.90 mmol&#183;g  &#8208;1  &#183;h  &#8208;1  and 5.84 mmol&#183;g  &#8208;1  &#183;h  &#8208;1  is delivered by Ag  SA+C  &#8208;CN, respectively, far exceeding that of the previously reported piezocatalysts. This work not only presents the SAs decoration as an available polarization enhancement strategy, but also sheds light on the superiority of multi&#8208;sites engineering in piezocatalysis.</dc:description>

Herein, Ag single atoms (SAs) and clusters are co-anchored on carbon nitride (Ag  SA+C  -CN) to serve as the multifunctional sites for efficient TEWS. The Ag SAs enhance the in-plane piezoelectric polarization of CN that is intimately modulated by the atomic coordination induced charge redistribution, and Ag clusters afford strong interfacial electric field to remarkably promote the out-of-plane migration of piezoelectrons from CN. Moreover, Ag  SA+C  -CN yields a larger piezoresistive effect that elevates carrier mobility under strain.

         <title>Modulating Supramolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions in the Solid State using Compressible Macrocyclic Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) interactions between specific donor and acceptor species in host&#8722;guest systems is a big challenge and full of research value in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. In this work, a strategy to modulate the supramolecular ICT interactions in the solid state is developed by compressing the binding cavity of a macrocyclic host named perethylated leaning pillar[6]arene ( p&#8208;EtLP6). The solid&#8208;state ICT affinities of  p&#8208;EtLP6 toward multi&#8208;types of electron&#8208;deficient planar guests could be significantly enhanced by transforming the macrocyclic backbone from the original para&#8208;bridged mode into a hybrid para&#8208; and meta&#8208;bridged isomeric form ( m&#8208;EtLP6). X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural analyses incorporating theoretical calculation demonstrate that the improved ICT affinities are mainly attributed to the superior host&#8722;guest size fit arising from the compressed binding cavity in  m&#8208;EtLP6 as compared with  p&#8208;EtLP6.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions are some of the most widely used methods in organic synthesis. However, despite the obvious advantages of iron as an abundant and low toxicity transition metal catalyst, its practical application in carbonylation reaction remains largely unexplored. Here we report our recent study on Fe&#8208;catalyzed alkoxycarbonylation of alkyl halides. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction is catalyzed by an in situ generated Fe  2&#8208;  complex. This low&#8208;valent iron species activates alkyl bromides via a distinctive two&#8208;electron transfer (TET) process, whereas it proceeds via a single electron transfer (SET) process for alkyl iodides which is consistent with literature.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Selective electrocatalytic&#160;oxidation of alcohol to value&#8208;added aldehyde&#160;has attracted increasing attention. However,&#160;due to its higher reactivity than alcohol, the aldehyde&#160;is easily over&#8208;oxidized to acid in alkaline&#160;electrolytes.&#160;This work&#160;has successfully realized the selective electrooxidation of alcohol to aldehyde on NiO by tuning&#160;the local microenvironment&#160;to salt out&#160;the aldehyde intermediate product from the reaction system. The origin of the high selectivity was unveiled that inhibiting the hydration process of aldehyde and enabling the salting&#8208;out&#160;of aldehyde&#160;at the gas|electrolyte interface are&#160;the key to achieving high selectivity of aldehyde, which is the result of&#160;the decreased&#160;alkalinity&#160;and the increased&#160;cation and substrate concentration. This strategy&#160;could salt out&#160;the aldehyde from the electrooxidation&#160;of alcohol with 100% selectivity and be easily extended to other selective oxidation reactions, such as 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF)&#160;to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxaldehyde (DFF) and amine to an imine.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroatoms Induce Localization of the Electric Field and Promote a Wide Potential&#8208;Window Selectivity Towards CO in the CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO  2  RR) is a sustainable way of producing carbon&#8208;neutral fuels. Product selectivity in CO  2  RR is regulated by the adsorption energy of reaction&#8208;intermediates. Here, we employ differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (DPC&#8208;STEM) to demonstrate that Sn heteroatoms on a Ag catalyst generate very strong and atomically localized electric fields.  In&#8208;situ  attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR) results verified that the localized electric field enhances the adsorption of *COOH, thus favoring the production of CO during CO  2  RR. The Ag/Sn catalyst exhibits a ~100% CO selectivity at a very wide range of potentials (from &#8208;0.5 to &#8208;1.1 V, versus reversible hydrogen electrode), and with a remarkably high energy efficiency (EE) of 76.1%.</dc:description>

         <title>Morphology and Light&#8208;Dependent Spatial Distribution of Spin Defects in Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nitride (CN) is a heterogeneous photocatalyst that combines good structural properties and a broad scope. The photocatalytic efficiency of CN is associated with the presence of defective and radical species. An accurate description of defective states &#8211; both at a local and extended level &#8211; is key to develop a thorough mechanistic understanding of the photophysics of CN. In turn, this will maximise the generation and usage of photogenerated charge carriers and minimise wasteful charge recombination. Here the influence of morphology and light&#8208;excitation on the number and chemical nature of radical defects is assessed. By exploiting the magnetic dipole&#8208;dipole coupling, the spatial distribution of native radicals in CN is derived with high precision. From the analysis an average distance in the range 1.99 &#8208; 2.34 nm is determined, which corresponds to pairs of radicals located approximately four tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units apart.</dc:description>

         <title>Algorithmic Explorations of Unimolecular and Bimolecular Reaction Spaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Algorithmic reaction exploration based on transition state searches has already made inroads into many niche applications, but its potential as a general&#8208;purpose tool is still largely unrealized. Computational cost and the absence of benchmark problems involving larger molecules remain obstacles to further progress. Here an ultra&#8208;low cost exploration algorithm is implemented and used to explore the reactivity of unimolecular and bimolecular reactants, comprising a total of 581 reactions involving 51 distinct reactants. The algorithm discovers all established reaction pathways, where such comparisons are possible, while also revealing a much richer reactivity landscape, including lower barrier reaction pathways and a strong dependence of reaction conformation in the apparent barriers of the reported reactions. The diversity of these benchmarks illustrate that reaction exploration algorithms are approaching general&#8208;purpose capability.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Acquisition of the Gap Height of Biological Tissue&#8208;Electronic Chemical Sensor Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacing biological tissues with electronic sensors offers the exciting opportunity to accurately investigate multiple biological processes. Accurate signal collection and application are the foundation of these measurements, but a long&#8208;term issue is the signal distortion resulting from the interface gap. The height of the gap is the key characteristic needed to evaluate or model the distortion, but it is difficult to measure. By integrating a pair of nanopores at the electronic sensor plane and measuring the ion conductance between them, we developed a versatile and straightforward strategy to realize the direct cooperative evaluation of the gap height during exocytotic release from adrenal gland tissues. The signaling distortion of this gap has been theoretically evaluated and shows almost no influence on the amperometric recording of exocytosis in a classic &#8220;semi&#8208;artificial synapse&#8221; configuration. This strategy should benefit research concerning various bio/chemical/machine interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Endohedrally Functionalized Heteroleptic Coordination Cages for Phosphate Ester Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallosupramolecular hosts of nanoscopic dimensions, able to serve as selective receptors and catalysts, are usually composed of only one type of organic ligand, restricting diversity in terms of cavity shape and functional group decoration. We report a series of heteroleptic [Pd  2  A  2  B  2  ] coordination cages that self&#8208;assemble from a library of shape complementary bis&#8208;monodentate ligands in a non&#8208;statistical fashion. Ligands A features an inward pointing NH function, able to engage in hydrogen bonding and amenable to being functionalized with amide and alkyl substituents. Ligands B comprise tricyclic aromatic backbones of different shape and electronic situation. Obtained heteroleptic coordination cages were investigated for their ability to bind phosphate diesters as guests. All&#8208;atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent were conducted to understand the mechanistic relationships behind the experimentally determined guest affinities.</dc:description>

Ligands B comprise tricyclic aromatic backbones of different shape and electronic situation. Obtained heteroleptic coordination cages were investigated for their ability to bind phosphate diesters as guests. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent were conducted to understand the mechanistic relationships behind the experimentally determined guest affinities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;heterolepticity in Low&#8208;Symmetry Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroleptic metal&#8208;organic cages, formed through integrative self&#8208;assembly of ligand mixtures, are highly attractive as reduced symmetry supramolecular hosts. Ensuring high&#8208;fidelity, nonstatistical self&#8208;assembly, however, presents a significant challenge in molecular engineering due to the inherent difficulty in predicting thermodynamic energy landscapes. In this work, two conceptual strategies are described that circumvent this issue, using ligand design strategies to access structurally sophisticated metal&#8208;organic hosts. Using these approaches, it was possible to realise cavity environments described by two inequivalent, unsymmetrical ligand frameworks, representing a significant step forward in the construction of highly anisotropic confined spaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Closed&#8208;loop Recycling of Poly(Imine&#8208;Carbonate) Derived from Plastic Waste and Bio&#8208;based Resources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Closed&#8208;loop recycling of polymers represents the key technology to convert plastic waste in a sustainable fashion. Efficient chemical recycling and upcycling strategies are thus highly sought&#8208;after to establish a circular plastic economy. Here, we present the selective chemical depolymerization of polycarbonate by employing a vanillin derivative as bio&#8208;based feedstock. The resulting di&#8208;vanillin carbonate monomer was used in combination with various amines to construct a library of reprocessable poly(imine&#8208;carbonate)s, which show tailor&#8208;made thermal and mechanical properties. These novel poly(imine&#8208;carbonate)s exhibit excellent recyclability under acidic and energy&#8208;efficient conditions. This allows the recovery of monomers in high yields and purity for immediate reuse, even when mixed with various commodity plastics. This work provides exciting new insights in the design of bio&#8208;based circular polymers produced by upcycling of plastic waste with minimal environmental impact.</dc:description>

         <title>Linker Redox Mediated Control of Morphology and Properties in Semiconducting Iron&#8208;Semiquinoid Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of conductive 2D and less commonly 3D coordination polymers (CPs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) promises novel applications in many fields. However, the synthetic parameters for these electronically complex materials are not thoroughly understood. Here we report a new 3D semiconducting CP Fe5(C6O6)3, which is a fusion of 2D Fe&#8208;semiquinoid materials and 3D cubic Fex(C6O6)y materials, by using a different initial redox&#8208;state of the C6O6 linker. The material displays high electrical conductivity (0.02 S cm&#8211;1), broad electronic transitions, promising thermoelectric behavior (S2&#963; = 7.0&#215;10&#8211;9 W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2), and strong antiferromagnetic interactions at room temperature. This material illustrates how controlling the oxidation states of redox&#8208;active components in conducting CPs/MOFs can be a &#8220;pre&#8208;synthetic&#8221; strategy to carefully tune material topologies and properties in contrast to more commonly encountered post&#8208;synthetic modifications.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomolecule&#8208;Based Circularly Polarized Luminescent Materials: Construction, Progress, and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral materials related to circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are a rapidly developing new field that has broad application prospects in optoelectronic devices, selective recognition, biomedicine, and other fields. Biomolecules naturally chiral, and biofunctional chiral materials attracted increasing attention because of their unique biocompatibility, chiral recognition and coding. However, there is little discussion on the biomolecule&#8208;based CPL till now. In this paper, the latest progress in CPL materials based on biomolecules is reviewed, including the chiral construction of bio&#8208;based CPL materials and their emerging applications. In addition, we put forward the main challenges and future prospects of bio&#8208;based CPL materials, hoping this work would provide new perspectives and insights for more related research.</dc:description>

         <title>Gradient Heating Epitaxial Growth    Well Lattice&#8208;Matched Mo2C&#8208;Mo2N Heterointerfaces   Boost Both Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Water Vapor Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An optimized approach to producing lattice&#8208;matched heterointerfaces for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution has not yet been reported. Herein, we present the synthesis of lattice&#8208;matched Mo2C&#8208;Mo2N heterostructures using a gradient heating epitaxial growth method.  The well lattice&#8208;matched heterointerface of Mo2C&#8208;Mo2N generating  near&#8208;zero hydrogen adsorption free energy  and facilitating water dissociation in acid and alkaline. Thus, the lattice&#8208;matched Mo2C&#8208;Mo2N heterostructures display ultralow overpotentials of 73 mV and 80 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2  in acid and alkaline solutions, respectively, comparable to the commercial Pt/C.Moreover, a novel  photothermal&#8208;electrocatalytic water vapor splitting device  adopting lattice&#8208;matched Mo2C&#8208;Mo2N heterostructure as hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst displays a competitive cell voltage in the electrocatalytic water splitting equipment. This work opens a novel pathway for designing efficient electrocatalysts with lattice&#8208;matched heterointerface.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity&#8208;Tunable Self&#8208;Immolative Design Enabling Histone Deacetylase&#8208;Targeted Imaging and Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Histone deacetylase (HDAC)&#8208;targeted probes and prodrugs are crucial for cancer theranostics. We develop a self&#8208;immolative design that enables  in vivo  activatable near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging and prodrug release in response to HDAC. This design comprises a phenyl ester linker with tunable reactivity, facilitating efficient release of caged fluorophores/drugs upon deacetylation. We engineer a new fluorophore using a spirocyclic xanthene scaffold with ring&#8208;open property, affording NIRF/PA detection with high contrast. We show that a nitro&#8208;substituted self&#8208;immolative linker allows sensitive NIRF/PA in vivo imaging of HDAC with minimal interferences. A highly efficient prodrug system is further developed for targeted therapy in HDAC&#8208;overexpressed triple negative breast tumors in mice. Our study provides a valuable paradigm for HDAC&#8208;targeted NIRF/PA imaging and prodrug release  in vivo  , highlighting its potential for bioimaging and drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporally Targeted Polypeptide Nanoantidotes&#160;Improve&#160;Chemotherapy Tolerance of Cisplatin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The toxicity of drugs causes various adverse effects in patients. While antidotes that neutralize drug toxicity help reduce systemic damage during clinical therapy, these antidotes are generally accompanied by the loss of drug efficacy. Herein, the spatiotemporally targeted polycystine&#8208;based nanoantidotes were designed as a neutralizer of cisplatin (CDDP) to decrease its toxicity without affecting its anticancer efficacy. The nanoantidotes administered before CDDP selectively accumulated in the liver and kidney and then firmly bound to CDDP through the highly stable Pt&#8211;S bond during subsequent chemotherapy. This two&#8208;step administration strategy reduced the level of Pt in normal organs, shortened the half&#8208;life of CDDP in plasma, and increased the tolerance to CDDP. More importantly, the nanoantidotes maintained the anticancer efficacy of CDDP after reducing systemic toxicity, indicating its great potential in expanding the clinical application of CDDP.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Aryldifluoromethylation of Aryl Halides with Aryldifluoromethyl Trimethylsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling of aryl halides with aryldifluoromethyl trimethylsilanes is shown to form diaryl difluoromethanes. A simple dialkyl(dimethoxyphenyl)phosphine ligand for palladium, stabilizing &#960;&#8208;interactions between palladium and the difluorobenzyl ligand during reductive elimination, and a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of the silanes enabled the reaction to form diverse products, including those possessing biological activities.







Abstract
Diaryl difluoromethanes are valuable targets for medicinal chemistry because they are bioisosteres of diaryl ethers and can function as replacements for diaryl methane, ketone, and sulfone groups. However, methods to prepare diaryl difluoromethanes are scarce, especially methods starting from abundant aryl halides. We report the Pd&#8208;catalyzed aryldifluoromethylation of aryl halides with aryldifluoromethyl trimethylsilanes (TMSCF2Ar). The reaction occurs when the catalyst contains a simple, but unusual, dialkylaryl phosphine ligand that promotes transmetallation of the silane. Computational studies show that reductive elimination following transmetallation occurs with a low barrier, despite the fluorine atoms on the &#945;&#8208;carbon, due to coordination of the difluorobenzyl &#960;&#8208;system to palladium. The co&#8208;development of a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of the silanes broadened the scope of the process including several applications to the synthesis biologically relevant diaryl difluoromethanes.

         <title>Upgrading Organic Compounds through the Coupling of Electrooxidation with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes the latest achievements and milestones in coupling the electrooxidation of organic compounds and the hydrogen evolution in a hybrid water electrolyzer. Emphasis is placed on exploiting the anode reaction and the design of the electrocatalyst. Prospects for the future development of this coupling technology and its potential implementation in practical organic synthesis and hydrogen production are also provided.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic splitting of water is recognized to be the most sustainable and clean technology for the production of hydrogen (H2). Unfortunately, the efficiency is seriously restricted by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. In contrast to the OER, the electrooxidation of organic compounds (EOO) is more thermodynamically and kinetically favorable. Thus, the coupling of the EOO and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has emerged as an alternative route, as it can greatly improve the catalytic efficiency for the production of H2. Simultaneously, value&#8208;added organic compounds can be generated on the anode through electrooxidation upgrading. In this Minireview, we highlight the latest progress and milestones in coupling the EOO with the HER. Emphasis is focused on the design of the anode catalyst, understanding the reaction mechanism, and the construction of the electrolyzer. Moreover, challenges and prospects are offered relating to the future development of this emerging technology.

         <title>A Deprotection&#8208;free Method for High&#8208;yield Synthesis of Graphdiyne Powder with In Situ Formed CuO Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deprotection&#8208;free method was developed for the synthesis of GDY powder with 100&#8201;% yield. CuO nanoparticles with an average diameter of &#8776;2.9&#8197;nm were in situ generated on GDY after the reaction. The as&#8208;prepared CuO/GDY was an excellent co&#8208;catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, comparable to the start&#8208;of&#8208;art Pt cocatalyst. This work provides a straightforward deprotection&#8208;free approach, which will definitely expand the diverse applications of GDY.







Abstract
With a direct band gap, superior charge carrier mobility, and uniformly distributed pores, graphdiyne (GDY) has stimulated tremendous interest from the scientific community. However, its broad application is greatly limited by the complicated multistep synthesis process including complex deprotection of hexakis&#8208;[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]benzene (HEB&#8208;TMS) and peeling of GDY from the substrates. Here, we describe a deprotection&#8208;free strategy to prepare GDY powder by directly using HEB&#8208;TMS as the monomer. When CuCl was used as the catalysts in DMF solvent, the yield of GDY powder reached &#8776;100&#8201;%. More interestingly, uniformly dispersed CuO nanoparticles with an average diameter of &#8776;2.9&#8197;nm were in situ formed on GDY after the reaction. The prepared CuO/GDY was demonstrated an excellent co&#8208;catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pt co&#8208;catalyst. The deprotection&#8208;free approach will widen the use of GDY and facilitate its scaling up to industrial level.

         <title>Dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]chalcogenadiazepine Photoswitches: Conversion of Excitation Energy into Ring Strain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen&#8208;bridged seven&#8208;membered cyclic azobenzenes, dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]chalcogenadiazepine (DBChD), exhibit distinct photo&#8208;switching characters with a high&#8208;energy E&#8208;configuration, especially for sulfur&#8208;bridged DBTD with an energy transduction efficiency of 21&#8201;% (&#951;) under 445&#8197;nm laser activation. Introducing oligothiophene &#960;&#8208;EDG on DBTD could further elevate the absorption &#955;max and coefficient &#1013;, reaching &#951;=29&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted, heteroaryl and cyclic azobenzenes have emerged as three key strategies on morphology design of photoswitch to diversify controllability. Cyclic azobenzene is of particular utilization in photo&#8208;energy conversion due to rigid and ring&#8208;strain structure. Despite the well&#8208;recognized diazocine, the photo&#8208;switching properties of seven&#8208;membered cyclic azobenzenes (diazepines) have yet been exploited. Herein, we report a family of dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]chalcogenadiazepines (DBChDs) and their T&#8208;type photo&#8208;switching nature with tunable relaxation rate. Based on experiments together with DFT calculations, we found that an unsymmetric 2&#8208;bithiophenyl&#8208;dibenzo[b,f][1,4,5]thiadiazepine exhibited an efficient response to 445&#8197;nm laser stimulation (quantum efficiency, &#934;Z&#8594;E=0.71) with millisecond relaxation half&#8208;life (t1/2=40&#8197;ms). Photo&#8208;energy transduction efficiency was also exceptionally high with 29.1&#8201;% converted into ring&#8208;strain energy mainly loaded on azo &#960;&#8208;bond.

         <title>Atropopeptides are a Novel Family of Ribosomally Synthesized and Posttranslationally Modified Peptides with a Complex Molecular Shape</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atropopeptides are a family of ribosomally synthesized and postranslationally modified peptides with an unusual complex molecular shape. A single cytochrome P450 is sufficient for the atropospecific introduction of one carbon&#8208;carbon and two carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds. A two&#8208;step maturation process yields hexa&#8208; and pentapeptide products that act as signaling metabolites and show proliferative and pro&#8208;migratory properties in endothelial cell cultures.







Abstract
Biomacromolecules are known to feature complex three&#8208;dimensional shapes that are essential for their function. Among natural products, ambiguous molecular shapes are a rare phenomenon. The hexapeptide tryptorubin A can adopt one of two unusual atropisomeric configurations. Initially hypothesized to be a non&#8208;ribosomal peptide, we show that tryptorubin A is the first characterized member of a new family of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) that we named atropopeptides. The sole modifying enzyme encoded in the gene cluster, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, is responsible for the atropospecific formation of one carbon&#8208;carbon and two carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds. The characterization of two additional atropopeptide biosynthetic pathways revealed a two&#8208;step maturation process. Atropopeptides promote pro&#8208;angiogenic cell functions as indicated by an increase in endothelial cell proliferation and undirected migration. Our study expands the biochemical space of RiPP&#8208;modifying enzymes and paves the way towards the chemoenzymatic utilization of atropopeptide&#8208;modifying P450s.

         <title>Synthetic Reagents for Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naturally occurring members of the thiopurine methyltransferase family have been found to accept synthetic methyl sulfates or methyl sulfonates as methyl donors for the stereoselective methylation of S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine to form S&#8208;adenosylmethionine. This activity can be used for co&#8208;substrate regeneration in methyltransferase biocatalysis.







Abstract
Late&#8208;stage methylation is a key technology in the development of pharmaceutical compounds. Methyltransferase biocatalysis may provide powerful options to insert methyl groups into complex molecules with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. The challenge of a large&#8208;scale application of methyltransferases is their dependence on S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a stoichiometric, and thus exceedingly expensive co&#8208;substrate. As a solution to this problem, we and others have explored the use of methyl halides as reagents for the in situ regeneration of SAM. However, the need to handle volatile electrophiles, such as methyl iodide (MeI), may also hamper applications at scale. As a more practical solution, we have now developed an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed process for the regeneration of SAM with methyl toluene sulfonate. Herein, we describe enzymes from the thiopurine methyltransferase family that accept sulfate&#8208; and sulfonate&#8208;based methyl donors to convert S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine into SAM with efficiencies that rival MeI&#8208;based reactions.

         <title>An Fe6C Core in All Nitrogenase Cofactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Earlier spectroscopic and structural studies have shown that the cofactors of molybdenum and vanadium nitrogenases contain a central &#956;6&#8208;carbide. Here, we used valence&#8208;to&#8208;core X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (VtC XES) to probe the presence of a carbide in the cofactor of iron nitrogenase. The presence of a K&#946;&#8242;&#8242; peak at 7100&#8197;eV reveals an interstitial carbon, showing that the cofactor of Fe nitrogenase contains an Fe6C core.







Abstract
The biological process of dinitrogen reduction to ammonium occurs at the cofactors of nitrogenases, the only enzymes that catalyze this challenging chemical reaction. Three types of nitrogenases have been described, named according to the heterometal in their cofactor: molybdenum, vanadium or iron nitrogenases. Spectroscopic and structural characterization allowed the unambiguous identification of the cofactors of molybdenum and vanadium nitrogenases and revealed a central &#956;6&#8208;carbide in both of them. Although genetic studies suggested that the cofactor of the iron nitrogenase contains a similar Fe6C core, this has not been experimentally demonstrated. Here we report Valence&#8208;to&#8208;Core X&#8208;ray Emission Spectroscopy providing experimental evidence that this cofactor contains a carbide, thereby making the Fe6C core a feature of all nitrogenase cofactors.

         <title>Rapid Access to Diverse Multicomponent Hierarchical Nanostructures from Mixed&#8208;Graft Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;graft block copolymers containing sequence&#8208;defined side chains were synthesized from three or four different types of macromonomers. The morphology of hierarchical nanostructures assembled from the prepared graft copolymers was readily diversified by varying the sequence, number, and molar ratio of the side chains.







Abstract
Multicomponent nanostructured materials assembled from molecular building blocks received wide attention due to their precisely integrated multifunctionalities. However, discovery of these materials with desirable composition and morphology was limited by their low synthetic scalability and narrow structural tuning window with given building blocks. Here, we report a scalable and diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic approach to hierarchically structured nanomaterials based on a few readily accessible building blocks. Mixed&#8208;graft block copolymers containing sequence&#8208;defined side chains were prepared through ring&#8208;opening metathesis copolymerization of three or four types of macromonomers. Intramolecularly defined interfaces promoted the formation of ordered hierarchical structures with lattice sizes tunable across multiple length scales. The same set of macromonomers were arranged and combined in different ways, providing access to diverse morphologies in the resultant structures.

         <title>Simultaneous and Spontaneous Oxidation and Reduction in Microdroplets by the Water Radical Cation/Anion Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous oxidation and reduction of phosphonate occur simultaneously in microdroplets. The key active species are the endogenous water radical cation and anion derived from water molecules and present at the droplet surface.







Abstract
Microdroplets show unique chemistry, especially in their intrinsic redox properties, and to this we here add a case of simultaneous and spontaneous oxidation and reduction. We report the concurrent conversions of several phosphonates to phosphonic acids by reduction (R&#8722;P &#8594; H&#8722;P) and to pentavalent phosphoric acids by oxidation. The experimental results suggest that the active reagent is the water radical cation/anion pair. The water radical cation is observed directly as the ionized water dimer while the water radical anion is only seen indirectly though the spontaneous reduction of carbon dioxide to formate. The coexistence of oxidative and reductive species in turn supports the proposal of a double&#8208;layer structure at the microdroplet surface, where the water radical cation and radical anion are separated and accumulated.

         <title>Conservation of Nickel Ion Single&#8208;Active Site Character in a Bottom&#8208;Up Constructed &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecular Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On&#8208;surface chemistry holds the potential for ultimate miniaturization of functional devices. Porphyrins are promising building&#8208;blocks in exploring advanced nanoarchitecture concepts. More stable molecular materials of practical interest with improved charge transfer properties can be achieved by covalently interconnecting molecular units. On&#8208;surface synthesis allows to construct extended covalent nanostructures at interfaces not conventionally available. Here, we address the synthesis and properties of covalent molecular network composed of interconnected constituents derived from halogenated nickel tetraphenylporphyrin on Au(111). We report that the &#960;&#8208;extended two&#8208;dimensional material exhibits dispersive electronic features. Concomitantly, the functional Ni cores retain the same single&#8208;active site character of their single&#8208;molecule counterparts.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On-surface chemistry holds the potential for ultimate miniaturization of functional devices. Porphyrins are promising building-blocks in exploring advanced nanoarchitecture concepts. More stable molecular materials of practical interest with improved charge transfer properties can be achieved by covalently interconnecting molecular units. On-surface synthesis allows to construct extended covalent nanostructures at interfaces not conventionally available. Here, we address the synthesis and properties of covalent molecular network composed of interconnected constituents derived from halogenated nickel tetraphenylporphyrin on Au(111). We report that the &#960;-extended two-dimensional material exhibits dispersive electronic features. Concomitantly, the functional Ni cores retain the same single-active site character of their single-molecule counterparts. This opens new pathways when exploiting the high robustness of transition metal cores provided by bottom-up constructed covalent nanomeshes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Growth Mechanism of a Conductive MOF Thin Film in Spray&#8208;based Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Liquid Phase Epitaxy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer liquid&#8208;phase epitaxy (LBL&#8208;LPE) method is widely used in preparing metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) thin films with merits of controlling thickness and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation for superior performances in applications. The LBL&#8208;LPE growth mechanism related to the grain boundary, structure defect, and orientation is critical but very challenging to study. In this work, a novel &#8220;in&#8208;plane self&#8208;limiting and self&#8208;repairing&#8221; thin&#8208;film growth mechanism is demonstrated by the combination study of the grain boundary, structure defect, and orientation of Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;xC thin film via microscopic analysis techniques and electrical measurements. This mechanism results a desired high&#8208;quality MOF thin film with preferred in&#8208;plane orientation at its bottom for the first time, and is very helpful for optimizing the LBL&#8208;LPE method, understanding the growth cycle&#8208;dependent properties of MOF thin film, and inspiring the investigations of the biomimetic self&#8208;repairing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Product Faradaic Efficiency for Electrocatalytic of CO2 to CO at Current Density Larger than 1.2 A cm&#8722;2 in Neutral Aqueous Solution by a Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electroreduction of CO  2  to CO is a promising approach for the cycling use of CO  2  , while it still suffers from impractical current density and durability. Here we report a single&#8208;atom nanozyme (  Ni&#8722;N  5  &#8722;C  ) that achieves industrial&#8208;scale performance for CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) exceeded 97% over &#8722;0.8 ~ &#8722;2.4 V  vs.  RHE. The current density at &#8722;2.4 V  vs.  RHE reached a maximum of 1.23 A cm  &#8722;2  (turnover frequency of 69.7 s  &#8722;1  ) with an FE of 99.6%. No obvious degradation was observed over 100 hours of continuous operation. Compared with the planar Ni&#8722;N  4  site, the square&#8208;pyramidal Ni&#8722;N  5  site has   an increase and a decrease in the d  z  2 and d  xz/yz  orbital energy levels, respectively, as revealed by density functional theory calculations. Thus, the Ni&#8722;N  5  catalytic site is more superior to activate CO  2  molecule and reduce the energy barriers as well as promote the CO desorption, thus boosting the kinetic activation process and catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Face&#8208;to&#8208;face noncovalent arene&#8211;fullerene interactions are important in several research fields such as synthetic chemistry, materials chemistry, and medicinal chemistry; however, their nature and strength are still poorly understood. In this study, we prepare a fullerene&#8208;based torsion balance containing thioanisole, phenol, naphthalene, azulene, and pyrene moieties as a unimolecular model system. Moreover, we compare the folding free energies between the folded and the unfolded conformers of a series of the molecular torsion balances to quantify noncovalent interactions between arenes and the fullerene surface. This work demonstrates that the contributions of polarizabilities, anionic charges, electronic dipole moments, and the number of arene rings to the interactions can be experimentally measured by analyzing the folding equilibrium of the molecular torsion balances.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Enantiodivergence in Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylation with &#946;&#8208;Alkenyl Allylic Boronates</title>

Abstract
We report herein a rare example of enantiodivergent aldehyde addition with &#946;&#8208;alkenyl allylic boronates via chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. 2,6&#8208;Di&#8208;9&#8208;anthracenyl&#8208;substituted chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylation using &#946;&#8208;vinyl substituted allylic boronate gave alcohols with R absolute configuration. The sense of asymmetric induction of the catalyst in these reactions is opposite to those in prior reports. Moreover, in the presence of the same acid catalyst, the reactions with &#946;&#8208;2&#8208;propenyl substituted allylic boronate generated homoallylic alcohol products with S absolute configuration. Unusual substrate&#8208;catalyst C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the favoured reaction transition state were identified as the origins of observed enantiodivergence through DFT computational studies.

&lt;p&gt;We report herein a rare example of enantiodivergent aldehyde addition with &#946;-alkenyl allylic boronates via chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. 2,6-Di-9-anthracenyl-substituted chiral phosphoric acid-catalyzed asymmetric allylation using &#946;-vinyl substituted allylic boronate gave alcohols with &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; absolute configuration. The sense of asymmetric induction of the catalyst in these reactions is opposite to those in prior reports. Moreover, in the presence of the same acid catalyst, the reactions with &#946;-2-propenyl substituted allylic boronate generated homoallylic alcohol products with &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; absolute configuration. Unusual substrate-catalyst C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the favoured reaction transition state were identified as the origins of observed enantiodivergence through DFT computational studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Crystal Packing by Terminal tert&#8208;Butylation for Enhanced Solid&#8208;State Emission and Efficacious Charge Transport in an Anthracene&#8208;Based Molecular Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anthracene&#8208;based molecular crystal with a unique &#8220;slipped herringbone&#8221; packing motif has been developed by delicate crystal engineering through terminal tert&#8208;butylation. Appropriate exciton&#8208;exciton coupling/electron&#8208;phonon coupling originating from the unique crystal packing induces a remarkably strong solid&#8208;state emission (photoluminescence quantum efficiency, &#934;F=74.9&#8201;%) and efficacious charge transport (carrier mobility, &#956;=5.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1).







Abstract
Organic semiconductors with combinative high carrier mobility and efficient solid&#8208;state emission are full of challenges but urgently pursued for developing new emerging optoelectronics. Herein, by delicately regulating the crystal packing of an anthracene&#8208;based molecular crystal via terminal tert&#8208;butylation, we developed a superior high mobility emissive molecule, 2,6&#8208;di(6&#8208;tert&#8208;butylnaphthyl)anthracene (TBU&#8208;DNA). The unique &#8220;slipped herringbone&#8221; packing motif of TBU&#8208;DNA enables its appropriate exciton&#8208;exciton coupling and electron&#8208;phonon coupling, thus resulting in remarkably high solid&#8208;state emission (photoluminescence quantum yield, &#934;F&#8776;74.9&#8201;%) and efficacious charge transport (carrier mobility, &#956;=5.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Furthermore, OLETs based on TBU&#8208;DNA show an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.8&#8201;%, which is among the highest EQE values for single component OLETs reported till now. This work presents a crystal engineering strategy via exquisite molecular design to realize high mobility emissive organic semiconductors.

         <title>Stereoselective Access to Tetra&#8208; and Tri&#8208;Substituted Fluoro&#8208; and Chloro&#8208;Borylalkenes via Boron&#8208;Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We generated bench&#8208;top stable fluoro&#8208; and chloro&#8208;diborylmethanes and their application to the synthesis of tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes via the Boron&#8211;Wittig reaction is reported. To demonstrate their synthetic utility, the obtained (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes were transformed to fluoroalkene derivatives and all&#8208;carbon substituted alkenes.







Abstract
Reported herein is the efficient synthesis of tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes by the Boron&#8211;Wittig reaction of ketones and aldehydes with bench&#8208;top stable halo&#8208;diborylmethanes. The substrate scope is broad and the Boron&#8211;Wittig reaction proceeds from a diverse range of ketones and aldehydes including biologically relevant molecules with fluoro&#8208; or chloro&#8208;diborylmethanes, providing tetra&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes in good yields with high stereoselectivity. The utilities of the obtained (Z)&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;chloro&#8208;borylalkenes are highlighted by further modifications to afford fluoroalkene derivatives or all&#8208;carbon substituted alkene.

         <title>High&#8208;Power Near&#8208;Neutral Aqueous All Organic Redox Flow Battery Enabled with a Pair of Anionic Redox Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance aqueous organic redox flow battery (AORFB) operating upon a pair of judiciously designed anionic viologen and TEMPO derivatives, endows the near&#8208;neutral electrolyte systems with compatibility to the cation&#8208;exchange membrane (CEM), high cell voltage, excellent cycling stability and record&#8208;high power density.







Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are regarded as a promising alternative for low&#8208;cost and durable grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the narrow potential gap, chemical lability and membrane fouling in most AORFBs constitute formidable roadblocks for practical applications. Herein, a pair of anionic organic molecules, namely (PPBPy)Br2 and PSS&#8208;TEMPO, are proposed. The (PPBPy)Br2 in anolyte reveals remarkable electrochemical stability without degradation after 1000&#8197;cycles, while PSS&#8208;TEMPO in catholyte presents a capacity decay rate as low as 0.012&#8201;%/cycle. At near&#8208;neutral conditions, the (PPBPy)Br2/PSS&#8208;TEMPO flow cell exhibits a high voltage of 1.61&#8197;V, extremely low permeability across cation&#8208;exchange membrane and thus excellent cycling stability. Notably, a highest peak power density of 509&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 has been achieved among reported all&#8208;organic aqueous RFBs. The molecular engineering strategies demonstrated here could provide a credible example of high&#8208;performance AORFBs.

         <title>Asymmetric Oxidative Lactonization of Enynyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein the first oxidation of enynyl boronates for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactones, including spiro&#8208;, and fused&#8208;butanolides as well as butenolides that are prevalent in nature products and bioactive molecules. The asymmetric version of this oxidation was also achieved in the presence of chiral ketone and Oxone. This process successively involves the oxidation of C(sp)&#8722;B bond, the epoxidation of C&#8722;C double bond, and the lactonization.







Abstract
Oxidation of C&#8722;B bonds is extensively used in organic synthesis, materials science, and chemically biology. However, these oxidations are usually limited to the oxidation of C(sp3)&#8722;B and C(sp2)&#8722;B bonds. The C(sp)&#8722;B bond oxidation is rarely developed. Herein we present a novel strategy for the preparation of &#947;&#8208;lactones via the oxidation of enynyl boronates. This process successively involves the C(sp)&#8722;B bond oxidation, the epoxidation of C&#8722;C double bond and the lactonization. This protocol provided various &#947;&#8208;lactones and unsaturated butenolides efficiently that are prevalent in numerous nature products and bioactive molecules. Most importantly, asymmetric oxidative lactonization of enynyl boronates was also achieved, providing chiral &#947;&#8208;lactones in high enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities. The versatile transformations and ubiquity of &#947;&#8208;lactones shed light on the importance of this strategy in the construction and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.

         <title>Unravelling the Reactivity of Framework Lewis Acid Sites towards Methanol Activation on H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite with Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structures of framework&#8208;associated tri&#8208;coordinated Al Lewis acid sites that are bonding with hydroxyl groups are determined on H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites by using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy coupled with theoretical calculations. The high reactivity of these framework&#8208;associated Al sites leads to the preferable formation of methoxy species in methanol reaction at lower temperature, which contribute to the formation of hydrocarbons at high temperature as active C1 species.







Abstract
Understanding the acid sites on zeolites is vital for the establishment of catalyst structure&#8211;activity relationship and exploration of their potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we report the identification of active framework Lewis acid sites on ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites. The structures of framework&#8208;associated tri&#8208;coordinated Al that is bonding with hydroxyl groups are determined by using one&#8208; dimensional (1D) 31P and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) 31P&#8208;{27Al} NMR spectroscopy of trimethylphosphine oxide probe molecule. 2D 13C&#8208;{27Al} NMR correlation experiments allow the observation of favorable formation of methoxy species on the framework&#8208;associated Al Lewis acid sites in methanol reaction at low temperature, which is corroborated by density functional theory calculations. These methoxy species contribute to the further conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons as active C1 species. The results provide new insights into the Lewis acidity of zeolites.

         <title>A Long&#8208;Circulating Vector for Aptamers Based upon Polyphosphodiester&#8208;Backboned Molecular Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottlebrush polymer&#8208;aptamer biohybrid, termed PSP pacDNA, is prepared using solid&#8208;phase and graft&#8208;onto methodologies. Consisting of a polyphosphodiester backbone and poly(ethylene glycol) side chains, the PSP pacDNA suppresses non&#8208;specific interactions with the cell and improves the plasma pharmacokinetics of the aptamer. Combined with a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer, the PSP pacDNA produces a pronounced anticoagulation effect in vivo.







Abstract
Aptamers face challenges for use outside the ideal conditions in which they are developed. These difficulties are most palpable in vivo due to nuclease activities, rapid clearance, and off&#8208;target binding. Herein, we demonstrate that a polyphosphodiester&#8208;backboned molecular brush can suppress enzymatic digestion, reduce non&#8208;specific cell uptake, enable long blood circulation, and rescue the bioactivity of a conjugated aptamer in vivo. The backbone along with the aptamer is assembled via solid&#8208;phase synthesis, followed by installation of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) side chains using a two&#8208;step process with near&#8208;quantitative efficiency. The synthesis allows for precise control over polymer size and architecture. Consisting entirely of building blocks that are generally recognized as safe for therapeutics, this novel molecular brush is expected to provide a highly translatable route for aptamer&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>A 3D Peptide/[60]Fullerene Hybrid for Multivalent Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent ligand presentation is a powerful strategy for the development of specific binders and inhibitors. Peptide/[60]fullerene hybrids have now been synthesized that exploit the complete substitution of the fullerene scaffold to afford globular structures presenting twelve copies of a peptide ligand for the recognition of E&#8208;selectin.







Abstract
Fully substituted peptide/[60]fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts offer an excellent opportunity for multivalent protein recognition. In contrast to monofunctionalized fullerene hybrids, peptide/[60]fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts display multiple copies of a peptide in close spatial proximity and in the three dimensions of space. High affinity peptide binders for almost any target can be currently identified by in vitro evolution techniques, often providing synthetically simpler alternatives to natural ligands. However, despite the potential of peptide/[60]fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts, these promising conjugates have not been reported to date. Here we present a synthetic strategy for the construction of 3D multivalent hybrids that are able to bind with high affinity the E&#8208;selectin. The here synthesized fully substituted peptide/[60]fullerene hybrids and their multivalent recognition of natural receptors constitute a proof of principle for their future application as functional biocompatible materials.

         <title>Near Infrared Light Induced Radical Polymerization in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near infrared irradiation can be sufficient to initiate radical polymerization when absorbed by gold nanorods, exploiting the photothermal effect to transfer energy to a thermal initiator molecule. A water&#8208;soluble monomer is readily polymerized in aqueous environments affording water&#8208;soluble polymers with tuneable molecular weights, including by irradiation through biological tissue.







Abstract
We introduce a gold nanorod (AuNR) driven methodology to induce free radical polymerization in water with near infrared light (800&#8197;nm). The process exploits photothermal conversion in AuNR and subsequent heat transfer to a radical initiator (here azobisisobutyronitrile) for primary radical generation. A broad range of reaction conditions were investigated, demonstrating control over molecular weight and reaction conversion of dimethylacrylamide polymers, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We underpin our experimental data with finite element simulation of the spatio&#8208;temporal temperature profile surrounding the AuNR directly after femtosecond laser pulse excitation. Critically, we evidence that polymerization can be induced through biological tissues given the enhanced penetration depth of the near infrared light. We submit that the presented initiation mechanism in aqueous systems holds promise for radical polymerization in biological environments, including cells.

         <title>Closed Aromatic Tubes&#8212;Capsularenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arenes can now be incorporated into closed tubes&#8212;capsularenes. These rigid, electron deficient, thermally stable, and tubular molecules with three arenes or acenes at a close distance can lend themselves to the construction of organic electronic devices.







Abstract
In this study, we describe a synthetic method for incorporating arenes into closed tubes that we name capsularenes. First, we prepared vase&#8208;shaped molecular baskets 4&#8211;7. The baskets comprise a benzene base fused to three bicycle[2.2.1]heptane rings that extend into phthalimide (4), naphthalimide (6), and anthraceneimide sides (7), each carrying a dimethoxyethane acetal group. In the presence of catalytic trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), the acetals at top of 4, 6 and 7 change into aliphatic aldehydes followed by their intramolecular cyclization into 1,3,5&#8208;trioxane (1H NMR spectroscopy). Such ring closure is nearly a quantitative process that furnishes differently sized capsularenes 1 (0.7&#215;0.9&#8197;nm), 8 (0.7&#215;1.1&#8197;nm;) and 9 (0.7&#215;1.4&#8197;nm;) characterized by X&#8208;Ray crystallography, microcrystal electron diffraction, UV/Vis, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, and thermogravimetry. With exceptional rigidity, unique topology, great thermal stability, and perhaps tuneable optoelectronic characteristics, capsularenes hold promise for the construction of novel organic electronic devices.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Lanthanide Molecular Probes for Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence and Mass Spectrometry Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we developed clickable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) lanthanide (Ln) complexes for bioorthogonal labeling. In combination with metabolic labeling, these NIR Ln (Ln=Yb, Er) complexes enabled NIR fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of proteins, glycans, and nucleic acids in cells. Furthermore, they were applied for multicolor imaging and NIR click&#8208;expansion microscopy (click&#8208;ExM). By combining these Ln probes with time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), we achieved the first dual&#8208;modal NIRF&#8208;SIMS imaging.







Abstract
We report here the development of clickable and highly near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent lanthanide (Ln) complexes for bioorthogonal labeling of biomolecules. These azide&#8208; or alkyne&#8208;functionalized Ln complexes are hydrophilic and fluorogenic, exhibiting a strong increase of NIR fluorescence upon conjugation with biomolecules. Metabolic labeling of biomolecules with azide or alkyne, followed by click labeling with the Ln complexes, enables NIR fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans in cells. Furthermore, multicolor imaging is performed by combining click&#8208;labeling with the Ln complexes and immunostaining. In addition, the Ln complexes is compatible with click&#8208;expansion microscopy (click&#8208;ExM), which enables high&#8208;resolution NIRF imaging of cellular glycoproteins. Finally, the Ln complexes can be used for time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) imaging, thus achieving the first example of dual&#8208;modal imaging combining NIRF and SIMS microscopies.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Structure&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Hyperbranched Polymers by a &#8220;Latent&#8221; Inimer Strategy Based on Diels&#8211;Alder Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
A &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy for the structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of hyperbranched polymers based on a &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer, containing both a furan&#8208;protected maleimide (FMI) monomer and a haloalkane initiator, is presented. Due to the dynamic nature of the r&#8208;DA reaction of FMI, the release of maleimide (MI) and the subsequent copolymerization of MI can be regulated by tuning the temperature and stereochemistry during its SCVCP.







Abstract
An efficient &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; strategy for the structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on a &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer (LI&#8208;Br), containing a furan&#8208;protected maleimide monomer and a haloalkane initiator, is presented. At high temperatures, the &#8220;latent&#8221; inimer is converted to a &#8220;real&#8221; inimer after releasing maleimide (MI) via a retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (r&#8208;DA) reaction and then copolymerized with methyl methacrylate by self&#8208;condensing vinyl copolymerization. Due to the dynamic characteristic of the r&#8208;DA reaction, the release of naked MI and the subsequent copolymerization can be regulated by the temperature or stereochemistry of Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) adducts. Thus, the &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of HBPs with various degrees of branching was achieved. By further implementation of a programmable temperature change, some valuable hyperbranched topologies such as star&#8208;shaped and long&#8208;chain hyperbranched polymers can be constructed avoiding sophisticated synthetic routes.

         <title>Selenoviologen&#8208;Appendant Metallacycles with Highly Stable Radical Cations and Long&#8208;Lived Charge Separation States for Electrochromism and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenoviologens&#8208;appendant metallacycles M1 (rhomboid) and M2 (hexagonal) were synthesized and utilized in electrochromism and photocatalysis, as reported in the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202209054) by Gang He et&#8197;al. The highly stable radical cations and long&#8208;lived charge separation states of the selenoviologens (SeV2+) originate from the metallacyclic effect. Their properties were validated by femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA), demonstrating the vital role of the metallacycle in organic photocatalytic reactions.

A self&#8208;assembled glucose oxidase (GOx) nanoparticle that falls into the sea and dissociates into several enzymes is depicted in the picture illustrating the Research Article by Peng Huang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202208583). After dissociation, GOx regains its catalytic activity and catalyzes the oxidization of glucose into gluconic acid and H2O2. It's like someone pressing the&#160;&#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2&#8242;&#8242;&#160;switch that crosses the sea surface.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Bonding of a Xe(IV) Transition&#8208;Metal Coordination Complex, F3XeFb&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;WOF4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coordination complex, F3XeFb&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;WOF4, was synthesized in CFCl3  solvent by reaction of the weak fluoride&#8208;ion donor and strong oxidative fluorinating agent, XeF4, with the moderate&#8208;strength fluoride&#8208;ion acceptor, WOF4. The compound is the only transition&#8208;metal coordination complex of Xe(IV) and was characterized at low temperatures by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Xenon tetrafluoride and WOF4  coordinate trans to the W=O bond through a W&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Fb  bond. The XeF3  moiety of F3XeFb&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;WOF4  acquires a degree of [XeF3]+  character upon coordination that is reflected by its stretching frequencies which are intermediate with respect to those of XeF4  and [XeF3]+. Calculations show W&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Fb  is predominantly an electrostatic, &#963;&#8208;hole bond with a significant orbital contribution that accounts for the bent Xe&#8211;Fb&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;W angle. The calculations show F3XeFb&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;MOF4  (M = Cr, Mo) are less stable than their W analogue, consistent with failed attempts to synthesize F3XeFb&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;MoOF4.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustaining Fluorination of Active Methylene Compounds and
Fluorination of Aryl and Alkenyl Lithium Species with a Sterically
Hindered N&#8208;Fluorosulfonamide Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorination of carbanions is pivotal for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds, but the current N&#8208;F fluorinating agents have significant drawbacks due to many reactive locations that surround the reactive N&#8208;F site. By developing a sterically hindered N&#8208;fluorosulfonamide reagent, namely N&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfonamide (NFBB), we discovered a conceptually novel base&#8208;catalyzed, self&#8208;sustaining fluorination of active methylene compounds and achieved the high&#8208;yielding fluorination of the hitherto difficult highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species. In the former, the mild and high yield fluorination of active methylene compounds exhibited wide functional group tolerance and its novel catalytic fluorination&#8208;deprotonation cycle mechanism was demonstrated by deuterium&#8208;tracing experiments. In the latter, NFBB reacted with a variety of highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species to provide the desired fluoro (hetero)arenes and alkenes in unprecedented high or quantitative yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Cyclopolymerization of 5&#8208;Ethynyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;Nonadiyne Derivatives to Synthesize Low Band Gap Conjugated Polyacetylenes Containing Fused Bicyclic Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopolymerization is a powerful method for synthesizing polyacetylenes containing four&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered rings. However, the structure of the repeat unit only consists of mono&#8208;cycloalkene due to the single cyclization of diyne monomers. Herein, we demonstrate a novel cascade cyclopolymerization to synthesize polyacetylenes containing fused bicyclic rings from triyne monomers containing bulky dendrons via sequential cascade ring&#8208;closing metathesis. These dendrons provided solubility and stability to the rigid bicyclic polyacetylene backbone. In addition, we controlled the regioselectivity of the catalyst approach by altering its structure and synthesized polymers containing fused bicyclo[4,3,0] or [4,4,0] rings with high molecular weights of up to 120 kg/mol. Interestingly, the resulting polymers showed narrower band gaps (down to 1.6 eV) than polymers with mono&#8208;cycloalkene repeat units due to the planarization of the conjugated segment resulting from the fused bicyclic structure.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface passivation technology provides noble&#8208;metal materials with limited chemical stability, especially under highly acidic condition. To design effective strategy to enhance stabilility of noble&#8208;metal particles, an understanding of their surface anticorrosion mechanism at the atomic level is desirable by using two&#8208;dimensional (2D) noble&#8208;metal coordination polymer (CP) as an ideal model for their interfacial region. With the protection of 2&#8208;thiobenzimidazole (TBI), we isolated two Ag&#8208;based 2D CPs, {Ag14(TBI)12X2}n (S&#8208;X, where S denotes sheet and X = Cl or Br). These compounds exhibited excellent chemical stability upon immersion in various common solvents, boiling water, boiling ethanol, 10% hydrogen peroxide, concentrated acid (12 M HCl), and concentrated alkali (19 M NaOH). Systematic characterization and DFT analyses demonstrate that the superior stability of S&#8208;X was attributed to the hydrophobic organic shell and dynamic proton buffer layer acting as a double protective&#8220;shield&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reactions of Sulfonamides with (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides/Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  N  &#8208;(hetero)aryl sulfonamide unit is one of the privileged skeletons for drug development. Direct  N  &#8208;arylation of sulfonamides is a very attractive approach for preparing  N  &#8208;(hetero)&#8208; aryl sulfonamides because it avoids the potential genotoxic problem resulted from the previous condensation method. Although a number of catalytic systems have been developed, most known methods suffer from limited reaction scope and inconveniency on metal catalyst and ligand availability. Here we described that the combination of copper and oxalamides (or 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamides) offers a powerful catalytic system for coupling of sulfonamides with both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor (hetero)aryl halides. A wide range of primary and secondary sulfonamides were able to couple with a series of (hetero)aryl bromides in the presence of 2&#8208;5 mol% copper salts and oxalamides at 100  o  C. Coupling of primary sulfonamides with (hetero)aryl chlorides worked well under the action of 10 mol% Cu  2  O and a 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamide to afford  N  &#8208;aryl sulfonamides in excellent diversity. The catalytic method enabled direct sulfonamidation of four chloro&#8208;containing marketed drugs and preparation of two sulfonamide drugs from the corresponding aryl halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying the Solution Structure of Metal Nanoclusters Using Small&#8208;Angle Neutron Scattering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal nanoclusters are a unique class of synthetic material, as their crystal structures can be resolved using X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their chemical formula precisely calculated from mass spectroscopy. However, the complete structure determination by these two techniques is often a challenging task. Here, we utilize small angle neutron scattering (SANS) to directly quantify the key structure parameters of a series of silver and gold nanoclusters in solution, which correlates well to their crystallographic structures. Besides, SANS also allows the quantification of the counterions layer surrounding charged nanoclusters in solution. Furthermore, when combining with X&#8208;ray scattering, it is possible to estimate the molecular weight of both the metal core and the ligand shell of nanoclusters. This work offers an alternative characterization tool for nanoclusters without the requirement of crystallization or gas phase ionization.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Controlling phase separation and transition plays a core role in establishing and maintaining the function of diverse self&#8208;assembled systems. However, it remains challenging to achieve wide&#8208;range continuous phase transition for dynamically producing a variety of assembled structures. Here, we developed a far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium system, upon the integration of photoexcitation&#8208;induced aggregation molecules and block copolymers, to establish an  in&#8208;situ  phase&#8208;volume ratio photocontrol strategy. Thus, full&#8208;scale phase&#8208;diagram structures, from lamellar structure to gyroidal, cylindrical, and finally to a spherical one, can be accessed under different irradiation periods. Moreover, the phase transition was accompanied by considerable aggregation&#8208;induced phosphorescence and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity change for building a functional surface. This strategy allows for a conceptual advance of accessing a wide range of distinct self&#8208;assembled structures and functions in real time.</dc:description>

         <title>Challenges and Prospects in Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a crucial C1 building block for daily&#8208;life commodities in a wide range of industrial processes. Industrial production of HCHO today is based on energy&#8208; and cost&#8208;intensive gas&#8208;phase catalytic oxidation of methanol, which calls for exploring other and more sustainable ways of carrying out this process. Utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) as precursor presents a promising strategy to simultaneously mitigate the carbon footprint and alleviate environmental issues. This minireview summarizes recent progress in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCHO conversion using hydrogenation, hydroboration/hydrosilylation as well as photochemical, electrochemical, photoelectrotrochemical, and enzymatic approaches. The active species, reaction intermediates, and mechanistic pathways are discussed to deepen the understanding of HCHO selectivity issues. Finally, shortcomings and prospects of the various strategies for sustainable reduction of CO2 to HCHO are discussed.</dc:description>

This minireview summarizes recent progress in CO2-to-HCHO conversion using hydrogenation, hydroboration/hydrosilylation as well as photochemical, electrochemical, photoelectrotrochemical, and enzymatic approaches. The active species, reaction intermediates, and mechanistic pathways are discussed to deepen the understanding of HCHO selectivity issues. Finally, shortcomings and prospects of the various strategies for sustainable reduction of CO2 to HCHO are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase Transitions in Chemically Fueled, Multiphase Complex Coacervate Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membraneless organelles are droplets in the cytosol that are regulated by chemical reactions. Increasing studies suggest that they are internally organized. However, how these subcompartments are regulated remains elusive. Herein, we describe a complex coacervate&#8208;based model composed of two polyanions and a short peptide. With a chemical reaction cycle, we control the affinity of the peptide for the polyelectrolytes leading to distinct regimes inside the phase diagram. We study the transitions from one regime to another and identify new transitions that can only occur under kinetic control. Finally, we show that the chemical reaction cycle controls the liquidity of the droplets offering insights into how active processes inside cells play an important role in tuning the liquid state of membraneless organelles. Our work demonstrates that not only thermodynamic properties but also kinetics should be considered in the organization of multiple phases in droplets.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tailored Functionalities for Modulating Surface Potentials in Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing materials with high triboelectric is an efficient way of improving output performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Herein, we synthesized a series of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with similar skeletons but various functional groups ranging between electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing. These COFs form an ideal platform for clarifying the contribution of each group to TENG performance because the pore wall is perturbed in a predesigned manner. Kelvin probe force microscopy and computational data suggest that surface potentials and electron affinities of COFs can be improved by introducing electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing groups, with the highest values observed for fluorinated COF. The TENG with fluorinated COF delivered an output voltage and current of 420 V and 64 &#181;A, respectively, which are comparable to other reported materials. This strategy can be used to efficiently screen suitable frameworks as TENG materials with excellent output performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Radical SAM Enzymes Are Necessary and Sufficient for the In Vitro Production of the Oxetane Nucleoside Antiviral Agent Albucidin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxetanocin A and albucidin are two oxetane natural products. While the biosynthesis of oxetanocin A has been described, less is known about albucidin. In this work, the albucidin biosynthetic gene cluster is identified in  Streptomyces  . Heterologous expression in a nonproducing strain demonstrates that the genes  alsA  and  alsB  are necessary and sufficient for albucidin biosynthesis confirming a previous study ( Myronovskyi  et al  .  Microorganisms  2020  ,  8  , 237 ). A two&#8208;step construction of albucidin 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphate from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine monophosphate (2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP) is shown to be catalyzed  in vitro  by the cobalamin dependent radical  S  &#8208;adenosyl&#8208; l &#8208;methionine (SAM) enzyme AlsB, which catalyzes a ring contraction, and the radical SAM enzyme AlsA, which catalyzes elimination of a one&#8208;carbon fragment. Isotope labelling studies show that AlsB catalysis begins with stereospecific H&#8208;atom transfer of the C2&#8242;&#8208;  pro&#8208;R  hydrogen from 2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP to 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine, and that the eliminated one&#8208;carbon fragment originates from C3&#8242; of 2&#8242;&#8208;dAMP.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Anisotropic Facet of Lead Chromate Photocatalysts to Promote Spatial Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes correlates closely with the anisotropic facets of PbCrO4 crystals. Charge&#8208;separation efficiencies exhibit a quasilinear relationship with the surface photovoltage difference between anisotropic facets. An apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 6.5&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm for photocatalytic water oxidation was achieved after optimizing the anisotropic facets of the PbCrO4 crystals.







Abstract
A crucial issue in artificial photosynthesis is how to modulate the behaviors of photogenerated charges of semiconductor photocatalysts. Here, using lead chromate (PbCrO4) as an example, we conducted the morphology tailoring from parallelepiped (p&#8208;PbCrO4) to truncated decahedron (t&#8208;PbCrO4) and elongated rhombic (r&#8208;PbCrO4), resulting in exposed anisotropic facets. The spatial separation of photogenerated charges closely correlates to the anisotropic facets of crystals, which can only be realized for t&#8208;PbCrO4 and r&#8208;PbCrO4. The charge&#8208;separation efficiencies exhibit a quasilinear relation with the surface photovoltage difference between anisotropic facets. The r&#8208;PbCrO4 gives an apparent quantum efficiency of 6.5&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm for photocatalytic water oxidation using Fe3+ ions as electron acceptors. Moreover, the oxidation reverse reaction from Fe2+ to Fe3+ ions was completely blocked with &#8764;100&#8201;% of Fe3+ conversion achieved on the anisotropic PbCrO4 crystals.

&lt;p&gt;A crucial issue in artificial photosynthesis is how to modulate the behaviors of photogenerated charges of semiconductor photocatalysts. Here, using lead chromate (PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) as an example, we conducted the morphology tailoring from parallelepiped (p-PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to truncated decahedron (t-PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and elongated rhombic (r-PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), resulting in exposed anisotropic facets. The spatial separation of photogenerated charges closely correlates to the anisotropic facets of crystals, which can only be realized for t-PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and r-PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The charge-separation efficiencies exhibit a quasilinear relation with the surface photovoltage difference between anisotropic facets. The r-PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; gives an apparent quantum efficiency of 6.5&#8201;% at 500&#8197;nm for photocatalytic water oxidation using Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions as electron acceptors.

         <title>A Plurizyme with Transaminase and Hydrolase Activity Catalyzes Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PluriZyme with transaminase and esterase activities was constructed by combining computational and laboratory design methods. The enzyme can perform cascade reactions in a single protein scaffold. Experimental evidence is presented for the catalytic efficiency of both the native transaminase and the artificial esterase active site and their synergistic action to transform &#946;&#8208;keto esters into enantiopure &#946;&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract
Engineering dual&#8208;function single polypeptide catalysts with two abiotic or biotic catalytic entities (or combinations of both) supporting cascade reactions is becoming an important area of enzyme engineering and catalysis. Herein we present the development of a PluriZyme, TR2E2, with efficient native transaminase (kcat: 69.49&#177;1.77&#8197;min&#8722;1) and artificial esterase (kcat: 3908&#8211;0.41&#8197;min&#8722;1) activities integrated into a single scaffold, and evaluate its utility in a cascade reaction. TR2E2 (pHopt: 8.0&#8211;9.5; Topt: 60&#8211;65&#8201;&#176;C) efficiently converts methyl 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;(2,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl)butanoate into 3&#8208;(R)&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;(2,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl)butanoic acid, a crucial intermediate for the synthesis of antidiabetic drugs. The reaction proceeds through the conversion of the &#946;&#8208;keto ester into the &#946;&#8208;keto acid at the hydrolytic site and subsequently into the &#946;&#8208;amino acid (e.e. &gt;99&#8201;%) at the transaminase site. The catalytic power of the TR2E2 PluriZyme was proven with a set of &#946;&#8208;keto esters, demonstrating the potential of such designs to address bioinspired cascade reactions.

         <title>A Specialized Polythioamide&#8208;Binding Protein Confers Antibiotic Self&#8208;Resistance in Anaerobic Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A central contributor to the self&#8208;resistance of an anaerobic antibiotic producer is identified. CtaZ, a new member of the GyrI&#8208;like superfamily, confines the gyrase inhibitor closthioamide in a ligand&#8208;optimized pocket. Genome mining uncovered CtaZ homologs encoded in the genomes of diverse bacteria, including numerous pathogens.







Abstract
Understanding antibiotic resistance mechanisms is central to the development of anti&#8208;infective therapies and genomics&#8208;based drug discovery. Yet, many knowledge gaps remain regarding the resistance strategies employed against novel types of antibiotics from less&#8208;explored producers such as anaerobic bacteria, among them the Clostridia. Through the use of genome editing and functional assays, we found that CtaZ confers self&#8208;resistance against the copper chelator and gyrase inhibitor closthioamide (CTA) in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum. Bioinformatics, biochemical analyses, and X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed CtaZ as a founding member of a new group of GyrI&#8208;like proteins. CtaZ is unique in binding a polythioamide scaffold in a ligand&#8208;optimized hydrophobic pocket, thereby confining CTA. By genome mining using CtaZ as a handle, we discovered previously overlooked homologs encoded by diverse members of the phylum Firmicutes, including many pathogens. In addition to characterizing both a new role for a GyrI&#8208;like domain in self&#8208;resistance and unprecedented thioamide binding, this work aids in uncovering related drug&#8208;resistance mechanisms.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization of Carboranes at the Electron&#8208;Rich Boron Vertex: Photocatalytic B&#8722;C Coupling via a Carboranyl Cage Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photocatalytic strategy for the site&#8208;selective functionalization of carboranes was demonstrated by the photo&#8208;induced decarboxylation of carborane carboxylic acids to generate boron&#8208;vertex&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals. This strategy enables facile construction of highly efficient blue emitters and drug candidates for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).







Abstract
Functionalization of carboranes in a vertex&#8208;specific manner is a perennial challenge. Here, we report a photocatalytic B&#8722;C coupling for the selective functionalization of carboranes at the boron site which is most distal to carbon. This reaction was achieved by the photo&#8208;induced decarboxylation of carborane carboxylic acids to generate boron vertex&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals. Theoretical calculations also demonstrate that the reaction more easily occurs at the boron site bearing higher electron density owing to the lower energy barrier for a single&#8208;electron transfer to generate a carboranyl radical. By using this strategy, a number of functionalized carboranes could be accessed through alkylation, alkenylation, and heteroarylation under mild conditions. Moreover, both a highly efficient blue emitter with a solid&#8208;state luminous efficiency of 42&#8201;% and a drug candidate for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) containing targeting and fluorine units were obtained.

         <title>Identification and Structure Analysis of an Unusual Halohydrin Dehalogenase for Highly Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Bio&#8208;Nitration of Epoxides</title>

         <dc:description>
An unusual halohydrin dehalogenase HHDHamb was identified for highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective bio&#8208;nitration of epoxides. Enantiopure &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols containing nitro&#8208;bearing stereocenters were synthesized on preparative scale by whole&#8208;cell biotransformation. The enzyme structure was also solved and analyzed, providing a possible understanding of the chemoselectivity control mechanism in the bio&#8208;nitration reaction.







Abstract
We report the discovery of an unusual halohydrin dehalogenase, HHDHamb, that can work under relatively low acidic conditions and extremely low temperatures for the bio&#8208;nitration of epoxides using nitrite as a nitrating agent. The bio&#8208;nitration strategy exhibits high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity, catalyzing the kinetic resolution of various epoxides to enantiopure &#946;&#8208;nitroalcohols with nitro&#8208;bearing stereocenters in up to 41&#8201;% isolated yield and &gt;99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee). Additionally, the bio&#8208;nitration method displays a high reaction efficiency and can be performed on a gram scale. We also solved the crystal structure of HHDHamb to understand the possible structural determinants of chemoselectivity control in the bio&#8208;nitration reaction.

         <title>Practical Synthesis of Chiral Allylboronates by Asymmetric 1,1&#8208;Difunctionalization of Terminal Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly 1,1&#8208;regio&#8208; and enantioselective alkenylboration of undirected and unactivated alkenes has been developed, which allows chiral allylboronates to be efficiently synthesized from readily available terminal alkenes, alkenyl bromides and B2pin2. This method is distinguished by its use of an inexpensive chiral catalyst, readily available starting materials, mild and convenient reaction conditions, scalability and practicality.







Abstract
We report herein a modular catalytic method for the efficient enantioselective synthesis of chiral allylboronates from abundant feedstock chemicals through an asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes. This protocol is distinguished by its use of an inexpensive chiral catalyst, mild and convenient reaction conditions, wide substrate scope, scalability and practicality. The utility of this method is demonstrated by the rapid synthesis of key intermediates of complex drug molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that &#946;&#8208;H elimination is a highly regioselective step and the reversible homolysis and convergance to the lower energy pre&#8208;reductive elimination intermediate is the enantio&#8208;determining step.

     alt="Practical Synthesis of Chiral Allylboronates by Asymmetric 1,1-Difunctionalization of Terminal Alkenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly 1,1-regio- and enantioselective alkenylboration of undirected and unactivated alkenes has been developed, which allows chiral allylboronates to be efficiently synthesized from readily available terminal alkenes, alkenyl bromides and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pin&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This method is distinguished by its use of an inexpensive chiral catalyst, readily available starting materials, mild and convenient reaction conditions, scalability and practicality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report herein a modular catalytic method for the efficient enantioselective synthesis of chiral allylboronates from abundant feedstock chemicals through an asymmetric 1,1-difunctionalization of alkenes. This protocol is distinguished by its use of an inexpensive chiral catalyst, mild and convenient reaction conditions, wide substrate scope, scalability and practicality. The utility of this method is demonstrated by the rapid synthesis of key intermediates of complex drug molecules. Mechanistic studies reveal that &#946;-H elimination is a highly regioselective step and the reversible homolysis and convergance to the lower energy pre-reductive elimination intermediate is the enantio-determining step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Dihydroazulene&#8208;Based Photofluorochromic AIE System for Rewritable 4D Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dihydroazulene&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission system is developed and systematically investigated. The light&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening and heat&#8208;driven closing processes endow it with controllable and quantitively described photofluorochromic properties. Accordingly, a rewritable 4D information encryption system with dynamic patterns is demonstrated, which shows a considerable data&#8208;storage capacity and multiple characteristics.







Abstract
Dynamic patterns based on luminescent materials play an essential role in the digital age. However, it is still challenging to develop highly emissive photofluorochromic materials with dynamic behaviors to store information with multiple characteristics. Here, we report a series of dihydroazulene&#8208;based compounds which show typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. Moreover, the photo&#8208;switching ability of the dihydroazulene units, undergoing light&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening, enables photofluorochromic properties. The photofluorochromism also shows quantitively described responses to time and temperature via a reverse ring&#8208;closing process. Ultimately, a rewritable 4D information system, embedded with a quick response code, dot matrix with microstructures, color matrix of fluorescence, and time/temperature&#8208;dependent intensity change, is established with dynamic patterns. This work not only develops a dynamic AIE skeleton with photofluorochromic properties but also provides a new strategy for information encryption and cybernetics.

         <title>Leveraging Isothermal Titration Calorimetry to Explore Structure&#8211;Property Relationships of Protein Immobilization in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isothermal titration calorimetry was leveraged to systematically study how the structural properties of MOFs, such as hydrophobicity, pore size, and topology, influence the thermodynamics of protein immobilization by using a series of Zr&#8208;MOFs as the host and insulin as the model protein probe. The thermodynamics of binding can elucidate a major driving force for protein encapsulation, which could not be revealed in bulk adsorption studies.







Abstract
Proteins immobilized in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) often show extraordinary stability. However, most efforts to immobilize proteins in MOFs have only been exploratory. Herein, we present the first systematic study on the thermodynamics of protein immobilization in MOFs. Using insulin as a probe, we leveraged isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to investigate how topology, pore size, and hydrophobicity of MOFs influence immobilization. ITC data obtained from the encapsulation of insulin in a series of Zr&#8208;MOFs reveals that MOFs provide proteins with a hydrophobic stabilizing microenvironment, making the encapsulation entropically driven. In particular, the pyrene&#8208;based NU&#8208;1000 tightly encapsulates insulin in its ideally sized mesopores and stabilizes insulin through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, resulting in the most enthalpically favored encapsulation process among this series. This study reveals critical insights into the structure&#8211;property relationships of protein immobilization.

         <title>Diborylmethyl Group as a Transformable Building Block for the Diversification of Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We established an efficient protocol for the preparation of halo&#8208;diborylmethanes and their use in homologative coupling with nitrogen nucleophiles to generate various nitrogen&#8208;substituted diborylmethanes. The diborylmethyl group installed onto the nitrogen atom served as a versatile synthetic handle, allowing for the programmed diversification of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.







Abstract
The development of new approaches to installing diverse carbon fragments to a nitrogen atom has attracted considerable attention in chemical science. While numerous strategies have been devised to forge C(sp3)&#8722;N bonds, one conceptually powerful and straightforward approach is to insert a transformable sp3&#8208;carbon unit onto a nitrogen atom for modular diversification. Here we describe the successful synthesis of halo&#8208;diborylmethanes and their applications to the preparation of nitrogen&#8208;substituted diborylmethanes through their homologative coupling with a variety of nitrogen nucleophiles including biologically relevant molecules. This process exhibits a remarkably broad substrate scope, and the usefulness of the obtained compounds is demonstrated by the modular diversification of the diborylmethyl group to access various nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>An Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Route to Dewar 1,3,5&#8208;Triphosphabenzene and Subsequent Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, scalable iron&#8208;catalyzed route to a Dewar phosphabenzene is presented. This species isomerizes in the presence of base to form the 1,3,5&#8208;phosphabenzene, which then spontaneously rearranges to a novel triphospha(tricyclo) species. Onward coordination chemistry of all three phosphines is explored along with an extensive study into the reactivity of the Dewar phosphabenzene.







Abstract
The application of an alkyne cyclotrimerization regime with an [Fe(salen)]2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo (1) catalyst to triphenylmethylphosphaalkyne (2) yields gram&#8208;scale quantities of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(triphenylmethyl)&#8208;Dewar&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene (3). Bulky lithium salt LiHMDS facilitates a rearrangement of 3 to the 1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene valence isomer (3&#8242;), which subsequently undergoes an intriguing phosphorus migration reaction to form the ring&#8208;contracted species (3&#8242;&#8242;). Density functional theory calculations provide a plausible mechanism for this rearrangement. Given the stability of 3, a diverse array of unprecedented transformations was investigated. We report novel crystallographically characterized products of successful nucleophilic/electrophilic addition and protonation/oxidation reactions.

         <title>Enhanced Solar Evaporation Using a Scalable MoS2&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Highly Efficient Solar Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable MoS2&#8208;based porous hydrogel (SMoS2&#8208;PH) was successfully constructed with a hydrophilic polyacrylamide as its skeleton and commercial MoS2 as the solar absorbent through a crosslinking foaming polymerization method. The SMoS2&#8208;PH performed an impressive evaporation rate of 3.297&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor conversion efficiency of 93.4&#8201;% under 1&#8208;sun illumination.







Abstract
Interfacial photo&#8208;vapor conversion has been suggested as a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable technology for seawater desalination. However, the conversion performance was still limited by some drawbacks, like salt accumulation and poor mechanical stability. Herein, a scalable MoS2&#8208;based porous hydrogel (SMoS2&#8208;PH) with good mechanical stability and salt resistance was successfully constructed through a crosslinking foaming polymerization method. With the high porosity (92.63&#8201;%), the SMoS2&#8208;PH performed an impressive evaporation rate of 3.297&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and photothermal conversion efficiency of 93.4&#8201;% under 1&#8208;sun illumination. Most importantly, the SMoS2&#8208;PH could maintain high and stable photothermal properties for 15&#8197;days on the surface of seawater. We believe that the excellent salt resistance, the high photothermal conversion efficiency, the ease of scale preparation method and the available commercial MoS2 make the SMoS2&#8208;PH a promising device for full&#8208;scale seawater desalination.

         <title>A Modular Co&#8208;assembly Strategy for Ordered Mesoporous Perovskite Oxides with Abundant Surface Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular co&#8208;assembly method is developed to synthesize a series of ordered mesoporous perovskite oxide/C composites and mesoporous perovskite oxides. Notably, the rich Lewis acid sites, active Zr species, and favorable porous structure of mesoporous La2Zr2O7 endow 94&#8201;% conversion and 99&#8201;% selectivity for hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan.







Abstract
The ordered mesoporous perovskite oxides with well&#8208;defined mesostrcture and versatile metal sites are attractive, but their successful synthesis faces challenges of complicated assembly dynamics and pore collapse in crystalline calcination. Here, we propose an energy balance concept to reveal interplay relationship in assembly process and realize regulation of porous structure for mesoporous perovskite oxides. A series of ordered mesoporous perovskite oxides with unique porous structure were prepared by a modular co&#8208;assembly method. Mesoporous La2Zr2O7 shows 94&#8201;% conversion and 99&#8201;% selectivity for hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan. Experiments reveal that rich Lewis acid sites, active Zr species, and favorable porous structure promote interaction between mesoporous La2Zr2O7 and HMF and reduce catalytic energy barrier. This work provides the insight into molecule co&#8208;assembly and developing multiple component ordered mesoporous materials.

         <title>Selective Confinement of Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Hydrates by a Capped Metallo&#8208;Cage under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulation of a hydrated rare&#8208;earth metal ion in a hydrophobic cavity was demonstrated under aqueous conditions by a cooperative system of a synthetic coordination cage and a tripodal capping anion. By the cooperation of the cage cavity and the caps, selective recognition and separation of early lanthanoid ions were achieved.







Abstract
The properties of rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal ions in aqueous media often depend on their various hydration modes, which allow them to exist as monomeric or oligomeric species with different coordination numbers. Capturing rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal ions in a confined cavity can fix their hydration modes and thus enable their intrinsic properties to be distinguished. However, the isolation of ionic species from bulk aqueous media is not an easy task due to competitive interaction with bulk water. Here, we report the encapsulation of hydrated rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal ions in a hydrophobic cavity of a synthetic cage. Cap&#8208;like counter anions located at the cage's portals play an important role in capturing the rare&#8208;earth metals at a fixed position via electrostatic interactions. Preferential encapsulation of early lanthanoid (III) ions was observed even though all the rare&#8208;earth metals have the same hydration number and geometry, as visualized by the competitive inclusion of a dye molecule. Accordingly, the early lanthanoid ion was selectively extracted from a mixture of two rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal ions.

         <title>Cocrystallization Enabled Spatial Self&#8208;Confinement Approach to Synthesize Crystalline Porous Metal Oxide Nanosheets for Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general cocrystallization induced spatial self&#8208;confinement approach has been developed to synthesize crystalline porous two&#8208;dimensional metal oxide nanosheets. The mechanism is proposed and various crystalline porous metal oxides nanosheets can be obtained. The resulting crystalline porous CeO2/SnO2 nanosheets show exceptional sensing performance towards 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone.







Abstract
Crystalline metal oxide nanosheets show exceptional catalytic performance owing to the large surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio and quantum confinement effect. However, it is still a challenge to develop a facile and general method to synthesize metal oxide nanosheets. Herein, we report a cocrystallization induced spatial self&#8208;confinement approach to synthesize metal oxide nanosheets. Taking the synthesis of SnO2 as an example, the solvent evaporation from KCl and SnCl2 solution induces the cocrystallization of KCl and K2SnCl6, and the obtained composite with encapsulated K2SnCl6 can be in situ converted into SnO2 nanosheets confined in KCl matrix, after water washing to remove KCl, porous SnO2 nanosheets can be obtained. Notably, a series of metal oxide nanosheets can be obtained through this general and efficient green route. In particular, porous CeO2/SnO2 nanosheets with improved surface O&#8722; species and abundant oxygen vacancies exhibit superior gas sensing performance to 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone.

         <title>Polystyrene&#8208;based Macromolecular Ammonium Halides for Tuning Color and Exchange Kinetics of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonium halide&#8208;containing polymers offer a convenient halide source for anion exchange with CsPbX3 nanocrystals (NCs), tuning their emission color from purple to red while simultaneously allowing formation of stable nanocomposite films. The polymer and its solvent&#8208;dependent aggregation state provide a handle to control inter&#8208;NC anion exchange kinetics, providing a simple solution&#8208;processable route to all&#8208;perovskite white emissive solutions and films.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthesis anion exchange of all&#8208;inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (CsPbX3 NCs, where X=Cl, Br, and/or I) provides a rapid and simple means of tuning their band gap and photoluminescence emission wavelengths. Here we report color&#8208;shifting of CsPbX3 nanocrystals induced by a macromolecular source of halide ions, specifically using polystyrene with ammonium halides as pendent groups. This strategy for introducing new halides to the perovskite nanocrystals gave access to perovskite&#8208;polymer hybrid materials as solutions, thin films, or free&#8208;flowing powders. Spectroscopic measurements of the halide&#8208;exchanged nanocrystal products revealed high photoluminescence quantum yields across the visible spectrum, with exchange kinetics that were tunable based on the solution environment, suggesting an aggregation&#8208;inhibited exchange process that affords access to multi&#8208;colored solutions and films.

         <title>Gauging Radical Stabilization with Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical stabilization by carbenes is explored computationally. A donor/acceptor frontier orbital picture based on the allyl radical is presented, and allows one to understand and predict radical stabilization in organic radicals, carbene complexes of the transitions metals, as well as of s&#8208; and p&#8208;block elements.







Abstract
Carbenes, including N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, are used extensively to stabilize open&#8208;shell transition metal complexes and organic radicals. Yet, it remains unknown, which carbene stabilizes a radical well and, thus, how to design radical&#8208;stabilizing C&#8208;donor ligands. With the large variety of C&#8208;donor ligands experimentally investigated and their electronic properties established, we report herein their radical&#8208;stabilizing effect. We show that radical stabilization can be understood by a captodative frontier orbital description involving &#960;&#8208;donation to&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donation from the carbenes. This picture sheds a new perspective on NHC chemistry, where &#960;&#8208;donor effects usually are assumed to be negligible. Further, it allows for the intuitive prediction of the thermodynamic stability of covalent radicals of main group&#8208; and transition metal carbene complexes, and the quantification of redox non&#8208;innocence.

         <title>In Situ Periodic Regeneration of Catalyst during CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;in situ periodic regeneration of catalyst (PR&#8208;C)&#8221; strategy is proposed to maintain the high efficiency of CO2 electroreduction towards C2+ products over a copper catalyst. A positive potential pulse is applied periodically for a short time in the halide&#8208;containing electrolyte. As a result the surface structure and oxidation state of the Cu could be recovered periodically by the PR&#8208;C method.







Abstract
Developing electrocatalytic reactions with high&#8208;efficiency can make important contributions to carbon neutrality. However, poor long&#8208;term stability of catalysts is a bottleneck for its practical application. Herein, an &#8220;in situ periodic regeneration of catalyst (PR&#8208;C)&#8221; strategy is proposed to give long&#8208;term high efficiency of CO2 electroreduction to generate C2+ products over Cu catalyst by applying a positive potential pulse for a short time periodically in the halide&#8208;containing electrolyte. The high Faradaic efficiency (81.2&#8201;%) and current density (22.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) could be maintained completely at least 36&#8197;h, while the activity and selectivity decreased continuously without using the PR&#8208;C method. Control experiments and operando characterization demonstrated that the surface structure and oxidation state of Cu could be recovered periodically by the PR&#8208;C method, which was beneficial for CO2 activation and C&#8722;C coupling.

         <title>Discrete Macrocycles with Fixed Chirality and Two Distinct Sides: Dipole&#8208;Dependent Chiroptical Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a rim&#8208;differentiated cylindrical macrocycle has enabled the synthesis of a series of chiroptical C5&#8208;symmetric molecules with various dipolar structures. Analysis of their enantiomers by chiroptical spectroscopy revealed that dipolar electronic distribution led to weak dissymmetry in the circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) responses, thus demonstrating the importance of reducing the nonsymmetry of macrocycles.







Abstract
Control of symmetry is fundamental in molecular design with aimed properties. Herein we report a set of chiroptical C5&#8208;symmetric molecules with variable dipolar structures based on a rim&#8208;differentiated cylindrical macrocycle, pillar[5]arene. Incorporation of electron&#8208;withdrawing ester groups formed an explicit two&#8208;sided structure, leading to increase in response wavelength and luminescence efficiency. On the other hand, chiroptical measurement of separated enantiomers revealed that such a dipolar character diminished dissymmetry of the electronic transitions. By suppressing the dipole, the dissymmetry factor for luminescence was enhanced from 0.4&#215;10&#8722;3 to 5.1&#215;10&#8722;3 in a less dipolar methoxy&#8208;substituted molecule, which was larger than reported pillar[5]arene derivatives without C5&#8208;symmetry around one order of magnitude.

         <title>Discovery of the Biosynthetic Pathway of Beticolin 1 Reveals a Novel Non&#8208;Heme Iron&#8208;Dependent Oxygenase for Anthraquinone Ring Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase BTG13 required for anthraquinone ring cleavage is discovered during elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of beticolin 1, in which iron is uncommonly coordinated by four histidine residues, an unusual carboxylated&#8208;lysine (Kcx377) and water based on its crystal structure. Moreover, Thr299 and His58 mediate Kcx377 to modulate the catalytic activity of BTG13. Thus, this work updates our knowledge of metalloenzymes.







Abstract
This study used light&#8208;mediated comparative transcriptomics to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of beticolin 1 in Cercospora. It contains an anthraquinone moiety and an unusual halogenated xanthone moiety connected by a bicyclo[3.2.2]nonane. During elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of beticolin 1, a novel non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase BTG13 responsible for anthraquinone ring cleavage was discovered. More importantly, the discovery of non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase BTG13 is well supported by experimental evidence: (i)&#8197;crystal structure and the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed that its reactive site is built by an atypical iron ion coordination, where the iron ion is uncommonly coordinated by four histidine residues, an unusual carboxylated&#8208;lysine (Kcx377) and water; (ii)&#8197;Kcx377 is mediated by His58 and Thr299 to modulate the catalytic activity of BTG13. Therefore, we believed this study updates our knowledge of metalloenzymes.

         <title>Constructing Interfacial Boron&#8208;Nitrogen Moieties in Turbostratic Carbon for Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron and nitrogen co&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon catalyst with tunable B&#8722;N&#8722;C configurations is fabricated by the assistance of a zwitterionic liquid, which is directly applied for HO2&#8722; synthesis in alkaline media through an O2 reduction reaction. Based on the combined spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical measurements, a correlation between the interfacial B&#8722;N moieties and HO2&#8722; selectivity is established.







Abstract
The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) provides a green route for decentralized H2O2 synthesis, where a structure&#8211;selectivity relationship is pivotal for the control of a highly selective and active two&#8208;electron pathway. Here, we report the fabrication of a boron and nitrogen co&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon catalyst with tunable B&#8722;N&#8722;C configurations (CNB&#8208;ZIL) by the assistance of a zwitterionic liquid (ZIL) for electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production. Combined spectroscopic analysis reveals a fine tailored B&#8722;N moiety in CNB&#8208;ZIL, where interfacial B&#8722;N species in a homogeneous distribution tend to segregate into hexagonal boron nitride domains at higher pyrolysis temperatures. Based on the experimental observations, a correlation between the interfacial B&#8722;N moieties and HO2&#8722; selectivity is established. The CNB&#8208;ZIL electrocatalysts with optimal interfacial B&#8722;N moieties exhibit a high HO2&#8722; selectivity with small overpotentials in alkaline media, giving a HO2&#8722; yield of &#8776;1787&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V in a flow&#8208;cell reactor.

&lt;p&gt;A boron and nitrogen co-doped turbostratic carbon catalyst with tunable B&#8722;N&#8722;C configurations is fabricated by the assistance of a zwitterionic liquid, which is directly applied for HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; synthesis in alkaline media through an O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction. Based on the combined spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical measurements, a correlation between the interfacial B&#8722;N moieties and HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) provides a green route for decentralized H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis, where a structure&#8211;selectivity relationship is pivotal for the control of a highly selective and active two-electron pathway. Here, we report the fabrication of a boron and nitrogen co-doped turbostratic carbon catalyst with tunable B&#8722;N&#8722;C configurations (CNB-ZIL) by the assistance of a zwitterionic liquid (ZIL) for electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production. Combined spectroscopic analysis reveals a fine tailored B&#8722;N moiety in CNB-ZIL, where interfacial B&#8722;N species in a homogeneous distribution tend to segregate into hexagonal boron nitride domains at higher pyrolysis temperatures. Based on the experimental observations, a correlation between the interfacial B&#8722;N moieties and HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity is established. The CNB-ZIL electrocatalysts with optimal interfacial B&#8722;N moieties exhibit a high HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity with small overpotentials in alkaline media, giving a HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; yield of &#8776;1787&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;catalyst&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V in a flow-cell reactor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective de novo Construction of Chiral Arenes through Desymmetrizing Oxidative [4+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A desymmetrization approach to centrally chiral unfunctionalized arenes is developed through the enantioselective de novo construction of the arene ring by oxidative [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of polycyclic meso&#8208;cyclohexenediones. Catalyzed by a diphenylprolinol silyl ether, this external oxidant&#8208;free protocol gives rise to diversely substituted chiral arenes with outstanding enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99.0&#8201;:&#8201;0.1 e.r.).







Abstract
Central chirality in arene derivatives arising out of unsymmetrically substituted arene ring is a fascinating yet rarely explored research topic. Here, we report a desymmetrization approach to centrally chiral unfunctionalized arenes, which is enabled by the enantioselective de novo construction of the arene ring. This operationally simple protocol is based on a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition between polycyclic meso&#8208;cyclohexenediones and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, and doesn't usually require any external oxidant. Catalyzed by a diphenylprolinol silyl ether, this reaction proceeds via dienamine intermediate and greatly simplifies the access to diversely substituted chiral arenes with outstanding enantioselectivities.

         <title>High&#8208;Field NMR, Reactivity, and DFT Modeling Reveal the &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 Surface Hydroxyl Network
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface hydroxyl network of gamma&#8208;Al2O3 was studied over a 300&#8211;700&#8201;&#176;C dehydroxylation temperature range. High&#8208;field MAS NMR, IR and DFT were harnessed to provide an unprecedented qualitative and quantitative assessment of the AlOH network, with impact on understanding of alkane conversion catalysts.







Abstract
Aluminas are strategic materials used in many major industrial processes, either as catalyst supports or as catalysts in their own right. The transition alumina &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 is a privileged support, whose reactivity can be tuned by thermal activation. This study provides a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the hydroxyl groups present on the surface of &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 at three different dehydroxylation temperatures. The principal [AlOH] configurations are identified and described in unprecedented detail at the molecular level. The structures were established by combining information from high&#8208;field 1H and 27Al solid&#8208;state NMR, IR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, as well as selective reactivity studies. Finally, the relationship between the hydroxyl structures and the molecular&#8208;level structures of the active sites in catalytic alkane metathesis is discussed.

         <title>Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfacial Coordination Chemistry Enables High&#8208;Capacity Ammonium Storage in Amorphous Manganese Phosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous manganese phosphate material is prepared using an electrochemical method for aqueous NH4+ ion storage. The electrode displays an ultra&#8208;high capacity of 299.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in NH4Ac electrolyte. Acetate ions can coordinate with the Mn sites and tailor the surface properties of the electrode, leading to the enhanced NH4+ adsorption capability.







Abstract
Ammonium (NH4+) ion as charge carrier is attracting attention in aqueous batteries. Yet, most NH4+ host materials are still limited by the relatively low capacities. Here, we fabricated a manganese phosphate (MP&#8208;20) for NH4+ ion storage. MP&#8208;20 displays a high capacity of 299.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in ammonium acetate (NH4Ac) electrolyte, outperforming other reported NH4+ host materials. Spectroscopy studies suggest a new NH4+/H+ co&#8208;insertion mechanism. We surprisingly discover that the NH4Ac electrolyte plays an important role in improving the charge storage capability of the materials. Experimental and computational results indicate acetate ions can form coordination bonds with the Mn atoms, tailoring the electronic structure of the Mn atoms and the surrounding O atoms, and therefore facilitating the NH4+ storage process. Our findings provide a new NH4+ host material and propose the important role of the electrolyte&#8208;electrode coordination effect in aqueous ammonium batteries.

         <title>From Ensemble Electrochemistry to Nano&#8208;Impact Electrochemistry: Altered Reaction Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction kinetics and mass transport behavior of LaNiO3 nanocube (NC)&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR) were systematically studied at ensemble and single nanoparticle levels. The selectivity of HPRR was altered at individual random&#8208;walk nanoparticles as compared to their ensemble counterpart without changing the reaction kinetics, offering the scope of new catalytic approaches to be developed.







Abstract
Selective electrochemical production of valued chemicals is of significant importance but remains a great challenge in chemistry. Conventional approaches for enhancing reaction selectivity focus on the improvement of the catalysts themselves. In this work, we systematically studied the reaction kinetics and mass transport behavior of LaNiO3 nanocubes (LaNiO3 NCs) catalyzed hydrogen peroxide reduction reaction (HPRR) at ensemble and single nanoparticle levels using nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry (NIE). We find that the selectivity of HPRR was altered at individual random&#8208;walk nanoparticles as compared to their ensemble counterpart without changing the reaction kinetics, due to the significantly enhanced mass transport at single nanoparticles. This discovery offers the scope of new catalytic approaches for engineering electrochemical reactions in general.

         <dc:description>
A novel geminal N,N&#8208;bis(silylenyl)aniline 1 degrades white phosphorus (P4) furnishing the first isolable 2,5&#8208;disila&#8208;3,4&#8208; diphosphapyrrole 2. The latter further reacts readily with P4 and 1 to afford the polycyclic Si=P&#8208;containing species 3 or the unprecedented conjugated Si=P&#8722;Si=P&#8722;Si=NPh chain&#8208;containing compound 4 depending on the molar ratio of the reactants. Moreover, the products 3 and 4 can be converted into each other when treated with 1 and P4, respectively.







Abstract
White phosphorus (P4) undergoes degradation to P2 moieties if exposed to the new N,N&#8208;bis(silylenyl)aniline PhNSi2 1 (Si=Si[N(tBu)]2CPh), furnishing the first isolable 2,5&#8208;disila&#8208;3,4&#8208;diphosphapyrrole 2 and the two novel functionalized Si=P doubly bonded compounds 3 and 4. The pathways for the transformation of the non&#8208;aromatic 2,5&#8208;disila&#8208;3,4&#8208;diphosphapyrrole PhNSi2P2 2 into 3 and 4 could be uncovered. It became evident that 2 reacts readily with both reactants P4 and 1 to afford either the polycyclic Si=P&#8208;containing product [PhNSi2P2]2P2 3 or the unprecedented conjugated Si=P&#8722;Si=P&#8722;Si=NPh chain&#8208;containing compound 4, depending on the employed molar ratio of 1 and P4 as well as the reaction conditions. Compounds 3 and 4 can be converted into each other by reactions with 1 and P4, respectively. All new compounds 1&#8211;4 were unequivocally characterized including by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. In addition, the electronic structures of 2&#8211;4 were established by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Framework Adaptability and Concerted Structural Response in a Bismuth Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Catalyst.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>

A highly robust bismuth MOF shows an unusual concerted structural response involving changes in inorganic building units upon binding of guest species at different sites. The MOF is an active catalyst for the Strecker reaction.







Abstract
Bismuth metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as heterogeneous catalysts are scarce, and there is little knowledge on the influence of the MOF features on their resulting activity and behavior. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic activity in the one&#8208;pot multicomponent Strecker reaction with ketones of three new MOFs prepared with the combination of indium or bismuth and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;methanetetrayltetrabenzoic acid. One of them, denoted BiPF&#8208;7, is very robust and chemically stable, and demonstrates a high activity in the formation of the desired &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles. The interaction of the catalytic substrates with the metal centers in this MOF has been crystallographically characterized, showcasing a concerted framework adaptability process that involves structural changes in framework components that are not directly involved in the binding of the guests.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Molybdenum&#8208;N3 Sites for Selective Hydrogenation of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adsorption and hydrogenation of CO2 to CO is reported over single Mo atoms with a MoN3 (pyrrolic) moiety. Density functional theory studies and experimental studies provide additional evidence to support the observed activity. A high and stable conversion of CO2 is attained up to 30.4&#8201;% with a 100&#8201;% CO selectivity.







Abstract
The design of efficient non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to fuels and chemicals is desired yet remains a challenge. Herein, we report that single Mo atoms with a MoN3 (pyrrolic) moiety enable remarkable CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation to CO, as predicted by density functional theory studies and evidenced by a high and stable conversion of CO2 reaching about 30.4&#8201;% with a CO selectivity of almost 100&#8201;% at 500&#8201;&#176;C and very low H2 partial pressure. Atomically dispersed MoN3 is calculated to facilitate CO2 activation and reduces CO2 to CO* via the direct dissociation path. Furthermore, the highest transition state energy in CO formation is 0.82&#8197;eV, which is substantially lower than that of CH4 formation (2.16&#8197;eV) and accounts for the dominant yield of CO. The enhanced catalytic performances of Mo/NC originate from facile CO desorption with the help of dispersed Mo on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Mo/NC), and in the absence of Mo nanoparticles. The resulting catalyst preserves good stability without degradation of CO2 conversion rate even after 68&#8197;hours of continuous reaction. This finding provides a promising route for the construction of highly active, selective, and robust single&#8208;atom non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for reverse water&#8211;gas shift reaction.

         <title>Deep Learning for Additive Screening in Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Additive engineering has significantly improved the performance of perovskite optoelectronic devices, and is promising for further enhancing perovskite devices&#8217; efficiency. A key challenge is to choose suitable additive for perovskite. The approach based on deep learning helps to predict the suitable additives, giving rising to high&#8208;performance near&#8208;infrared perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Additive engineering with organic molecules is of critical importance for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite optoelectronic devices. However, experimentally finding suitable additives is costly and time consuming, while conventional machine learning (ML) is difficult to predict accurately due to the limited experimental data available in this relatively new field. Here, we demonstrate a deep learning method that can predict the effectiveness of additives in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with a high accuracy up to 96&#8201;% by using a small dataset of 132 molecules. This model can maximize the information of the molecules and significantly mitigate the duplicated problem that usually happened with previous models in ML for molecular screening. Very high efficiency PeLEDs with a peak external quantum efficiency up to 22.7&#8201;% can be achieved by using the predicated additive. Our work opens a new avenue for further boosting the performance of perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Promoted by a Ru1Cu Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) was achieved over a Ru1Cu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst with isolated Ru atoms on Cu nanowires. Single&#8208;atom Ru promotes the dissociation of water to produce H* species that effectively react with HMF to afford DHMF. This work offers a catalyst design model for highly efficient ECH of biomass via single&#8208;atom alloying.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) represents an elegant route toward sustainable value&#8208;added chemicals production that circumvents the use of fossil fuel and hydrogen. However, the reaction efficiency is hampered by the high voltage and low activity of electrodes (Cu, Bi, Pb). Herein, we report a Ru1Cu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst with isolated Ru atoms on Cu nanowires that exhibits an electrochemical reduction of HMF to 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) with promoted productivity (0.47 vs. 0.08&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1) and faradic efficiency (FE) (85.6 vs. 71.3&#8201;%) at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V (vs. RHE) compared with Cu counterpart. More importantly, the FE (87.5&#8201;%) is largely retained at high HMF concentration (100&#8197;mM). Kinetic studies by using combined electrochemical techniques suggest disparate mechanisms over Ru1Cu and Cu, revealing that single&#8208;atom Ru promotes the dissociation of water to produce H* species that effectively react with HMF via an electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) mechanism.

         <title>Linker Scissoring Strategy Enables Precise Shaping of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Chromatographic Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;linker scissoring&#8221; strategy is used to control the shape of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles from nanoplate to nanorod by surface conformational pairing. Both structure and shape influenced the separation ability of MOF stationary phases in gas chromatography by affecting the thermodynamic and kinetic diffusion factors.







Abstract
Precise shaping of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is significant in both fundamental coordination chemistry and practical applications, such as catalysis, separation, and biomedicine. Herein, we demonstrated a linker scissoring strategy for precisely shaping MOFs through surface conformational pairing. In this strategy, the bidentate linkers which were designed according to the original tetratopic ligands and the coordination environment of MOF surfaces, were utilized as the covering agents. The shape of these covering agents and the surface conformation of metals onto MOFs restricted them to coordinate on specific MOF facets thus precisely controlling the shape of the MOFs. Different shapes of PCN&#8208;608 from nanoplate (PCN&#8208;NP) to nanorod (PCN&#8208;NR) have been targeted by adding different bidentate linkers. The universality of this strategy was demonstrated by controlling the shapes of the NU&#8208;MOFs from nanoplate to nanorod. This strategy provides a new guiding principle to synthesize MOF nanocrystals with controlled shapes.

         <dc:description>
Activated graphene&#8208;embedded Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 catalysts showed a remarkable nitrogen fixation apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 9.25&#8201;% under 365&#8197;nm light and high stability as solar nitrogen fertilizer. Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 is activated by the breakage of benzene&#8208;C bonds and forms effective active sites. Graphene embedding controlled bond breakages and improved photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Currently, nitrogen fertilizers feed half of the global population, but their use is limited by energy consumption and transportation. Therefore, it is important to study photocatalysts for use in solar nitrogen fertilizers. Herein, a new type of graphene&#8208;embedded Ce&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 (Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) photocatalyst (GSCe) is investigated. Ce&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 is activated by the breakage of benzene&#8208;C bonds and the formation of active sites by ultraviolet light in water. Moreover, embedding graphene effectively controls activation and improves nitrogen fixation. GSCe exhibited a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 9.25&#8201;% and stability under 365&#8197;nm light with solar&#8208;level intensity. GSCe also performed well as a solar ammonia fertilizer for crop cultivation. This investigation opens up opportunities for nitrogen fixation photocatalysts to be used as environmentally friendly solar nitrogen fertilizers.

         <title>Discovery and Genetic Code Expansion of a Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Hydrolase from the Human Saliva Metagenome for the Degradation and Bio&#8208;Functionalization of PET</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
MG8, a novel polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate (PET) hydrolase from the human saliva metagenome, with robust PET degradation activity, was discovered and characterized. It was further repurposed into a covalent binder of PET through genetic code expansion, enabling its use to attach protein payloads to PET and other polyesters under mild conditions.







Abstract
We report a bioinformatic workflow and subsequent discovery of a new polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase, which we named MG8, from the human saliva metagenome. MG8 has robust PET plastic degradation activities under different temperature and salinity conditions, outperforming several naturally occurring and engineered hydrolases in degrading PET. Moreover, we genetically encoded 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid (DAP) in place of the catalytic serine residue of MG8, thereby converting a PET hydrolase into a covalent binder for bio&#8208;functionalization of PET. We show that MG8(DAP), in conjunction with a split green fluorescent protein system, can be used to attach protein cargos to PET as well as other polyester plastics. The discovery of a highly active PET hydrolase from the human metagenome&#8212;currently an underexplored resource for industrial enzyme discovery&#8212;as well as the repurposing of such an enzyme into a plastic functionalization tool, should facilitate ongoing efforts to degrade and maximize reusability of PET.

         <title>Scalable, Chemoselective Nickel Electrocatalytic Sulfinylation of Aryl Halides with SO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by electrochemistry, the conversion of aryl halides to sulfinates using an inexpensive Ni catalyst at room temperature is reported. The use of SO2 stock solution at controlled concentration represents a convenient sulfur source. The sulfinate intermediates can be derivatized into sulfonyl fluorides, sulfonamide, and sulfone in a one&#8208;pot fashion. This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope and can be easily scaled up in batch and flow.







Abstract
Simple access to aryl sulfinates from aryl iodides and bromides is reported using an inexpensive Ni&#8208;electrocatalytic protocol. The reaction exhibits a broad scope, uses stock solution of simple SO2 as sulfur source, and can be scaled up in batch and recycle flow settings.

     alt="Scalable, Chemoselective Nickel Electrocatalytic Sulfinylation of Aryl Halides with SO2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enabled by electrochemistry, the conversion of aryl halides to sulfinates using an inexpensive Ni catalyst at room temperature is reported. The use of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stock solution at controlled concentration represents a convenient sulfur source. The sulfinate intermediates can be derivatized into sulfonyl fluorides, sulfonamide, and sulfone in a one-pot fashion. This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope and can be easily scaled up in batch and flow.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple access to aryl sulfinates from aryl iodides and bromides is reported using an inexpensive Ni-electrocatalytic protocol. The reaction exhibits a broad scope, uses stock solution of simple SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as sulfur source, and can be scaled up in batch and recycle flow settings. The limitations of this reaction are clearly shown and put into context by benchmarking with state-of-the-art Pd-based methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Sulfonium&#8208;Stabilized High&#8208;Efficiency Cesium or Methylammonium Lead Bromide Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic sulfonium bromide was introduced as a new X&#8208;type ligand to synthesize cesium or methylammonium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). The purified PNCs exhibited near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) without post&#8208;treatments and showed high ambient stability. The CsPbBr3 PNCs can be incorporated into polystyrene, and the composite exhibited a record&#8208;high PLQY of 93.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Herein, we report a new X&#8208;type ligand, i.e., organic sulfonium bromide, for high&#8208;efficiency CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 (MA=methylammonium) perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). We first confirmed the facile synthesis of the titled ligands in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide at room temperature. By reacting dodecylmethylsulfide with allyl bromide, (3&#8208;bromopropyl)trimethoxysilane, and 1,4&#8208;dibromobutane, respectively, three representative ligands (named DAM, DSM, and DMM) are acquired. All of them result in CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 PNCs with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and decent ambient stability (no less than 90&#8201;% PLQY after 2&#8197;months) using a room&#8208;temperature ligand&#8208;assisted reprecipitation technique. Among them, DSM and DMM endow CsPbBr3 PNCs with higher thermal/light stability arising from the cross&#8208;linkable or bidentate ligand structure. Further, DSM&#8208;CsPbBr3 PNCs can be incorporated into polystyrene through in situ thermal polymerization and the composite shows a record&#8208;high PLQY of 93.8&#8201;%.

         <title>A Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide with Ultra&#8208;Microporosity for Inverse CO2/C2H2 Separation at High Temperature and Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;microporous zeolitic octahedral metal oxide is used for CO2 capture over C2H2 to obtain highly pure C2H2 directly. The material not only shows high separation performance at low temperatures but also at high temperatures and humidities.







Abstract
Separation of CO2/C2H2 to obtain pure C2H2 presents a challenge for the chemical industry. CO2&#8208;selective adsorbents are favored because of the convenient separation process. However, there are only a few CO2&#8208;selective adsorbents that can effectively isolate CO2 from CO2/C2H2, and there is almost no research on CO2/C2H2 separation under harsh conditions, such as with high temperatures and humidities. Herein, a zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on &#1013;&#8208;Keggin polyoxometalates is utilized for separations of CO2/C2H2 at high temperatures and humidities. Single gas adsorption measurements show that the material only adsorbs CO2 with almost no C2H2 taken up. Dynamic competitive adsorption experiments show that the material efficiently separates CO2/C2H2, and highly pure C2H2 is obtained directly. The robust material maintains a high separation performance at 333&#8197;K with 18.12&#8201;% water. The high stability of the material enables reuse without loss of separation performance.

         <title>Chromophore&#8208;Inspired Design of Pyridinium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Polymers for Dual Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal photoredox platform was developed through the synergistic construction of triphenylpyrylium&#8208;mimic ligands and reductive metal ions in a metal&#8211;organic polymer. This novel strategy enabled the integration of significant photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer (LMCT) events for the efficient photocatalysis of various organic couplings and molecular oxygen activation. PYTC+=2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium.







Abstract
2,4,6&#8208;Triphenylpyrylium (TPT+) functions as a classic organic photocatalyst and exhibits a noteworthy absorption in the visible range, strongly oxidizing excited states, and a somewhat unstable structure. Inspired by the nuclear chromophore and dual catalysis strategy, herein, we report a universal photoredox platform constructed by TPT+&#8208;mimic bridging ligands and reductive metal ions on the basis of metal&#8211;organic supramolecular systems for various organic couplings and molecular oxygen activation under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Significant photoinduced electron transfer and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer events are both integrated and regulated by the spatial and kinetic confinement effects of the structurally confined microenvironments, effectively improving the efficiency of electron transfer and radical&#8211;radical coupling processes in photocatalysis. This package deal provides a promising way for the design of novel photocatalysts and the development of versatile and sustainable synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Covalent&#8208;Bonding Oxidation Group and Titanium Cluster to Synthesize a Porous Crystalline Catalyst for Selective Photo&#8208;Oxidation Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A titanium&#8208;cluster&#8208;based metal&#8208;covalent organic framework nanosheet has been prepared through the covalent&#8208;coupling between the Ti&#8208;cluster and an oxidation group. The resulting nanosheets can be applied for highly selective photo&#8208;oxidation of biomass HMF into FDCA.







Abstract
The selective photo&#8208;oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is important due to its substitute&#8208;role in polyester&#8208;fabrication. Here, a titanium&#8208;cluster based metal&#8208;covalent organic framework nanosheet has been synthesized through the covalent&#8208;coupling between Ti6&#8208;NH2 and benzotrithiophene tricarbaldehyde (BTT). The integration of them endows the nanosheet with a visible&#8208;light&#8208;adsorption region, effective electron&#8208;hole separation&#8208;efficiency and suitable photo&#8208;oxidation ability. Specifically, its photo&#8208;selectivity for HMF&#8208;to&#8208;FDCA can be &gt;95&#8201;% with &#8776;100&#8201;% conversion, which is more than 2, 5, and 10 times higher than MOF&#8208;901 (43&#8201;%), Ti6&#8208;NH2 (19&#8201;%) and under&#8208;darkness (9&#8201;%), respectively. Notably, an O2&#8208;based mechanism is proposed and the vital roles of Ti6&#8208;NH2 and BTT are verified by DFT calculations. This work might facilitate the exploration of porous&#8208;crystalline&#8208;catalysts for selective biomass&#8208;valorization.

Notably, an O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based mechanism is proposed and the vital roles of Ti&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and BTT are verified by DFT calculations. This work might facilitate the exploration of porous-crystalline-catalysts for selective biomass-valorization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Cooperatively Grown J&#8208;aggregates with Different Nucleus Size</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular aggregation system is studied in which the two J&#8208;aggregates are both assembled cooperatively. A series of variable&#8208;temperature experiments indicate that the different nucleus sizes of J1 and J2 account for the difference in their elongation temperatures. Despite the thermodynamic stability of J2 at around room temperature, the smaller nucleus size and higher elongation temperature facilitate the J1 formation from thermal treatment.







Abstract
A molecule featuring two distinct cooperatively grown J&#8208;aggregates is investigated. Interestingly, when cooling a hot monomer solution, the thermodynamically less stable J1 is exclusively formed even at a particularly slowed temperature dropping rate, which transforms to the more stable J2 at room temperature with very slow kinetics. This observation is ascribed to the differed nucleus sizes of J1 and J2. During the cooling process, smaller J1 nuclei are formed first at a higher temperature, favored by the entropy effect. At intermediate temperatures, the elongation of J1 out&#8208;competes the nucleation of J2. Then, below the elongation temperature of J2, the formation of this thermodynamically stable aggregate is hindered kinetically, due to the depletion of monomer by the slow dissociation of J1. Additional evidence proving the larger nucleus size of J2 is also identified with the varied&#8208;temperature spectral analyses and mathematic simulations.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Organic Supramolecule via Hydrogen Bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking for Ultrahigh Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust two&#8208;dimensional organic supramolecular network is achieved via hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, leading to enhanced charge transfer, insolubility and rapid ion transport channels for fast&#8208;charge and &#8208;discharge Zn&#8211;organic batteries with record&#8208;breaking ultrahigh capacity and outstanding cyclability.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, the reported electrode materials for ZIBs are facing shortcomings including low capacity and unsatisfactory cycling stability etc. Herein, hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;quione (HATNQ) is reported for aqueous ZIBs. The HATNQ electrodes delivered an ultrahigh capacity (482.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and outstanding cyclability of &gt;10&#8201;000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The capacity sets a new record for organic cathodes in aqueous ZIBs. The high performances are ascribed to the rich C=O and C=N groups that endowed HATNQ with a 2D layered supramolecular structure by multiple hydrogen bonds in plane with &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, leading to enhanced charge transfer, insolubility, and rapid ion transport for fast&#8208;charge and &#8208;discharge batteries. Moreover, the 2D supramolecular structure boosted the storage of Zn2+/H+, particularly the storage of Zn2+, due to the more favorable O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N coordination in HATNQ.

Bioremediation. The discovery of MG8, an efficient polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase enzyme from the human saliva metagenome, is reported by Worawan Bhanthumnavin, Chayasith Uttamapinant et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202203061). Aside from its plastic degradation capability, MG8 was further engineered via genetic code expansion into a covalent binder of PET plastic and can be used to attach protein payloads to PET and other polyesters.

         <title>Radical Brook Rearrangements: Concept and Recent Developments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical Brook rearrangement is a unique molecular arrangement, but it is not highly explored in synthetic chemistry. This Minireview summarizes the early developments and general concept of radical Brook rearrangements and highlights the recent advances in photocatalytic reactions and transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving radical Brook rearrangements.







Abstract
The Brook rearrangement has already become established as one of the most important molecular rearrangements in synthetic chemistry and has been applied in the generation of complexes, drug discovery, material science, and natural products synthesis. Compared to the widely known ionic mechanism, the radical Brook rearrangement is less explored because of the difficulty in generating alkoxyl radical species. This Minireview summarizes the early developments and general concept of the radical Brook rearrangement and highlights recent advances in photocatalytic reactions and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving radical Brook rearrangements. We hope this survey will inspire further developments in this emerging area.

         <title>Capture, Storage, and Release of Oxygen by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging materials for oxygen capture and storage with significant benefits for the broader community. This Minireview assesses and discusses the fundamental chemistry for both selective and reversible MOFs for the role of oxygen capture from air. In addition, we describe the current state of play for oxygen storage by MOFs, as well as engineering solutions to aid in the release of oxygen once captured.







Abstract
Oxygen is a critical gas for medical and industrial settings. Much of today's global oxygen supply is via inefficient technologies such as cryogenic distillation, membranes or zeolites. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) promise a superior alternative for oxygen separation, as their fundamental chemistry can in principle be tailored for reversible and selective oxygen capture.

     alt="Capture, Storage, and Release of Oxygen by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging materials for oxygen capture and storage with significant benefits for the broader community. This Minireview assesses and discusses the fundamental chemistry for both selective and reversible MOFs for the role of oxygen capture from air. In addition, we describe the current state of play for oxygen storage by MOFs, as well as engineering solutions to aid in the release of oxygen once captured.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen is a critical gas for medical and industrial settings. Much of today's global oxygen supply is via inefficient technologies such as cryogenic distillation, membranes or zeolites. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) promise a superior alternative for oxygen separation, as their fundamental chemistry can in principle be tailored for reversible and selective oxygen capture. We evaluate the characteristics for reversible and selective uptake of oxygen by MOFs, focussing on redox-active sites. Key characteristics for separation can also be seen in MOFs for oxygen storage roles. Engineering solutions to release adsorbed oxygen from the MOFs are discussed including Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA), Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) and the highly efficient Magnetic Induction Swing Adsorption (MISA). We conclude with the applications and outlooks for oxygen capture, storage and release, and the likely impacts the next generation of MOFs will have on industry and the broader community.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Organic solar cells (OSCs) are a promising next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technology with many unique advantages. This Minireview highlights the recent advances in material design and cutting&#8208;edge devices. Particular attention is paid to a few research directions toward practical applications of OSCs.







Abstract
Single&#8208;junction organic solar cells (OSCs) have made significant progress in recent years. Innovations in material design and device optimization have improved the power conversion efficiencies to over 19&#8201;%. In this Minireview, based on recent advances, we discuss molecular design strategies to tune the absorption spectrum, energy level, and intermolecular aggregation as well as highlight the role of molecular electrostatic potential in decreasing energy loss. Then, we introduce the latest progress in four types of OSCs composed of different donor:acceptor combinations: polymer donor:small&#8208;molecule acceptor, all&#8208;polymer, all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule, and small&#8208;molecule donor:polymer acceptor. Finally, the challenges of OSCs in practical applications, including material cost, stability, and multi&#8208;function integration, are discussed.

         <title>Enabling Sustainable Chemistry with Ionic Liquids and Deep Eutectic Solvents: A Fad or the Future?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) continue to generate interest within and beyond the chemistry community. Their property tunability through a rational selection of precursors, including bioderived ones, provides a strategy to ameliorate toxicity, lower cost, and endow new functions for sustainable chemistry. This Review discusses whether ILs and DESs are sustainable solvents and how they contribute to sustainable chemical processes.







Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) debuted with a promise of a superior sustainability footprint due to their low vapor pressure. However, their toxicity and high cost compromise this footprint, impeding their real&#8208;world applications. Fortunately, their property tunability through a rational selection of precursors, including bioderived ones, provides a strategy to ameliorate toxicity, lower cost, and endow new functions. This Review discusses whether ILs and DESs are sustainable solvents and how they contribute to sustainable chemical processes.

         <title>Fused Hybrids of a [22]Smaragdyrin BF2 Complex with a NiII Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directly fused porphyrinoids with wavy structures have been synthesized by the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of [22]Smaragdyrin BF2 complexes with NiII porphyrins and a subsequent oxidative fusion reaction with FeCl3. The fused hybrids with cycloheptatriene linkages exhibit red&#8208;shifted and enhanced absorption bands in the near&#8208;infrared region.







Abstract
[22]Smaragdyrin BF2 complex (S)&#8208;NiII porphyrin (P) fused hybrids were synthesized through Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of brominated S with borylated P and subsequent oxidative fusion reaction with FeCl3 as the first example of directly fused porphyrinoids bearing cycloheptatriene linkage. These fused hybrids have been fully characterized, including their X&#8208;ray structural analysis. Owing to the cycloheptatriene linkage, these fused hybrids adopt waving structures. These fused hybrids display red&#8208;shifted and enhanced Q&#8208;like bands and characteristic redox potentials, depending upon the constitution and the linking position.

         <title>Stable Monodisperse Pb1&#8722;xCdxS Quantum Dots for NIR&#8208;II Bioimaging by Aqueous Coprecipitation of Bimetallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly monodisperse and stable Pb1&#8722;xCdxS QDs are prepared by a simple aqueous method with Pb4&#8722;nCdnO4 clusters as building blocks. They emit at 1100&#8197;nm in the NIR&#8208;II window with 17.72&#8201;% PLQY in water. Fine lymphography, angiography and dual&#8208;channel bioimaging at low power density (10&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) excitation can be successfully achieved by using these ternary QDs. The excellent stability makes this material very competitive in practical applications.







Abstract
Aqueous lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs) synthesized by traditional methods are unstable, so that they are usually coated with cadmium sulfide (CdS) to prevent oxidation, which are complicated and not satisfactory for mass production. Here, stable ternary Pb1&#8722;xCdxS QDs were synthesized by in situ coprecipitation of Pb4&#8722;nCdnO4 bimetallic clusters in an aqueous solution, which possess a uniform size of 4.0&#177;0.2&#8197;nm and the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission at 1100&#8197;nm with photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 17.72&#8201;%. Stored at 4&#8201;&#176;C and in colloidal form, the PLQY of Pb1&#8722;xCdxS QDs remained at 90.9&#8201;% of the initial value after 15&#8197;days, while stored as powder, the spectra did not change after 5&#8197;months. The high PLQY and good water compatibility of Pb1&#8722;xCdxS QDs provide a good performance in vivo vasculature imaging and lymphatic system imaging at a very low power density (10&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in the NIR&#8208;II window.

         <title>Multienzyme Redox System with Cofactor Regeneration for Cyclic Deracemization of Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multienzyme cyclic deracemization system with cofactor regeneration was established for the preparation of enantiopure sulfoxides. Chiral sulfoxides were prepared in &gt;90&#8201;% yield with &gt;90&#8201;% ee through the cascade catalysis of methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr), styrene monooxygenase (SMO), and three other auxiliary enzymes (Trx, Trx&#8208;R, and GDH).







Abstract
Optically pure sulfoxides are noteworthy compounds applied in a wide range of industrial fields; however, the biocatalytic deracemization of racemic sulfoxides is challenging. Herein, a high&#8208;enantioselective methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) was combined with a low&#8208;enantioselective styrene monooxygenase (SMO) for the cyclic deracemization of sulfoxides. Enantiopure sulfoxides were obtained in &gt;90&#8201;% yield and with &gt;90&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee) through dynamic &#8220;selective reduction and non&#8208;selective oxidation&#8221; cycles. The cofactors of MsrA and SMO were subsequently regenerated by the cascade catalysis of three auxiliary enzymes through the consumption of low&#8208;cost D&#8208;glucose. Moreover, this &#8220;one&#8208;pot, one&#8208;step&#8221; cyclic deracemization strategy exhibited a wide substrate scope toward various aromatic, heteroaromatic, alkyl and thio&#8208;alkyl sulfoxides. This system proposed an efficient strategy for the green synthesis of chiral sulfoxide.

         <title>Synthesis of Hydrofluoroolefin&#8208;Based Iodonium Reagent via Dyotropic Rearrangement and Its Utilization in Fluoroalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a novel hypervalent iodonium salt was developed with the exploitation of a dyotropic rearrangement of iodine and chlorine functions in fluoroalkyl chains from HFO&#8208;1234yf gas. The electrophilic reagent enabled the direct and metal&#8208;free introduction of a special fluoroalkyl group into aniline derivatives and N&#8208;containing heteroaromatic compounds. Detailed experimental and computational data were collected and used to propose a mechanistic description of this unique rearrangement.







Abstract
[1,2]&#8208;shift of atoms in alkyl fragments belongs to the class of dyotropic rearrangements. Various atoms, including halogens can be involved in the migration, however participation of iodine is unprecedented. Herein, we report our experimental and DFT studies on the oxidation triggered dyotropic rearrangement of iodo and chloro functions via butterfly&#8208;type transition state to demonstrate the migrating ability of &#955;3&#8208;iodane centre. With the exploitation of dyotropic rearrangement we designed and synthesized a novel fluoroalkyl iodonium reagent from industrial feedstock gas HFO&#8208;1234yf. We demonstrated that the hypervalent reagent serves as an excellent fluoroalkylation agent for various amines and nitrogen heterocycles.

         <title>Pincer&#8208;Supported Perfluororhodacyclopentanes: High Nucleophilicity of the M&#8722;CF Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluororhodacyclopentane supported by a PBP&#8208;pincer ligand was synthesized. The Rh&#8722;CF bond showed high reactivity toward hydrogenolysis, iodinolysis and protonolysis thanks to the strong &#963;&#8208;donation from the boryl group.







Abstract
Perfluororhodacyclopentane supported by PBP pincer ligand PBP&#8208;RhIII(CF2)4 (2) was prepared from PBP&#8208;RhI&#8208;PPh3 (1) and tetrafluoroethylene (TFE). By scXRD analysis, it was revealed that the Rh&#8722;CF bond trans to the boryl ligand was largely elongated compared to the one in the apical position. Although M&#8722;CF bonds of perfluorometallacyclopentanes are known to be very stable, 2 shows high reactivity toward hydrogenolysis, iodinolysis and protonolysis, thanks to the strong trans&#8208;effect of the highly &#963;&#8208;donating boryl ligand. Analogous PCP pincer complex PCP&#8722;RhIII(CF2)4 (4) showed slower reaction rate both in oxidative cyclization with TFE and hydrogenolysis of Rh&#8722;CF bond. Catalytic production of 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4&#8208;octafluorobutane from two TFE and hydrogen in one pot was achieved via repetitive oxidative cyclization of TFE and Rh followed by the hydrogenolysis of Rh&#8722;CF bonds. This report demonstrates the possible application of PBP&#8208;pincer skeleton to the preparation of fluorinated compounds from TFE.

         <title>Periphery&#8208;Core Strategy to Access a Bowl&#8208;Shaped Molecule Bearing Multiple Heteroatoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bowl&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with up to four sulfur atoms and two embedded B&#8722;N bonds has been synthesized by a periphery&#8208;core strategy, whereby the bottom of the bowl is closed in the final step. The incorporation of sulfur and nitrogen atoms enriches the electronic density of the buckybowl and results in a strong intermolecular interaction with C60 fullerene.







Abstract
Most of the bowl&#8208;shaped molecules are synthesized via a core&#8208;periphery strategy with the bowl rim closed at the final stage. However, the construction of heteroatom&#8208;doped buckybowls by the periphery&#8208;core method with the bowl bottom sealed by inserting new atoms in the last step is quite limited. Herein we report the synthesis of a bowl&#8208;shaped compound containing four sulfur atoms and two embedded N&#8722;B bonds with the ratio of carbon atom and heteroatom as low as four through a periphery&#8208;core strategy. Crystallographic analysis confirms the formation of a bowl&#8208;shaped structure. The multiple heteroatoms alter the molecular electronic structure, thus resulting in the distinct aromaticity when compared with its all&#8208;carbon congener. The electron&#8208;rich buckybowl shows a strong interaction with the electron&#8208;deficient fullerene C60 by forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex in toluene.

         <dc:description>
A CuI&#8208;phosphine catalytic system activates 1,1&#8208;diborylalkenes stereoselectively. The energetically preferred formation of (Z)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;borylalkenyl copper(I) species and the subsequent coupling reaction with allyl bromides allow the exclusive formation of (Z)&#8208;skipped dienes. This new methodology is applicable to various 1,1&#8208;di(pinacolboryl)alkenes which can be efficiently coupled with different types of allyl halides. The (Z)&#8208;skipped dienes with bromide functionality are treated with NaOtBu to promote cyclization/aromatization patterns via enyne intermediates.

         <title>Topochemical Cycloaddition Reaction between an Azide and an Internal Alkyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internal alkynes are generally unreactive in solution&#8208;phase 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions. However, a topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction involving an internal alkyne has now been achieved by using a cyclitol&#8208;derived monomer containing an azide and an internal alkyne group. Heating the crystals results in the monomer undergoing a topochemical polymerization to yield trisubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;linked&#8208;polycyclitol.







Abstract
Here we report the synthesis of a trisubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;linked polymer using a topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction. A cyclitol&#8208;derived monomer having an azide and an internal alkyne group was designed. The four hydroxy groups present in this monomer dictate its crystal packing such that the monomer molecules are arranged head&#8208;to&#8208;tail, thereby placing the internal alkyne and the azide units of adjacent molecules proximally. Although the alignment of the reactive groups in the monomer crystal is not favourable for a topochemical reaction, a reactive orientation can be achieved by the rotation of the reactive groups. Upon heating the crystals, the monomer underwent topochemical polymerization to yield the trisubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;linked&#8208;polycyclitol. This study demonstrates a new synthetic strategy for cycloaddition reaction between non&#8208;polarized internal alkynes and azides to yield trisubstituted triazoles.

         <title>Thiol&#8208;Disulfide Exchange as a Route for Endosomal Escape of Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric nanogels with judiciously placed disulfide bonds have been synthesized and tested for cellular uptake and endosomal escape. Comparison with their non&#8208;disulfide counterparts shows that disulfide moieties play a key role in endosomal escape.







Abstract
Endosomal entrapment has remained the major bottleneck for cytosolic delivery of nanoparticle&#8208;based delivery systems. Uncovering fundamentally new pathways for endosomal escape is therefore highly sought. Herein, we report that disulfide bonds can enhance endosomal escape through contacts with cellular exofacial thiols, in addition to facilitating cellular uptake. Our results are supported through comparative analysis of polymeric nanogels with variable accessibility to disulfide bonds by placing these functionalities at the core or the shell of the nanogels. The findings here inform future chemical design of delivery vehicles.

A new method for differential dihydrofunctionalization of terminal alkynes enables the synthesis of allylic boronate esters through reductive three&#8208;component coupling of terminal alkynes, alkenyl bromides, and pinacolborane. The transformation is promoted by cooperative action of a copper/palladium catalyst system and results in hydrofunctionalization of both &#960;&#8208;bonds of an alkyne.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Radioluminescence from Chiral Perovskite Scintillators for Improved X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral perovskite scintillators emit circularly polarized radioluminescence with a controlled propagation pathway, enabling a new style of X&#8208;ray imaging, which potentially reduces the optical crosstalk.







Abstract
Scintillators display radioluminescent properties when irradiated by high&#8208;energy photons and therefore play an essential role in radiation detection. The current inventory of scintillators is overwhelmingly represented by achiral structures, where the radioluminescence propagates isotropically after generation. Herein, we demonstrate that chiral perovskites of (R&#8208;3AP)PbBr3Cl&#8901;H2O (R&#8208;3APP) and (S&#8208;3AP)PbBr3Cl&#8901;H2O (S&#8208;3APP) emerge as a new type of scintillator displaying a distinct property of circularly polarized radioluminescence (CPRL). A high quantum yield of 27.6&#8201;%, high luminescence dissymmetric factors (glum) of 4&#215;10&#8722;2, and high X&#8208;ray absorption coefficients were observed for these compounds. As proof of concept, we fabricated a polarized scintillator pair by assembling chiral scintillator crystals, which provides a new strategy to attenuate optical crosstalk between the scintillators by precisely controlling the radioluminescence propagation and improves the X&#8208;ray imaging quality at the boundary region.

         <title>Giant Multi&#8208;Photon Absorption by Heptazine Organometalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organometallic donors covalently attached to an s&#8208;heptazine acceptor afford photo&#8208;stable materials that possess outstanding three&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;sections in the technologically important near&#8208;infrared III region of the spectrum, and exceptional four&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;sections in the recently proposed 2080&#8211;2340&#8197;nm window.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;photon absorption (MPA) is of increasing interest for applications in technologically important &#8220;windows&#8221; of the electromagnetic spectrum (near&#8208;infrared III, NIR&#8208;III, 1550&#8211;1870&#8197;nm; and the new 2080&#8211;2340&#8197;nm region); however, few molecules exist that display strong MPA at these long wavelengths. We herein report the syntheses of the first 2,5,8&#8208;s&#8208;heptazine&#8208;cored organometallic complexes, together with organic analogues. The complexes exhibit outstanding 3PA cross&#8208;sections in the NIR&#8208;III and exceptional 4PA cross&#8208;sections in the new 2080&#8211;2340&#8197;nm window. We demonstrate that replacing organic donor groups by organometallic units results in an order of magnitude increase in 3PA, the &#8220;switching on&#8221; of 4PA, and a dramatic improvement in photo&#8208;stability. Our results highlight the impressive outcomes possible with an &#8220;organometalation&#8221; approach to NLO materials design.

         <title>Desymmetric Cyanosilylation of Acyclic 1,3&#8208;Diketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bifunctional complex containing both a hydrogen bond donor and a Lewis acidic magnesium center was discovered to be a stereoselective cyanosilylation catalyst for structurally flexible acyclic 1,3&#8208;diketones. Stereochemically defined vicinal tertiary and quaternary stereocenters can be obtained and further derived to polyfunctionalized molecules.







Abstract
Diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective construction of vicinal stereocenters from easily available starting materials is a challenging task. Here, we report that a bifunctional catalyst prepared from dibutylmagnesium and a pipecolinol&#8208;derived tetradentate ligand can enable an asymmetric cyanosilylation of 1,3&#8208;diketones to forge a pair of neighboring and acyclic tetrasubstituted carbons. The high stereoselectivity results from the rigid conformation of the diketone in the catalyst pocket, where the Lewis acidic magnesium center, together with the free hydroxyl group as a putative hydrogen bond donor, bind with both carbonyls. Consequently, stereochemically well&#8208;defined cyanohydrin silyl ethers with a diverse collection of substituents were prepared. Their rapid derivatization to molecules of higher complexity, such as heterocycles, triols, and fused rings, were also demonstrated.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a silyliumylidene cation complex stabilized by a Ni0&#8208;based donating ligand is reported. Experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that the highly electrophilic SiII center is stabilized by a dative Ni&#8594;Si &#963;&#8208;interaction and &#960;&#8208;donations from the amino&#8208; and Ni&#8208;moieties. Due to the energetically close frontier orbitals localized on Si and Ni atoms, this silyliumylidene complex presents competitive reactivity at Si and Ni sites.

         <title>Chemical Investigations of Differentially Oxidized Polycylic Pyrroles from Bipolaris Fungi: Synthetic Entry Into the Bipolamine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibacterial alkaloids from Bipolaris Fungi represent notable challenges to the field of chemical synthesis owing to their reactive, electron&#8208;rich bispyrrole architectures. Herein we explore the chemical reactivity of this unusual alkaloid framework resulting in the total synthesis of bipolamines D, E, G, and I and a discussion surrounding possible biosynthetic relationships within this family.







Abstract
indolizidine alkaloids of unusual biosynthetic origin have recently been characterized from several species of fungi within the Pleosporaceae family. Possessing distinct polycyclic architectures with two embedded electron&#8208;rich pyrroles as well as reported antibacterial activity against gram positive and negative pathogens, these natural products represent attractive targets for total synthesis. Herein we survey the differential functionalization of a chemically sensitive bispyrrole framework resulting in the preparation of multiple bipolamine alkaloids, work which sheds light on their innate chemical reactivity and potential biosynthetic relationships.

         <title>On the Bonding Nature in the Crystalline Tri&#8208;Thorium Cluster: Core&#8208;Shell Syngenetic &#963;&#8208;Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell syngenetic bonding model is proposed to describe the chemical bond in a stable crystalline tri&#8208;thorium cluster. It involves a 3c&#8211;2e Th3 core bond and a multicenter (ThCl2)3 charge&#8208;shift bond with 12 electrons scattering along the outer shell. The resonance energies and extra cyclic resonance energies from the BLW method further confirm that this novel 3c&#8211;2e Th3 core bond is delocalized and &#963;&#8208;aromatic.







Abstract
A unique thorium&#8208;thorium bond was observed in the crystalline tri&#8208;thorium cluster [{Th(&#951;8&#8208;C8H8)(&#956;3&#8208;Cl)2}3{K(THF)2}2]&#8734;, though the claim of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity for Th3 bond has been questioned. Herein, a new type of core&#8211;shell syngenetic bonding model is proposed to describe the stability of this tri&#8208;thorium cluster. The model involves a 3c&#8211;2e bond in the Th3 core and a multicentered (ThCl2)3 charge&#8208;shift bond with 12 electrons scattering along the outer shell. To differentiate the strengths of the 3c&#8211;2e bond and the charge&#8208;shift bond, the block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method which falls into the ab initio valence bond (VB) theory is employed to construct a strictly core/shell localized state and its contributing covalent resonance structure for the Th3 core bond. By comparing with the &#963;&#8208;aromatic H3+ and nonaromatic Li3+, the computed resonance energies and extra cyclic resonance energies confirm that this Th3 core bond is truly delocalized and &#963;&#8208;aromatic.

         <title>Enantioselective Dearomative Cyclization Enabled by Asymmetric Cooperative Gold Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Gold&#8208;ligand cooperation permits catalytic enantioselective dearomatization of 1&#8208;naphthols, 2&#8208;naphthols, and phenols. This work is facilitated by the development of a divergent synthesis of chiral bifunctional binaphthyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphine ligands. Enantiomeric excesses up to 98&#8201;% are realized. DFT calculations lend support to the cooperative nature of the catalysis and the observed stereochemical outcome.







Abstract
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dearomatization is achieved via metal&#8208;chiral ligand cooperation. A new and divergent synthesis of chiral bifunctional binaphthyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphines is developed to allow rapid access to these ligands, which in turn facilitate the application of this chemistry to a broad substrate scope including 1&#8208;naphthols, 2&#8208;naphthols, and phenols. Enantiomeric excesses up to 98&#8201;% are achieved via selective acceleration of one enantiomer formation enabled by hydrogen bonding between substrate and ligand remote basic group. DFT calculations lend support to the cooperative catalysis and substantiate the reaction stereochemical outcomes.

Enantiomeric excesses up to 98&#8201;% are achieved via selective acceleration of one enantiomer formation enabled by hydrogen bonding between substrate and ligand remote basic group. DFT calculations lend support to the cooperative catalysis and substantiate the reaction stereochemical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Piezochromic Tetracoordinate Boron Complex: Blue&#8208;Shifted and Enhanced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetracoordinate boron complex shows polymorphism&#8208;dependent luminescence. Impressively, Y&#8208;phase crystals showed rare piezochromic luminescent properties: pressure&#8208;induced blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced emission. This phenomenon is due to a cooperative effect between the restriction of intramolecular motions and changes in the charge&#8208;transfer behavior during compression.







Abstract
Achieving blueshifted and enhanced emission from purely organic luminophors remains a major challenge. Herein, we report a tetracoordinate boron complex with polymorphism (Y&#8208;phase and O&#8208;phase)&#8208;dependent luminescence. Impressively, the Y&#8208;phase crystals exhibited rare piezochromic luminescent properties such as pressure&#8208;induced blue&#8208;shifted and enhanced emission. The results of theoretical and experimental tests demonstrated that this phenomenon results from the cooperative effect between the restriction of intramolecular motions and alterable charge transfer (CT) behavior during compression. This work provides an ideal model to investigate the optoelectronic properties of boron complexes. Importantly, manipulating the CT behavior through the electrophilicity of boron atoms may become a new principle for the design of piezochromic materials with blueshifted and enhanced emission.

         <title>Multifunctional Charge and Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Effects of Second&#8208;Sphere Imidazolium Pendants Promote Capture and Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 in Water Catalyzed by Iron Porphyrins
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron porphyrins decorated with imidazolium (im) pendants enable the disentangling of second&#8208;sphere contributions that stem from through&#8208;space charge and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Charge effects are the dominant contributor to observed improvements in CO2 conversion with hydrogen bonding effects augmenting CO2 capture affinity, resulting in effective homogeneous electrocatalytic CO2RR in water.







Abstract
Microenvironments tailored by multifunctional secondary coordination sphere groups can enhance catalytic performance at primary metal active sites in natural systems. Here, we capture this biological concept in synthetic systems by developing a family of iron porphyrins decorated with imidazolium (im) pendants for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), which promotes multiple synergistic effects to enhance CO2RR and enables the disentangling of second&#8208;sphere contributions that stem from each type of interaction. Fe&#8208;ortho&#8208;im(H), which poises imidazolium units featuring both positive charge and hydrogen&#8208;bond capabilities proximal to the active iron center, increases CO2 binding affinity by 25&#8208;fold and CO2RR activity by 2000&#8208;fold relative to the parent Fe tetraphenylporphyrin (Fe&#8208;TPP). Comparison with monofunctional analogs reveals that through&#8208;space charge effects have a greater impact on catalytic CO2RR performance compared to hydrogen bonding in this context.

         <title>Facile Conversion of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids into &#945;&#8208;Amino Phosphonates by Decarboxylative Phosphorylation using Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facile conversion of &#945;&#8208;amino acids to the respective &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonates via their redox active esters using organophotoredox catalysis is reported. A novel photocatalytic phosphorylation combines radical&#8211;polar crossover with Arbuzov&#8208;type reactivity, providing an operationally simple, high yielding and general synthetic approach for the generation of &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonates.







Abstract
Amino phosphonates exhibit potent inhibitory activity for a wide range of biological processes due to their specific structural and electronic properties, making them important in a plethora of applications, including as enzyme inhibitors, herbicides, antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal agents. While the traditional synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonates has relied on the multicomponent Kabachnik&#8208;Fields reaction, we herein describe a novel and facile conversion of activated derivatives of &#945;&#8208;amino acids directly to their respective &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonate counterparts via a decarboxylative radical&#8211;polar crossover process enabled by the use of visible&#8208;light organophotocatalysis. The novel method shows broad applicability across a range of natural and synthetic amino acids, operates under mild conditions, and has been demonstrated to successfully achieve the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence in a M&#246;bius Helicene Carbon Nanohoop

M&#246;bius helicene nanohoop: A chiral helicene carbon nanohoop with M&#246;bius topology is obtained by integrating stereogenic [6]helicene unit with a planar &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation into radially&#8208;conjugated [7]cycloparaphenylene. The new carbon nanohoop preserves the favorable optoelectronic properties typical for cycloparaphenylenes while [6]helicene endows it with configurational stability and chiroptical properties, such as circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
We present the first helicene carbon nanoohop that integrates a [6]helicene into [7]cycloparaphenylene. The [6]helicene endows the helicene carbon nanohoop with chiroptical properties and configurational stability typical for higher helicenes, while the radially conjugated seven para&#8208;phenylenes largely determine the optoelectronic properties. The structure of the helicene carbon nanoohop was unambiguously characterized by NMR, MS and X&#8208;ray analysis that revealed that it possesses a topology of a M&#246;bius strip in the solid state and in solution. The chirality transfers from the [6]helicene to the para&#8208;phenylenes and leads to a pronounced circular dichroism and bright circularly polarized luminescence, which is affected by the structural topology of the nanohoop.

         <title>Reactions of Frustrated Lewis Pairs with Chloro&#8208;Diazirines: Cleavage of N=N Double Bonds</title>

While the reactions of FLPs with diazomethanes are known to lead to rapid loss of N2, reactions of phosphine/borane FLPs with chlorodiazirines prompt N=N double bond cleavage, affording linked phosphinimide/amidoborate zwitterions of the general form R3PNC(Ar)NR&#8242;BX(C6F5)2. A detailed DFT mechanistic study shows that these reactions proceed via FLP addition to the N=N bond.







Abstract
The reactions of FLPs with diazomethanes leads to the rapid loss of N2. In contrast, in this work, we reported reactions of phosphine/borane FLPs with chlorodiazirines which led to the reduction of the N=N double bond, affording linked phosphinimide/amidoborate zwitterions of the general form R3PNC(Ar)NR&#8242;BX(C6F5)2. A detailed DFT mechanistic study showed that these reactions proceed via FLP addition to the N=N bond, followed by subsequent group transfer reactions to nitrogen and capture of the halide anion.

&lt;p&gt;While the reactions of FLPs with diazomethanes are known to lead to rapid loss of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, reactions of phosphine/borane FLPs with chlorodiazirines prompt N=N double bond cleavage, affording linked phosphinimide/amidoborate zwitterions of the general form R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PNC(Ar)NR&#8242;BX(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A detailed DFT mechanistic study shows that these reactions proceed via FLP addition to the N=N bond.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reactions of FLPs with diazomethanes leads to the rapid loss of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In contrast, in this work, we reported reactions of phosphine/borane FLPs with chlorodiazirines which led to the reduction of the N=N double bond, affording linked phosphinimide/amidoborate zwitterions of the general form R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PNC(Ar)NR&#8242;BX(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A detailed DFT mechanistic study showed that these reactions proceed via FLP addition to the N=N bond, followed by subsequent group transfer reactions to nitrogen and capture of the halide anion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Printed CO2&#8208;Based Triblock Copolymers and Post&#8208;Printing Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Degradable CO2&#8208;based triblock polycarbonates with tailored thermal and mechanical properties were synthesized via a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy. By dispersing NaCl particles in polymer solutions, thixotropic inks can be formulated and 3D printed. Subsequent removal of the filler yields porous structures. The alkene pendant groups on the polymer backbone can be further modified via UV&#8208; induced thiol&#8208;ene surface functionalization and crosslinking.







Abstract
We report the facile synthesis and 3D printing of a series of triblock copolymers consisting of soft and hard blocks and demonstrate that alkene pendant groups of the hard block can be covalently modified. The polymers are prepared using a salenCo(III)TFA/PPNTFA binary catalyst system and 1,2&#8208;propanediol as a chain transfer agent, providing an efficient one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy to tailor polymer thermal and mechanical properties. Thixotropic inks suitable for direct ink write printing were formulated by dissolving the block copolymers in organic solvent and dispersing NaCl particles. After printing, porous structures were produced by removing solvent and NaCl with water to give printed structures with surfaces that could be modified via UV&#8208;initiated thiol&#8208;ene click reactions. Alternatively, a tetra&#8208;thiol could be incorporated into the ink and used for cross&#8208;linking to give objects with high solvent resistance and selective degradability.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Encoded Bead&#8208;Based Immunoassay with Tunable Detection Range for COVID&#8208;19 Serum Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiplexed strategy for chip&#8208;based sandwich immunoassays integrated with color/size dual&#8208;barcoded beads and rolling circle amplification (RCA) is presented. RCA based on beads of various sizes allows for a tunable detection range from pg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 to &#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1.







Abstract
Serological assay for coronavirus 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) patients including asymptomatic cases can inform on disease progression and prognosis. A detection method taking into account multiplex, high sensitivity, and a wider detection range will help to identify and treat COVID&#8208;19. Here we integrated color&#8208;size dual&#8208;encoded beads and rolling circle amplification (RCA) into a bead&#8208;based fluorescence immunoassay implemented in a size sorting chip to achieve high&#8208;throughput and sensitive detection. We used the assay for quantifying COVID&#8208;19 antibodies against spike S1, nucleocapsid, the receptor binding domain antigens. It also detected inflammatory biomarkers including interleukin&#8208;6, interleukin&#8208;1&#946;, procalcitonin, C&#8208;reactive protein whose concentrations range from pg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 to &#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1. Use of different size beads integrating with RCA results in a tunable detection range. The assay can be readily modified to simultaneously measure more COVID&#8208;19 serological molecules differing by orders of magnitude.

         <title>A Ratiometric Photoacoustic Probe with a Reversible Response to Hydrogen Sulfide and Hydroxyl Radicals for Dynamic Imaging of Liver Inflammation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible ratiometric photoacoustic (PA) imaging probe is designed, which shows a reversible switch in the PA ratio (PA690/PA825) in response to the redox cycle between &#8901;OH and H2S. The probe allows the non&#8208;invasive and dynamic imaging of the redox fluctuation in mice during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced liver inflammation and the subsequent N&#8208;acetyl cysteine (NAC)&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;inflammation process.







Abstract
Reversible imaging probes that allow for the dynamic visualization of the redox cycle between hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are vital to probe the redox imbalance&#8208;involved pathological process in vivo. Herein, we report a reversible ratiometric photoacoustic (PA) imaging nanoprobe (1&#8208;PAIN) for the real&#8208;time imaging of &#8901;OH/H2S redox cycle in vivo. 1&#8208;PAIN displays a low PA ratio between 690 and 825&#8197;nm (PA690/PA825), which significantly increases by &#8776;5&#8208;fold upon oxidation by &#8901;OH, and is switched back to the initially low PA690/PA825 value upon reduction by H2S. 1&#8208;PAIN could dynamically report on the hepatic &#8901;OH production in mice during the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced liver inflammation process, and visualize hepatic H2S generation during the N&#8208;acetyl cysteine (NAC)&#8208;induced anti&#8208;inflammation process. 1&#8208;PAIN can act as a useful tool to probe the redox state in living biology, beneficial for the study of redox imbalance&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Cytochrome P450Blt Enables Versatile Peptide Cyclisation to Generate Histidine&#8208; and Tyrosine&#8208;Containing Crosslinked Tripeptide Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 37, September 12, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytochrome&#8197;P450Blt generates A&#8722;N&#8722;B and A&#8722;O&#8722;B crosslinked tripeptides within MRYxH and MRYxW peptides. Removal of the minimal leader peptide allows isolation of these cyclic tripeptides, with sequences further varied by incorporation of a range of residues at the position within the cyclic tripeptide. Biarylitide P450s therefore show potential as biocatalysts for the generation of a diverse range of cyclic tripeptide building blocks.







Abstract
We report our investigation of the utility of peptide crosslinking cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzymes from biarylitide biosynthesis to generate a range of cyclic tripeptides from simple synthons. The crosslinked tripeptides produced by this P450 include both tyrosine&#8208;histidine (A&#8722;N&#8722;B) and tyrosine&#8208;tryptophan (A&#8722;O&#8722;B) crosslinked tripeptides, the latter a rare example of a phenolic crosslink to an indole moiety. Tripeptides are easily isolated following proteolytic removal of the leader peptide and can incorporate a wide range of amino acids in the residue inside the crosslinked tripeptide. Given the utility of peptide crosslinks in important natural products and the synthetic challenge that these can represent, P450 enzymes have the potential to play roles as important tools in the generation of high&#8208;value cyclic tripeptides for incorporation in synthesis, which can be yet further diversified using selective chemical techniques through specific handles contained within these tripeptides.

         <title>Tetrazine Linkers as Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Tags for General Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Functionalization and C60 Conjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous UiO&#8208;68 tetrazine metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is used for post&#8208;synthetic ligation chemistry. The central tetrazine rings act as tags for straightforward framework functionalization by a one&#8208;step reaction with alkene, alkyne dienophiles or fullerene. This approach respects the structural integrity of the parent MOF and offers opportunities for functionalization as well as the integration of C60 in crystalline materials.







Abstract
The value of covalent post&#8208;synthetic modification in expanding the chemistry and pore versatility of reticular solids is well documented. Here we use mesoporous crystals of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) UiO&#8208;68&#8208;TZDC to demonstrate the value of tetrazine connectors for all&#8208;purpose inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder ligation chemistry. Our results suggest a positive effect of tetrazine reticulation over its reactivity for quantitative one&#8208;step functionalization with a broad scope of alkene or alkyne dienophiles into pyridazine and dihydropyridazine frameworks. This permits generating multiple pore environments with diverse chemical functionalities and the expected accessible porosities, that is also extended to the synthesis of crystalline fulleretic materials by covalent conjugation of fullerene molecules.

         <title>Fiber&#8208;spinning Asymmetric Assembly for Janus&#8208;structured Bifunctional Nanofiber Films towards All&#8208;Weather Smart Textile</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermally selective AgNW/rGO/PVDF&#8208;HFP laminated nanofiber film with Janus structure is prepared by fiber&#8208;spinning asymmetric chemical assembly method. The two sides of AgNW/rGO/PVDF&#8208;HFP reveal different photothermal performances. Such lightweight, breathable and conductive nanofiber&#8208;hybrid textile enables applications in thermoregulatory garments that possess the performances of heat preservation in winter and cooling in summer.







Abstract
Given health threat by global warming and increased energy consumption in regulating body temperature, it is an urgent need to construct smart temperature&#8208;regulating materials. Herein, a novel fiber&#8208;spinning asymmetric chemical assembly (FACA) method is proposed to construct nanofiber materials with asymmetric photothermal properties. The silver nanowires (AgNWs) and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) with opposite thermal radiation are assembled on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) film, imparting AgNW/rGO/PVDF&#8208;HFP film with Janus structure that can realize the AgNWs side consistently keeps temperature of ca. 11&#8201;&#176;C lower than the side of PVDF&#8208;HFP nanofiber regardless of the irradiation directions under 1 sun, suggesting the adjustable photothermal regulation. Such photothermally selective hybrid nanofiber film provides great potential as fabrics to achieve all&#8208;weather smart clothes, promoting controllable and comprehensive utilization of solar energy.

         <title>How Subtle Changes Can Make a Difference: Reproducibility in Complex Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of complex systems often coincides with difficult preparation protocols and narrow windows of suitable conditions. In this Scientific Perspective, we report on unexpected observations made in our group that highlight the impact of subtle &#8220;irregularities&#8221; on supramolecular systems. We draw attention to often overlooked details and aim to initiate an open discussion on reproducibility in supramolecular chemistry.







Abstract
The desire to construct complex molecular systems is driven by the need for technological (r)evolution and our intrinsic curiosity to comprehend the origin of life. Supramolecular chemists tackle this challenge by combining covalent and noncovalent reactions leading to multicomponent systems with emerging complexity. However, this synthetic strategy often coincides with difficult preparation protocols and a narrow window of suitable conditions. Here, we report on unsuspected observations of our group that highlight the impact of subtle &#8220;irregularities&#8221; on supramolecular systems. Based on the effects of pathway complexity, minute amounts of water in organic solvents or small impurities in the supramolecular building block, we discuss potential pitfalls in the study of complex systems. This article is intended to draw attention to often overlooked details and to initiate an open discussion on the importance of reporting experimental details to increase reproducibility in supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Construction of Ultrastable Nonsubstituted Quinoline&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Frameworks via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidant&#8208;free locking of a dynamic imine bridge to construct the ultrastable nonsubstituted quinoline&#8208;linked COFs via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation is reported. This methodology features high efficiency, generality, retention of crystallinity and topology. The enhanced in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation facilitates photocatalytic organic transformations mediated by superoxide anion radicals.







Abstract
Exploring new routes to lock the dynamic C=N bonds in imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is highly desired for enhancing their stability and functionality. Herein, a novel C=N bridge locking strategy via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] annulation is developed to construct nonsubstituted quinoline&#8208;linked COFs (NQ&#8208;COFs). The notable feature of this strategy includes high C=N conversion efficiency, oxidant&#8208;free, and generality for synthesis of a variety of NQ&#8208;COFs with high chemical stability. Particularly, after post&#8208;synthetic modification, the crystallinity, topology, and porosity of pristine imine&#8208;linked COFs are well retained. When used as photocatalysts, NQ&#8208;COFs display better visible light absorption and carriers&#8217; separation efficiency due to enhanced in&#8208;plane &#960; conjugation ability, as well as more facile generation of superoxide anion radicals than their counterparts, thus leading to efficient synthesis of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(aryl)pyridines, benzimidazole, and sulfoxide derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;Exploring new routes to lock the dynamic C=N bonds in imine-linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is highly desired for enhancing their stability and functionality. Herein, a novel C=N bridge locking strategy via rhodium-catalyzed [4+2] annulation is developed to construct nonsubstituted quinoline-linked COFs (NQ-COFs). The notable feature of this strategy includes high C=N conversion efficiency, oxidant-free, and generality for synthesis of a variety of NQ-COFs with high chemical stability. Particularly, after post-synthetic modification, the crystallinity, topology, and porosity of pristine imine-linked COFs are well retained. When used as photocatalysts, NQ-COFs display better visible light absorption and carriers&#8217; separation efficiency due to enhanced in-plane &#960; conjugation ability, as well as more facile generation of superoxide anion radicals than their counterparts, thus leading to efficient synthesis of 2,4,6-tris(aryl)pyridines, benzimidazole, and sulfoxide derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multistate Circularly Polarized Luminescence Switching through Stimuli&#8208;Induced Co&#8208;Conformation Regulations of Pyrene&#8208;Functionalized Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using topologically chiral [2]catenanes as not only the chiral platform but also the switching scaffold, the first construction of a novel bidirectional circularly polarized luminescence switching system was successfully realized.







Abstract
Aiming at the construction of novel circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches with multiple switchable emission states and high dissymmetry factors (glum), topologically chiral [2]catenanes were employed as the key platform to construct a novel multistate CPL switching system. Taking advantage of the precise co&#8208;conformation regulations of the resultant pyrene&#8208;functionalized [2]catenanes under different external stimuli, reversible transformations between three emission states with different CPL performances, i.e. the initial &#8220;closed&#8221; form with a |glum| value of 0.012, the &#8220;open&#8221; form with an almost complete turn&#8208;off of CPL emission, and the &#8220;protonated&#8221; form with a boosted |glum| value of 0.022, were successfully realized. This study demonstrates the successful construction of not only the first topological chirality&#8208;based CPL switch, but also a novel bidirectional CPL switch, thus providing a promising platform for the construction of novel chiral materials.

         <title>Non&#8208;Flammable Ester Electrolyte with Boosted Stability Against Li for High&#8208;Performance Li metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte with NO3&#8722; readily involved in the Li+ solvation sheath that reduces the polarity of solvent and therefore boosts the stability of electrolyte against Li metal. The electrolyte has low viscosity, high ionic conductivity and is low cost. The Li plating/stripping reversibility in Li&#8208;Cu cell was improved to 99.49&#8201;%.







Abstract
In traditional non&#8208;flammable electrolytes a trade&#8208;off always exists between non&#8208;flammability and battery performance. Previous research focused on reducing free solvents and forming anion&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase. However, the contribution of solvated anions in boosting the stability of electrolyte has been overlooked. Here, we resolve this via introducing anions into Li+ solvation sheaths using anions with similar Gutmann donor number (DN) to that of solvents. Taking trimethyl phosphate fire&#8208;retardant (DN=23.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and NO3&#8722; (DN=22.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) as an example, NO3&#8722; is readily involved in the Li+ solvation sheath and reduces the polarity of solvent. This results in boosted stability of electrolyte against Li. The developed non&#8208;flammable electrolyte has low viscosity, high ionic conductivity and is low cost. The reversibility of Li&#8208;Cu cell was improved to 99.49&#8201;% and the lifespan of practical LMBs was extended by &gt;100&#8201;%.

         <title>The N&#1013;&#8208;Rule for Serine, but Not Cysteine Catalytic Triads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serine&#8208;containing catalytic triads are almost exclusively N&#1013;&#8208;configured (the histidine N&#1013; atom is next to the nucleophile). This is in stark contrast to cysteine catalytic triads (and noncatalytic triads). It is argued that the effect stems from the pKa difference of the histidine nitrogen atoms. The N&#1013;&#8208;triads are evolutionarily selected for at the cost of stability to help overcome the much larger Ser&#8208;His pKa gradient than that of the Cys&#8208;His pair.Serine&#8208;containing catalytic triads are almost exclusively N&#1013;&#8208;configured (the histidine N&#1013; atom is next to the nucleophile).

Abstract
Catalytic triads, composed of a serine or cysteine nucleophile, a histidine, and a third triad residue (typically Asp/Glu/Asn), are common in enzyme active sites and catalyze a wide variety of chemical reactions. Two types of triads can be distinguished: We refer to them as N&#948;&#8208; or N&#1013;&#8208;configured, depending on whether the histidine imidazole N&#948; or N&#1013; atom is close to the nucleophile O&#947;/S&#947;. In this study, we have analyzed triad configuration. In structural triads, the more stable N&#948;&#8208;configuration predominates. For catalytic triads, the configuration depends on the nucleophile. When it is a cysteine residue, both configuration types occur, depending on the family. However, when the nucleophile is a serine residue, the less stable N&#1013;&#8208;configuration is almost exclusively found. We posit that the energetically less favored conformation is selected for in serine triads to facilitate the otherwise difficult proton transfer from the nucleophile to the histidine residue.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Single Au Atoms on Ultrathin ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction towards CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single Au atoms in Au1&#8208;S2 low&#8208;coordination structure on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets were prepared by a rational complex&#8208;exchange route. Endowed with much faster interfacial electron transfer from [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 photosensitizer and more appropriate binding strength with *CO intermediates, low&#8208;coordination single Au atoms surpass Au nanoparticles counterpart in CO2 photoreduction, leading to CH4 product with both high activity and selectivity.







Abstract
Selective CO2 photoreduction to hydrocarbon fuels such as CH4 is promising and sustainable for carbon&#8208;neutral future. However, lack of proper binding strengths with reaction intermediates makes it still a challenge for photocatalytic CO2 methanation with both high activity and selectivity. Here, low&#8208;coordination single Au atoms (Au1&#8208;S2) on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets was synthesized by a complex&#8208;exchange route, enabling exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. Under visible light irradiation, Au1/ZnIn2S4 catalyst exhibits a CH4 yield of 275&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity as high as 77&#8201;%. As revealed by detailed characterizations and density functional theory calculations, Au1/ZnIn2S4 with Au1&#8208;S2 structure not only display fast carrier transfer to underpin its superior activity, but also greatly reduce the energy barrier for protonation of *CO and stabilize the *CH3 intermediate, thereby leading to the selective CH4 generation from CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>Stereoselective Three&#8208;Step One&#8208;Pot Cascade Combining Amino&#8208; and Biocatalysis to Access Chiral &#947;&#8208;Nitro Alcohols
</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemoenzymatic cascades offer a simple and efficient way to rapidly build structural complexity. A three&#8208;step one&#8208;pot process is reported in which a Wittig reaction, chiral&#8208;thiourea&#8208;mediated asymmetric conjugate addition, and a bioreduction step were combined to access chiral nitro alcohols from commercially available benzaldehyde derivatives in good overall yields and excellent diastereomeric and enantiomeric ratios.







Abstract
The combination of small&#8208;molecule catalysis and enzyme catalysis represents an underexploited area of research with huge potential in asymmetric synthetic chemistry due to both compatibility of reaction conditions and complementary reactivity. Herein, we describe the telescopic synthesis of chiral nitro alcohols starting from commercially available benzaldehyde derivatives through the one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step chemoenzymatic cascade combination of a Wittig reaction, chiral&#8208;thiourea&#8208;catalysed asymmetric conjugate addition, and ketoreductase&#8208;mediated reduction to access the corresponding target compounds in moderate to excellent overall isolated yields (36&#8211;80&#8201;%) and high diastereomeric and enantiomeric ratios (up to &gt;97&#8201;:&#8201;3). This represents the first example of the combination of an organocatalysed asymmetric conjugate addition via iminium ion activation and a bioreduction step catalysed by ketoreductases.

         <title>Photocatalytic Direct Decarboxylation of Carboxylic Acids to Derivatize or Degrade Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light&#8208;driven direct decarboxylation of carboxylic acid side chains in macromolecules was explored as a robust post&#8208;polymerization modification strategy. Multiple transformations of copolymers were achieved, including derivatization with olefin units, functionalization with pendent alkenes, and backbone degradation. These decarboxylative processes were rapid, selective, and displayed high atom economy.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;mediated direct decarboxylation of carboxylic acids with an acridine photocatalyst is a convenient and powerful method to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals in polymer chains. Advantageously, this process proceeds under mild conditions, without preactivation of the acid groups. We utilize decarboxylation in the presence of a hydrogen atom donor to form statistical acrylate&#8208;ethylene and acrylate&#8208;propylene copolymers, which are challenging to obtain by direct polymerization. We additionally show that decarboxylation of methacrylic acid units within polymethacrylates can trigger degradation of the polymer backbones. Moreover, a dual catalytic approach, which combines the function of an acridine photocatalyst with that of a cobaloxime catalyst, is leveraged to furnish unique copolymers with pendent alkenes. Our work indicates that direct decarboxylation is a versatile technique for the synthesis of functional materials with tailored compositions and properties.

         <title>Chemically Driven Rotatory Molecular Machines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The possibility of generating unidirectional, controlled rotary motion by chemical conversion is a major challenge. This Review provides an overview of approaches to the design, synthesis, and dynamic properties of various classes of atropisomers that can perform controlled switching or directional rotational motion under the influence of a chemical stimulus. Future strategies and challenges for the development of autonomous molecular motors are also provided.







Abstract
Molecular machines are at the frontier of biology and chemistry. The ability to control molecular motion and emulating the movement of biological systems are major steps towards the development of responsive and adaptive materials. Amazing progress has been seen for the design of molecular machines including light&#8208;induced unidirectional rotation of overcrowded alkenes. However, the feasibility of inducing unidirectional rotation about a single bond as a result of chemical conversion has been a challenging task. In this Review, an overview of approaches towards the design, synthesis, and dynamic properties of different classes of atropisomers which can undergo controlled switching or rotation under the influence of a chemical stimulus is presented. They are categorized as molecular switches, rotors, motors, and autonomous motors according to their type of response. Furthermore, we provide a future perspective and challenges focusing on building sophisticated molecular machines.

         <title>Tailoring Bond Microenvironments and Reaction Pathways of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disclosing the structure&#8211;reactivity relationships of single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) in water electrolysis is critical to guide the future design, performance optimization, and broad applications of single&#8208;atom catalysts. This Review summarizes the most recent progress in tailoring the bond microenvironment of single&#8208;atom catalysts on different supports and discusses the reaction pathways, mechanisms, and performance advantages of different SAS structures for water electrolysis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) are commonly stabilized and influenced by neighboring atoms in the host; disclosing the structure&#8211;reactivity relationships of SASs in water electrolysis is one of the grand challenges originating from the tremendous wealth of support materials with complex structures. Through a multidisciplinary view of the design principles, synthesis strategies, characterization techniques, and theoretical analysis of structure&#8211;performance correlations, this timely Review is dedicated to summarizing the most recent progress in tailoring bond microenvironments on different supports and discussing the reaction pathways and performance advantages of different SAS structures for water electrolysis. The essence and mechanisms of how SAS structures influence electrocatalysis and the critical requirements for future developments are discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are also provided to stimulate the practical, widespread utilization of SAS catalysts in water&#8208;splitting electrolyzers.

         <title>Reconstruction of Highly Dense Cu&#8722;N4 Active Sites in Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Characterized by Operando Synchrotron Radiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando synchrotron radiation identifies the reconstruction process of highly dense Cu&#8722;N4 sites transform to Cu&#8722;N4/Cu&#8208;nanoclusters (NC) and then to Cu&#8722;N3/Cu&#8722;NC under potential&#8208;driver, which could regulate the d&#8208;band center of metal atom and balance the competition of rate&#8208;determining step for ORR, thus optimizing the electrocatalytic activity and anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell performance.







Abstract
The emerging star of single atomic site (SAS) catalyst has been regarded as the most promising Pt&#8208;substituted electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). However, the metal loading in SAS directly affects the whole device performance. Herein, we report a dual nitrogen source coordinated strategy to realize high dense Cu&#8722;N4 SAS with a metal loading of 5.61&#8197;wt% supported on 3D N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes/graphene structure wherein simultaneously performs superior ORR activity and stability in alkaline media. When applied in H2/O2 AEMFC, it could reach an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.90&#8197;V and a peak power density of 324&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Operando synchrotron radiation analyses identify the reconstruction from initial Cu&#8722;N4 to Cu&#8722;N4/Cu&#8208;nanoclusters (NC) and the subsequent Cu&#8722;N3/Cu&#8722;NC under working conditions, which gradually regulate the d&#8208;band center of central metal and balance the Gibbs free energy of *OOH and *O intermediates, benefiting to ORR activity.

         <title>Proton Chemistry Induced Long&#8208;Cycle Air Self&#8208;Charging Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An air self&#8208;charging Pb/pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) battery was developed in acidic electrolyte. The Pb/PTO batteries display excellent cycle stability during repeated self&#8208;charging/galvanostatic discharging process because the self&#8208;charging behavior in acidic medium can effectively avoid the formation of basic salts on self&#8208;charging electrode.







Abstract
Air self&#8208;charging aqueous metal&#8208;ion batteries usually suffer from capacity loss after self&#8208;charging cycles due to the formation of basic salts on cathodes in the near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. Here, air self&#8208;charging Pb/pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) batteries based on proton chemistry are developed in acidic electrolyte. The fast kinetics of H+ uptake/removal endows the battery with enhanced electrochemical performance. Owing to the high standard electrode potential of oxygen in acid electrolyte, the discharged cathodes are spontaneously oxidized by oxygen in air along with H+ extraction and thus achieve self&#8208;charging without external power supply. Notably, the air self&#8208;charging mechanism involved H+&#8208;based redox can effectively avoid the generation of basic salts on self&#8208;charging electrodes and thus guarantee long&#8208;term self&#8208;charging/galvanostatic discharging cycles of Pb/PTO batteries. This work provides a promising strategy for designing long&#8208;cycle air self&#8208;charging systems.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Isolation of An Aza&#8208;Triangulene and Its Cation in Crystalline Form</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene and its cation were synthesized and isolated in crystalline form. The cation is an isoelectronic structure of triangulene, showing a triplet ground state with a singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of about 0.84&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
Synthesis of triangulene and its derivatives is challenging due to their intrinsic high spin nature. Herein, we report solution&#8208;phase synthesis and isolation of a nitrogen&#8208;doped triangulene (i.e., aza&#8208;triangulene) (NT) and its cation (NT+) in single&#8208;crystal form. Notably, the cation NT+ can be regarded as an isoelectronic structure of the corresponding all&#8208;carbon triangulene. Both NT and NT+ show reasonable stability due to kinetic blocking by bulky and electron&#8208;withdrawing aryl substituents, and intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interaction. Bond length analysis, magnetic measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that the neutral NT has a doublet ground state with a zwitterionic character, while the cation NT+ exhibits a triplet ground state with a singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of +0.84&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This study provides a rational strategy to access high&#8208;spin systems by heteroatom doping of pure &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Directed Reversal of 13C NMR Chemical Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the reversal of 13C NMR chemical shielding behavior of carbonyl carbon in sulfur and selenium substituted H&#8208;bonded amides. Solution phase NMR spectroscopy corroborated with various computational studies explains the physical origin of such unusual behavior.







Abstract
The deshielding or downfield 13C NMR chemical shift of amide carbonyl carbon upon H&#8208;bonding is a widely observed phenomenon. This downfield shift is commonly used as a spectroscopic ruler for H&#8208;bonding. However, the very first observation of an upfield 13C NMR of thiocarbonyl carbon in thioamides upon H&#8208;bonding encouraged us to explore the physical origin of the reversal of 13C NMR chemical shielding. Careful NMR analysis shows that sulfur and selenium&#8208;centered H&#8208;bonds (S/SeCHBs) induce a shielding effect on the 13CC=S(Se) while changing from amides to thioamides or selenoamides. In addition, natural chemical shielding (NCS) analysis shows that the &#963;11 and &#963;22 components of the isotropic shielding tensor (&#963;) have a crucial role in this unusual shielding.

         <title>Exploiting Coordination Effects for the Regioselective Zincation of Diazines Using TMPZnX&#8901;LiX (X=Cl, Br)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Important N&#8208;heterocycles such as pyrimidines were regioselectively zincated using bimetallic bases of type TMPZnX&#8901;LiX (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl; X=Cl, Br) and subsequently quenched with electrophiles. Trapping of key organometallic intermediates has shed light on their complex solution constitution and helped to explain the high regioselectivity observed as well as the stoichiometry of the base used.







Abstract
A new method for regioselective zincations of challenging N&#8208;heterocyclic substrates such as pyrimidines and pyridazine was reported using bimetallic bases TMPZnX&#8901;LiX (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl; X=Cl, Br). Reactions occurred under mild conditions (25&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C, using 1.75 equivalents of base without additives), furnishing 2&#8208;zincated pyrimidines and 3&#8208;zincated pyridazine, which were then trapped with a variety of electrophiles. Contrasting with other s&#8208;block metalating systems, which lack selectivity in their reactions even when operating at low temperatures, these mixed Li/Zn bases enabled unprecedented regioselectivities that cannot be replicated by either LiTMP nor Zn(TMP)2 on their own. Spectroscopic and structural interrogations of organometallic intermediates involved in these reactions have shed light on the complex constitution of reaction mixtures and the origins of their special reactivities.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Functional Evaluation of IORs, Sulfonolipid&#8208;based Inhibitors of Cell Differentiation in Salpingoeca rosetta</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and modular synthesis of the rosette&#8208;inhibitor sulfonolipid IOR&#8208;1A and chemical probes was achieved via decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of a desymmetrized tartaric acid derivatives and alkyl zinc reagents of choice. Synthesized congeners and bifunctional probes allowed to determine structure&#8208;activity relation to profile binding partners in producer and recipient for the first time.







Abstract
The choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta is an important model system to study the evolution of multicellularity. In this study we developed a new, modular, and scalable synthesis of sulfonolipid IOR&#8208;1A (six steps, 27&#8201;% overall yield), which acts as bacterial inhibitor of rosette formation in S.&#8197;rosetta. The synthesis features a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of a sulfonic acid&#8208;containing tartaric acid derivative with alkyl zinc reagents. Synthesis of 15 modified IOR&#8208;1A derivatives, including fluorescent and photoaffinity&#8208;based probes, allowed quantification of IOR&#8208;1A, localization studies within S.&#8197;rosetta cells, and evaluation of structure&#8208;activity relations. In a proof of concept study, an inhibitory bifunctional probe was employed in proteomic profiling studies, which allowed to deduce binding partners in bacteria and S.&#8197;rosetta. These results showcase the power of synthetic chemistry to decipher the biochemical basis of cell differentiation processes within S.&#8197;rosetta.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Plus Reversible Supramolecular Adhesives Achieved by Regulating Intermolecular PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a new class of reversible supramolecular organoplatinum(II) adhesive systems by integrating adhesive chains with cyclometalated platinum(II) units in the same covalent skeleton. By manipulating intermolecular PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII interactions, the organoplatinum(II) adhesives exhibit stable reversible adhesion even after 100 cycles with a robust strength of &#8776;1.25&#8197;MPa.







Abstract
Surface adhesion has a great contradiction in high strength and good reversibility given their mutually exclusive requirements of fixed crosslinked networks and dynamic chain motion. Herein, we demonstrate a supramolecular organoplatinum(II) adhesive system regulated by intermolecular PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII interactions that can simultaneously achieve high&#8208;strength and excellent reversible adhesion to various substrates. Upon alternating temperature, the assembly of suitably substituted organoplatinum(II) molecules can switch between well&#8208;ordered and disordered states via tuning PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII interactions, resulting in stable reversible adhesion even after 100 cycles with a robust strength of &#8776;1.25&#8197;MPa and a large on&#8208;off ratio of &#8776;25. Along with the switch of PtII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;PtII contacts, the surface adhesion of organoplatinum(II) adhesives can be monitored by their changes in electrical signals. This study will open up new inspirations for developing high&#8208;performance reversible adhesives.

         <title>Synergistic Charge Percolation in Conducting Polymers Enables High&#8208;Performance In Vivo Sensing of Neurochemical and Neuroelectrical Signals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a universal approach that endows conducting polymer (PEDOT:PSS)&#8208;based fiber&#8208;microsensors with an interiorly constructed synergistic charge percolation highway for (i)&#8197;selective and sensitive sensing of a target neurochemical (vitamin C) and (ii)&#8197;high&#8208;fidelity sensing of neuronal activities. This strategy is validated through in vivo applications in the nervous system.







Abstract
Challenges remain in establishing a universal method to precisely tune electrochemical properties of conducting polymers for multifunctional neurosensing with high selectivity and sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate a facile and general approach to achieving synergistic charge percolation in conducting polymers (i.e., poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS) by incorporating conductive catalysts (i.e., carbon nanotubes, CNTs) and post&#8208;processing. The approach shows synergistic effects: (i)&#8197;CNTs and post&#8208;processing together promote PEDOT ordered interconnection for highly efficient charge percolation that accelerates electrochemical kinetics; (ii)&#8197;CNTs catalyze the electrooxidation of vitamin C for selective electrochemical sensing; (iii)&#8197;CNTs enhance the charge storage/injection capacity of PEDOT:PSS. The prepared CNT&#8208;PEDOT:PSS fiber mechanically matches with neural tissues and is proved to be a biocompatible versatile microsensor capable of high&#8208;performance neurosensing in vivo.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Macrocyclic Triangles into Helicity&#8208;Opposite Nanotwists by Competitive Planar over Point Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar chirality emerging from the restriction rotation of achiral edges in macrocyclic triangles containing chiral vertices has led to chiral self&#8208;assembly. In contrast to solution systems, where chiroptical properties are exclusively dominated by the point chiral vertices, the emerging planar chirality arising from intermolecular stacking controls the chiral self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
While helix has elegant biomimetic structures and functionalities, it still remains a big question how the nanoscale helicity evolved from the molecular chiral building blocks across length scales. Herein, macrocyclic triangles composed of achiral edges and chiral vertices were rationally designed, in which the planar chirality emerged due to the restriction of edge rotation by intermolecular stackings and led to a unique chiral self&#8208;assembly. In contrast to the solution systems where the chiroptical property is exclusively dominated by the point chiral vertices, the emerged planar chirality was found to control the chiral self&#8208;assembly, resulting the nanotwist with the handedness determined by the planar chirality. Our work unveiled the self&#8208;assembly behaviors of macrocyclic conformers for the first time and provided a deep understanding on the macrocyclic chirality evolution including the excited&#8208;state chirality.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Chemokine Conjugates for In Vivo Targeting of Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe the first enzyme&#8208;activatable chemokine conjugates for selective targeting of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages in preclinical models of cancer. We demonstrate that this new chemical design is compatible with both fluorescent and therapeutic payloads, opening avenues in the preparation of future theranostic probes for immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.







Abstract
Increased levels of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are indicators of poor prognosis in most cancers. Although antibodies and small molecules blocking the recruitment of macrophages to tumors are under evaluation as anticancer therapies, these strategies are not specific for macrophage subpopulations. Herein we report the first enzyme&#8208;activatable chemokine conjugates for effective targeting of defined macrophage subsets in live tumors. Our constructs exploit the high expression of chemokine receptors (e.g., CCR2) and the activity of cysteine cathepsins in TAMs to target these cells selectively over other macrophages and immune cells (e.g., neutrophils, T cells, B cells). Furthermore, we demonstrate that cathepsin&#8208;activatable chemokines are compatible with both fluorescent and therapeutic cargos, opening new avenues in the design of targeted theranostic probes for immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.
