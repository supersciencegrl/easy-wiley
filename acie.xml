         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Dicarbofunctionalization of Alkynes with Organohalides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the first gold&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;dicarbofunctionalization of alkynes using organohalides as non&#8208;prefunctionalized coupling partners. The mechanism of the reaction involves an oxidative addition/&#960;&#8208;activation mechanism in contrast to the migratory insertion/cis&#8208;trans isomerization pathway that is predominantly observed with other transition metals yielding products with anti&#8208;selectivity. Mechanistic insights include several control experiments, NMR studies, HR&#8208;MSMS analyses, and DFT calculations that strongly support the proposed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Enabled Self&#8208;(3+2) Cyclization of Vinyldiazo Reagents: Synthesis of Cyclopentenyl &#945;&#8208;Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photocatalytic self&#8208;(3+2) cycloaddition of vinyldiazo compounds is described, which provides cyclopentene derivatives with conservation of one diazo functional group. Experimental insights and density functional theory indicate that the reaction is triggered by an unusual single electron oxidation of vinyldiazo compounds, while the photolysis for the generation of free carbene species is not involved. The synthetic applications of the resulting cyclopentenyl &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds were demonstrated based on the rich chemistry of the diazo functional group.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive Phase&#8208;Separating Fluorescent Molecules for Intracellular Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cellular membranes, including the plasma and endosome membranes, are barriers to outside proteins. Various vehicles have been devised to deliver proteins across the plasma membrane, but in many cases, the payload gets trapped in the endosome. Here we designed a photo&#8208;responsive phase&#8208;separating fluorescent molecule (PPFM) with a molecular weight of 666.8 daltons. The PPFM compound condensates as fluorescent droplets in the aqueous solution by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), which disintegrate upon photoirradiation with a 405 nm LED lamp within 20 min or a 405 nm laser within 3 min. The PPFM coacervates recruit a wide range of peptides and proteins and deliver them into mammalian cells. Photolysis disperses the payload from condensates into the cytosolic space. Altogether, a type of small molecules that are photo&#8208;responsive and phase separating are discovered; their coacervates can serve as transmembrane vehicles for intracellular delivery of proteins, whereas photo illumination triggers the cytosolic distribution of the payload.</dc:description>

         <title>An RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNAzyme That Requires an Organic Solvent to Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering functional nucleic acids active under unusual conditions will not only reveal the hidden talents of nucleic acids but also lay groundwork for pursuing them for unique applications. Although many DNAzymes have been derived to catalyze diverse chemical reactions in aqueous solutions, no prior study has been set up to purposely derive DNAzymes that require an organic solvent to function. Herein, we utilized in vitro selection to isolate RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes from a random&#8208;sequence DNA pool that were &#8220;compelled&#8221; to accept 35% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a cosolvent, via counter selection in a purely aqueous solution followed by positive selection in the same solution containing 35% DMSO. This experiment indeed led to the discovery of a new DNAzyme that requires 35% DMSO for its catalytic activity but exhibits drastically reduced activity without DMSO. This DNAzyme also requires divalent metal ions for catalysis and uses monovalent ions for activity enhancement. A minimized, more efficient DNAzyme was also derived. This work demonstrates that highly functional organic solvent&#8208;dependent DNAzymes can be isolated from random&#8208;sequence DNA libraries via forced in vitro selection, thus expanding the capability and potential utility of DNA as enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Thermo&#8208;Driven Azoarene&#8208;Based Circularly Polarized Luminescence Molecular Switch in Liquid Crystal Host</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chiral optical active materials with switchable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals remains a challenge. Here an azoarene&#8208;based circularly polarized luminescence molecular switch, (S, R, S)&#8208;switch 1 and its contrast (R, R, R)&#8208;switch 2, are designed and prepared with (R)&#8208;binaphthyl azo group as a chiral photosensitive moiety and two (S) or (R)&#8208;binaphthyl fluorescent molecules with opposite or same handedness as chiral fluorescent moieties. Both two switches exhibit reversible trans/cis isomerization irradiated by 365 nm UV light and 520 nm green light in solvent and liquid crystal (LC) media. In contrast with the control (R, R, R)&#8208;switch 2, when switch 1 is doped into nematic LCs, the polarization inversion and switching&#8208;off of the CPL signals are achieved in the resultant helical superstructure upon the irradiations of 365 nm UV and 520 nm green light, respectively. Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity of the system is basically unchanged during this switching process. In particular, these variations of the CPL signals could be recovered after heating, realizing the true sense of CPL reversible switching. Taking advantage of the unique CPL switching, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for &#8220;a dual&#8208;optical information encryption system&#8221; based on the above CPL active material is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable One&#8208;Step Assembly of Uniform Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymer &#160;Cylindrical Micelles via&#160;Tailored Nucleation&#8208;Growth Process and Their Applications as Tougheners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of uniform cylindrical nanoobjects from soft materials has attracted tremendous research attention from both fundamental research and practical application points of view but also posed outstanding challenges to their preparation. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step method to assemble cylindrical micelles (CMs) with highly controllable lengths from a single liquid crystalline block copolymer via an in&#8208;situ nucleation&#8208;growth strategy. By adjusting the assembly conditions, the lengths of the CMs are controlled from hundreds of nanometers to microns. Several influencing factors are systematically investigated to comprehensively understand the process. Particularly, the solvent quality is found determinative to either enhance or suppress the nucleation process to produce shorter and longer CMs, respectively. Taking advantage of this strategy, the lengths of CMs can be nicely controlled in a wide concentration range over four magnitudes. Lastly, CMs are produced on decent scales and applied as additives to dramatically toughen glassy plastic matrix, revealing an unprecedented length&#8208;dependent toughening effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Molecular Structure and Confining Environment of an Organometallic Catalyst Heterogenized within Amorphous Porous Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic activity of multifunctional, microporous materials is directly linked to the spatial arrangement of their structural building blocks. Despite great achievements in the design and incorporation of isolated catalytically active metal complexes within such materials, a detailed understanding of their atomic&#8208;level structure and the local environment of the active species remains a fundamental challenge, especially when these latter are hosted in non&#8208;crystalline organic polymers. Here, we show that by combining computational chemistry with pair distribution function analysis, 129Xe NMR and Dynamic Nuclear Polarization enhanced NMR spectroscopy, a very accurate description of the molecular structure and confining surroundings of a catalytically active Rh&#8208;based organometallic complex incorporated inside the cavity of amorphous bipyridine&#8208;based porous polymers is obtained. Small but significant differences in the structural properties of the polymers are highlighted depending on their backbone motifs.</dc:description>

Despite great achievements in the design and incorporation of isolated catalytically active metal complexes within such materials, a detailed understanding of their atomic-level structure and the local environment of the active species remains a fundamental challenge, especially when these latter are hosted in non-crystalline organic polymers. Here, we show that by combining computational chemistry with pair distribution function analysis, 129Xe NMR and Dynamic Nuclear Polarization enhanced NMR spectroscopy, a very accurate description of the molecular structure and confining surroundings of a catalytically active Rh-based organometallic complex incorporated inside the cavity of amorphous bipyridine-based porous polymers is obtained. Small but significant differences in the structural properties of the polymers are highlighted depending on their backbone motifs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosynthesis of Cosmosporasides Reveals the Assembly Line for Fungal Hybrid Terpenoid Saccharides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fungal hybrid terpenoid saccharides constitute a new and growing family of natural products with significant biomedical and agricultural activities. One of the most representative families is cosmosporasides, which feature&#160;hybrid degree of oxidized terpenoid units and saccharide moieties, however, the assembly line of these building blocks is elusive to date. Herein, a cos cluster from Fusarium orthoceras was discovered for the synthesis of cosmosporaside C (1) by genome mining. A UbiA family intramembrane prenyltransferase (UbiA&#8208;type PT), a multifunctional cytochrome P450, an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;hydrolase, an acetyltransferase, a dimethylallyl transferase (DMAT&#8208;type PT) and a glycosyltransferase, function cooperatively in the assembly of the scaffold of 1 using primary central metabolites. In addition, the absolute configurations of C&#8208;4, C&#8208;6 and C&#8208;7 of 1 are also established. Our work importantly clarifies the unexpected functions of UbiA&#8208;type and DMAT&#8208;type PTs and provides an example for understanding the synthetic logic of hybrid terpenoid saccharides in fungi.</dc:description>

         <title>Partial Deoxygenative CO Homocoupling by a Diiron Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diiron of a bis(beta&#8208;diketiminate) cyclophane effects the partially deoxygenative homologation of two CO molecules by two sequential one&#8208;electron reduction and silylation reactions to generate a ketenylidene ligand. The ketenylidene can be readily released from the complex along with retention of the dinuclear metal construct.







Abstract
One route to address climate change is converting carbon dioxide to synthetic carbon&#8208;neutral fuels. Whereas carbon dioxide to CO conversion has precedent in homo&#8208; and heterogeneous catalysis, deoxygenative coupling of CO to products with C&#8722;C bonds&#8212;as in liquid fuels&#8212;remains challenging. Here, we report coupling of two CO molecules by a diiron complex. Reduction of Fe2(CO)2L (2), where L2&#8722; is a bis(&#946;&#8208;diketiminate) cyclophane, gives [K(THF)5][Fe2(CO)2L] (3), which undergoes silylation to Fe2(CO)(COSiMe3)L (4). Subsequent C&#8208;OSiMe3 bond cleavage and C=C bond formation occurs upon reduction of 4, yielding Fe2(&#956;&#8208;CCO)L. CO derived ligands in this series mediate weak exchange interactions with the ketenylidene affording the smallest J value, with changes to local metal ion spin states and coupling schemes (ferro&#8208; vs. antiferromagnetism) based on DFT calculations, M&#246;ssbauer and EPR spectroscopy. Finally, reaction of 5 with KEt3BH or methanol releases the C2O2&#8722; ligand with retention of the diiron core

         <title>Narrow&#8208;Pore Engineering of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Weak Interaction&#8208;Triggered Multi&#8208;Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerged as one type of promising crystalline materials, but their narrow pore engineering is severely impeded by the weak reversibility of carbon&#8208;carbon double bond formation reaction, leading to the less exploration of their ultramicroporous structures and properties. Herein, we developed a single aromatic ring&#8208;based tetratopic monomer, tetramethylpyrazine, which enables smoothly conducting Knoevenegal condensation at its four arylmethly carbon atoms with linear aromatic dialdehyde monomers upon the self&#8208;catalyzed activation of pyridine nitrogen&#8208;containing monomers in the presence of organic anhydride, leading to the formation of two vinylene&#8208;linked COFs. Both of them were crystallized in orthorhombic lattices, and layered in AA stacking fashions along the vertical directions. They exhibit high surface areas and well&#8208;tailored ultramicropore sizes up to 0.5 nm. The unique cross&#8208;linking mode at two pairs of para&#8208;positions of each pyrazine unit through carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds render them with p&#8208;extended conjugation over the in&#8208;plane backbones and substantial semiconducting characters. The resultant COFs can be well&#8208;dispersed in water to form the stable submicroparticles with negative charges (zeta potentials: ~ &#8208;30 mV), and exhibiting tunable aggregation behaviors through protonation/deprotonation. As a consequence, they exhibit the pore size&#8208;dependent colorimetric responses to various anions with different pKa in high selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Reversible Homogeneous Catalysis of the Electrochemical H2 Evolution and Oxidation: Role of Proton Relays and Local Concentration Effects

Analytical treatment allows determining all thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of reversible electrocatalytic oxidation and production of dihydrogen mediated by DuBois/Shaw nickel bisdiphosphine complexes bearing pendant bases. This analysis shed light on the key activity descriptors responsible for reversible vs. bidirectional catalysis and paves the way towards rational optimization of such molecular catalysts







Abstract
Nickel bisdiphosphine complexes bearing pendant amines form a unique series of catalysts (so&#8208;called DuBois&#8217; catalysts) capable of bidirectional/reversible electrocatalytic oxidation and production of dihydrogen. This unique behaviour is directly linked to the presence of proton relays installed close to the metal center. We report here for the arginine derivative [Ni(P2CyN2Arg)2]6+ on a mechanistic model and its kinetic treatment that may apply to all DuBois&#8217; catalysts and show that it allows for a good fit of experimental data measured at different pH values, catalyst concentrations and partial hydrogen pressures. The bidirectionality of catalysis results from balanced equilibria related to hydrogen uptake/evolution on one side and (metal)&#8208;hydride installation/capture on the other side, both controlled by concentration effects resulting from the presence of proton relays and connected by two square schemes corresponding to proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes. We show that the catalytic bias is controlled by the kinetic of the H2 uptake/evolution step. Reversibility does not require that the energy landscape be flat, with redox transitions occurring at potentials up to 250&#8197;mV away for the equilibrium potential, although such large deviations from a flat energy landscape can negatively impacts the rate of catalysis when coupled with slow interfacial electron transfer kinetics.

         <title>Coupling Benzylamine Oxidation with CO2 Photoconversion to Ethanol over a Black Phosphorus and Bismuth Tungstate S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction for efficient ethanol production is challenging. A 2D/2D S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction comprised of black phosphorus and bismuth tungstate (BP/BWO) was constructed for CO2 reduction, coupled with benzylamine (BA) oxidation to N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine (BDA). The catalyst generates ethanol with high yield and selectivity. This work provides insight into heterogeneous photocatalysts based on cooperative photoredox systems.







Abstract
Photoconversion of CO2 and H2O into ethanol is an ideal strategy to achieve carbon neutrality. However, the production of ethanol with high activity and selectivity is challenging owing to the less efficient reduction half&#8208;reaction involving multi&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), a slow C&#8722;C coupling process, and sluggish water oxidation half&#8208;reaction. Herein, a two&#8208;dimensional/two&#8208;dimensional (2D/2D) S&#8208;scheme heterojunction consisting of black phosphorus and Bi2WO6 (BP/BWO) was constructed for photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupling with benzylamine (BA) oxidation. The as&#8208;prepared BP/BWO catalyst exhibits a superior photocatalytic performance toward CO2 reduction, with a yield of 61.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for ethanol (selectivity of 91&#8201;%).In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations reveal that S&#8208;scheme heterojunction can effectively promote photogenerated carrier separation via the Bi&#8722;O&#8722;P bridge to accelerate the PCET process. Meanwhile, electron&#8208;rich BP acts as the active site and plays a vital role in the process of C&#8722;C coupling. In addition, the substitution of BA oxidation for H2O oxidation can further enhance the photocatalytic performance of CO2 reduction to C2H5OH. This work opens a new horizon for exploring novel heterogeneous photocatalysts in CO2 photoconversion to C2H5OH based on cooperative photoredox systems.

     alt="Coupling Benzylamine Oxidation with CO2 Photoconversion to Ethanol over a Black Phosphorus and Bismuth Tungstate S-Scheme Heterojunction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction for efficient ethanol production is challenging. A 2D/2D S-Scheme heterojunction comprised of black phosphorus and bismuth tungstate (BP/BWO) was constructed for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, coupled with benzylamine (BA) oxidation to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-benzylidenebenzylamine (BDA). The catalyst generates ethanol with high yield and selectivity. This work provides insight into heterogeneous photocatalysts based on cooperative photoredox systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoconversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O into ethanol is an ideal strategy to achieve carbon neutrality. However, the production of ethanol with high activity and selectivity is challenging owing to the less efficient reduction half-reaction involving multi-step proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), a slow C&#8722;C coupling process, and sluggish water oxidation half-reaction. Herein, a two-dimensional/two-dimensional (2D/2D) S-scheme heterojunction consisting of black phosphorus and Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (BP/BWO) was constructed for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction coupling with benzylamine (BA) oxidation. The as-prepared BP/BWO catalyst exhibits a superior photocatalytic performance toward CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, with a yield of 61.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for ethanol (selectivity of 91&#8201;%).In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations reveal that S-scheme heterojunction can effectively promote photogenerated carrier separation via the Bi&#8722;O&#8722;P bridge to accelerate the PCET process. Meanwhile, electron-rich BP acts as the active site and plays a vital role in the process of C&#8722;C coupling. In addition, the substitution of BA oxidation for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oxidation can further enhance the photocatalytic performance of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH. This work opens a new horizon for exploring novel heterogeneous photocatalysts in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoconversion to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH based on cooperative photoredox systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A glycoproteomics platform, Click&#8208;iG, is reported that integrates metabolic labeling of glycans with clickable unnatural sugars, an optimized MS method, and a tailored version of pGlyco3 software to enable simultaneous enrichment and profiling of three types of intact glycopeptides: N&#8208;linked, mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;linked, and O&#8208;GlcNAcylated glycopeptides.







Abstract
Proteins are ubiquitously modified with glycans of varied chemical structures through distinct glycosidic linkages, making the landscape of protein glycosylation challenging to map. Profiling of intact glycopeptides with mass spectrometry (MS) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for revealing matched information of the glycosylation sites and attached glycans (i.e., intact glycosites), but is largely limited to individual glycosylation types. Herein, we describe Click&#8208;iG, which integrates metabolic labeling of glycans with clickable unnatural sugars, an optimized MS method, and a tailored version of pGlyco3 software to enable simultaneous enrichment and profiling of three types of intact glycopeptides: N&#8208;linked, mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;linked, and O&#8208;GlcNAcylated glycopeptides. We demonstrate the utility of Click&#8208;iG by the identification of thousands of intact glycosites in cell lines and living mice. From the mouse lung, heart, and spleen, a total of 2053 intact N&#8208;glycosites, 262 intact O&#8208;GalNAc glycosites, and 1947 O&#8208;GlcNAcylation sites were identified. Click&#8208;iG&#8208;enabled comprehensive coverage of the protein glycosylation landscape lays the foundation for interrogating crosstalk between different glycosylation pathways.

         <title>Dynamic Control of Cyclic Peptide Assembly to Form Higher&#8208;Order Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetrical cyclic peptides constructed by dynamic covalent chemistry provide a platform for the investigation of naturally occurring chirality inversion, ring&#8208;chain tautomerism, and hierarchical assembly. The insertion of a 4&#8208;imidazolidinone ring promotes the formation of intertwined nanostructures. The reversibility can be tuned by changing the pH value without producing other chemical waste except water.







Abstract
Chirality correction, asymmetry, ring&#8208;chain tautomerism and hierarchical assemblies are fundamental phenomena in nature. They are geometrically related and may impact the biological roles of a protein or other supermolecules. It is challenging to study those behaviors within an artificial system due to the complexity of displaying these features. Herein, we design an alternating D,L peptide to recreate and validate the naturally occurring chirality inversion prior to cyclization in water. The resulting asymmetrical cyclic peptide containing a 4&#8208;imidazolidinone ring provides an excellent platform to study the ring&#8208;chain tautomerism, thermostability and dynamic assembly of the nanostructures. Different from traditional cyclic D,L peptides, the formation of 4&#8208;imidazolidinone promotes the formation of intertwined nanostructures. Analysis of the nanostructures confirmed the left&#8208;handedness, representing chirality induced self&#8208;assembly. This proves that a rationally designed peptide can mimic multiple natural phenomena and could promote the development of functional biomaterials, catalysts, antibiotics, and supermolecules.

         <title>Mechanisms of Cysteine&#8208;Lysine Covalent Linkage&#8212;The Role of Reactive Oxygen Species and Competition with Disulfide Bonds
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual &#8220;NOS&#8221; bond with a bridging oxygen atom can form under oxidising conditions between a cysteine and a lysine residue. Now the reaction mechanisms for the formation of single and double NOS bonds in proteins have been computationally investigated. More than 30 reactions were considered for oxidation pathways involving different reactive oxygen species, providing a comprehensive overview of cysteine oxidation pathways.







Abstract
Recently, a new naturally occurring covalent linkage was characterised, involving a cysteine and a lysine, bridged through an oxygen atom. The latter was dubbed as the NOS bond, reflecting the individual atoms involved in this uncommon bond which finds little parallel in lab chemistry. It is found to form under oxidising conditions and is reversible upon addition of reducing agents. Further studies have identified the bond in crystal structures across a variety of systems and organisms, potentially playing an important role in regulation, cellular defense and replication. Not only that, double NOS bonds have been identified and even found to be competitive in relation to the formation of disulfide bonds. This raises several questions about how this exotic bond comes to be, what are the intermediates involved in its formation and how it competes with other pathways of sulfide oxidation. With this objective in mind, we revisited our first proposed mechanism for the reaction with model electronic structure calculations, adding information about the reactivity with alternative reactive oxygen species and other potential competing products of oxidation. We present a network with more than 30 reactions which provides one of the most encompassing pictures for cysteine oxidation pathways to date.

         <title>Cl2&#8901;&#8722; Mediates Direct and Selective Conversion of Inert C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds into Aldehydes/Ketones</title>

A thiophene&#8208;based covalent triazine polymer facilitates effective conversion of O2&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8901;OH&#8594;Cl&#8901;&#8594;Cl2.&#8722; in the aqueous phase. Cl2.&#8722;, with a longer lifetime, transfers into organic phase and activates C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to generate unstable dichlorinated intermediates by successive hydrogen abstraction and chlorination. These unstable intermediates hydrolyze into either aldehydes or ketones with higher selectivity than that of benzyl dichloride.







Abstract
Developing new reactive pathway to activate inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds for valuable oxygenated products remains a challenge. We prepared a series of triazine conjugated organic polymers to photoactivate C&#8722;H into aldehyde/ketone via O2&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8901;OH&#8594;Cl&#8901;&#8594;Cl2&#8901;&#8722;. Experiment results showed Cl2&#8901;&#8722; could successively activate C(sp3)&#8722;H more effectively than Cl&#8901; to generate unstable dichlorinated intermediates, increasing the kinetic rate ratio of dichlorination to monochlorination by a factor of 2,000 and thus breaking traditional dichlorination kinetic constraints. These active intermediates were hydrolyzed into aldehydes or ketones easily, when compared with typical stable dichlorinated complexes, avoiding chlorinated by&#8208;product generation. Moreover, an integrated two&#8208;phase system in an acid solution strengthened the Cl2&#8901;&#8722; mediated process and inhibited product overoxidation, where the conversion rate of toluene reached 16.94&#8197;mmol/g/h and the selectivity of benzaldehyde was 99.5&#8201;%. This work presents a facile and efficient approach for selective conversion of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using Cl2&#8901;&#8722;.

Experiment results showed Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; could successively activate C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H more effectively than Cl&#8901; to generate unstable dichlorinated intermediates, increasing the kinetic rate ratio of dichlorination to monochlorination by a factor of 2,000 and thus breaking traditional dichlorination kinetic constraints. These active intermediates were hydrolyzed into aldehydes or ketones easily, when compared with typical stable dichlorinated complexes, avoiding chlorinated by-product generation. Moreover, an integrated two-phase system in an acid solution strengthened the Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; mediated process and inhibited product overoxidation, where the conversion rate of toluene reached 16.94&#8197;mmol/g/h and the selectivity of benzaldehyde was 99.5&#8201;%. This work presents a facile and efficient approach for selective conversion of inert C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds using Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Compartmentalized Polyampholyte Microgels by Depletion Flocculation and Coacervation of Nanogels in Emulsion Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel step&#8208;by&#8208;step approach for the synthesis of polyampholyte nanogel&#8208;in&#8208;microgel colloids (NiM&#8722;C) was developed by incorporating nanogels into microgels via droplet&#8208;based microfluidics yielding different internal morphologies including phase&#8208;separated coacervates, statistically distributed coacervates and core&#8211;shell like arrangements by variation of synthesis parameters such as nanogel concentration, ionic strength and pH value.







Abstract
In pH&#8208;responsive drug carriers, the distribution of charges has been proven to affect delivery efficiency but is difficult to control and verify. Herein, we fabricate polyampholyte nanogel&#8208;in&#8208;microgel colloids (NiM&#8722;C) and show that the arrangement of the nanogels (NG) can easily be manipulated by adapting synthesis conditions. Positively and negatively charged pH&#8208;responsive NG are synthesized by precipitation polymerization and labelled with different fluorescent dyes. The obtained NG are integrated into microgel (MG) networks by subsequent inverse emulsion polymerization in droplet&#8208;based microfluidics. By confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), we verify that depending on NG concentration, pH value and ionic strength, NiM&#8722;C with different NG arrangements are obtained, including Janus&#8208;like phase&#8208;separation of NG, statistical distribution of NG, and core&#8211;shell arrangements. Our approach is a major step towards uptake and release of oppositely charged (drug) molecules.

         <title>Fast and Tunable Phosphorescence from Organic Ionic Crystals</title>

The photoluminescence mechanism of crystalline diphosphonium iodide salts strongly depends on anion&#8208;&#960; interactions. In the case of iodide&#8211;&#960; charge transfer combined with electrostatically controlled packing effects, high quantum yields (&#934;em up to 0.75) and fast radiative rate constants (kr of up to 2.77&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1) of phosphorescence have been realized at room temperature, which are exceptionally rare for metal&#8208;free systems.







Abstract
Crystalline diphosphonium iodides [MeR2P&#8208;spacer&#8208;R2Me]I with phenylene (1, 2), naphthalene (3, 4), biphenyl (5) and anthracene (6) as aromatic spacers, are photoemissive under ambient conditions. The emission colors (&#955;em values from 550 to 880&#8197;nm) and intensities (&#934;em reaching 0.75) are defined by the composition and substitution geometry of the central conjugated chromophore motif, and the anion&#8208;&#960; interactions. Time&#8208;resolved and variable&#8208;temperature luminescence studies suggest phosphorescence for all the titled compounds, which demonstrate observed lifetimes of 0.46&#8211;92.23&#8197;&#956;s at 297&#8197;K. Radiative rate constants kr as high as 2.8&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1 deduced for salts 1&#8211;3 were assigned to strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling enhanced by an external heavy atom effect arising from the anion&#8208;&#960; charge&#8208;transfer character of the triplet excited state. These rates of anomalously fast metal&#8208;free phosphorescence are comparable to those of transition metal complexes and organic luminophores that utilize triplet excitons via a thermally activated delayed fluorescence mechanism, making such ionic luminophores a new paradigm for the design of photofunctional and responsive molecular materials.

         <title>Enhanced Spatial Charge Separation in a Niobium and Tantalum Nitride Core&#8208;Shell Photoanode: In Situ Interface Bonding for Efficient Solar Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient electron/hole separation and collection has been achieved by in situ interface bonding of an ultrathin high&#8208;crystallinity Ta3N5 mono&#8208;grain shell and conductive NbNx nanorod core. The photoanode attains a photocurrent density of 7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V RHE with a Ta3N5 shell thickness of less than 30&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) has emerged as a promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, the inefficient electron&#8208;hole separation remains a bottleneck that impedes its solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate that a core&#8211;shell nanoarray photoanode of NbNx&#8208;nanorod@Ta3N5 ultrathin layer enhances light harvesting and forms a spatial charge&#8208;transfer channel, which leads to the efficient generation and extraction of charge carriers. Consequently, an impressive photocurrent density of 7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE is obtained with an ultrathin Ta3N5 shell thickness of less than 30&#8197;nm, accompanied by excellent stability and a low onset potential (0.46&#8197;VRHE). Mechanistic studies reveal the enhanced performance is attributed to the high&#8208;conductivity NbNx core, high&#8208;crystalline Ta3N5 mono&#8208;grain shell, and the intimate Ta&#8722;N&#8722;Nb interface bonds, which accelerate the charge&#8208;separation capability of the core&#8211;shell photoanode. This study demonstrates the key roles of nanostructure design in improving the efficiency of PEC devices.

         <title>Bilayer&#8208;Coating Strategy for Hydrophobic Nanoparticles Providing Colloidal Stability, Functionality, and Surface Protection in Biological Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying the surface of oleate&#8208;coated hydrophobic particles to render them stable in aqueous biological environments is often challenging. We present a one&#8208;step reaction, to form a bilayer consisting of oleate and dodecylamine moieties, which provides excellent stability and versatility as it allows further functionalization via carbodiimide chemistry.







Abstract
The surface chemistry of nanoparticles is a key step on the pathway from particle design towards applications in biologically relevant environments. Here, a bilayer&#8208;based strategy for the surface modification of hydrophobic nanoparticles is introduced that leads to excellent colloidal stability in aqueous environments and good protection against disintegration, while permitting surface functionalization via simple carbodiimide chemistry. We have demonstrated the excellent potential of this strategy using upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), initially coated with oleate and therefore dispersible only in organic solvents. The hydrophobic oleate capping is maintained and a bilayer is formed upon addition of excess oleate. The bilayer approach renders protection towards luminescence loss by water quenching, while the incorporation of additional molecules containing amino functions yields colloidal stability and facilitates the introduction of functionality. The biological relevance of the approach was confirmed with the use of two model dyes, a photosensitizer and a nitric oxide (NO) probe that, when attached to the surface of the UCNPs, retained their functionality to produce singlet oxygen and detect intracellular NO, respectively. We present a simple and fast strategy to protect and functionalize inorganic nanoparticles in biological media, which is important for controlled surface engineering of nanosized materials for theranostic applications.

&lt;p&gt;The surface chemistry of nanoparticles is a key step on the pathway from particle design towards applications in biologically relevant environments. Here, a bilayer-based strategy for the surface modification of hydrophobic nanoparticles is introduced that leads to excellent colloidal stability in aqueous environments and good protection against disintegration, while permitting surface functionalization via simple carbodiimide chemistry. We have demonstrated the excellent potential of this strategy using upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), initially coated with oleate and therefore dispersible only in organic solvents. The hydrophobic oleate capping is maintained and a bilayer is formed upon addition of excess oleate. The bilayer approach renders protection towards luminescence loss by water quenching, while the incorporation of additional molecules containing amino functions yields colloidal stability and facilitates the introduction of functionality. The biological relevance of the approach was confirmed with the use of two model dyes, a photosensitizer and a nitric oxide (NO) probe that, when attached to the surface of the UCNPs, retained their functionality to produce singlet oxygen and detect intracellular NO, respectively. We present a simple and fast strategy to protect and functionalize inorganic nanoparticles in biological media, which is important for controlled surface engineering of nanosized materials for theranostic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystal Structure and NMR of an &#945;,&#948;&#8208;Peptide Foldamer Helix Shows Side&#8208;Chains are Well Placed for Bifunctional Catalysis: Application as a Minimalist Aldolase Mimic
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalytic foldamer constructed of &#945;&#8208; and bespoke &#948;&#8208;residues forms a helix which is not only stabilized by intramolecular H&#8208;bonds, but also by apolar interactions not observed in foldamer secondary structures until now. The resulting scaffold gives a useful juxtaposition of functionality and leads to bifunctional catalysis as demonstrated through an aldolase&#8208;like process.







Abstract
We report the first NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) structures of an unusual 13/11&#8208;helix (alternating i,&#8201;i+1 {NH&#8722;O=C} and i,&#8201;i+3 {C=O&#8722;H&#8722;N} H&#8208;bonds) formed by a heteromeric 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 sequence of &#945;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;amino acids, and demonstrate the application of this framework towards catalysis. Whilst intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IMHBs) are the clear driver of helix formation in this system, we also observe an apolar interaction between the ethyl residue of one &#948;&#8208;amino acid and the cyclohexyl group of the next &#948;&#8208;residue in the sequence that seems to stabilize one type of helix over another. To the best of our knowledge this type of additional stabilization leading to a specific helical preference has not been observed before. Critically, the helix type realized places the &#945;&#8208;residue functionalities in positions proximal enough to engage in bifunctional catalysis as demonstrated in the application of our system as a minimalist aldolase mimic.

         <title>Sandwich&#8208;Kernelled AgCu Nanoclusters with Golden Ratio Geometry and Promising Photothermal Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silver copper nanocluster with a golden ratio pentangle structure is prepared. It shows promising photothermal conversion. It is a novel alloy nanocluster with a sandwich&#8208;like kernel (diameter&#8776;0.9&#8197;nm and length&#8776;0.25&#8197;nm), and gives insight into the relationship between structure and photothermal properties.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters have recently attracted extensive interest from the scientific community. However, unlike carbon&#8208;based materials and metal nanocrystals, they rarely exhibit a sheet kernel structure, probably owing to the instability caused by the high exposure of metal atoms (particularly in the relatively less noble Ag or Cu nanoclusters) in such a structure. Herein, we synthesized a novel AgCu nanocluster with a sandwich&#8208;like kernel (diameter&#8776;0.9&#8197;nm and length&#8776;0.25&#8197;nm) by introducing the furfuryl mercaptan ligand (FUR) and the alloying strategy. Interestingly, the kernel consists of a centered silver atom and two planar Ag10 pentacle units with completely mirrored symmetry after a rotation of 36 degrees. The two Ag10 pentacles and some extended structures show an unreported golden ratio geometry, and the two inner five&#8208;membered rings and the centered Ag atom form an unanticipated full&#8208;metal ferrocene&#8208;like structure. The featured kernel structure causes the dominant radial direction transition of excitation electrons, as determined via time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations, which affords the protruding absorption at 612&#8197;nm and contributes to the promising photothermal conversion efficiency of 67.6&#8201;% of the as&#8208;obtained nanocluster, having important implications for structure&#8208;property correlation and the development of nanocluser&#8208;based photothermal materials.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Platinum Hybrids for Covalent Binding of G&#8208;Quadruplexes: Structural Basis and Application to Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of G4&#8208;targeting organic&#8208;platinum hybrids, L1&#8208;cispt and L1&#8208;transpt, designed to covalently bind to the G4 binding site, could activate the retinoic acid&#8208;induced gene I (RIG&#8208;I) pathway, induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) and stimulate potent immunotherapy in vivo. This study highlights the importance of the rational combination of specific spatial recognition and covalent binding in G4&#8208;targeting drug design.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) have been revived as promising therapeutic targets with the development of immunotherapy, but the G4&#8208;mediated immune response remains unclear. We designed a novel class of G4&#8208;binding organic&#8208;platinum hybrids, L1&#8208;cispt and L1&#8208;transpt, with spatial matching for G4 binding and G4 DNA reactivity for binding site locking. The solution structure of L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;MYT1L G4 demonstrated the effectiveness of the covalent binding and revealed the covalent binding&#8208;guided dynamic balance, accompanied by the destruction of the A5&#8208;T17 base pairs to achieve the covalent binding of the platinum unit to N7 of the G6 residue. Furthermore, L1&#8208;cispt&#8208; and L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;mediated genomic dysfunction could activate the retinoic acid&#8208;induced gene I (RIG&#8208;I) pathway and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). The use of L1&#8208;cispt/L1&#8208;transpt&#8208;treated dying cells as therapeutic vaccines stimulated a robust immune response and effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Our findings highlight the importance of the rational combination of specific spatial recognition and covalent locking in G4&#8208;trageting drug design and their potential in immunotherapy.

         <title>Thiol&#8208;Aldehyde Polycondensation for Bio&#8208;based Adaptable and Degradable Phenolic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lignin and synthetic phenolic polymers are difficult to degrade and reprocess. Through thiol&#8208;aldehyde polycondensation, degradable and reprocessable phenolic polymers with tensile strength up to 64&#8197;MPa were prepared from bioderived phenolic compounds. The developed method is promising for facile preparation of macromolecular antioxidants and dynamic networks.







Abstract
Designing sustainable materials with tunable mechanical properties, intrinsic degradability, and recyclability from renewable biomass through a mild process has become vital in polymer science. Traditional phenolic resins are generally considered to be not degradable or recyclable. Here we report the design and synthesis of linear and network structured phenolic polymers using facile polycondensation between natural aldehyde&#8208;bearing phenolic compounds and polymercaptans. Linear phenolic products are amorphous with Tg between &#8722;9&#8201;&#176;C and 12&#8201;&#176;C. Cross&#8208;linked networks from vanillin and its di&#8208;aldehyde derivative exhibited excellent mechanical strength between 6&#8211;64&#8197;MPa. The connecting dithioacetals are associatively adaptable strong bonds and susceptible to degradation in oxidative conditions to regenerate vanillin. These results highlight the potential of biobased sustainable phenolic polymers with recyclability and selective degradation, as a complement to the traditional phenol&#8208;formaldehyde resins.

         <title>Infrared Multiphoton Dissociation Enables Top&#8208;Down Characterization of Membrane Protein Complexes and G Protein&#8208;Coupled Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Top&#8208;down mass spectrometry using infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) of native membrane proteins such as G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) provides good sequence coverage from native protein ions. We observe successive cleavage of adjacent amino acids, specifically within transmembrane helices, enabling unambiguous identification of membrane proteins and their complexes.







Abstract
Membrane proteins are challenging to analyze by native mass spectrometry (MS) as their hydrophobic nature typically requires stabilization in detergent micelles that are removed prior to analysis via collisional activation. There is however a practical limit to the amount of energy which can be applied, which often precludes subsequent characterization by top&#8208;down MS. To overcome this barrier, we have applied a modified Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer coupled to an infrared laser within a high&#8208;pressure linear ion trap. We show how tuning the intensity and time of incident photons enables liberation of membrane proteins from detergent micelles. Specifically, we relate the ease of micelle removal to the infrared absorption of detergents in both condensed and gas phases. Top&#8208;down MS via infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD), results in good sequence coverage enabling unambiguous identification of membrane proteins and their complexes. By contrasting and comparing the fragmentation patterns of the ammonia channel with two class A GPCRs, we identify successive cleavage of adjacent amino acids within transmembrane domains. Using gas&#8208;phase molecular dynamics simulations, we show that areas prone to fragmentation maintain aspects of protein structure at increasing temperatures. Altogether, we propose a rationale to explain why and where in the protein fragment ions are generated.

         <title>Highly Cooperative CO2 Adsorption via a Cation Crowding Mechanism on a Cesium&#8208;Exchanged Phillipsite Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly cooperative CO2 adsorption on a flexible cesium&#8208;exchanged phillipsite, a channel&#8208;based small&#8208;pore zeolite, is operated by an unprecedented adsorption phenomenon: structural breathing (the narrow&#8208;to&#8208;wide pore) is associated with the crowding and dispersal of large Cs+ ions, depending on the CO2 pressure, termed the &#8216;cation crowding&#8217; mechanism.







Abstract
An understanding of the CO2 adsorption mechanisms on small&#8208;pore zeolites is of practical importance in the development of more efficient adsorbents for the separation of CO2 from N2 or CH4. Here we report that the CO2 isotherms at 25&#8211;75&#8201;&#176;C on cesium&#8208;exchanged phillipsite zeolite with a Si/Al ratio of 2.5 (Cs&#8208;PHI&#8208;2.5) are characterized by a rectilinear step shape: limited uptake at low CO2 pressure (PCO2) is followed by highly cooperative uptake at a critical pressure, above which adsorption rapidly approaches capacity (2.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1). Structural analysis reveals that this isotherm behavior is attributed to the high concentration and large size of Cs+ ions in dehydrated Cs&#8208;PHI&#8208;2.5. This results in Cs+ cation crowding and subsequent dispersal at a critical loading of CO2, which allows the PHI framework to relax to its wide pore form and enables its pores to fill with CO2 over a very narrow range of PCO2. Such a highly cooperative phenomenon has not been observed for other zeolites.

         <title>Pathway Control of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Supramolecular Polymers by Incorporating Donor&#8208;Acceptor Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8208;acceptor functionality has been incorporated into the &#960;&#8208;conjugated monomeric structure to program self&#8208;assembly pathways, directing the formation of parallel&#8208;stacked supramolecular polymers as metastable species and slip&#8208;stacked ones as the thermodynamically stable species.







Abstract
Controlling the nanoscale orientation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems remains challenging due to the complexity of multiple energy landscapes involved in the supramolecular assembly process. In this study, we have developed an effective strategy for programming the pathways of &#960;&#8208;conjugated supramolecular polymers, by incorporating both electron&#8208;rich methoxy&#8208; or methanthiol&#8208;benzene as donor unit and electron&#8208;poor cyano&#8208;vinylenes as acceptor units on the monomeric structure. It leads to the formation of parallel&#8208;stacked supramolecular polymers as the metastable species through homomeric donor/acceptor packing, which convert to slip&#8208;stacked supramolecular polymers as the thermodynamically stable species facilitated by heteromeric donor&#8208;acceptor packing. By further investigating the external seed&#8208;induced kinetic&#8208;to&#8208;thermodynamic transformation behaviors, our findings suggest that the donor&#8208;acceptor functionality on the seed structure is crucial for accelerating pathway conversion. This is achieved by eliminating the initial lag phase in the supramolecular polymerization process. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into designing molecular structures that control aggregation pathways of &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanostructures.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Vinylogous Urethane Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The closed&#8208;loop recycling of vinylogous urethane vitrimers made from acetoacetate&#8208;terminated polyethyleneglycol and tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine is presented. Treatment with water allows the selective and quantitative recovery of the monomers, even from mixed waste streams. The modular synthetic approach allows the synthesis of materials that cover a broad range of mechanical properties and that are easy to reprocess.







Abstract
Devising energy&#8208;efficient strategies for the depolymerization of plastics and the recovery of their structural components in high yield and purity is key to a circular plastics economy. Here, we report a case study in which we demonstrate that vinylogous urethane (VU) vitrimers synthesized from bis&#8208;polyethylene glycol acetoacetates (aPEG) and tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine can be degraded by water at moderate temperature with almost quantitative recovery (&#8776;98&#8201;%) of aPEG. The rate of depolymerization can be controlled by the temperature, amount of water, molecular weight of aPEG, and composition of the starting material. These last two parameters also allow one to tailor the mechanical properties of the final materials, and this was used to access soft, tough, and brittle vitrimers, respectively. The straightforward preparation and depolymerization of the aPEG&#8208;based VU vitrimers are interesting elements for the design of polymer materials with enhanced closed&#8208;loop recycling characteristics.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Phosphido Catalysis: Enantioselective Addition of Phosphines to Cyclopropenes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective hydrophosphination of cyclopropenes that occurs at ambient temperature is reported. It proceeds through a copper&#8208;phosphido intermediate while various cyclopropylphosphines can now be accessed in high yields and enantioselectivities. Enrichment of phosphorus stereocenters is also demonstrated via a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) process. Experimental studies and DFT calculations provide mechanistic insight.







Abstract
We describe a copper catalyst that promotes the addition of phosphines to cyclopropenes at ambient temperature. A range of cyclopropylphosphines bearing different steric and electronic properties can now be accessed in high yields and enantioselectivities. Enrichment of phosphorus stereocenters is also demonstrated via a Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Transformation (DyKAT) process. A combined experimental and theoretical mechanistic study supports an elementary step featuring insertion of a CuI&#8208;phosphido into a carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. Density functional theory calculations reveal migratory insertion as the rate&#8208; and stereo&#8208;determining step, followed by a syn&#8208;protodemetalation.

Enrichment of phosphorus stereocenters is also demonstrated via a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) process. Experimental studies and DFT calculations provide mechanistic insight.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe a copper catalyst that promotes the addition of phosphines to cyclopropenes at ambient temperature. A range of cyclopropylphosphines bearing different steric and electronic properties can now be accessed in high yields and enantioselectivities. Enrichment of phosphorus stereocenters is also demonstrated via a Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Transformation (DyKAT) process. A combined experimental and theoretical mechanistic study supports an elementary step featuring insertion of a Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphido into a carbon-carbon double bond. Density functional theory calculations reveal migratory insertion as the rate- and stereo-determining step, followed by a &lt;i&gt;syn-&lt;/i&gt;protodemetalation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Cluster&#8208;Organic Supramolecular Framework for Polysulfide Conversion and Guest&#8211;Host Recognition in Lithium&#8208;sulfur Batteries</title>

Polyoxometalate&#8208;cyclodextrin cluster&#8208;organic supramolecular framework (POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF)&#8208;based battery separator as an ideal lightweight barrier (ca. 0.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) was first directly involved in the lithium&#8208;sulfur battery (Li&#8722;S) system to suppress the polysulfide shuttle effect through supramolecularly recognizing polysulfide guests and then catalyzing their conversion while simultaneously accelerating Li+ ions diffusion.







Abstract
Developing polyoxometalate&#8208;cyclodextrin cluster&#8208;organic supramolecular framework (POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF) still remains challenging due to an extremely difficult task in rationally interconnecting two dissimilar building blocks. Here we report an unprecedented POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF crystalline structure produced through the self&#8208;assembly process of a Krebs&#8208;type POM, [Zn2(WO2)2(SbW9O33)2]10&#8722;, and two &#946;&#8208;CD units. The as&#8208;prepared POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF&#8208;based battery separator can be applied as a lightweight barrier (approximately 0.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) to mitigate the polysulfide shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. The designed Li&#8722;S batteries equipped with the POM&#8208;CD&#8208;COSF modified separator exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance, attributed to fast Li+ diffusion through the supramolecular channel of &#946;&#8208;CD, efficient polysulfide&#8208;capture ability by the dynamic host&#8211;guest interaction of &#946;&#8208;CD, and improved sulfur redox kinetics by the bidirectional catalysis of POM cluster. This research provides a broad perspective for the development of multifunctional supramolecular POM frameworks and their applications in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>In Vivo Metabolic Imaging of [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate&#8208;d3 Hyperpolarized By Reversible Exchange With Parahydrogen
</title>

         <dc:description>
Fast, low&#8208;cost parahydrogen&#8208;hyperpolarization via Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) enables in vivo metabolic magnetic resonance imaging. We demonstrate the first in vivo application of SABRE&#8208;hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 in a purified, aqueous solution with &#8776;30&#8197;mM [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 polarized to &#8776;11&#8201;%, obtained by rapid solvent evaporation and metal filtering. This achievement paves the way for affordable and widespread metabolic imaging applications.







Abstract
Metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using hyperpolarized (HP) pyruvate is becoming a non&#8208;invasive technique for diagnosing, staging, and monitoring response to treatment in cancer and other diseases. The clinically established method for producing HP pyruvate, dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, however, is rather complex and slow. Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is an ultra&#8208;fast and low&#8208;cost method based on fast chemical exchange. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate not only in vivo utility, but also metabolic MRI with SABRE. We present a novel routine to produce aqueous HP [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 for injection in 6&#8197;minutes. The injected solution was sterile, non&#8208;toxic, pH neutral and contained &#8776;30&#8197;mM [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate&#8208;d3 polarized to &#8776;11&#8201;% (residual 250&#8197;mM methanol and 20&#8197;&#956;M catalyst). It was obtained by rapid solvent evaporation and metal filtering, which we detail in this manuscript. This achievement makes HP pyruvate MRI available to a wide biomedical community for fast metabolic imaging of living organisms.

         <title>A Targeting Singlet Oxygen Battery for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacterial Deep&#8208;Tissue Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A targeting CARG&#8208;1O2 was designed as a &#8220;singlet oxygen battery&#8221; for the efficient treatment of MRSA deep&#8208;tissue infections. CARG&#8208;Py was able to store singlet oxygen by pre&#8208;irradiation and produce singlet oxygen over a time course of approximately 30min. CARG&#8208;1O2 potently combats biofilm&#8208;associated infections and disrupts MRSA biofilms, and it exerted a beneficial therapeutic impact in a MRSA&#8208;induced model of pneumonia.







Abstract
Traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT) is dependent on externally applied light and oxygen, and the depth of penetration of these factors can be insufficient for the treatment of deep infections. The short half&#8208;life and short diffusion distance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) also limit the antibacterial efficiency of PDT. Herein, we designed a targeting singlet oxygen delivery system, CARG&#8208;Py, for irradiation&#8208;free and oxygen&#8208;free PDT. This system was converted to the &#8220;singlet oxygen battery&#8221; CARG&#8208;1O2 and released singlet oxygen without external irradiation or oxygen. CARG&#8208;1O2 is composed of pyridones coupled to a targeting peptide that improves the utilization of singlet oxygen in deep multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections. CARG&#8208;1O2 was shown to damage DNA, protein, and membranes by increasing the level of reactive oxygen inside bacteria; the attacking of multiple biomolecular sites caused the death of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). An in vivo study in a MRSA&#8208;infected mouse model of pneumonia demonstrated the potential of CARG&#8208;1O2 for the efficient treatment of deep infections. This work provides a new strategy to improve traditional PDT for irradiation&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;free treatment of deep infections while improving convenience of PDT.

         <title>Atomically Precise Copper Nanoclusters for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 towards Hydrocarbons via Breaking the Coordination Symmetry of Cu Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking the coordination symmetry of Cu site in atomically precise Cu6 cluster forms Cu&#8208;S2N1 site, which rank the dx2&#8208;y2 orbital as the highest occupied d orbital to favor the specific coordination between C atom of CO2 and Cu&#8722;S2N1 site. This binding mode is conductive to the generation of *COOH instead of *OCHO, thereby switching the product of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction to higher&#8208;valued hydrocarbons.







Abstract
We propose an effective highest occupied d&#8208;orbital modulation strategy engendered by breaking the coordination symmetry of sites in the atomically precise Cu nanocluster (NC) to switch the product of CO2 electroreduction from HCOOH/CO to higher&#8208;valued hydrocarbons. An atomically well&#8208;defined Cu6 NC with symmetry&#8208;broken Cu&#8722;S2N1 active sites (named Cu6(MBD)6, MBD=2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole) was designed and synthesized by a judicious choice of ligand containing both S and N coordination atoms. Different from the previously reported high HCOOH selectivity of Cu NCs with Cu&#8722;S3 sites, the Cu6(MBD)6 with Cu&#8722;S2N1 coordination structure shows a high Faradaic efficiency toward hydrocarbons of 65.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (including 42.5&#8201;% CH4 and 23&#8201;% C2H4), with the hydrocarbons partial current density of &#8722;183.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations reveal that the symmetry&#8208;broken Cu&#8722;S2N1 sites can rearrange the Cu 3d orbitals with 
 as the highest occupied d&#8208;orbital, thus favoring the generation of key intermediate *COOH instead of *OCHO to favor *CO formation, followed by hydrogenation and/or C&#8722;C coupling to produce hydrocarbons. This is the first attempt to regulate the coordination mode of Cu atom in Cu NCs for hydrocarbons generation, and provides new inspiration for designing atomically precise NCs for efficient CO2RR towards highly&#8208;valued products.

     alt="Atomically Precise Copper Nanoclusters for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 towards Hydrocarbons via Breaking the Coordination Symmetry of Cu Site"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking the coordination symmetry of Cu site in atomically precise Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cluster forms Cu-S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; site, which rank the d&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;-y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbital as the highest occupied d orbital to favor the specific coordination between C atom of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&#8722;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; site. This binding mode is conductive to the generation of *COOH instead of *OCHO, thereby switching the product of electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction to higher-valued hydrocarbons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose an effective highest occupied d-orbital modulation strategy engendered by breaking the coordination symmetry of sites in the atomically precise Cu nanocluster (NC) to switch the product of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction from HCOOH/CO to higher-valued hydrocarbons. An atomically well-defined Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; NC with symmetry-broken Cu&#8722;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; active sites (named Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(MBD)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, MBD=2-mercaptobenzimidazole) was designed and synthesized by a judicious choice of ligand containing both S and N coordination atoms. Different from the previously reported high HCOOH selectivity of Cu NCs with Cu&#8722;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites, the Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(MBD)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; with Cu&#8722;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; coordination structure shows a high Faradaic efficiency toward hydrocarbons of 65.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (including 42.5&#8201;% CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and 23&#8201;% C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), with the hydrocarbons partial current density of &#8722;183.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Theoretical calculations reveal that the symmetry-broken Cu&#8722;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; sites can rearrange the Cu 3d orbitals with 
 as the highest occupied d-orbital, thus favoring the generation of key intermediate *COOH instead of *OCHO to favor *CO formation, followed by hydrogenation and/or C&#8722;C coupling to produce hydrocarbons. This is the first attempt to regulate the coordination mode of Cu atom in Cu NCs for hydrocarbons generation, and provides new inspiration for designing atomically precise NCs for efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR towards highly-valued products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nonclassical Crystallization Causes Dendritic and Band&#8208;Like Microscale Patterns in Inorganic Precipitates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic experiments yield compositionally pure Ni(OH)2 membranes that show internal microscale structures such as parallel bands, dendritic trees, and disorganized spots. These light&#8208;scattering patterns result from nonclassical crystallization and nanoparticle aggregation. The particles form in the flowing NiCl2 solution and self&#8208;organize aggregation zones&#8212;that for band patterns&#8212;move over the membrane surface in the upstream direction.







Abstract
The self&#8208;organization of complex solids can create patterns extending hierarchically from the atomic to the macroscopic scale. A frequently studied model is the chemical garden system which consists of life&#8208;like precipitate shapes. In this study, we examine the thin walls of chemical gardens using microfluidic devices that yield linear Ni(OH)2 precipitate membranes. We observe distinct light&#8208;scattering patterns within the compositionally pure membranes, including disorganized spots, dendrites, and parallel bands. The bands are tilted with respect to the membrane axis and their spacing (20&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;m) increases with increasing flow rates. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that the bands consist of submicron particles embedded in a denser material and these particles are also found in the reactant stream. We propose that dendrites and bands arise from the attachment of solution&#8208;borne nanoparticles. The bands are generated by particle&#8208;aggregation zones moving upstream along the slowly advancing membrane surface. The speed of the aggregation zones is proportional to the band distance and defines the system's dispersion relation. This speed&#8208;wavelength dependence and the flow&#8208;opposing motion of the aggregation zones are likely caused by low particle concentrations in the wake of the zones that only slowly recover due to Brownian motion and particle nucleation.

         <title>Defluorinative Multi&#8208;Functionalization of Fluoroaryl Sulfoxides Enabled by Fluorine&#8208;Assisted Temporary Dearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential reactivities of fluoroaryl sulfoxides have been unlocked by precisely constructing and elaborating their temporarily dearomatized intermediates via a robust [5,5]&#8208;sulfonium&#8208;rearrangement&#8208;triggered dearomatization/rearomatization process. Impressively, fluorine has shown its irreplaceable role for the success of the reaction.







Abstract
Owing to its unique physical properties, fluorine is often used to open up new reaction channels. In this report, we establish a cooperation of [5,5]&#8208;rearrangement and fluorine&#8208;assisted temporary dearomatization for arene multi&#8208;functionalization. Specifically, the [5,5]&#8208;rearrangement of fluoroaryl sulfoxides with &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles generates an intriguing dearomatized sulfonium species which is short&#8208;lived but exhibits unusually high electrophilicity and thus can be instantly trapped by nucleophiles and dienes at a remarkably low temperature (&#8722;95&#8201;&#176;C) to produce four types of valuable multi&#8208;functionalized benzenes, respectively, involving appealing processes of defluorination, desulfurization, and sulfur shift. Mechanistic studies indicate that the use of fluorine on arenes not only circumvents the generally inevitable [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement but also impedes the undesired rearomatization process, thus provides a precious space for constructing and elaborating the temporarily dearomatized fluorinated sulfonium species.

         <title>A Generic Platform for Upcycling Polystyrene to Aryl Ketones and Organosulfur Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermochemical degradation utilizing AlCl3 recovers benzene from polystyrene in quantitative yields. The subsequent addition of acyl/alkyl and sulfinyl chlorides to the same reactor produces aryl ketones and sulfides in moderate to high yields. The one&#8208;pot cascade degradation&#8211;upcycling reactions present an effective strategy for converting polystyrene to valuable chemicals, including benzophenone, acetophenone, and diphenyl sulfide.







Abstract
Polystyrene (PS) is one of the least recycled large&#8208;volume commodity plastics due to bulkiness of foam products and associated contaminants. PS recycling is also severely hampered by the lack of financial incentive, limited versatility, and poor selectivity of existing methods. To this end, herein we report a thermochemical recycling strategy of &#8220;degradation&#8208;upcycling&#8221; to synthesize a library of high&#8208;value aromatic chemicals from PS wastes with high versatility and selectivity. Two cascade reactions are selected to first degrade PS to benzene under mild temperatures, followed by the derivatization thereof utilizing a variety of acyl/alkyl and sulfinyl chloride additives. To demonstrate the versatility, nine ketones and sulfides of cosmetic and pharmaceutical relevance were prepared, including propiophenone, benzophenone, and diphenyl sulfide. The approach is also amenable to sophisticated upcycling reaction designs and can produce desired products stepwise. The facile and versatile approach will provide a scalable and profitable methodology for upcycling PS waste into value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Type&#8208;II Red Phosphorus: Wavy Packing of Twisted Pentagonal Tubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of type&#8208;II red phosphorus is investigated by various structural characterizations, including 3D electron diffraction, atomic&#8208;resolution STEM imaging, and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. A triclinic unit cell with a large volume containing around 250 phosphorus atoms is identified via 3D electron diffraction. The twisted wavy tubular motif, a new variation of building blocks in phosphorus, is also revealed via STEM.







Abstract
Elemental phosphorus exhibits fascinating structural varieties and versatile properties. The unique nature of phosphorus bonds can lead to the formation of extremely complex structures, and detailed structural information on some phosphorus polymorphs is yet to be investigated. In this study, we investigated an unidentified crystalline phase of phosphorus, type&#8208;II red phosphorus (RP), by combining state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art structural characterization techniques. Electron diffraction tomography, atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy were concurrently used to elucidate the hidden structural motifs and their packing in type&#8208;II RP. Electron diffraction tomography, performed using individual crystalline nanowires, was used to identify a triclinic unit cell with volume of 5330&#8197;&#197;3, which is the largest unit cell for elemental phosphorus crystals up to now and contains approximately 250 phosphorus atoms. Atomic&#8208;resolution STEM imaging, which was performed along different crystal&#8208;zone axes, confirmed that the twisted wavy tubular motif is the basic building block of type&#8208;II RP. Our study discovered and presented a new variation of building blocks in phosphorus, and it provides insights to clarify the complexities observed in phosphorus as well as other relevant systems.

         <title>MET&#8208;Activating Ubiquitin Multimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monomeric small protein ligands, referred to as U&#8208;body constructs, were developed from ubiquitin and macrocyclic peptide pharmacophores via genetic implantation (lasso&#8208;grafting) and spacer optimization, showing antagonist or &#8220;enhancer&#8221; activity for a receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Subsequently, multimeric U&#8208;body&#8208;based proteins, U&#8208;bodies, were constructed, exhibiting potent agonist activity for MET.







Abstract
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are generally activated through their dimerization and/or oligomerization induced by their cognate ligands, and one such RTK hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, known as MET, plays an important role in tissue regeneration. Here we show the development of ubiquitin (Ub)&#8208;based protein ligand multimers, referred to as U&#8208;bodies, which act as surrogate agonists for MET and are derived from MET&#8208;binding macrocyclic peptides. Monomeric Ub constructs (U&#8208;body) were first generated by genetic implantation of a macrocyclic peptide pharmacophore into a structural loop of Ub (lasso&#8208;grafting) and subsequent optimization of its flanking spacer sequences via mRNA display. Such U&#8208;body constructs exhibit potent binding affinity to MET, thermal stability, and proteolytic stability. The U&#8208;body constructs also partially/fully inhibited or enhanced HGF&#8208;induced MET&#8208;phosphorylation. Their multimerization to dimeric, tetrameric, and octameric U&#8208;bodies linked by an appropriate peptide linker yielded potent MET activation activity and downstream cell proliferation&#8208;promoting activity. This work suggests that lasso&#8208;grafting of macrocycles to Ub is an effective approach to devising protein&#8208;based artificial RTK agonists and it can be useful in the development of a new class of biologics for various therapeutic applications.

         <title>[2+2+1+1] Cycloaddition for de novo Synthesis of Densely Functionalized Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized phenols can be easily obtained through formal [2+2+1+1] cycloaddition of two different alkynes and two molecules of CO. The new benzannulation strategy allows efficient regioselective installation of up to five different substituents on a phenol ring. The resulting phenols have a substitution pattern different from and complementary to those obtained from D&#246;tz and Danheiser benzannulations.







Abstract
A unique benzannulation strategy for regioselective de novo synthesis of densely functionalized phenols is described. Through metal&#8208;mediated formal [2+2+1+1] cycloaddition of two different alkynes and two molecules of CO, a series of densely functionalized phenols were obtained. The benzannulation strategy allows efficient regioselective installation up to five different substituents on a phenol ring. The resulting phenols have a substitution pattern different from those obtained from D&#246;tz and Danheiser benzannulations.

         <title>Cooperative Lewis Acid&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Triazolium&#8208;Aryloxide Catalysis: Pyrazolone Addition to Nitroolefins as Entry to Diaminoamides</title>

Pyrazolones represent an important structural motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients. A polyfunctional CuII&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolium&#8208;aryloxide catalyst which enables their addition to nitroolefins with high enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol is presented. DFT studies show that the catalyst adopts a rigid chiral cage structure by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The products were used to form bioactive compounds, pyrazolidinones and &#946;,&#947;&#8217;&#8208;diaminoamides.







Abstract
Pyrazolones represent an important structural motif in active pharmaceutical ingredients. Their asymmetric synthesis is thus widely studied. Still, a generally highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective 1,4&#8208;addition to nitroolefins providing products with adjacent stereocenters is elusive. In this article, a new polyfunctional CuII&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolium&#8208;aryloxide catalyst is presented which enables this reaction type with high stereocontrol. DFT studies revealed that the triazolium stabilizes the transition state by hydrogen bonding between C(5)&#8722;H and the nitroolefin and verify a cooperative mode of activation. Moreover, they show that the catalyst adopts a rigid chiral cage/pore structure by intramolecular hydrogen bonding, by which stereocontrol is achieved. Control catalyst systems confirm the crucial role of the triazolium, aryloxide and CuII, requiring a sophisticated structural orchestration for high efficiency. The addition products were used to form pyrazolidinones by chemoselective C=N reduction. These heterocycles are shown to be valuable precursors toward &#946;,&#947;&#8217;&#8208;diaminoamides by chemoselective nitro and N&#8722;N bond reductions. Morphological profiling using the Cell painting assay identified biological activities for the pyrazolidinones and suggest modulation of DNA synthesis as a potential mode of action. One product showed biological similarity to Camptothecin, a lead structure for cancer therapy.

         <title>Redox Reorganization: Aluminium Promoted 1,5&#8208;Hydride Shifts Allow the Controlled Synthesis of Multisubstituted Cyclohexenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient synthesis of multisubstituted cyclohexenes has been achieved from tetrahydropyrans (easily accessible via many synthetic approaches). The process operates via a tandem 1,5&#8208;hydride shift&#8211;aldol condensation mediated by simple aluminium reagents (e.g. Al2O3), enabling the synthesis of cyclohexenes (&gt;40 examples) bearing substituents at each position around the cyclohexene ring with high levels of chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity.







Abstract
An efficient synthesis of cyclohexenes has been achieved from easily accessible tetrahydropyrans via a tandem 1,5&#8208;hydride shift&#8211;aldol condensation. We discovered that readily available aluminium reagents, e.g. Al2O3 or Al(OtBu)3 are essential for this process, promoting the 1,5&#8208;hydride shift with complete regio&#8208; and enantiospecificity (in stark contrast to results obtained under basic conditions). The mild conditions, coupled with multiple methods available to access the tetrahydropyran starting materials makes this a versatile method with exceptional functional group tolerance. A wide range of cyclohexenes (&gt;40 examples) have been prepared, many in enantiopure form, showing our ability to selectively install a substituent at each position around the newly forged cyclohexene ring. Experimental and computational studies revealed that aluminium serves a dual role in facilitating the hydride shift, activating both the alkoxide nucleophile and the electrophilic carbonyl group.

         <title>Cooperative Network Formation via Two&#8208;Colour Light&#8208;Activated &#955;&#8208;Orthogonal Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterotelechelic dilinker enables the generation of a polymer network exclusively via dual&#8208;colour irradiation. In contrast, single&#8208;colour irradiation results in polymer functionalization.







Abstract
Independently addressing photoreactive sites within one molecule with two colours of light is a formidable challenge. Here, we combine two sequence independent &#955;&#8208;orthogonal chromophores in one heterotelechelic dilinker molecule, to exploit their disparate reactivity utilizing the same reaction partner, a maleimide&#8208;containing polymer. We demonstrate that polymer network formation only proceeds if two colours of light are employed.

     alt="Cooperative Network Formation via Two-Colour Light-Activated &#955;-Orthogonal Chromophores"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A heterotelechelic dilinker enables the generation of a polymer network exclusively via dual-colour irradiation. In contrast, single-colour irradiation results in polymer functionalization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independently addressing photoreactive sites within one molecule with two colours of light is a formidable challenge. Here, we combine two sequence independent &#955;-orthogonal chromophores in one heterotelechelic dilinker molecule, to exploit their disparate reactivity utilizing the same reaction partner, a maleimide-containing polymer. We demonstrate that polymer network formation only proceeds if two colours of light are employed. Upon single colour irradiation, linker-decorated post-functionalized polymers are generated at either wavelength and in either sequence. Network formation, however, is only achieved by sequential or simultaneous two colour irradiation. The herein introduced photoreactive system demonstrates the power of wavelength orthogonal chemistry in macromolecular synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Rate CO2 Electrolysis to Formic Acid over a Wide Potential Window: An Electrocatalyst Comprised of Indium Nanoparticles on Chitosan&#8208;Derived Graphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indium nanoparticles on chitosan&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped defective graphene (In/N&#8208;dG) create bifunctional active centers that integrate chemical adsorption and electrocatalytic capabilities for CO2 electrolysis. The electrocatalyst demonstrated outstanding performance for the CO2 reduction reaction with a nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency toward HCOOH across a wide potential window and with high current density.







Abstract
Realizing industrial&#8208;scale production of HCOOH from the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is very important, but the current density as well as the electrochemical potential window are still limited to date. Herein, we achieved this by integration of chemical adsorption and electrocatalytic capabilities for the CO2RR via anchoring In nanoparticles (NPs) on biomass&#8208;derived substrates to create In/X&#8722;C (X=N, P, B) bifunctional active centers. The In NPs/chitosan&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped defective graphene (In/N&#8208;dG) catalyst had outstanding performance for the CO2RR with a nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE) of HCOOH across a wide potential window. Particularly, at 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 high current density, the FE of HCOOH was as high as 96.0&#8201;%, and the reduction potential was as low as &#8722;1.17&#8197;V vs RHE. When using a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), a pure HCOOH solution could be obtained at the cathode without further separation and purification. The FE of HCOOH was still up to 93.3&#8201;% at 0.52&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the HCOOH production rate could reach 9.051&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our results suggested that the defects and multilayer structure in In/N&#8208;dG could not only enhance CO2 chemical adsorption capability, but also trigger the formation of an electron&#8208;rich catalytic environment around In sites to promote the generation of HCOOH.

         <title>Nucleophilic Attack at Pentaarsaferrocene [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)]&#8212;The Way to Larger Polyarsenide Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective way for the nucleophilic substitution of the cyclo&#8208;As5 ligand in [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (I) was found, resulting in first As5R entities. By the reduction of I, an access to the dianionic compound [(Cp*Fe)2{&#956;&#8208;&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;As10}]2&#8722; (4), and by using As&#8208;based nucleophiles, the straightforward formation of tetramers representing the largest polyarsenide&#8208;containing (As20) molecular complexes could be achieved.







Abstract
By the reaction of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (I) (Cp*=C5Me5) with main group nucleophiles, unique functionalized products with &#951;4&#8208;coordinated polyarsenide (Asn) units (n=5, 6, 20) are obtained. With carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles such as MeLi or KBn (Bn=CH2Ph), the anionic organo&#8208;substituted polyarsenide complexes, [Li(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)][Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As5Me)] (1&#8201;a) and [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)][Cp*Fe{&#951;4&#8208;As5(CH2Ph)}] (1&#8201;b), are accessible. The use of KAsPh2 leads to a selective and controlled extension of the As5 unit and the formation of the monoanionic compound [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand][Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As6Ph2)] (2). When I is reacted with [M]As(SiMe3)2 (M=Li&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF; K), the formation of the largest known anionic polyarsenide unit in [M&#8242;(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)]2[(Cp*Fe)4{&#956;5&#8208;&#951;4:&#951;4:&#951;3:&#951;3:&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;As20}] (3) occurred (M&#8242;=Li (3&#8201;a), K (3&#8201;b)).

         <title>Relaxing Wrinkles in Jammed Interfacial Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Autonomous stress&#8208;relaxation by dynamic jammed assemblies of nanoparticles and lipids at the interface was demonstrated. Such a lipid&#8208;based self&#8208;relaxing system may find applications in soft robots, medical and materials applications.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent bonding has emerged as a mean by which stresses in a network can be relaxed. Here, the strength of the bonding of ligands to nanoparticles at the interface between two immiscible liquids affect the same results in jammed assemblies of nanoparticle surfactants. Beyond a critical degree of overcrowding induced by the compression of jammed interfacial assemblies, the bonding of ligands to nanoparticles (NPs) can be broken, resulting in a desorption of the NPs from the interface. This reduces the areal density of nanoparticle surfactants at the interface, allowing the assemblies to relax, not to a fluid state but rather another jammed state. The relaxation of the wrinkles caused by the compression reflects the tendency of these assemblies to eliminate areas of high curvature, favoring a more planar geometry. This enabled the generation of giant vesicular and multivesicular structures from these assemblies.

         <title>Gallium Triggers Ferroptosis through a Synergistic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ga&#8208;1 anchors to mitochondria by binding to the membrane phospholipids and results in the dysfunction of the electron transfer chain as well as iron release, eventually triggering ferroptosis. In addition, Ga&#8208;1 inhibits protein disulfide isomerase in the endoplasmic reticulum, breaking the antioxidant glutathione system. Both actions synergistically induce ferroptosis. In addition, exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acid enhances ferroptosis.







Abstract
The gallium ion (Ga3+) has long been believed to disrupt ferric homeostasis in the body by competing with iron cofactors in metalloproteins, ultimately leading to cell death. This study revealed that through an indirect pathway, gallium can trigger ferroptosis, a type of non&#8208;apoptotic cell death regulated by iron. This is exemplified by the gallium complex of the salen ligand (Ga&#8208;1); we found that Ga&#8208;1 acts as an effective anion transporter that can affect the pH gradient and change membrane permeability, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of ferrous iron from the electron transfer chain (ETC). In addition, Ga&#8208;1 also targeted protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, preventing the repair of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) system and thus enforcing ferroptosis. Finally, a combination treatment of Ga&#8208;1 and dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which enhances lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis, showed a synergistic therapeutic effect both in vitro and in vivo. This study provided us with a strategy to synergistically induce Ferroptosis in tumor cells, thereby enhancing the anti&#8208;neoplastic effect.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ga-1&lt;/b&gt; anchors to mitochondria by binding to the membrane phospholipids and results in the dysfunction of the electron transfer chain as well as iron release, eventually triggering ferroptosis. In addition, &lt;b&gt;Ga-1&lt;/b&gt; inhibits protein disulfide isomerase in the endoplasmic reticulum, breaking the antioxidant glutathione system. Both actions synergistically induce ferroptosis. In addition, exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acid enhances ferroptosis.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Atomic Insights into Synergistic Nitroarene Hydrogenation over Nanodiamond&#8208;Supported Pt1&#8722;Fe1 Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method was developed for Pt1&#8722;Fe1/nanodiamond dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst construction. Synergistic chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroarenes was achieved, whereby hydrogen is activated on the Pt1&#8722;Fe1 dual site and nitro group is preferentially adsorbed at the Fe1 site. The activation energy is decreased, resulting in an appreciable catalytic performance (3.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 turnover frequency, ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity, and a scope of 24 substrates).







Abstract
Fundamental understanding of the synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts is of extreme significance in heterogeneous catalysis, but a great challenge lies in the precise construction of uniform dual&#8208;metal sites. Here, we develop a novel method for constructing Pt1&#8722;Fe1/ND dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst, by anchoring Pt single atoms on Fe1&#8722;N4 sites decorating a nanodiamond (ND) surface. Using this catalyst, the synergy of nitroarenes selective hydrogenation is revealed. In detail, hydrogen is activated on the Pt1&#8722;Fe1 dual site and the nitro group is strongly adsorbed on the Fe1 site via a vertical configuration for subsequent hydrogenation. Such synergistic effect decreases the activation energy and results in an unprecedented catalytic performance (3.1&#8197;s&#8722;1 turnover frequency, ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity, 24 types of substrates). Our findings advance the applications of dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts in selective hydrogenations and open up a new way to explore the nature of synergistic catalysis at the atomic level.

         <title>Multiple Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Luminescent Chiral Hybrid Antimony Chlorides for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Encryption Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiral hybrid antimony halides R&#8208;/S&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5 have excitation&#8208;dependent emission originating from the synergistic effects of ligand and self&#8208;trapped excitons, and exhibit reversible structural transformation between non&#8208;emissive R&#8208;/S&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF upon exposure to DMF and heat. CPL switch, chiral optical logic gate and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications have been investigated based on the multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive properties.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials are ideal for information anti&#8208;countering applications, but the best&#8208;performing materials have not yet been identified. This work presents enantiomorphic hybrid antimony halides R&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5 (1) and S&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5 (2) showing mirror&#8208;imaged CPL activity with a dissymmetry factor of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;3. Interestingly, the DMF&#8208;induced structural transformation is realized to obtain non&#8208;emissive R&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF (3) and S&#8208;(C5H12NO)2SbCl5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF (4) upon exposure to DMF vapor. The transformation process is reversed upon heating. DFT calculations showed that the DMF&#8208;induced&#8208;quenched&#8208;luminescence is attributed to the intersection of the ground and excited state curves on the configuration coordinates. Unexpectedly, the nanocrystals of the chiral antimony halides 1 and 2 were prepared and indicate the excellent solution process performance. The reversible PL and CPL switching gives the system applications in information technology, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, encryption&#8208;decryption, and logic gates.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Donor&#8208;Acceptor Units as Photocatalysts for Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (Co&#8208;Por&#8208;COFs) were prepared with different donor building units. Their photophysical studies indicated that the Co&#8208;Por&#8208;COFs with higher charge&#8208;carrier density and longer conjugation length led to a more efficient charge separation with a reduced exciton binding energy, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction into CO.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a promising platform for photocatalysts. Their crystalline porous nature allows comprehensive mechanistic studies of photocatalysis, which have revealed that their general photophysical parameters, such as light absorption ability, electronic band structure, and charge separation efficiency, can be conveniently tailored by structural modifications. However, further understanding of the relationship between structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity is required from the viewpoint of charge&#8208;carrier transport, because the charge&#8208;carrier property is closely related to alleviation of the excitonic effect. In the present study, COFs composed of a fixed cobalt (Co) porphyrin (Por) centered tetraamine as an acceptor unit with differently conjugated di&#8208;carbaldehyde based donor units, such as benzodithiophene (BDT), thienothiophene (TT), or phenyl (TA), were synthesized to form Co&#8208;Por&#8208;BDT, Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TT, or Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TA, respectively. Their photocatalytic activity for reducing carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide was in the order of Co&#8208;Por&#8208;BDT&gt;Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TT&gt;Co&#8208;Por&#8208;TA. The results indicated that the excitonic effect, associated with their charge&#8208;carrier densities and &#960;&#8208;conjugation lengths, was a significant factor in photocatalysis performance.

Reducing the complexity of crystallizable fragment glycans dramatically increased the efficiency of the conjugation of large payloads to antibodies via fucosyltransferase&#8208;mediated unnatural fucosylation. An anti&#8208;human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and anti&#8208;cluster of differentiation 3 bispecific antibody was synthesized which enabled the recruitment and activation of endogenous cytolytic T lymphocyte cells for tumor killing within organoids.







Abstract
Glycoengineering has provided powerful tools to construct site&#8208;specific antibody conjugates. However, only small&#8208;molecule payloads can be directly transferred to native or engineered antibodies using existing glycoengineering strategies. Herein, we demonstrate that reducing the complexity of crystallizable fragment (Fc) glycans could dramatically boost the chemoenzymatic modification of immunoglobulin G (IgG) via an engineered fucosyltransferase. In this platform, antibodies with Fc glycans engineered to a simple N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) disaccharide are successfully conjugated to biomacromolecules, such as oligonucleotides and nanobodies, in a single step within hours. Accordingly, we synthesized an antibody&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based anti&#8208;human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/ cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) bispecific antibody and used it to selectively destroy patient&#8208;derived cancer organoids by reactivating endogenous T lymphocyte cells (T cells) inside the organoid. Our results highlight that this platform is a general approach to construct antibody&#8208;biomacromolecule conjugates with translational values.

         <title>Construction of Covalent Organic Cages with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Characteristics from Metallacages for Mimicking Light&#8208;Harvesting Antenna</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of covalent organic cages with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics were elegantly prepared through the reduction of preorganized metallacages. These covalent cages performed well as energy donors for the construction of artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems for the photocatalytic dehalogenation reaction.







Abstract
A series of covalent organic cages built from fluorophores capable of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) were elegantly prepared through the reduction of preorganized M2(LA)3(LB)2&#8208;type metallacages, simultaneously taking advantage of the synthetic accessibility and well&#8208;defined shapes and sizes of metallacages, the good chemical stability of the covalent cages as well as the bright emission of AIE fluorophores. Moreover, the covalent cages could be further post&#8208;synthetically modified into an amide&#8208;functionalized cage with a higher quantum yield. Furthermore, these presented covalent cages proved to be good energy donors and were used to construct light&#8208;harvesting systems employing Nile Red as an energy acceptor. These light&#8208;harvesting systems displayed efficient energy transfer and relatively high antenna effect, which enabled their use as efficient photocatalysts for a dehalogenation reaction. This research provides a new avenue for the development of luminescent covalent cages for light&#8208;harvesting and photocatalysis.

         <title>Eliminating Concentration Polarization with Cationic Covalent Organic Polymer to Promote Effective Overpotential of Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel covalent organic polymer with ordered periodic cationic sites is proposed to tackle the concentration polarization and drive the equilibrium of the nitrogen reduction reaction in the forward direction. With the given potential unchanged, the suppressed overpotential can be much liberated, ultimately leading to a 24&#8208;fold improvement generated in the Faradaic efficiency (73.74&#8201;%).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction offers a sustainable alternative to the conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, it is currently restricted by low effective overpotential due to the concentration polarization, which arises from accumulated products, ammonium, at the reaction interface. Here, a novel covalent organic polymer with ordered periodic cationic sites is proposed to tackle this challenge. The whole network exhibits strong positive charge and effectively repels the positively charged ammonium, enabling an ultra&#8208;low interfacial product concentration, and successfully driving the reaction equilibrium to the forward direction. With the given potential unchanged, the suppressed overpotential can be much liberated, ultimately leading to a continuous high&#8208;level reaction rate. As expected, when this tailored microenvironment is coupled with a transition metal&#8208;based catalyst, a 24&#8208;fold improvement is generated in the Faradaic efficiency (73.74&#8201;%) as compared with the bare one. The proposed strategy underscores the importance of optimizing dynamic processes as a means of improving overall performance in electrochemical syntheses.

         <title>Unidirectional Sidechain Engineering to Construct Dual&#8208;Asymmetric Acceptors for 19.23&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Low Energy Loss and Efficient Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;asymmetric Y&#8208;series acceptor is developed using unidirectional sidechain engineering. Thanks to the low energy loss and efficient charge transfer properties, the corresponding organic solar cells achieved an efficiency of 19.23&#8201;%, which is one of the highest values among annealing&#8208;free devices.







Abstract
Achieving both high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) to boost power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) is a major challenge for organic solar cells (OSCs), wherein high energy loss (Eloss) and inefficient charge transfer usually take place. Here, three new Y&#8208;series acceptors of mono&#8208;asymmetric asy&#8208;YC11 and dual&#8208;asymmetric bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC9 and bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 are developed. They share the same asymmetric D1AD2 (D1=thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene and D2=selenopheno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) fused&#8208;core but have different unidirectional sidechain on D1 side, allowing fine&#8208;tuned molecular properties, such as intermolecular interaction, packing pattern, and crystallinity. Among the binary blends, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 one has better morphology with appropriate phase separation and higher order packing than the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;asy&#8208;YC9 and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC11 ones. Therefore, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12&#8208;based OSCs offer a higher PCE of 17.16&#8201;% with both high Voc and Jsc, due to the reduced Eloss and efficient charge transfer properties. Inspired by the high Voc and strong NIR&#8208;absorption, bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12 is introduced into efficient binary PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO to construct ternary OSCs. Thanks to the broadened absorption, optimized morphology, and furtherly minimized Eloss, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8201;:&#8201;bi&#8208;asy&#8208;YC12&#8208;based OSCs achieve a champion PCE of 19.23&#8201;%, which is one of the highest efficiencies among these annealing&#8208;free devices. Our developed unidirectional sidechain engineering for constructing bi&#8208;asymmetric Y&#8208;series acceptors provides an approach to boost PCE of OSCs.

         <title>Epoxy&#8208;rich Fe Single Atom Sites Boost Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe single atom catalysts with sulfur and epoxy groups near the atomically dispersed metal centers (Fe1/NSOC) are designed for highly efficient oxygen reduction reactions. The presence of sulfur and epoxy groups modulates the electronic structure of Fe centers, while the epoxy groups also participate in the reduction reaction through reversible cleavage, lowering the energy barrier by functioning as an anchor site for OH* intermediates.







Abstract
Electrocatalysts for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are crucial for energy conversion and storage devices. Single&#8208;atom catalysts with maximized metal utilization and altered electronic structure are the most promising alternatives to replace current benchmark precious metals. However, the atomic level understanding of the functional role for each species at the anchoring sites is still unclear and poorly elucidated.

&lt;p&gt;Fe single atom catalysts with sulfur and epoxy groups near the atomically dispersed metal centers (Fe1/NSOC) are designed for highly efficient oxygen reduction reactions. The presence of sulfur and epoxy groups modulates the electronic structure of Fe centers, while the epoxy groups also participate in the reduction reaction through reversible cleavage, lowering the energy barrier by functioning as an anchor site for OH* intermediates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalysts for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are crucial for energy conversion and storage devices. Single-atom catalysts with maximized metal utilization and altered electronic structure are the most promising alternatives to replace current benchmark precious metals. However, the atomic level understanding of the functional role for each species at the anchoring sites is still unclear and poorly elucidated. Herein, we report Fe single atom catalysts with the sulfur and oxygen functional groups near the atomically dispersed metal centers (Fe1/NSOC) for highly efficient ORR. The Fe1/NSOC delivers a half-wave potential of 0.92&#8197;V vs. RHE, which is much better than those of commercial Pt/C (0.88&#8197;V), Fe single atoms on N-doped carbon (Fe1/NC, 0.89&#8197;V) and most reported nonprecious metal catalysts.

The density functional theory calculations demonstrate the existence of sulfur and epoxy group engineer the charges of Fe reactive center and facilitate the reductive release of OH* (rate-limiting step), thus boosting the overall oxygen reduction efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of Two&#8208;dimensional Hexagonal MBene HfBO and Exploration on its Potential for Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of DFT calculations and experiments were used to discover a large class of exfoliable h&#8208;MAB phases and their derivative h&#8208;MBenes. A representative 2D h&#8208;MBene, HfBO, was successfully synthesized by selectively etching the In layers from Hf2InB2. The synthesized 2D HfBO was demonstrated to show lithium&#8208;ion storage performance for the first time.







Abstract
The practical applications of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition&#8208;metal borides (MBenes) have been severely hindered by the lack of accessible MBenes because of the difficulties in the selective etching of traditional ternary MAB phases with orthorhombic symmetry (ort&#8208;MAB). Here, we discover a family of ternary hexagonal MAB (h&#8208;MAB) phases and 2D hexagonal MBenes (h&#8208;MBenes) by ab initio predictions and experiments. Calculations suggest that the ternary h&#8208;MAB phases are more suitable precursors for MBenes than the ort&#8208;MAB phases. Based on the prediction, we report the experimental synthesis of h&#8208;MBene HfBO by selective removal of In from h&#8208;MAB Hf2InB2. The synthesized 2D HfBO delivered a specific capacity of 420&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 as an anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, demonstrating the potential for energy&#8208;storage applications. The discovery of this h&#8208;MBene HfBO added a new member to the growing family of 2D materials and provided opportunities for a wide range of novel applications.

         <title>Geometrically Constrained Organoboron Species as Lewis Superacids and Organic Superbases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unveils a T&#8208;shaped organoboron system with three stable oxidation states, which allowed for the isolation of geometrically constrained superacidic boron dication, ambiphilic boron radical cation and superbasic borylene.







Abstract
This report unveils an advancement in the formation of a Lewis superacid (LSA) and an organic superbase by the geometrical deformation of an organoboron species towards a T&#8208;shaped geometry. The boron dication [2]2+ supported by an amido diphosphine pincer ligand features both a large fluoride ion affinity (FIA&gt;SbF5) and hydride ion affinity (HIA&gt;B(C6F5)3), which qualifies it as both a hard and soft LSA. The unusual Lewis acidic properties of [2]2+ are further showcased by its ability to abstract hydride and fluoride from Et3SiH and AgSbF6 respectively, and effectively catalyze the hydrodefluorination, defluorination/arylation, as well as reduction of carbonyl compounds. One and two&#8208;electron reduction of [2]2+ affords stable boron radical cation [2]&#8901;+ and borylene 2, respectively. The former species has an extremely high spin density of 0.798e at the boron atom, whereas the latter compound has been demonstrated to be a strong organic base (calcd. pKBH+ (MeCN)=47.4) by both theoretical and experimental assessment. Overall, these results demonstrate the strong ability of geometric constraining to empower the central boron atom.

         <title>Synergistic Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Active Sites in a Metal&#8208;Organic Cage for Efficient Photocatalytic Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two stable CoII&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cages are efficient catalysts for photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 in pure water and O2 or air atmospheres. The metal&#8208;nonmetal active site operates synergistically during photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis and the reaction substrate can more fully contact the catalytically active site through host&#8211;guest chemistry of cages, ultimately achieving a high H2O2 production rate.







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a potential clean method, but the long distance between the oxidation and reduction sites in photocatalysts hinders the rapid transfer of photogenerated charges, limiting the improvement of its performance. Here, a metal&#8208;organic cage photocatalyst, Co14(L&#8722;CH3)24, is constructed by directly coordinating metal sites (Co sites) used for the O2 reduction reaction (ORR) with non&#8208;metallic sites (imidazole sites of ligands) used for the H2O oxidation reaction (WOR), which shortens the transport path of photogenerated electrons and holes, and improves the transport efficiency of charges and activity of the photocatalyst. Therefore, it can be used as an efficient photocatalyst with a rate of as high as 146.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for H2O2 production under O2&#8208;saturated pure water without sacrificial agents. Significantly, the combination of photocatalytic experiments and theoretical calculations proves that the functionalized modification of ligands is more conducive to adsorbing key intermediates (*OH for WOR and *HOOH for ORR), resulting in better performance. This work proposed a new catalytic strategy for the first time; i.e., to build a synergistic metal&#8208;nonmetal active site in the crystalline catalyst and use the host&#8211;guest chemistry inherent in the metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC)to increase the contact between the substrate and the catalytically active site, and finally achieve efficient photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>A Fully Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework with Oxidative and Reductive Sites for Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction with Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline network is constructed by incorporating rhenium complexes and triazine ring structures as catalytic sites via robust &#8722;C=C&#8722; bonding. Appreciable charge&#8208;separation and transfer efficiency drive both the photocatalytic oxidative and reductive reactions in the conversion of CO2 to CO with H2O, and without any additional sacrificial agents or photosensitizers.







Abstract
Constructing a powerful photocatalytic system that can achieve the carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction half&#8208;reaction and the water (H2O) oxidation half&#8208;reaction simultaneously is a very challenging but meaningful task.

&lt;p&gt;A crystalline network is constructed by incorporating rhenium complexes and triazine ring structures as catalytic sites via robust &#8722;C=C&#8722; bonding. Appreciable charge-separation and transfer efficiency drive both the photocatalytic oxidative and reductive reactions in the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and without any additional sacrificial agents or photosensitizers.

The charge-separation ability of viCOF-bpy-Re is promoted by low polarized &#960;-bridges between rhenium complexes and triazine ring units, and the efficient charge-separation enables the photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs, followed by an intramolecular charge-transfer process, to form photogenerated electrons involved in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and photogenerated holes that participate in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oxidation simultaneously.

         <dc:description>
A straightforward method of controlled partial linker thermolysis allows the microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) photocatalyst UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 to expand its porosity with a tailored pore environment. The resulting material accommodates single&#8208;site Cu species, shows significant mesoporosity and enhanced charge photogeneration. It has excellent performance in photocatalytic reactions for the functionalization of terminal alkynes.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with expanding porosity and tailored pore environments are intriguing for catalytic applications. We report herein a straightforward method of controlled partial linker thermolysis to introduce desirable mesopores into mono&#8208;ligand MOFs, which is different from the classical thermolyzing method that starts from mixed&#8208;linker MOFs. UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, after partial ligand thermolysis, exhibits significant mesoporosity, retained crystal structure, improved charge photogeneration and abundant anchoring sites, which is ideal to explore single&#8208;site photocatalysis. Atomically dispersed Cu is then accommodated in the tailored pore. The resulting single&#8208;site Cu catalyst exhibits excellent performance for photocatalytic alkylation and oxidation coupling for the functionalization of terminal alkynes. The study highlights the advantage of controlled partial linker thermolysis to synthesize hierarchical MOFs to achieve the advanced single&#8208;site photocatalysis.

         <title>Acidic Media Impedes Tandem Catalysis Reaction Pathways in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem catalysis effects in electrochemical CO2 reduction were investigated through an isotopic labelling strategy involving the co&#8208;reduction of 13CO2/12CO mixtures. The results provide evidence that tandem catalysis does indeed occur in neutral electrolyte but is curtailed under acidic conditions. This is due to Cu becoming less effective at utilizing tandem&#8208;supplied CO in the presence of hydronium ions.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) in acidic media with Cu&#8208;based catalysts tends to suffer from lowered selectivity towards multicarbon products. This could in principle be mitigated using tandem catalysis, whereby the *CO coverage on Cu is increased by introducing a CO generating catalyst (e.g. Ag) in close proximity. Although this has seen significant success in neutral/alkaline media, here we report that such a strategy becomes impeded in acidic electrolyte. This was investigated through the co&#8208;reduction of 13CO2/12CO mixtures using a series of Cu and CuAg catalysts. These experiments provide strong evidence for the occurrence of tandem catalysis in neutral media and its curtailment under acidic conditions. Density functional theory simulations suggest that the presence of H3O+ weakens the *CO binding energy of Cu, preventing effective utilization of tandem&#8208;supplied CO. Our findings also provide other unanticipated insights into the tandem catalysis reaction pathway and important design considerations for effective CO2R in acidic media.

         <title>Catalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation with Polyhydride Ni/Ga Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>

The bimetallic cluster [Ni3(GaTMP)7] reversibly forms di&#8208;, tetra&#8208; and hexahydride species under hydrogen pressure in solution, that were characterized by low temperature COSY and ROESY NMR experiments and DFT calculations. The work conceptually relates properties of molecular, atom&#8208;precise transition metal main&#8208;group bimetallic clusters to the respective solid&#8208;state phase in catalysis.







Abstract
The bimetallic, decanuclear Ni3Ga7&#8208;cluster of the formula [Ni3(GaTMP)3(&#956;2&#8208;GaTMP)3(&#956;3&#8208;GaTMP)] (1, TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyl) reacts reversibly with dihydrogen under the formation of a series of (poly&#8208;)hydride clusters 2. Low&#8208;temperature 2D NMR experiments at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C show that 2 consist of a mixture of a di&#8208; (2Di), tetra&#8208; (2Tetra) and hexahydride species (2Hexa). The structures of 2Di and 2Tetra are assessed by a combination of 2D NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The cooperation of both metals is essential for the high hydrogen uptake of the cluster. Polyhydrides 2 are catalytically active in the semihydrogenation of 4&#8208;octyne to 4&#8208;octene with good selectivity. The example is the first of its kind and conceptually relates properties of molecular, atom&#8208;precise transition metal/main group metal clusters to the respective solid&#8208;state phase in catalysis.

         <title>Fast Polysulfide Conversion Catalysis and Reversible Anode Operation by A Single Cathode Modifier in Li&#8208;Metal Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functionalities were enabled by a single cathode modifier: i)&#8197;for the cathode, it can work as an effective catalyst to promote cathode reaction kinetics; ii)&#8197;for the anode, trace amounts of dissolved In and Se ions are incorporated as LiInS2 and LiInSe2 in the anode solid electrolyte interface to facilitate reversible Li deposition/stripping.







Abstract
The two major issues confronting the commercialization of rechargeable lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur electrochemical reactions on the cathode and inadequate lithium deposition/stripping reversibility on the anode. They are commonly mitigated with additives designed specifically for the anode and the cathode individually. Here, we report the use of a single cathode modifier, In2Se3, which can effectively catalyse the polysulfide reactions on the cathode, and also improve the reversibility of Li deposition and removal on the anode through a LiInS2/LiInSe2 containing solid electrolyte interface formed in situ by the Se and In ions dissolved in the electrolyte. The amounts of dissolved Se and In are small relative to the amount of In2Se3 administered. The benefits of using this single modification approach were verified in Li&#8208;metal anode&#8208;free Li&#8722;S batteries with a Li2S loading of 4&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low electrolyte/Li2S ratio of 7.5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1. The resulting battery showed 60&#8201;% capacity retention after 160&#8197;cycles at the 0.2&#8197;C rate and an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.27&#8201;%, comparing very well with recent studies using separate electrode modifiers.

&lt;p&gt;Multiple functionalities were enabled by a single cathode modifier: i)&#8197;for the cathode, it can work as an effective catalyst to promote cathode reaction kinetics; ii)&#8197;for the anode, trace amounts of dissolved In and Se ions are incorporated as LiInS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and LiInSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the anode solid electrolyte interface to facilitate reversible Li deposition/stripping.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two major issues confronting the commercialization of rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur electrochemical reactions on the cathode and inadequate lithium deposition/stripping reversibility on the anode. They are commonly mitigated with additives designed specifically for the anode and the cathode individually. Here, we report the use of a single cathode modifier, In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which can effectively catalyse the polysulfide reactions on the cathode, and also improve the reversibility of Li deposition and removal on the anode through a LiInS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/LiInSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; containing solid electrolyte interface formed in situ by the Se and In ions dissolved in the electrolyte. The amounts of dissolved Se and In are small relative to the amount of In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; administered. The benefits of using this single modification approach were verified in Li-metal anode-free Li&#8722;S batteries with a Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S loading of 4&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a low electrolyte/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S ratio of 7.5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The resulting battery showed 60&#8201;% capacity retention after 160&#8197;cycles at the 0.2&#8197;C rate and an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.27&#8201;%, comparing very well with recent studies using separate electrode modifiers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Keto&#8208;Switched Photocatalysis of Reconstructed Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local reconstruction of imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) unlocks visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photocatalytic H2 evolution. The keto units in skeletal building blocks are active injectors, where hot &#960;&#8208;electrons are emitted to Pt nanoparticles across a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) insulting layer for reduction of protons to H2. A new benchmark H2 production rate of 53&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved over &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs.







Abstract
The keto&#8208;switched photocatalysis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for efficient H2 evolution was reported for the first time by engineering, at a molecular level, the local structure and component of the skeletal building blocks. A series of imine&#8208;linked BT&#8208;COFs were synthesized by the Schiff&#8208;base reaction of 1, 3, 5&#8208;benzenetrialdehyde with diamines to demonstrate the structural reconstruction of enol to keto configurations by alkaline catalysis. The keto groups of the skeletal building blocks served as active injectors, where hot &#960;&#8208;electrons were provided to Pt nanoparticles (NPs) across a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) insulting layer. The characterization results, together with density functional theory calculations, indicated clearly that the formation of keto&#8208;injectors not only made the conduction band level more negative, but also led to an inhomogeneous charge distribution in the donor&#8208;acceptor molecular building blocks to form a strong intramolecular built&#8208;in electric field. As a result, visible&#8208;light photocatalysis of TP&#8208;COFs&#8208;1 with one keto group in the skeletal building blocks was successfully enabled and achieved an impressive H2 evolution rate as high as 0.96&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Also, the photocatalytic H2 evolution rates of the reconstructed BT&#8208;COFs&#8208;2 and &#8208;3 with two and three keto&#8208;injectors were significantly enhanced by alkaline post&#8208;treatment.

         <title>Linkage Microenvironment of Azoles&#8208;Related Covalent Organic Frameworks Precisely Regulates Photocatalytic Generation of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable covalent organic framework (COF) platform with three azole&#8208;related linkages was prepared through linker exchange reactions. The linkage microenvironment changes the photoelectric properties and photocatalytic performance. The thiazole linkage was more favorable than the oxazole and imidazole linkages for the formation of *O2 intermediate in H2O2 production.







Abstract
Artificial H2O2 photosynthesis by covalent organic frameworks (COFs) photocatalysts is promising for wastewater treatment. The effect of linkage chemistry of COFs as functional basis to photoelectrochemical properties and photocatalysis remains a significant challenge. In this study, three kinds of azoles&#8208;linked COFs including thiazole&#8208;linked TZ&#8208;COF, oxazole&#8208;linked OZ&#8208;COF and imidazole&#8208;linked IZ&#8208;COF were successfully synthesized. More accessible channels of charge transfer were constructed in TZ&#8208;COF via the donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor structure between thiazole linkage and pyrene linker, leading to efficient suppression of photoexcited charge recombination. Density functional theory calculations support the experimental studies, demonstrating that the thiazole linkage is more favorable for the formation of *O2 intermediate in H2O2 production than that of the oxazole and imidazole linkages. The real active sites in COFs located at the benzene ring fragment between pyrene unit and azole linkage.

         <title>Triazinium Ligation: Bioorthogonal Reaction of N1&#8208;Alkyl 1,2,4&#8208;Triazinium Salts
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe N1&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated 1,2,4&#8208;triazinium salts as new bioorthogonal reagents. These heterodienes are stable under biological conditions and react selectively and at high rates with strained alkynes such as BCN, allowing efficient modification of biomolecules. The unique ionic character makes the compounds more water soluble and cell permeable. These features enable efficient labeling of intracellular targets in living cells.







Abstract
The development of reagents that can selectively react in complex biological media is an important challenge. Here we show that N1&#8208;alkylation of 1,2,4&#8208;triazines yields the corresponding triazinium salts, which are three orders of magnitude more reactive in reactions with strained alkynes than the parent 1,2,4&#8208;triazines. This powerful bioorthogonal ligation enables efficient modification of peptides and proteins. The positively charged N1&#8208;alkyl triazinium salts exhibit favorable cell permeability, which makes them superior for intracellular fluorescent labeling applications when compared to analogous 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines. Due to their high reactivity, stability, synthetic accessibility and improved water solubility, the new ionic heterodienes represent a valuable addition to the repertoire of existing modern bioorthogonal reagents.

Abstract
The German Chemical Society (GDCh) Board of Directors chose the motto &#8220;Rethinking Chemistry&#8221; last year to address challenges connected to climate change, loss of natural resources, and geopolitical conflicts as the guiding principle of all our endeavors and actions. Rethinking Chemistry indicates the Board's desire to encourage scientists to approach chemistry in a new way, with a focus on reconsidering the field from many different angles. By taking a holistic approach, the Board intends to foster innovative, sustainable, and effective ways to use chemistry.
Rethinking Chemistry is also the motto of the GDCh Science Forum Chemistry (WiFo) 2023, and a Special Collection on the homepage of Angewandte Chemie is dedicated to this event and its motto. Rethinking Chemistry means something different in each area of chemistry, and the WiFo 2023 as well as this Special Collection of Angewandte Chemie showcase its many facets.

         <title>Inside Cover: Thiol&#8208;Aldehyde Polycondensation for Bio&#8208;based Adaptable and Degradable Phenolic Polymers (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 36/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thiol&#8211;aldehyde polycondensation was developed for the polymerization of phenolic compounds. In their Research Article (e202305677), Shichao Xu, Liang Yuan et&#8197;al. found several catalysts for making linear and network&#8208;structured phenolic polymers from plant&#8208;derived monomers. Since the repeating units are connected via dynamic dithioacetal groups, the cross&#8208;linked networks can be reprocessed and oxidatively degraded by DMSO to recover the monomers for reuse.

A bilayer consisting of oleate and dodecylamine provides excellent colloidal stability and versatility to nanoparticles with upconversion luminescence. This surface modification strategy can be achieved in a fast and easy one&#8208;step reaction, as demonstrated by Mar&#237;a&#8197;J. Mar&#237;n, Thomas Hirsch et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202305165).

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Fast and Tunable Phosphorescence from Organic Ionic Crystals (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 36/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harvesting organic phosphorescence is essential for many fields in energy and materials sciences related to light generation. In their Research Article (e202305108), Andreas Steffen, Andrey Belyaev, Pi&#8208;Tai Chou, Igor&#8197;O. Koshevoy et&#8197;al. show that the anion&#8211;&#960; interactions in crystalline diphosphonium iodides induce unusually fast room temperature triplet emission, which is associated with the external heavy atom effect and anion&#8211;&#960; charge&#8208;transfer character of the excited states. This makes ionic luminophores a new design strategy beyond transition metals and organic delayed fluorophores.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Mediated Photocatalysis for Lignocellulosic Biomass Conversion into Value&#8208;Added Chemicals and Hydrogen: Facts, Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>

This review discusses recent developments in the chemistry of photocatalytic biomass conversion into chemicals and fuels, emphasizing the role of experimental factors and materials design. A critical technological analysis to facilitate the scaling up of this technology is provided based on the reported research studies and industrial need.







Abstract
Photocatalytic biomass conversion into high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels is considered one of the hottest ongoing research and industrial topics toward sustainable development. In short, this process can cleave C&#946;&#8722;O/C&#945;&#8722;C&#946; bonds in lignin to aromatic platform chemicals, and further conversion of the polysaccharides to other platform chemicals and H2. From the chemistry point of view, the optimization of the unique cooperative interplay of radical oxidation species (which are activated via molecular oxygen species, ROSs) and substrate&#8208;derived radical intermediates by appropriate control of their type and/or yield is key to the selective production of desired products. Technically, several challenges have been raised that face successful real&#8208;world applications. This review aims to discuss the recently reported mechanistic pathways toward selective biomass conversion through the optimization of ROSs behavior and materials/system design. On top of that, through a SWOT analysis, we critically discussed this technology from both chemistry and technological viewpoints to help the scientists and engineers bridge the gap between lab&#8208;scale and large&#8208;scale production.

         <title>Modern Strategies for Carbon Isotope Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of carbon isotope labeling has recently explored new alternative avenues for better dealing with the hurdles of radiochemistry. This review focuses on the emerging opportunities provided by carbon isotope exchange (CIE) technologies. By dramatically reducing the number of steps and radioactive waste generated in preparation of tracers, CIE has great potential for accelerating clinical development of pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
In contrast to stable and natural abundant carbon&#8208;12, the synthesis of organic molecules with carbon (radio)isotopes must be conceived and optimized in order to navigate through the hurdles of radiochemical requirements, such as high costs of the starting materials, harsh conditions and radioactive waste generation. In addition, it must initiate from the small cohort of available C&#8208;labeled building blocks. For long time, multi&#8208;step approaches have represented the sole available patterns. On the other side, the development of chemical reactions based on the reversible cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds might offer new opportunities and reshape retrosynthetic analysis in radiosynthesis. This review aims to provide a short survey on the recently emerged carbon isotope exchange technologies that provide effective opportunity for late&#8208;stage labeling. At present, such strategies have relied on the use of primary and easily accessible radiolabeled C1&#8208;building blocks, such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and cyanides, while the activation principles have been based on thermal, photocatalytic, metal&#8208;catalyzed and biocatalytic processes.

         <title>Stabilizing Liquids Using Interfacial Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilizing liquids based on supramolecular assembly (non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions) has attracted significant interest, due to the increasing demand for soft, liquid&#8208;based devices. Recent advances in structuring liquids based on non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions are highlighted and a perspective is provided on future directions to inspire further studies on structured liquids based on supramolecular assembly.







Abstract
Stabilizing liquids based on supramolecular assembly (non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions) has attracted significant interest, due to the increasing demand for soft, liquid&#8208;based devices where the shape of the liquid is far from the equilibrium spherical shape. The components comprising these interfacial assemblies must have sufficient binding energies to the interface to prevent their ejection from the interface when the assemblies are compressed. Here, we highlight recent advances in structuring liquids based on non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions. We describe some of the progress made that reveals structure&#8211;property relationships. In addition to treating advances, we discuss some of the limitations and provide a perspective on future directions to inspire further studies on structured liquids based on supramolecular assembly.

         <title>1,3&#8208;Imidazole&#8208;Based Mesoionic Carbenes and Anionic Dicarbenes: Pushing the Limit of Classical N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoionic carbenes (iMICs) and anionic dicarbenes (ADCs) are readily accessible by the deprotonation of C2&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolium salts, which are prepared by the direct C2&#8208;arylation of classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). The implications of iMICs as potent &#963;&#8208;donor ligands in organometallic catalysis and ADCs as unique building&#8208;blocks in accessing conceptually new main&#8208;group heterocycles with an annulated C4E2 ring are showcased.







Abstract
Classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) featuring the carbene center at the C2&#8208;position of 1,3&#8208;imidazole framework (i.e. C2&#8208;carbenes) are well acknowledged as very versatile neutral ligands in molecular as well as in materials sciences. The efficiency and success of NHCs in diverse areas is essentially attributed to their persuasive stereoelectronics, in particular the potent &#963;&#8208;donor property. The NHCs with the carbene center at the unusual C4 (or C5) position, the so&#8208;called abnormal NHCs (aNHCs) or mesoionic carbenes (iMICs), are however superior &#963;&#8208;donors than C2&#8208;carbenes. Hence, iMICs have substantial potential in sustainable synthesis and catalysis. The main obstacle in this direction is rather demanding synthetic accessibility of iMICs. The aim of this review article is to highlight recent advances, particularly by the author's research group, in accessing stable iMICs, quantifying their properties, and exploring their applications in synthesis and catalysis. In addition, the synthetic viability and use of vicinal C4,C5&#8208;anionic dicarbenes (ADCs), also based on an 1,3&#8208;imidazole framework, are presented. As will be apparent on following pages, iMICs and ADCs hold potentials in pushing the limit of classical NHCs by enabling access to conceptually new main&#8208;group heterocycles, radicals, molecular catalysts, ligands sets, and more.

The implications of &lt;b&gt;iMICs&lt;/b&gt; as potent &#963;-donor ligands in organometallic catalysis and &lt;b&gt;ADCs&lt;/b&gt; as unique building-blocks in accessing conceptually new main-group heterocycles with an annulated C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ring are showcased.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) featuring the carbene center at the C2-position of 1,3-imidazole framework (i.e. C2-carbenes) are well acknowledged as very versatile neutral ligands in molecular as well as in materials sciences. The efficiency and success of NHCs in diverse areas is essentially attributed to their persuasive stereoelectronics, in particular the potent &#963;-donor property. The NHCs with the carbene center at the unusual C4 (or C5) position, the so-called abnormal NHCs (aNHCs) or mesoionic carbenes (iMICs), are however superior &#963;-donors than C2-carbenes. Hence, iMICs have substantial potential in sustainable synthesis and catalysis. The main obstacle in this direction is rather demanding synthetic accessibility of iMICs. The aim of this review article is to highlight recent advances, particularly by the author's research group, in accessing stable iMICs, quantifying their properties, and exploring their applications in synthesis and catalysis. In addition, the synthetic viability and use of vicinal C4,C5-anionic dicarbenes (ADCs), also based on an 1,3-imidazole framework, are presented. As will be apparent on following pages, iMICs and ADCs hold potentials in pushing the limit of classical NHCs by enabling access to conceptually new main-group heterocycles, radicals, molecular catalysts, ligands sets, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unravelling the Superiority of Nonbenzenoid Acepleiadylene as a Building Block for Organic Semiconducting Materials
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonbenzenoid acepleiadylene (APD) has been explored as a new building block to construct organic electronic material (APD&#8208;IID), which exhibits higher hole mobility than its pyrene&#8208;based isomers because of the stronger intermolecular interaction induced by the unique charge&#8208;separated character. These results demonstrate the superiority of nonbenzenoid arenes in the future development of organic semiconducting materials.







Abstract
Acepleiadylene (APD), a nonbenzenoid isomer of pyrene, exhibits a unique charge&#8208;separated character with a large molecular dipole and a small optical gap. However, APD has never been explored in optoelectronic materials to take advantage of these appealing properties. Here, we employ APD as a building block in organic semiconducting materials for the first time, and unravel the superiority of nonbenzenoid APD in electronic applications. We have synthesized an APD derivative (APD&#8208;IID) with APD as the terminal donor moieties and isoindigo (IID) as the acceptor core. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal that APD&#8208;IID has an obvious charge&#8208;separated structure and enhanced intermolecular interactions as compared with its pyrene&#8208;based isomers. As a result, APD&#8208;IID displays significantly higher hole mobilities than those of the pyrene&#8208;based counterparts. These results imply the advantages of employing APD in semiconducting materials and great potential of nonbenzenoid polycyclic arenes for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;s&#8208;indacene is a Bond&#8208;Localized C2h Structure and a Challenge for Computational Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;s&#8208;indacene is a computational challenge. Highly correlated methods and popular DFT functionals predict a bond&#8208;delocalized D2h symmetry, but excellent agreement between experimental and computed proton chemical shifts suggests a true C2h geometry.







Abstract
Whether tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;s&#8208;indacene is a symmetric D2h structure or a bond&#8208;alternating C2h structure remains a standing puzzle. Close agreement between experimental and computed proton chemical shifts based on minima structures optimized at the M06&#8208;2X, &#969;B97X&#8208;D, and M11 levels confirm a bond&#8208;localized C2h symmetry, which is consistent with the expected strong antiaromaticity of TtB&#8208;s&#8208;indacene.

         <dc:description>
Unprotected cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;diarylpiperidines are synthesized from readily available piperidines in only three operations. The key step is a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aryl halides and endocyclic 1&#8208;azallyl anions, elusive intermediates derived from the in situ deprotonation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;piperideines. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction can be achieved enantioselectively with a chiral mono&#8208;phosphine ligand.

These intermediates are generated in situ by the deprotonation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;piperideines, precursors that are readily prepared in two operations from simple piperidines. An asymmetric version of this reaction with (2R, 3R)&#8208;iPr&#8208;BI&#8208;DIME as the ligand provides products in moderate to good yields and enantioselectivities.

         <dc:description>
A nitrone&#8208;linked covalent organic framework, COF&#8208;115, has been synthesized for the first time via polycondensation reaction. The sorption analyses of COF&#8208;115 revealed a porosity of 1387&#8197;m2/g, and a superior potential for atmospheric water harvesting and CO2 capture applications compared to their imine&#8208;based analogs. Finally, COF&#8208;115 was found to undergo a photochemical rearrangement to the corresponding amide&#8208;linked material.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a nitrone&#8208;linked covalent organic framework, COF&#8208;115, by combining N, N&#8242;, N&#8242;, N&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(ethene&#8208;1, 1, 2, 2&#8208;tetrayltetrakis(benzene&#8208;4, 1&#8208;diyl))tetrakis(hydroxylamine) and terephthaladehyde via a polycondensation reaction. The formation of the nitrone functionality was confirmed by solid&#8208;state 13C multi cross&#8208;polarization magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy of the 13C&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeled COF&#8208;115 and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy. The permanent porosity of COF&#8208;115 was evaluated through low&#8208;pressure N2, CO2, and H2 sorption experiments. Water vapor and carbon dioxide sorption analysis of COF&#8208;115 and the isoreticular imine&#8208;linked COF indicated a superior potential of N&#8208;oxide&#8208;based porous materials for atmospheric water harvesting and CO2 capture applications. Density functional theory calculations provided valuable insights into the difference between the adsorption properties of these COFs. Lastly, photoinduced rearrangement of COF&#8208;115 to the associated amide&#8208;linked material was successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Chiral PSiSi&#8208;Ligand Enabled Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Intermolecular C&#8722;H Silylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of chiral pincer silyl ligand is developed, which enables an Iridium&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation reaction. Key to the success of this transformation is the use of a novel chiral PSiSi&#8208;ligand, which facilitates the C&#8722;H silylation process with high chemical, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;control via a multi&#8208;coordinated silyl iridium complex.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation offers an efficient approach for the rapid construction of chiral organosilicon compounds, but remains a significant challenge. Herein, a new type of chiral silyl ligand is developed, which enables the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation reaction of 2&#8208;arylisoquinolines. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, high atom economy, and remarkable yield with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 99&#8201;% ee), delivering enantioenriched axially chiral silane platform molecules with facile convertibility. Key to the success of this unprecedented transformation relies on a novel chiral PSiSi&#8208;ligand, which facilitates the intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation process with perfect chem&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;control via a multi&#8208;coordinated silyl iridium complex.

         <title>Autohydrolysis of Diglycine&#8208;Activated Succinic Esters Boosts Cellular Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxy&#8208;terminal diglycine&#8208;modified succinate compounds undergo autohydrolysis at physiological pH. This process converts supramolecular assemblies from nanofibers to nanoparticles for fast cellular uptake. This approach also restores drug efficacy, promoting effective intracellular therapeutics.







Abstract
Rapid cellular uptake of synthetic molecules remains a challenge, and the motif frequently employed to generate prodrugs, succinic ester, unfortunately lowers the efficacy of the desired drugs due to their slow ester hydrolysis and low cell entry. Here we show that succinic ester&#8208;containing diglycine drastically boosts the cellular uptake of supramolecular assemblies or prodrugs. Specifically, autohydrolysis of the diglycine&#8208;activated succinic esters turns the nanofibers of the conjugates of succinic ester and self&#8208;assembling motif into nanoparticles for fast cellular uptake. The autohydrolysis of diglycine&#8208;activated succinic esters and drug conjugates also restores the efficacy of the drugs. 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) suggests that a &#8220;U&#8208;turn&#8221; of diglycine favors intramolecular hydrolysis of diglycine&#8208;activated succinic esters to promote autohydrolysis. As an example of rapid autohydrolysis of diglycine&#8208;activated succinic esters for instant cellular uptake, this work illustrates a nonenzymatic bond cleavage approach to develop effective therapeutics for intracellular targeting.

         <title>Tracking an FeV(O) Intermediate for Water Oxidation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;rich and oxidation&#8208;resistant ligand is effective at stabilizing high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates involved in the water oxidation reaction. UV/Vis, XAS, EPR, electrochemical and kinetic measurements, allow a high&#8208;valent FeV(O) species that participates in O&#8722;O bond formation with higher reactivity and shorter lifetime to be tracked in a real catalytic water oxidation reaction.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species are appealing for conducting O&#8722;O bond formation for water oxidation reactions. However, their high reactivity poses a great challenge to the dissection of their chemical transformations. Herein, we introduce an electron&#8208;rich and oxidation&#8208;resistant ligand, 2&#8208;[(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridin)&#8208;6&#8208;yl]propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol to stabilize such fleeting intermediates. Advanced spectroscopies and electrochemical studies demonstrate a high&#8208;valent FeV(O) species formation in water. Combining kinetic and oxygen isotope labelling experiments and organic reactions indicates that the FeV(O) species is responsible for O&#8722;O bond formation via water nucleophilic attack under the real catalytic water oxidation conditions.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;cis Disubstituted Cycloalkanes by Convergent NiH Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NiH&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) of easily accessible racemic and isomeric mixture of cycloalkenes and a NiH&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization transformation of prochiral cyclic alkenes are reported. This migratory hydroalkylation process produces enantioenriched thermodynamically disfavored 1,2&#8208;cis disubstituted cycloalkanes with excellent levels of regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Enantioenriched multi&#8208;substituted cycloalkanes constitute an essential class of compounds in pharmaceuticals, natural products and agrochemicals. Here we report an NiH&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric migratory hydroalkylation process for the efficient and selective construction of such compounds. Through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT), easily accessible racemic and isomeric mixtures of cycloalkenes could be directly utilized as starting materials, convergently producing thermo&#8208;dynamically disfavored chiral 1,2&#8208;cis disubstituted cycloalkanes bearing vicinal stereocenters with high levels of regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. In addition, prochiral cyclic alkenes can be also employed, and deliver chiral 1,2&#8208;cis disubstituted cycloalkanes through desymmetrization process.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Aryl C&#8722;H Bond Cyclopropenylation with Cyclopropenium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules enables the installation of cyclopropene rings with excellent efficiency, thus reaching an uncharted cyclopropenylated chemical space. The cyclopropene ring generally improves the metabolic stability of the cyclopropenylated drug molecules and serves as a unique scaffold to access broad range of medically&#8208;relevant motifs.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose the first regio&#8208;, site&#8208; and chemoselective late&#8208;stage (hetero)aryl C&#8722;H bond cyclopropenylation with cyclopropenium cations (CPCs). The process is fast, operationally simple and shows an excellent functional group tolerance in densely&#8208;functionalized drug molecules, natural products, agrochemicals and fluorescent dyes. Moreover, we discovered that the installation of the cyclopropene ring in drug molecules could not only be used to shield against metabolic instability but also as a synthetic tool to reach medicinally&#8208;relevant sp3&#8208;rich scaffolds exploiting the highly&#8208;strained nature of the cyclopropene ring with known transformations.

         <title>Efficient C(sp3)&#8722;H Carbonylation of Light and Heavy Hydrocarbons with Carbon Monoxide via Hydrogen Atom Transfer Photocatalysis in Flow
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient C&#8722;H functionalization process, enabling the regioselective installation of carbonyls in light and heavy hydrocarbons by using inexpensive carbon monoxide. Safe processing of hazardous CO and flammable alkanes is ensured in flow, with high gas&#8208;liquid mass transfer rates and fast reaction kinetics. Our method demonstrates the valorization of gaseous reagents, coupling light alkanes, CO, and an olefin as a terminal radical trap.







Abstract
Despite their abundance in organic molecules, considerable limitations still exist in synthetic methods that target the direct C&#8722;H functionalization at sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. This is even more the case for light alkanes, which bear some of the strongest C&#8722;H bonds known in Nature, requiring extreme activation conditions that are not tolerant to most organic molecules. To bypass these issues, synthetic chemists rely on prefunctionalized alkyl halides or organometallic coupling partners. However, new synthetic methods that target regioselectively C&#8722;H bonds in a variety of different organic scaffolds would be of great added value, not only for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically active molecules but also for the catalytic upgrading of cheap and abundant hydrocarbon feedstocks. Here, we describe a general, mild and scalable protocol which enables the direct C(sp3)&#8722;H carbonylation of saturated hydrocarbons, including natural products and light alkanes, using photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and gaseous carbon monoxide (CO). Flow technology was deemed crucial to enable high gas&#8208;liquid mass transfer rates and fast reaction kinetics, needed to outpace deleterious reaction pathways, but also to leverage a scalable and safe process.

         <title>In situ Generated Iridium Nanoparticles as Hydride Donors in Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Reactions with Deuterium and Tritium Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the synergistic approach of in situ generated iridium nanoparticles in photoredox&#8208;catalyzed and CH&#8208;functionalization hydrogen isotope exchange with deuterium and tritium gas.







Abstract
We have studied the photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) reaction with deuterium or tritium gas as isotope sources and in situ formed transition metal nanoparticles as hydrogen atom transfer pre&#8208;catalysts. By this means we have found synergistic reactivities applying two different HIE mechanisms, namely photoredox&#8208;catalyzed and CH&#8208;functionalization HIE leading to the synthesis of highly deuterated complex molecules. Finally, we adopted these findings successfully to tritium chemistry.

         <title>Overlooked Formation of Carbonate Radical Anions in the Oxidation of Iron(II) by Oxygen in the Presence of Bicarbonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 36, September 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid generation of carbonate radical anions (CO3.&#8722;) in the oxidation of FeII by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate (HCO3&#8722;) is shown. The results highlight the importance of considering the formation of CO3.&#8722; in the geochemical cycling of iron and carbon and show that the presence of bicarbonate dramatically changes the mechanism and kinetics of the reaction of Fe(H2O)62++O2 under physiological and environmental conditions.







Abstract
Iron(II), (Fe(H2O)62+, (FeII) participates in many reactions of natural and biological importance. It is critically important to understand the rates and the mechanism of FeII oxidation by dissolved molecular oxygen, O2, under environmental conditions containing bicarbonate (HCO3&#8722;), which exists up to millimolar concentrations. In the absence and presence of HCO3&#8722;, the formation of reactive oxygen species (O2&#8901;&#8722;, H2O2, and HO&#8901;) in FeII oxidation by O2 has been suggested. In contrast, our study demonstrates for the first time the rapid generation of carbonate radical anions (CO3&#8901;&#8722;) in the oxidation of FeII by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate, HCO3&#8722;. The rate of the formation of CO3&#8901;&#8722; may be expressed as d[CO3&#8901;&#8722;]/dt=[FeII[[O2][HCO3&#8722;]2. The formation of reactive species was investigated using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and gas chromatographic techniques. The study presented herein provides new insights into the reaction mechanism of FeII oxidation by O2 in the presence of bicarbonate and highlights the importance of considering the formation of CO3&#8901;&#8722; in the geochemical cycling of iron and carbon.

         <title>Strong and Ultra&#8208;tough Ionic Hydrogel Based on Hyperbranched Macro&#8208;cross&#8208;linker: Influence of Topological Structure on Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of hydrogels often suffers from their inherent limitation of poor mechanical properties. Here, a carboxyl&#8208;functionalized and acryloyl&#8208;terminated hyperbranched polycaprolactone (PCL) was synthesized and used as a macro&#8208;cross&#8208;linker to fabricate a super strong and ultra&#8208;tough ionic hydrogel. The terminal acryloyl groups of hyperbranched PCL are chemically incorporated into the network to form covalent cross&#8208;links, which contribute to robust networks. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic domains formed by the spontaneous aggregation of PCL chains and coordination bonds between Fe3+ and COO&#8211; groups serve as dynamic non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;links, which enhance the energy dissipation ability. Especially, the influence of the hyperbranched topological structure of PCL on hydrogel properties has been well investigated, exhibiting superior strengthening and toughening effects compared to the linear one. Moreover, the hyperbranched PCL cross&#8208;linker also endowed the ionic hydrogel with higher sensitivity than the linear one when used as a strain sensor. As a result, this well&#8208;designed ionic hydrogel possesses high mechanical strength, superior toughness, and well ionic conductivity, exhibiting potential applications in the field of flexible strain sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis&#8208;Olefin Based Crystalline Schlenk Hydrocarbon Diradicals with a Triplet Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular approach for the synthesis of isolable crystalline Schlenk hydrocarbon diradicals from m&#8208;phenylene bridged electron&#8208;rich bis&#8208;triazaalkenes as synthons is reported. EPR spectroscopy confirms their diradical nature and triplet electronic structure by revealing a half&#8208;field signal. A computational analysis confirms the triplet state to be the ground state. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for the modular methodology, the 4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;m&#8208;phenylene was further utilized as a coupling unit between two alkene motifs. The steric conjunction of the 4,6&#8208;dimethyl groups substantially twists the substituents at the nonbonding electron bearing centers relative to the central coupling m&#8208;phenylene motif. As a result, the spin delocalization is decreased and the exchange coupling between the two unpaired spins, hence, significantly reduced. Notably, after 108 years of Schlenk&#8217;s m&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(diphenylmethyl) synthesis as diradical, for the first time we were able to isolate its derivative with the same spacer, i.e. m&#8208;phenylene, between two radical centers in a crystalline form.</dc:description>

         <title>Multitargeting prodrugs that release oxaliplatin, doxorubicin and gemcitabine are potent inhibitors of tumor growth and effective inducers of immunogenic cell death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multitargeting prodrug (2) that releases in cancer cells gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and doxorubicin in their active form is a potent cytotoxic agent with nM IC50s; is highly selective to cancer cells with mean selectivity indices to human (136) and murine (320) cancer cells. It effectively induces release of DAMPs (CALR, ATP &amp; HMGB1) in CT26 cells facilitating more efficient phagocytosis by J774 macrophages than the FDA drugs or their co&#8208;administration. The viability of CT26 cells co&#8208;cultured with J774 macrophages and treated with 2 was reduced by 32% compared to the non&#8208;treated, suggesting a synergistic antiproliferative effect between the chemical and immune reactions. 2 inhibited in vivo tumor growth in two murine models (LLC and CT26) better than the FDA drugs or their co&#8208;administration with significantly lower body weight loss. Mice inoculated with CT26 cells treated with 2 showed 80% tumor reduction in a re&#8208;challenge study compared to 73% induced by doxorubicin.</dc:description>

         <title>Durable Multiblock Poly(biphenyl alkylene) Anion Exchange Membranes with Microphase Separation for Hydrogen Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) and water electrolysis (AEMWE) show great application potential in the field of hydrogen energy conversion technology. However, scalable anion exchange membranes (AEMs) with desirable properties are still lacking, which greatly hampers the commercialization of this technology. Herein, we propose a series of novel multiblock AEMs based on ether&#8208;free poly(biphenyl ammonium&#8208;b&#8208;biphenyl phenyl)s (PBPA&#8208;b&#8208;BPPs) that are suitable for use in high performance AEMFC and AEMWE systems because of their well&#8208;formed microphase separation structures. The developed AEMs achieved outstanding OH&#8208; conductivity (162.2 mS cm&#8208;1 at 80 &#176;C) with a low swelling ratio, good alkaline stability, and excellent mechanical durability (tensile strength &gt; 31 MPa and elongation at break &gt; 147% after treatment in 2 M NaOH at 80 &#176;C for 3750 h). A PBPA&#8208;b&#8208;BPP&#8208;based AEMFC demonstrated a remarkable peak power density of 2.41 W cm&#8208;2 and in&#8208;situ durability for 330 h under 0.6 A cm&#8208;2 at 70 &#176;C. An AEMWE device showed a promising performance (6.25 A cm&#8208;2 at 2 V, 80 &#176;C) and outstanding in&#8208;situ durability for 3250 h with a low voltage decay rate (&lt;28 &#956;V h&#8208;1). The newly developed PBPA&#8208;b&#8208;BPP AEMs thus show great application prospects for energy conversion devices.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Formed Potassium&#8208;Modified Nickel&#8208;Zinc Carbide Boosts Production of Higher Alcohols beyond CH4 in CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni&#8208;based catalysts have been widely studied in the hydrogenation of CO2 to CH4, but selective and efficient synthesis of higher alcohols (C2+OH) from CO2 hydrogenation over Ni&#8208;based catalyst is still challenging due to successive hydrogenation of C1 intermediates leading to methanation. Herein, we report an unprecedented synthesis of C2+OH from CO2 hydrogenation over K&#8208;modified Ni&#8208;Zn bimetal catalyst with promising activity and selectivity. Systematic experiments (including XRD, in situ spectroscopic characterizations) and computational studies reveal the in situ generation of an active K&#8208;modified Ni&#8208;Zn carbide (K&#8208;Ni3Zn1C0.7) by carburization of Zn&#8208;incorporated Ni0, which can significantly enhance CO2 adsorption and the surface coverage of alkyl intermediates, and boost the C&#8208;C coupling to C2+OH rather than conventional CH4. This work opens a new catalyst avenue for the CO2 hydrogenation to C2+OH, and also provides an insightful example for the rational design of selective and efficient Ni&#8208;based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to multiple carbon products.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Small Air&#8208;Stable Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Nanoparticles for Anti&#8208;Stokes Time&#8208;Resolved Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Image contrast is often limited by background autofluorescence in steady&#8208;state bioimaging microscopy. Upconversion bioimaging can overcome this by shifting the emission lifetime and wavelength beyond the autofluorescence window. Here we demonstrate the first example of triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) based lifetime imaging microscopy. A new class of ultra&#8208;small nanoparticle (NP) probes based on TTA&#8208;UC chromophores encapsulated in an organic&#8208;inorganic host has been synthesized. The NPs exhibit bright UC emission (400&#8208;500 nm) in aerated aqueous media with a UC lifetime of ~1 &#956;s, excellent colloidal stability and little cytotoxicity. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of TTA&#8208;UC lifetime imaging using these NPs shows that the long&#8208;lived anti&#8208;Stokes emission is easily discriminable from typical autofluorescence. Moreover, fluctuations in the UC lifetime can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Image contrast is often limited by background autofluorescence in steady-state bioimaging microscopy. Upconversion bioimaging can overcome this by shifting the emission lifetime and wavelength beyond the autofluorescence window. Here we demonstrate the first example of triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) based lifetime imaging microscopy. A new class of ultra-small nanoparticle (NP) probes based on TTA-UC chromophores encapsulated in an organic-inorganic host has been synthesized. The NPs exhibit bright UC emission (400-500 nm) in aerated aqueous media with a UC lifetime of ~1 &#956;s, excellent colloidal stability and little cytotoxicity. Proof-of-concept demonstration of TTA-UC lifetime imaging using these NPs shows that the long-lived anti-Stokes emission is easily discriminable from typical autofluorescence. Moreover, fluctuations in the UC lifetime can be used to map local oxygen diffusion across the subcellular structure. Our TTA-UC NPs are highly promising stains for lifetime imaging microscopy, affording excellent image contrast and potential for oxygen mapping that is ripe for further exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improved Interfacial Ion Migration and Deposition through the Chain&#8211;Liquid Synergistic Effect by a Carboxylated Hydrogel Electrolyte for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The large&#8208;scale applicability of Zn&#8208;metal anodes is severely impeded by the issues such as the dendrite growth, complicated hydrogen evolution, and uncontrollable passivation reaction. Herein, a negatively charged carboxylated double&#8208;network hydrogel electrolyte (Gelatin/Sodium alginate&#8208;acetate, denoted as Gel/SA&#8208;acetate) has been developed to stabilize the interfacial electrochemistry, which restructures a type of Zn2+ ion solvent sheath optimized via a chain&#8208;liquid synergistic effect. New hydrogen bonds are reconstructed with water molecules by the zincophilic functional groups, and directional migration of hydrated Zn2+ ions is therefore induced. Concomitantly, the robust chemical bonding of such hydrogel layers to the Zn slab exhibits a desirable anti&#8208;catalytic effect, thereby greatly diminishing the water activity and eliminating side reactions. Subsequently, a symmetric cell using the Gel/SA&#8208;acetate electrolyte demonstrates a reversible plating/stripping performance for 1580 h, and an asymmetric cell reaches a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art runtime of 5600 h with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9%. The resultant zinc ion hybrid capacitors deliver exceptional properties including the capacity retention of 98.5% over 15000 cycles, energy density of 236.8 Wh kg&#8211;1, and high mechanical adaptability. This work is expected to pave a new avenue for the development of novel hydrogel electrolytes towards safe and stable Zn anodes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of pyridines for the synthesis of piperidines remains a challenge. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot asymmetric hydrogenation of pyridines with subsequent N&#8208;alkylation using a traceless Br&#248;nsted acid activation strategy. Catalyzed by the iridium&#8208;BINAP complex, the substrates undergo ketone reduction, cyclization and pyridine hydrogenation in sequence to form indolizidines and quinolizidines. The absolute configuration of&#160;the chiral center of the alcohol is retained and influences the formation of the second chiral center. The experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies reveal that the chloride anion and certain noncovalent interactions govern the stereoselectivity of the cascade reaction throughout the catalytic process.</dc:description>

         <title>Balancing Interfacial Reactions through Regulating p&#8208;Band Centers by an Indium Tin Oxide Protective Layer for Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new principle of regulating p&#8208;band center of metal oxide protective layer to balance Zn adsorption energy and migration energy barrier for effective Zn anode with long lifetime and low overpotential.







Abstract
Metallic zinc (Zn) is considered as one of the most attractive anode materials for the post&#8208;lithium metal battery systems owing to the high theoretical capacity, low cost, and intrinsic safety. However, the Zn dendrites and parasitic side reaction impede its application. Herein, we propose a new principle of regulating p&#8208;band center of metal oxide protective coating to balance Zn adsorption energy and migration energy barrier for effective Zn deposition and stripping. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that benefiting from the uniform zincophilic nucleation sites and fast Zn transport on indium tin oxide (ITO), highly stable and reversible Zn anode can be achieved. As a result, the I&#8722;Zn symmetrical cell achieves highly reversible Zn deposition/stripping with an extremely low overpotential of 9&#8197;mV and a superior lifespan over 4000&#8197;h. The Cu/I&#8722;Zn asymmetrical cell exhibits a long lifetime of over 4000&#8197;cycles with high average coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;%. Furthermore, the assembled I&#8722;Zn/AC full cell exhibits an excellent lifetime for 70000&#8197;cycles with nearly 100&#8201;% capacity retention. This work provides a general strategy and new insight for the construction of efficient Zn anode protection layer.

Abstract
Metal encapsulation in zeolitic materials through one&#8208;pot hydrothermal synthesis (HTS) is an attractive technique to prepare zeolites with a high metal dispersion. Due to its simplicity and the excellent catalytic performance observed for several catalytic systems, this method has gained a great deal of attention over the last few years. While most studies apply synthetic methods involving different organic ligands to stabilize the metal under synthesis conditions, here we report the use of metallosiloxanes as an alternative metal precursor. Metallosiloxanes can be synthesized from simple and cost&#8208;affordable chemicals and, when used in combination with zeolite building blocks under standard synthesis conditions, lead to quantitative metal loading and high dispersion. Thanks to the structural analogy of siloxane with TEOS, the synthesis gel stabilizes by forming siloxane bridges that prevent metal precipitation and clustering. When focusing on Fe&#8208;encapsulation, we demonstrate that Fe&#8208;MFI zeolites obtained by this method exhibit high catalytic activity in the NH3&#8208;mediated selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx along with a good H2O/SO2 tolerance. This synthetic approach opens a new synthetic route for the encapsulation of transition metals within zeolite structures.

         <title>Toward Magneto&#8208;Optical Cryogenic Thermometers with High Sensitivity: A Magnetic Circular Dichroism Based Thermometric Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the application potential of magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) techniques is showcased through the inaugural application of MCD&#8208;based magneto&#8208;optical thermometry. Leveraging the intrinsic temperature dependence of the MCD C&#8208;term, the presence of dual&#8208;signaled bands, and the amalgamation of multiparametric thermal read&#8208;out with multiple regression, remarkable sensitivities of up to 95.3&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 are achieved with the [Ho(acac)3(phen)] complex. This achievement establishes a new benchmark for thermal sensitivity values within the cryogenic range.







Abstract
Remote temperature probing at the cryogenic range is of utmost importance for the advancement of future quantum technologies. Despite the notable achievements in luminescent thermometers, accurately measuring temperatures below 10&#8197;K remains a challenging endeavor. In this study, we propose a novel magneto&#8208;optical thermometric approach based on the magnetic&#8208;circular dichroism (MCD) technique, which offers unprecedented capabilities for meticulous temperature variation analysis at cryogenic temperatures. The inherent temperature sensitivity of the MCD C&#8208;term, in conjunction with both positive and negative signals, enables highly sensitive magneto&#8208;optical temperature probing. Additionally, a groundbreaking relative thermal sensitivity value of 95.3&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 at 2.54&#8197;K can be achieved using a mononuclear lanthanide complex, [[Ho(acac)3(phen)], in the presence of a 0.25&#8197;T applied magnetic field and using a combination of multiparametric thermal read&#8208;out with multiple regression. These results unequivocally demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of our methodology for cryogenic temperature sensing.

         <title>Constructing Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid electrolyte interface plays an important role for the stability of zinc anodes. This Review summarizes the construction methods, formation mechanisms, composition and electrochemical performance of SEIs, thus providing guidance for the construction of high&#8208;performance zinc anodes.







Abstract
Problems of zinc anode including dendrite and hydrogen evolution seriously degrade the performance of zinc batteries. Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which plays a key role in achieving high reversibility of lithium anode in aprotic organic solvent, is also beneficial to performance improvement of zinc anode in aqueous electrolyte. However, various studies about interphase for zinc electrode is quite fragmented, and lack of deep understanding on root causes or general design rules for SEI construction. And water molecules with high reactivity brings serious challenge to the effective SEI construction. Here, we reviewed the brief development history of zinc batteries firstly, then summarized the approaches to construct SEI in aqueous electrolyte. Furthermore, the formation mechanisms behind approaches are systematically analyzed, together with discussion on the SEI components and evaluation on electrochemical performance of zinc anode with various types of SEI. Meanwhile, the challenge between lab and industrialization are also discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of Levulinic Acids From Muconic Acids in Hot Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrolysis of biorenewable muconic acids or their corresponding lactones in high temperature water allows the selective synthesis of levulinic acids. This enables direct access to novel substituted levulinic acids from biomass, creating novel opportunities for industrial applications. 3&#8208;Propyllevulinic acid was used to synthesize a novel plasticizer which performed equally well as a commercial, petrochemical phthalate&#8208;based benchmark.







Abstract
Levulinic acid is a key biorenewable platform molecule. Its current chemical production from sugars is plagued by limited yields, char formation and difficult separations. An alternative and selective route starting from muconic acid via simple heating in water at high temperature (180&#8201;&#176;C) has been developed. Muconic acid can be obtained from sugars or catechol fermentation. Chemical oxidation of catechol is another possibility which advantageously can also be applied on substituted catechols, hereby providing substituted muconic acids. When applying the disclosed hydrothermal protocol on these substrates hitherto unknown substituted levulinic acids were accessed. In particular, 3&#8208;propyllevulinic acid has been synthesized from 4&#8208;propylcatechol, prepared from pine wood. This propylated derivative has been used for the synthesis of a 3&#8208;propyllevulinate diester, i.e. butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl bis(4&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;propylpentanoate), via esterification with 1,4&#8208;butanediol. The diester showed superior performance as plasticizer in comparison to the corresponding levulinate diester in both PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and PLA (polylactic acid). It plasticizes equally effective as the notorious commercial phthalate&#8208;based benchmark DEHP (di&#8208;2&#8208;ethylhexyl phthalate) in PVC.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Corrole Radicals by Polycyclic Aromatic Fusion: Towards Open&#8208;Shell Near&#8208;Infrared Materials for Efficient Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stable &#960;&#8208;extended nickel corrole radicals and their cations exhibiting superior absorbing capacities across the visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region are synthesized via the radial fusion of aromatic rings. The nanoparticles encapsulating corrole radicals are high&#8208;performance photothermal agents and enable efficient NIR&#8208;triggered photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy in vivo.







Abstract
Open&#8208;shell radicals are promising near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal agents (PTAs) owing to their easily accessible narrow band gaps, but their stabilization and functionalization remain challenging. Herein, highly stable &#960;&#8208;extended nickel corrole radicals with [4n+1] &#960; systems are synthesized and used to prepare NIR&#8208;absorbing PTAs for efficient phototheranostics. The light&#8208;harvesting ability of corrole radicals gradually improves as the number of fused benzene rings on &#946;&#8208;pyrrolic locations increases radially, with naphthalene&#8208; and anthracene&#8208;fused radicals and their one&#8208;electron oxidized [4n] &#960; cations exhibiting panchromatic visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR absorption. The extremely low doublet excited states of corrole radicals promote heat generation via nonradiative decay. By encapsulating naphthocorrole radicals with amphiphilic polymer, water&#8208;soluble nanoparticles Na&#8208;NPs are produced, which exhibit outstanding photostability and high photothermal conversion efficiency of 71.8&#8201;%. In vivo anti&#8208;tumor therapy results indicate that Na&#8208;NPs enable photoacoustic imaging of tumors and act as biocompatible PTAs for tumor ablation when triggered by 808&#8197;nm laser light. The &#8220;aromatic&#8208;ring fusion&#8221; strategy for energy&#8208;gap tuning of corrole radicals opens a new platform for developing robust NIR&#8208;absorbing photothermal materials.

         <title>Pushing the Upper Limit of Nucleophilicity Scales by Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs) was synthesized and their reactions with Michael acceptors and CO2 investigated. The outstandingly high nucleophilicities of mNHOs were determined by kinetic measurements and located on the Mayr scale where they belong to the strongest carbon nucleophiles reported to date.







Abstract
A series of mesoionic, 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;derived N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (mNHOs), which have an extraordinarily electron&#8208;rich exocyclic CC&#8208;double bond, was synthesized and spectroscopically characterized, in selected cases by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The kinetics of their reactions with arylidene malonates, ArCH=C(CO2Et)2, which gave zwitterionic adducts, were investigated photometrically in THF at 20&#8201;&#176;C. The resulting second&#8208;order rate constants k2(20&#8201;&#176;C) correlate linearly with the reported electrophilicity parameters E of the arylidene malonates (reference electrophiles), thus providing the nucleophile&#8208;specific N and sN parameters of the mNHOs according to the correlation lg k2(20&#8201;&#176;C)=sN(N+E). With 21&lt;N&lt;32, the mNHOs are much stronger nucleophiles than conventional NHOs. Some mNHOs even excel the reactivity of mono&#8208; and diacceptor&#8208;substituted carbanions. It is exemplarily shown that the reactivity parameters thus obtained allow to calculate the rate constants for mNHO reactions with further Michael acceptors and predict the scope of reactions with other electrophilic reaction partners including carbon dioxide, which gives zwitterionic mNHO&#8208;carboxylates. The nucleophilicity parameters N correlate linearly with a linear combination of the quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl cation affinities and buried volumes of mNHOs, which offers a valuable tool to tailor the reactivities of strong carbon nucleophiles.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers of Bi&#8208;Functionalized Porphyrins: A Novel Class of Hole&#8208;Layer&#8208;Coordinating Perovskites and Indium Tin Oxide in Inverted Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a series of new self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) based on ZnII porphyrin for use as hole&#8208;selective layer (HSL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Our study successfully demonstrates the superior performance of dual carboxylic acid functionalized porphyrins can boost the solar efficiency of PSCs. The outstanding performance of these porphyrin SAMs lies in their inherent self&#8208;assembled properties and the presence of dual carboxylic acid groups that facilitate effective anchoring to both the ITO surface and perovskites.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) offer the advantage of facile interfacial modification, leading to significant improvements in device performance. In this study, we report the design and synthesis of a new series of carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized porphyrin derivatives, namely AC&#8208;1, AC&#8208;3, and AC&#8208;5, and present, for the first time, a strategy to exploit the large &#960;&#8208;moiety of porphyrins as a backbone for interfacing the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and perovskite active layer in an inverted perovskite solar cell (PSC) configuration. The electron&#8208;rich nature of porphyrins facilitates hole transfer and the formation of SAMs, resulting in a dense surface that minimizes defects. Comprehensive spectroscopic and dynamic studies demonstrate that the double&#8208;anchored AC&#8208;3 and AC&#8208;5 enhance SAMs on ITO, passivate the perovskite layer, and function as conduits to facilitate hole transfer, thus significantly boosting the performance of PSCs. The champion inverted PSC employing AC&#8208;5 SAM achieves an impressive solar efficiency of 23.19&#8201;% with a high fill factor of 84.05&#8201;%. This work presents a novel molecular engineering strategy for functionalizing SAMs to tune the energy levels, molecular dipoles, packing orientations to achieve stable and efficient solar performance.

     alt="Self-Assembled Monolayers of Bi-Functionalized Porphyrins: A Novel Class of Hole-Layer-Coordinating Perovskites and Indium Tin Oxide in Inverted Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed a series of new self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) based on Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; porphyrin for use as hole-selective layer (HSL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Our study successfully demonstrates the superior performance of dual carboxylic acid functionalized porphyrins can boost the solar efficiency of PSCs. The outstanding performance of these porphyrin SAMs lies in their inherent self-assembled properties and the presence of dual carboxylic acid groups that facilitate effective anchoring to both the ITO surface and perovskites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) offer the advantage of facile interfacial modification, leading to significant improvements in device performance. In this study, we report the design and synthesis of a new series of carboxylic acid-functionalized porphyrin derivatives, namely AC-1, AC-3, and AC-5, and present, for the first time, a strategy to exploit the large &#960;-moiety of porphyrins as a backbone for interfacing the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and perovskite active layer in an inverted perovskite solar cell (PSC) configuration. The electron-rich nature of porphyrins facilitates hole transfer and the formation of SAMs, resulting in a dense surface that minimizes defects. Comprehensive spectroscopic and dynamic studies demonstrate that the double-anchored AC-3 and AC-5 enhance SAMs on ITO, passivate the perovskite layer, and function as conduits to facilitate hole transfer, thus significantly boosting the performance of PSCs. The champion inverted PSC employing AC-5 SAM achieves an impressive solar efficiency of 23.19&#8201;% with a high fill factor of 84.05&#8201;%. This work presents a novel molecular engineering strategy for functionalizing SAMs to tune the energy levels, molecular dipoles, packing orientations to achieve stable and efficient solar performance. Importantly, our comprehensive investigation has unraveled the associated mechanisms, offering valuable insights for future advancements in PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;Disubstituted Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes catalyzed by Cu(I)&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;QUINOXP* is developed, affording a series of phosphine derivatives in high to excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrophosphination of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes is reported. It provides a series of phosphine derivatives in high to excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The methodology enjoys broad substrate scope on both 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes and diarylphosphines. The high stereoselectivity is attributed to both the high stability of the Cu(I)&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;QUINOXP* complex in the presence of stoichiometric HPPh2 and the produced phosphines, and the high&#8208;performance asymmetric induction of the Cu(I)&#8208;(R,R)&#8208;QUINOXP* complex. Finally, the method is used for the synthesis of new chiral phosphine&#8208;olefin compounds built on a cyclopropane skeleton, one of which serves as a wonderful ligand in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of phenylboronic acid to various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated compounds.

         <title>Ferricyanide Armed Anodes Enable Stable Water Oxidation in Saturated Saline Water at 2 A/cm2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous saline water electrolysis increases the concentration of Cl&#8722;, leading to severe anode corrosion. In this work, we have developed the anodes that could efficiently catalyze water oxidation in alkaline saturated saline water at ultra&#8208;high current densities up to 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over hundreds of hours. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the most stable brine oxidation electrodes reported to date.







Abstract
The direct seawater electrolysis at high current density and low overpotential affords an effective strategy toward clean and renewable hydrogen fuel production. However, the severe corrosion of anode as a result of the saturation of Cl&#8722; upon continuous seawater feeding seriously hamper the electrolytic process. Herein, cobalt ferricyanide / cobalt phosphide (CoFePBA/Co2P) anodes with Cap/Pin structure are synthesized, which stably catalyze alkaline saturated saline water oxidation at 200&#8211;2000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over hundreds of hours without corrosion. Together with the experimental findings, the molecular dynamics simulations reveal that PO43&#8722; and Fe(CN)63&#8722; generated by the electrode play synergistic role in repelling Cl&#8722; via electrostatic repulsion and dense coverage, which reduced Cl&#8722; adsorption by nearly 5&#8208;fold. The novel anionic synergy endow superior corrosion protection for the electrode, and is expected to promote the practical application of saline water electrolysis.

         <title>Elucidating the Underlying Reactivities of Alternating Current Electrosynthesis by Time&#8208;Resolved Mapping of Short&#8208;Lived Reactive Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A time&#8208;resolved operando electrochemical mass spectrometry platform was developed to elucidate the unique reactivities of alternating current (AC) electrosynthesis. Minimization of over&#8208;oxidation and effective reaction of the electrogenerated intermediates in AC electrolysis was demonstrated. Notably, the kinetics of reactive N&#8208;centered radical intermediates in multistep sequential AC electrosynthesis could be controlled to minimize side reactions.







Abstract
Alternating current (AC) electrolysis is an emerging field in synthetic chemistry, however its mechanistic studies are challenged by the effective characterization of the elusive intermediate processes. Herein, we develop an operando electrochemical mass spectrometry platform that allows time&#8208;resolved mapping of stepwise electrosynthetic reactive intermediates in both direct current and alternating current modes. By dissecting the key intermediate processes of electrochemical functionalization of arylamines, the unique reactivities of AC electrosynthesis, including minimizing the over&#8208;oxidation/reduction through the inverse process, and enabling effective reaction of short&#8208;lived intermediates generated by oxidation and reduction in paired electrolysis, were evidenced and verified. Notably, the controlled kinetics of reactive N&#8208;centered radical intermediates in multistep sequential AC electrosynthesis to minimize the competing reactions was discovered. Overall, this work provides direct evidence for the mechanism of AC electrolysis, and clarifies the underlying reasons for its high efficiency, which will benefit the rational design of AC electrosynthetic reactions.

         <title>Maximizing Electrostatic Polarity of Non&#8208;Sacrificial Electrolyte Additives Enables Stable Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of different saccharide molecules as non&#8208;sacrificial electrolyte additives in regulating Zn2+ desolvation and Zn deposition was investigated for the first time through experimental and theoretical studies.







Abstract
Although additives are widely used in aqueous electrolytes to inhibit the formation of dendrites and hydrogen evolution reactions on Zn anodes, there is a lack of rational design principles and systematic mechanistic studies on how to select a suitable additive to regulate reversible Zn plating/stripping chemistry. Here, using saccharides as the representatives, we reveal that the electrostatic polarity of non&#8208;sacrificial additives is a critical descriptor for their ability to stabilize Zn anodes. Non&#8208;sacrificial additives are found to continuously modulate the solvation structure of Zn ions and form a molecular adsorption layer (MAL) for uniform Zn deposition, avoiding the thick solid electrolyte interphase layer due to the decomposition of sacrificial additives. A high electrostatic polarity renders sucrose the best hydrated Zn2+ desolvation ability and facilitates the MAL formation, resulting in the best cycling stability with a long&#8208;term reversible plating/stripping cycle life of thousands of hours. This study provides theoretical guidance for the screening of optimal additives for high&#8208;performance ZIBs.

         <title>The Power of Action Plots: Unveiling Reaction Selectivity of Light&#8208;Stabilized Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The power of action plots is demonstrated by unveiling a reaction selective window between two different substituted triazolinediones that exhibit near identical absorbance spectra. The remarkable difference in photoreactivity is exploited by designing a dual&#8208;gated reaction manifold, which demonstrates the site&#8208;selective (photo)chemical behavior of both triazolinedione substrates within a single small molecule.







Abstract
Exploiting the optimum wavelength of reactivity for efficient photochemical reactions has been well&#8208;established based on the development of photochemical action plots. We herein demonstrate the power of such action plots by a remarkable example of the wavelength&#8208;resolved photochemistry of two triazolinedione (TAD) substrates, i.e., aliphatic and aromatic substituted, that exhibit near identical absorption spectra yet possess vastly disparate photoreactivity. We present our findings in carefully recorded action plots, from which reaction selectivity is identified. The profound difference in photoreactivity is exploited by designing a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; bisfunctional TAD molecule, enabling the formation of a dual&#8208;gated reaction manifold that demonstrates the exceptional and site&#8208;selective (photo)chemical behavior of both TAD substrates within a single small molecule.

&lt;p&gt;The power of action plots is demonstrated by unveiling a reaction selective window between two different substituted triazolinediones that exhibit near identical absorbance spectra. The remarkable difference in photoreactivity is exploited by designing a dual-gated reaction manifold, which demonstrates the site-selective (photo)chemical behavior of both triazolinedione substrates within a single small molecule.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploiting the optimum wavelength of reactivity for efficient photochemical reactions has been well-established based on the development of photochemical action plots. We herein demonstrate the power of such action plots by a remarkable example of the wavelength-resolved photochemistry of two triazolinedione (TAD) substrates, i.e., aliphatic and aromatic substituted, that exhibit near identical absorption spectra yet possess vastly disparate photoreactivity. We present our findings in carefully recorded action plots, from which reaction selectivity is identified. The profound difference in photoreactivity is exploited by designing a &#8216;hybrid&#8217; bisfunctional TAD molecule, enabling the formation of a dual-gated reaction manifold that demonstrates the exceptional and site-selective (photo)chemical behavior of both TAD substrates within a single small molecule.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Recycling of Gold and Copper from Electronic Waste by Selective Precipitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and selective recovery of gold and copper is achieved using triphenylphosphine oxide and 2,3&#8208;pyrazinedicarboxylic acid, respectively from 2&#8197;M HCl e&#8208;waste leach solutions. The selectivity of these precipitation methods, together with their ease of operation and capacity to recycle and reuse the precipitants, offers potential applications in the purification of Au and Cu from various metal sources.







Abstract
The recycling of metals from electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) using efficient, selective, and sustainable processes is integral to circular economy and net&#8208;zero aspirations. Herein, we report a new method for the selective precipitation of metals such as gold and copper that offsets the use of organic solvents that are traditionally employed in solvent extraction processes. We show that gold can be selectively precipitated from a mixture of metals in hydrochloric acid solution using triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO), as the complex [(TPPO)4(H5O2)][AuCl4]. By tuning the acid concentration, controlled precipitation of gold, zinc and iron can be achieved. We also show that copper can be selectively precipitated using 2,3&#8208;pyrazinedicarboxylic acid (2,3&#8208;PDCA), as the complex [Cu(2,3&#8208;PDCA&#8208;H)2]n&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2n(H2O). The combination of these two precipitation methods resulted in the recovery of 99.5&#8201;% of the Au and 98.5&#8201;% of the Cu present in the connector pins of an end&#8208;of&#8208;life computer processing unit. The selectivity of these precipitation processes, combined with their straightforward operation and the ability to recycle and reuse the precipitants, suggests potential industrial uses in the purification of gold and copper from e&#8208;waste.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Metaphanine and Oxoepistephamiersine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two complex hasubanan alkaloids were synthesized from inexpensive cyclohexanedione monoethylene acetal by a divergent route featuring a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization. Regioselective Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation followed by MeNH2&#8208;triggered skeletal reorganization formed the benzannulated aza[4.4.3]propellane, and late&#8208;stage regio&#8208; and diastereoselective oxidative annulation of a sp3 C&#8722;H bond formed the challenging tetrahydrofuran ring system.







Abstract
Herein, we report a concise and divergent synthesis of the complex hasubanan alkaloids metaphanine and oxoepistephamiersine from commercially available and inexpensive cyclohexanedione monoethylene acetal. Our synthesis features a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization reaction to set the tricyclic carbon framework of the desired molecules, a regioselective Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation followed by a MeNH2 triggered skeletal reorganization cascade to construct the benzannulated aza[4.4.3]propellane, and a strategically late&#8208;stage regio&#8208;/diastereoselective oxidative annulation of sp3 C&#8722;H bond to form the challenging THF ring system and hemiketal moiety in a single step. In addition, a highly enantioselective alkylation of cyclohexanedione monoethylene acetal paved the way for the asymmetric synthesis of target molecular.

         <title>Few&#8208;Layer Fullerene Network for Photocatalytic Pure Water Splitting into H2 and H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A few&#8208;layer fullerene C60 network was successfully synthesized and explored for photocatalytic water splitting into H2 and H2O2 under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The mechanism for water splitting of the few&#8208;layer C60 catalyst was investigated.







Abstract
A few&#8208;layer fullerene network possesses several advantageous characteristics, including a large surface area, abundant active sites, high charge mobility, and an appropriate band gap and band edge for solar water splitting. Herein, we report for the first time that the few&#8208;layer fullerene network shows interesting photocatalytic performance in pure water splitting into H2 and H2O2 in the absence of any sacrificial reagents. Under optimal conditions, the H2 and H2O2 evolution rates can reach 91 and 116&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, with good stability. This work demonstrates the novel application of the few&#8208;layer fullerene network in the field of energy conversion.

         <title>Polymeric Carbon Nitride with Chirality Inherited from Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;scale synthesis of chiral polymeric carbon nitride (CN) powder and electrode capable of enantioselective recognition from chiral supramolecular assemblies as monomers is reported. The optimized chiral CN exhibits good chiral recognition for tartaric acid, with an enantioselective preference of ca. 14&#8201;% for the D enantiomer.







Abstract
The facile synthesis of chiral materials is of paramount importance for various applications. Supramolecular preorganization of monomers for thermal polymerization has been proven as an effective tool to synthesize carbon and carbon nitride&#8208;based (CN) materials with ordered morphology and controlled properties. However, the transfer of an intrinsic chemical property, such as chirality from supramolecular assemblies to the final material after thermal condensation, was not shown. Here, we report the large&#8208;scale synthesis of chiral CN materials capable of enantioselective recognition. To achieve this, we designed supramolecular assemblies with a chiral center that remains intact at elevated temperatures. The optimized chiral CN demonstrates an enantiomeric preference of ca. 14&#8201;%; CN electrodes were also prepared and show stereoselective interactions with enantiomeric probes in electrochemical measurements. By adding chirality to the properties transferrable from monomers to the final product of a thermal polymerization, this study confirms the potential of using supramolecular precursors to produce carbon and CN materials and electrodes with designed chemical properties.

         <title>Harnessing Aromatic&#8208;Histidine Interactions through Synergistic Backbone Extension and Side Chain Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational and coordinated side chain modification and backbone extension, by replacing &#945;&#8208;amino acid residues with &#946;&#8208;amino acid residues, enables favorable interaction between a His side chain on a target protein and an aromatic side chain on a synthetic peptide ligand. This strategy, which enhances affinity, is showcased with peptides that bind to the parathyroid hormone receptor 1.







Abstract
Peptide engineering efforts have delivered drugs for diverse human diseases. Side chain alteration is among the most common approaches to designing new peptides for specific applications. The peptide backbone can be modified as well, but this strategy has received relatively little attention. Here we show that new and favorable contacts between a His side chain on a target protein and an aromatic side chain on a synthetic peptide ligand can be engineered by rational and coordinated side chain modification and backbone extension. Side chain modification alone was unsuccessful. Binding measurements, high&#8208;resolution structural studies and pharmacological outcomes all support the synergy between backbone and side chain modification in engineered ligands of the parathyroid hormone receptor&#8208;1, which is targeted by osteoporosis drugs. These results should motivate other structure&#8208;based designs featuring coordinated side chain modification and backbone extension to enhance the engagement of peptide ligands with target proteins.

These results should motivate other structure-based designs featuring coordinated side chain modification and backbone extension to enhance the engagement of peptide ligands with target proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking the Transition of Electrochemical Water Oxidation Mechanism Induced by Heteroatom Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by using P and S&#8208;doped Ni&#8722;Fe mixed oxides as model catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), we discover that heteroatom doping triggers the OER mechanism transition from the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism (LOM) by enlarging metal&#8208;oxygen covalency.







Abstract
Heteroatom doping has emerged as a highly effective strategy to enhance the activity of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is widely accepted that the doping does not switch the OER mechanism from the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism (LOM), and the enhanced activity is attributed to the optimized binding energies toward oxygen intermediates. However, this seems inconsistent with the fact that the overpotential of doped OER electrocatalysts (&lt;300&#8197;mV) is considerably smaller than the limit of AEM (&gt;370&#8197;mV). To determine the origin of this inconsistency, we select phosphorus (P)&#8208;doped nickel&#8208;iron mixed oxides as the model electrocatalysts and observe that the doping enhances the covalency of the metal&#8208;oxygen bonds to drive the OER pathway transition from the AEM to the LOM, thereby breaking the adsorption linear relation between *OH and *OOH in the AEM. Consequently, the obtained P&#8208;doped oxides display a small overpotential of 237&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Beyond P, the similar pathway transition is also observed on the sulfur doping. These findings offer new insights into the substantially enhanced OER activity originating from heteroatom doping.

         <title>Searching the Chemical Space of Bicyclic Dienes for Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage Candidates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Illustration of the relative speed with which a large chemical space of bicyclic dienes can be screened for molecular solar thermal energy storage candidates. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is as illustrated not a feasible route due to computational cost, while extended tight binding (xTB) methods are much faster and can give estimates.







Abstract
Photoswitches are molecular systems that are chemically transformed subsequent to interaction with light and they find potential application in many new technologies. The design and discovery of photoswitch candidates require intricate molecular engineering of a range of properties to optimize a candidate to a specific applications, a task which can be tackled efficiently using quantum chemical screening procedures. In this paper, we perform a large scale screening of approximately half a million bicyclic diene photoswitches in the context of molecular solar thermal energy storage using ab initio quantum chemical methods. We further device an efficient strategy for scoring the systems based on their predicted solar energy conversion efficiency and elucidate potential pitfalls of this approach. Our search through the chemical space of bicyclic dienes reveals systems with unprecedented solar energy conversion efficiencies and storage densities that show promising design guidelines for next generation molecular solar thermal energy storage systems.

         <title>Sodium Bicarbonate Nanoparticles for Amplified Cancer Immunotherapy by Inducing Pyroptosis and Regulating Lactic Acid Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and drug&#8208;free inorganic nanomaterial, alkalescent sodium bicarbonate nanoparticles (NaHCO3 NPs), was obtained to regulate lactic acid metabolism through acid&#8208;base neutralization, and thus to reverse the mildly acidic immunosuppressive tumor environment. Furthermore, it can release high amounts of Na+ ions and induce a surge in intracellular osmolarity to activate the pyroptosis pathway and improve immune responses.







Abstract
Although immunotherapy has a broad clinical application prospect, it is still hindered by low immune responses and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, a simple and drug&#8208;free inorganic nanomaterial, alkalescent sodium bicarbonate nanoparticles (NaHCO3 NPs), is prepared via a fast microemulsion method for amplified cancer immunotherapy. The obtained alkalescent NaHCO3 regulates lactic acid metabolism through acid&#8208;base neutralization so as to reverse the mildly acidic immunosuppressive tumor environment. Additionally, it can further release high amounts of Na+ ions inside tumor cells and induce a surge in intracellular osmolarity, and thus activate the pyroptosis pathway and immunogenic cell death (ICD), release damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and inflammatory factors, and improve immune responses. Collectively, NaHCO3 NPs observably inhibit primary/distal tumor growth and tumor metastasis through acid neutralization remitted immunosuppression and pyroptosis induced immune activation, showing an enhanced antitumor immunity efficiency. This work provides a new paradigm for lactic acid metabolism and pyroptosis mediated tumor treatment, which has a potential for application in clinical tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Manganese/Cobalt Bimetallic Relay Catalysis for Divergent Dehydrogenative Difluoroalkylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The involvement of manganese radical for halogen atom transfer (XAT) reactions has been esteemed as one reliable method but encountered with limited catalytic models. In this paper, a novel bimetallic relay catalysis of Mn2(CO)10 and cobaloxime has been developed for divergent dehydrogenative difluoroalkylation of alkenes using commercially available difluoroalkyl bromides. A wide range of structurally diverse terminal, cyclic and internal alkenes as well as tetrasubstituted alkenes are found to be good coupling partners to deliver difluoroalkylated allylic products and difluoromethylated cyclic products, accompanied with the production of H2 as the by&#8208;product. This bimetallic relay strategy features broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions and excellent functional group compatibility. Its success represents an important step&#8208;forward to expedite the construction of a rich library of difluoroalkylated products.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Reaction Configuration by Breaking the Structural Symmetry of Active Sites for Efficient Photocatalytic Reduction of Low&#8208;concentration CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 is considered as a promising way to simultaneously mitigate the environmental and energy issues. However, the weak CO2 adsorption and tough CO2 activation process seriously compromise the CO production, due to the chemical inertness of CO2 molecule and the formed fragile metal&#8208;C/O bond. Herein, we designed and fabricated oxygen vacancy contained Co3O4 hollow nanoparticles on ordered macroporous N&#8208;doped carbon framework (Vo&#8208;HCo3O4/OMNC) towards photoreduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2. In&#8208;situ spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the constructed oxygen vacancy is able to break the local structural symmetry of Co&#8208;O&#8208;Co sites. The formation of asymmetric active site switches the CO2 configuration from a single&#8208;site linear model to a multiple&#8208;sites bending one with a highly stable configuration, enhancing the binding and structural polarization of CO2 molecules. As a result, Vo&#8208;HCo3O4/OMNC shows unprecedent activity in the photocatalytic conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 (10% CO2/Ar) under laboratory light source or even natural sunlight, affording a syngas yield of 337.8 or 95.2 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, respectively, with an apparent quantum yield up to 4.2%.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Role of the Ser&#8208;Phosphorylation Pattern on the DNA&#8208;Binding Activity of Max Transcription Factor Using Chemical Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical synthesis of site&#8208;specifically modified transcription factors (TFs) is a powerful method to investigate how post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) influence TF&#8208;DNA interactions and impact gene expression. Among these TFs, Max plays a pivotal role in controlling the expression of 15% of the genome. The activity of Max is regulated by PTMs; Ser&#8208;phosphorylation at the N&#8208;terminus is considered one of the key regulatory mechanisms. However, the molecular impact of the phosphorylation pattern on the DNA binding and sequence specificities remains elusive. Here, we developed a practical synthetic strategy to prepare homogeneous full&#8208;length Max for the first time, to explore the impact of Max phosphorylation. We prepared a focused library of eight Max variants, with distinct modification patterns, including mono&#8208;phosphorylated, and doubly&#8208;phosphorylated analogs at Ser2/ Ser11 as well as fluorescently&#8208;labeled variants via native chemical ligation. Through comprehensive DNA binding analyses, we discovered that the phosphorylation position plays a crucial role in Max's DNA binding activity. Furthermore, in&#8208;vitro high&#8208;throughput analysis using DNA microarrays revealed that the N&#8208;terminus phosphorylation pattern does not interfere with Max's DNA sequence specificity. Our work provides insights into the regulatory role of Max's phosphorylation on the DNA interactions and sequence specificity, shedding light on how PTMs influence TF function.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Electrocatalytic Olefin Hydrogenation in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective hydrogenation of olefins with green water as hydrogen source at ambient conditions is still a big challenge in the field of catalysis. Herein, the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of purely aliphatic and functionalized olefins were achieved by using graphdiyne based copper oxide quantum dots (CuxO/GDY) as cathodic electrodes and water as the hydrogen source, with high activity and selectivity in aqueous solution at high current density under ambient temperature and pressure. Especially, the sp&#8208;/sp2&#8208;hybridized graphdiyne catalyst allows the selective hydrogenation of cis&#8208;trans isomeric olefins. The GDY's special chemical and electronic structure result in the incomplete charge transfer between GDY and Cu atoms&#160;to optimize the adsorption/desorption of the reaction intermediates and finally resulting in high reaction selectivity and activity for hydrogenations.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum(II)&#8208;Based Optical Probes for Imaging Quadruplex DNA Structures via Phosphorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplex DNA is a non&#8208;canonical structure that forms in guanine&#8208;rich regions of the genome. There is increasing evidence showing that G&#8208;quadruplexes have important biological functions, and therefore molecular tools to visualise these structures are important. Herein we report on a series of new cyclometallated platinum(II) complexes which, upon binding to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA, display an increase in their phosphorescence, acting as switch&#8208;on probes. More importantly, upon binding to G&#8208;quadruplexes they display a selective and distinct lengthening of their emission lifetime. We show that this effect can be used to selectively visualise these structures in cells using Phosphorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (PLIM).</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Catalyzed Defluorination of Aromatic Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biodegradability of many fluorinated compounds is limited due to the robustness of the C&#8208;F bond. Recently, experimental studies suggested the potential involvement of cytochrome P450 enzymes in facilitating aromatic defluorination, raising questions where this can be applied in biocatalysis. Our study offers an in&#8208;depth computational examination into the oxidative defluorination process of a drug molecule, mediated by cytochrome P450 Compound I. We explored a large number of potential mechanisms, and identify two competitive low&#8208;energy pathways that are initiated with an electrophilic attack on the aromatic ring, and followed by either a 1,2&#8208;fluorine shift or a ring&#8208;closure to form an epoxide intermediate. Both of these intermediates are shown to react rapidly through defluorination assisted by a solvent proton. Interestingly, defluorination in the vicinity of a heme group may generate a stable iron(III)&#8208;fluoride complex, potentially leading to enzyme inactivation.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversely Trapping Isolated Atoms in High Oxidation for Accelerating the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount to the energy conversion and storage devices. However, the structural complexity of heterogeneous electrocatalysts makes it a great challenge to elucidate the dynamic structural evolution and OER mechanisms. Here, we develop a controllable atom&#8208;trapping strategy to extract isolated Mo atom from the MoOx&#8208;decorated CoSe2 (a&#8208;MoOx@CoSe2) pre&#8208;catalyst into Co&#8208;based oxyhydroxide (Mo&#8208;CoOOH) through an ultra&#8208;fast self&#8208;reconstruction process during the OER process. This conceptual advance has been validated by operando characterizations, which reveals that the initially rapid Mo leaching can expedite the dynamic reconstruction of pre&#8208;catalyst, and simultaneously trap Mo species in high oxidation state into the lattice of in&#8208;situ generated CoOOH support. Impressively, the OER kinetics of CoOOH has been greatly accelerated after the reverse decoration of Mo species, in which the Mo&#8208;CoOOH affords a markedly decreased overpotential of 297 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm&#8211;2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Co species have been greatly activated via the effective electron coupling with Mo species in high oxidation state. These findings open new avenues toward directly synthesizing atomically dispersed electrocatalysts for high&#8208;efficiency water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation by Interfacial&#160;Phase Transition and Photothermal Effect in Multiply&#160;Heterostructured Co9S8/Co3S4/Cu2S Nanohybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational design of advanced nanohybrids (NHs) with optimized interface electronic environment and rapid reaction kinetics is pivotal to electrocatalytic schedule. Herein, we developed a multiple heterogeneous Co9S8/Co3S4/Cu2S nanoparticle in which Co3S4 germinates between Co9S8 and Cu2S. Using high&#8208;angle annular&#8208;dark&#8208;field imaging and theoretical calculation, it was found that the integration of Co9S8 and Cu2S tends to trigger the interface phase transition of Co9S8, leading to Co3S4 interlayer due to the low formation energy of Co3S4/Cu2S (&#8208;7.61 eV) than Co9S8/Cu2S (&#8208;5.76 eV). Such phase transition not only lowers the energy barrier of oxygen evolution reaction (OER, from 0.335 eV to 0.297 eV), but also increases charge carrier density (from 7.76&#215;1014 to 2.09&#215;1015 cm&#8208;3), and creates more active sites. Compared to Co9S8 and Cu2S, the Co9S8/Co3S4/Cu2S NHs also demonstrate notable photothermal effect that can heat the catalyst locally, offset the endothermic enthalpy change of OER, and promote carrier migrate, reaction intermediates adsorption/deprotonation to improve reaction kinetics. Profiting from these favorable factors, the Co9S8/Co3S4/Cu2S catalyst only requires an OER overpotential of 181 mV and overall water splitting cell voltage of 1.43 V to driven 10 mA cm&#8208;2 under the irradiation of near&#8208;infrared light, outperforming those without light irradiation&#160;and many reported Co&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Achiral Au(I) Cyclic Trinuclear Complexes with High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Near&#8208;Infrared TADF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region is challenging and valuable for luminescent material, especially for thermally activated delay fluorescence (TADF) material. In this work, we report two achiral cyclic trinuclear Au(I) complexes, Au3(4&#8208;Clpyrazolate)3 and Au3(4&#8208;Brpyrazolate)3 (denoted as Cl&#8208;Au and Br&#8208;Au), obtained through the reaction of 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole and 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole with Au(I) salts, respectively. Both Cl&#8208;Au and Br&#8208;Au exhibit TADF with high PLQY (&gt;70%) in the NIR I (700~900 nm) (&#955;max = 720 nm) region, exceeding other NIR&#8208;TADF emitters in the solid state. Photophysical experiments and theoretical calculations confirmed the efficient NIR&#8208;TADF properties of Cl&#8208;Au and Br&#8208;Au were attributed to the small energy gap &#916;E(S1&#8208;T2) and the large spin&#8208;orbital coupling induced by ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer of molecular aggregations. In addition, both complexes crystallize in the achiral Pna21 space group (mm2 point group) and are circularly polarized light (CPL) active with maxima luminescent dissymmetry factor glum of 3.4 &#215; 10&#8208;3 (Cl&#8208;Au) and 2.7 &#215; 10&#8208;3 (Br&#8208;Au) for their crystalline powder samples, respectively. By using Cl&#8208;Au as the emitting ink, 3D&#8208;printed luminescent logos are fabricated, which own anti&#8208;counterfeiting functions due to its CPL behavior dependent on the crystallinity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of a nickel(II) catalyst and a mechanoredox catalyst under ball&#8208;milling conditions promotes mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;driven C&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In this nickel(II)/mechanoredox cocatalyst system, the modulation of the oxidation state of the nickel center, induced by piezoelectricity, is used to facilitate a highly efficient aryl&#8208;amination reaction, which is characterized by a broad substrate scope, an inexpensive combination of catalysts (NiBr2 and BaTiO3), short reaction times, and an almost negligible quantity of solvents. Moreover, this reaction can be readily up&#8208;scaled to the multi&#8208;gram scale, and all synthetic operations can be carried out under atmospheric conditions without the need for complicated reaction setups. Furthermore, this force&#8208;induced system is suitable for excitation&#8208;energy&#8208;accepting molecules and poorly soluble polyaromatic substrates that are incompatible with solution&#8208;based nickel(II)/photoredox cocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing Spiro&#8208;locks into the Nitrogen/Carbonyl System towards Efficient Narrowband Deep&#8208;blue Multi&#8208;resonance TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various spiro&#8208;locks were introduced into the nitrogen/carbonyl&#8208;based multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) system via a designed synthetic route. The introduction of spiro&#8208;locks increased molecular rigidity and suppressed intermolecular interactions. Thus, narrowband deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence spectra and improved device efficiencies were achieved simultaneously.







Abstract
The current availability of multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials with excellent color purity and high device efficiency in the deep&#8208;blue region is appealing. To address this issue in the emerged nitrogen/carbonyl MR&#8208;TADF system, we propose a spiro&#8208;lock strategy. By incorporating spiro functionalization into a concise molecular skeleton, a series of emitters (SFQ, SOQ, SSQ, and SSeQ) can enhance molecular rigidity, blue&#8208;shift the emission peak, narrow the emission band, increase the photoluminescence quantum yield by over 92&#8201;%, and suppress intermolecular interactions in the film state. The referent CZQ without spiro structure has a more planar skeleton, and its bluer emission in the solution state redshifts over 40&#8197;nm with serious spectrum broadening and a low PLQY in the film state. As a result, SSQ achieves an external quantum efficiency of 25.5&#8201;% with a peak at 456&#8197;nm and a small full width at half maximum of 31&#8197;nm in a simple unsensitized device, significantly outperforming CZQ. This work discloses the importance of spiro&#8208;junction in modulating deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Defect Rich Structure Activated 3D Palladium Catalyst for Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of defect&#8208;rich structures (stacking faults, twin boundaries, lattice distortion, steps, and edges), low coordination number (CN), and tensile strain in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) urchin&#8208;like palladium nanoparticles through chlorine bonded with sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY) can regulate the arrangement of metal atoms. The as&#8208;prepared Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY are highly efficient and durable methanol oxidation reaction electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Controlling the structure and properties of catalysts through atomic arrangement is the source of producing a new generation of advanced catalysts. A highly active and stable catalyst in catalytic reactions strongly depends on an ideal arrangement structure of metal atoms. We demonstrated that the introduction of the defect&#8208;rich structures, low coordination number (CN), and tensile strain in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) urchin&#8208;like palladium nanoparticles through chlorine bonded with sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY) can regulate the arrangement of metal atoms in the palladium nanoparticles to form a special structure. In situ Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and theoretical calculation results show that Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY catalyst is beneficial to the oxidation and removal of CO intermediates. The Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) that display high current density (363.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and mass activity (3.6&#8197;A&#8201;mgPd&#8722;1), 12.0 and 10.9&#8197;times higher than Pd nanoparticles, respectively. The Pd&#8208;UNs/Cl&#8208;GDY catalyst also exhibited robust stability with still retained 95&#8201;% activity after 2000 cycles. A defects libraries of the face&#8208;centered cubic and hexagonal close&#8208;packed crystal catalysts (FH&#8208;NPs) were synthesized by introducing chlorine in graphdiyne. Such defect&#8208;rich structures, low CN, and tensile strain tailoring methods have opened up a new way for the catalytic reaction of MOR.

         <title>Liquids with Permanent Macroporosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tao Li and co&#8208;workers reported a material based on metal&#8211;organic framework nanocrystals which contains the largest reported permanent pores for a liquid. They described the CO2 and water adsorption, as well as the thermal switching properties of the porous liquid. This is the first example of a dual micro&#8208;macroporous liquid created using design rules of hierarchical porosity.







Abstract
Permanent macropores (&gt;50&#8197;nm) had not been reported in the liquid state until a recent report by Tao Li and co&#8208;workers describing a synthetic strategy to form a porous liquid with dual micro&#8208;macroporosity. This is prepared by producing hierarchically porous particles that are surface coated and fluidised by dispersion. Surface micropores enable permanent porosity by steric exclusion of the fluid phase. The material has a considerable water uptake capacity (27&#8201;% w/w) due to large (480&#8197;nm) unoccupied macropores. This also enables switching of thermal conductivity on uptake of water. These are new properties translated from porous solids to the liquid state.

         <title>A Fixable Fluorescence&#8208;Quenched Substrate for Quantitation of Lysosomal Glucocerebrosidase Activity in Both Live and Fixed Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescence&#8208;quenched substrate for glucocerebrosidase that can be conveniently fixed using standard conditions enables quantitative measurement of enzyme activity within lysosomes in both live and fixed cells, as well as antibody co&#8208;staining of cellular proteins.







Abstract
Fluorogenic substrates are emerging tools that enable studying enzymatic processes within their native cellular environments. However, fluorogenic substrates that function within live cells are generally incompatible with cellular fixation, preventing their tandem application with fundamental cell biology methods such as immunocytochemistry. Here we report a simple approach to enable the chemical fixation of a dark&#8208;to&#8208;light substrate, LysoFix&#8208;GBA, which enables quantification of glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity in both live and fixed cells. LysoFix&#8208;GBA enables measuring responses to both chemical and genetic perturbations to lysosomal GCase activity. Further, LysoFix&#8208;GBA permits simple multiplexed co&#8208;localization studies of GCase activity with subcellular protein markers. This tool will aid studying the role of GCase activity in Parkinson's Disease, creating new therapeutic approaches targeting the GCase pathway. This approach also lays the foundation for an approach to create fixable substrates for other lysosomal enzymes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview provides an overview of recent developments in target&#8208;specific bioorthogonal reactions and their applications for different therapeutic targets. In addition, a perspective is provided on the challenges and future directions of this emerging field for expanding their practical application.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry is a promising toolbox for dissecting biological processes in the native environment. Recently, bioorthogonal reactions have attracted considerable attention in the medical field for treating diseases, since this approach may lead to improved drug efficacy and reduced side effects via in situ drug synthesis. For precise biomedical applications, it is a prerequisite that the reactions should occur in the right locations and on the appropriate therapeutic targets. In this minireview, we highlight the design and development of targeted bioorthogonal reactions for precise medical treatment. First, we compile recent strategies for achieving target&#8208;specific bioorthogonal reactions. Further, we emphasize their application for the precise treatment of different therapeutic targets. Finally, a perspective is provided on the challenges and future directions of this emerging field for safe, efficient, and translatable disease treatment.

         <title>Sonodynamic Cytokine Nanocomplexes with Specific Stimulation towards Effector T Cell for Combination Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

The sonodynamic cytokine nanocomplexes (SPNAI) can not only specifically activate effector T cells (Teffs) rather than regulatory T cells (Tregs), but also generate 1O2 under sono&#8208;irradiation for induction of immunogenic cell death, which synergistically elevates the ratio of Teffs/Tregs for effective antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Cytokine therapy mediates the interaction between immune cells and non&#8208;immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), forming a promising approach in cancer therapy. However, the dose&#8208;dependent adverse effects and non&#8208;selective stimulation of cytokines limit their clinical use. We herein report a sonodynamic cytokine nano&#8208;immunocomplex (SPNAI) that specifically activates effector T cells (Teffs) for antitumor immunotherapy. By conjugating anti&#8208;interleukin&#8208;2 (anti&#8208;IL&#8208;2) antibodies S4B6 on the semiconducting polymer nanoparticles to afford SPNA, this nanoantibody SPNA can bind with IL&#8208;2 to form SPNAI which can block the interaction between IL&#8208;2 and regulatory T cells (Tregs), selectively activating Teffs in TME. Moreover, SPNAI generates 1O2 to trigger immunogenic cell death of cancer cells upon sono&#8208;irradiation, which promotes the maturation of dendritic cells and the proliferation of Teffs. This SPNAI&#8208;mediated combination sonodynamic immunotherapy thus elevates the ratio of Teffs/Tregs in TME, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth, suppression of lung metastasis and prevention of tumor relapse.

         <title>Isolable Tetragold(0) Clusters with Polarity&#8208;Tunable exo&#8208;Au&#8722;Au Bond via Intramolecular &#963;&#8208;Aromatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;enveloped tetragold(0) clusters have been successfully synthesized via a nucleophilic substitution reaction between a Au3 anionic cluster and PMe3AuCl. A novel stabilization mode, intramolecular &#963;&#8208;aromatization has been discovered, in which the intramolecular &#963;&#8208;aromatization has now been observed for the first time in homometallic clusters, and the polarity of the exo&#8208;Au&#8722;Au bonds can be tuned via the strength of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity.







Abstract
Intramolecular &#960;&#8208;aromatization is a trait of many organic compounds that enhances the stability of their structures and polarizes related C&#8722;C &#960; bonds. In contrast, rare study is focused on this phenomenon in metal clusters. Many existing homometallic clusters exhibit aromaticity, often characterized by nonpolar metal&#8208;metal bonds and a high degree of symmetry. However, synthesizing low&#8208;symmetric homometallic clusters with high&#8208;polar metal&#8208;metal bonds is challenging due to their limited thermodynamic stability. Herein, we report a facile strategy for the synthesis of [Au(&#956;2&#8208;ER2)]3&#8722;AuPMe3 (E=Ge, Sn; R2=1,1,4,4&#8208;tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl) clusters and reveal a novel stabilization mode, intramolecular &#963;&#8208;aromatization. Our electronic structure analyses show that these low&#8208;symmetric clusters possess a ten&#8208;electron &#963;&#8208;aromatic system, which is achieved via intramolecular &#963;&#8208;aromatization. Moreover, the strength of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity gives rise to a polarity&#8208;tunable exo&#8208;Au&#8722;Au bond.

         <title>Enzymatic Benzofuranoindoline Formation in the Biosynthesis of the Strained Bridgehead Bicyclic Dipeptide (+)&#8208;Azonazine A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic pathway of the strained dipeptide (+)&#8208;azonazine A from marine&#8208;derived Aspergillus insulicola, which features a rarely observed benzofuranoindoline ring system, was uncovered. Heterologous reconstitution of the fourth&#8208;enzyme pathway showed a P450 enyzme catalyzes an oxidative cyclization of cyclo&#8208;(l&#8208;Trp&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;Tyr) to form the hexacyclic ring system. Analogs of azonazine A were generated by supplementing the producing strain with different indole&#8208;substituted tryptophan analogs.

Supplementing the producing strain with various indole&#8208;substituted tryptophan derivatives resulted in the generation of a series of azonazine A analogs.

         <title>Elastic Polymer Coated Nanoparticles with Fast Clearance for 19F&#8197;MR Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elastic polymer&#8208;coated nanoparticles (NPs) were developed as novel contrast agents for 19F&#8197;MRI. These NPs encapsulated liquid perfluorocarbon, resulting in high elasticity and robust sensitivity in 19F&#8197;NMR and MRI. Moreover, in vivo imaging of these NPs implied that elastic NPs suppressed long&#8208;term accumulation in the liver.







Abstract
19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful molecular imaging technique that enables high&#8208;resolution imaging of deep tissues without background signal interference. However, the use of nanoparticles (NPs) as 19F&#8197;MRI probes has been limited by the immediate trapping and accumulation of stiff NPs, typically of around 100&#8197;nm in size, in the mononuclear phagocyte system, particularly in the liver. To address this issue, elastic nanomaterials have emerged as promising candidates for improving delivery efficacy in vivo. Nevertheless, the impact of elasticity on NP elimination has remained unclear due to the lack of suitable probes for real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term monitoring. In this study, we present the development of perfluorocarbon&#8208;encapsulated polymer NPs as a novel 19F&#8197;MRI contrast agent, with the aim of suppressing long&#8208;term accumulation. The polymer NPs have high elasticity and exhibit robust sensitivity in 19F&#8197;MRI imaging. Importantly, our 19F&#8197;MRI data demonstrate a gradual decline in the signal intensity of the polymer NPs after administration, which contrasts starkly with the behavior observed for stiff silica NPs. This innovative polymer&#8208;coated NP system represents a groundbreaking nanomaterial that successfully overcomes the challenges associated with long&#8208;term accumulation, while enabling tracking of biodistribution over extended periods.

         <title>An Interlocked Figure&#8208;of&#8208;Eight Molecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;station figure of eight rotaxane molecular shuttle has been synthesized by making use of a template&#8208;driven intramolecular self&#8208;entanglement of a hermaphrodite disubstituted dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 derivative and the mechanical locking of the architecture. The shuttling of the macrocycle from the ammonium to the triazolium station results in an interdependent tightening/loosening of the two loops of the interlocked molecular architecture.







Abstract
Here is reported the synthesis and characterization of an interlocked figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight rotaxane molecular shuttle from a dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) derivative. This latter bears two molecular chains, whose extremities are able to react together by click chemistry. One of the two substituting chain holds an ammonium function aimed at driving the self&#8208;entanglement through the complexation of the DB24C8 moiety. In the targeted figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight rotaxane, shuttling of the DB24C8 along the threaded axle from the best ammonium station to the weaker binding site triazolium was performed through deprotonation or deprotonation&#8208;then&#8208;carbamoylation of the ammonium. This way, two discrete co&#8208;conformational states were obtained, in which the folding and size of the two loops could be changed.

         <title>Janus&#8208;Type ESIPT Chromophores with Distinctive Intramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;bonding Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of Janus&#8208;type ESIPT chromophores with distinctive hydrogen bonding selectivity between competitive hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) were reported. Single&#8208;crystal structures and theoretical studies unveiled the molecular origins of the biased intramolecular hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) and their impact on the ESIPT process. This Janus&#8208;type ESIPT chromophore skeleton provides new opportunities for the design of solid luminescent materials.







Abstract
Excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT)&#8208;based solid luminescent materials with multiple hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) remain unexplored. Herein, we introduced a family of Janus&#8208;type ESIPT chromophores featuring distinctive hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) selectivity between competitive HBAs in a single molecule. Our investigations showed that the central hydroxyl group preferentially forms intramolecular H&#8208;bonds with imines in imine&#8208;modified 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl benzothiazole (HBT) chromophores but tethers the benzothiazole moiety in hydrazone&#8208;modified HBT chromophores. Imine&#8208;derived HBTs generally exhibit higher fluorescence efficiency, while hydrazone&#8208;derived HBTs show a reduced overlap between the absorption and fluorescence bands. Quantum chemical calculations unveiled the molecular origins of the biased intramolecular H&#8208;bonds and their impact on the ESIPT process. This Janus&#8208;type ESIPT chromophore skeleton provides new opportunities for the design of solid luminescent materials.

         <title>A Fluorescent Probe for Investigating the Role of Biothiols in Signaling Pathways Associated with Cerebral Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe for crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier was constructed via a rational molecular design strategy. The probe allowed the investigation of the biothiol&#8208;mediated nuclear factor kappa&#8208;light&#8208;chain&#8208;enhancer of activated B cells (NF&#8208;&#954;B) signaling pathway in cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury mice models.







Abstract
Cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (CIRI) is intimately associated with the redox regulation of biothiol, a crucial antioxidant marker that precludes the onset of ROS. We designed a novel fluorescent probe, DCI&#8208;Ac&#8208;Py, showing various physicochemical properties, such as high selectivity, exceptional signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) optical window, and blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetrability, for detecting biothiols in the brain. The picolinate serves as a specific recognition group that is rapidly activated by biothiol and undergoes nucleophilic substitution with the adjacent acrylic ester to yield the desired NIR probe. Additionally, the probe's lipid solubility is improved through the inclusion of halogen atoms, which aids in penetrating the BBB. Using DCI&#8208;Ac&#8208;Py, we investigated changes of biothiols in vivo in the brains of mice during CIRI. We found that biothiol&#8208;mediated NF&#8208;kB classical (P65&#8208;related) and nonclassical (RelB&#8208;related) pathways contribute to abundant ROS production induced by CIRI and that biothiols are involved in redox regulation. These findings provide new insights into the study of CIRI and shed light on the physiological and pathological mechanisms of biothiols in the brain.

         <title>Diboriranide &#963;&#8208;Complexes of d&#8208; and p&#8208;Block Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a straightforward synthesis of the first peraryl lithium diboriranide c&#8208;(DurB)2CPh&#8722; via the corresponding non&#8208;classical diborirane (Dur=2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl; Bn=benzyl) starting from a diborane(4). We demonstrate the strong preference of the diboriranide for &#963;&#8208;type coordination modes towards main group and transition metal centers (Au, Cu, Zn and Sn) under unperturbed retention of the three&#8208;membered B2C&#8208;ring's 2e&#8722; &#960;&#8208;system.







Abstract
Diboriranides are the smallest conceivable monoanionic aromatic cycles, yet only limited examples have been reported and their reactivity and complexation behavior remain completely unexplored. We report a straightforward synthesis of the first peraryl diboriranide c&#8208;(DurB)2CPh&#8722; as its lithium salt in three steps via the corresponding non&#8208;classical diborirane from a readily available 1,2&#8208;dichlorodiborane(4) (Dur=2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl). With the preparation and complete characterization of representative complexes with tin, copper, gold and zinc, we demonstrate the strong preference of the diboriranide for &#963;&#8208;type coordination modes towards main group and transition metal centers under unperturbed retention of the three&#8208;membered B2C&#8208;ring's 2e&#8722; &#960;&#8208;system.

         <title>Regioselective and Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminocarbonylation of Unactivated Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here a general method for the regio&#8208; and enantioselective Cu&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes under mild conditions. The reaction tolerates a wild range of functional groups and applicable to different classes of alkenes. Alkynes are also compatible under this catalytic system with the cascade hydrogenation&#8208;hydroaminocarbonylation process to alkyl amides.







Abstract
Given the prevalence of amide backbones in marketed pharmaceuticals and their ubiquity as critical binding units in natural peptides and proteins, it remains important to develop novel methods to construct amide bonds. We report here a general method for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes under mild conditions, using copper catalysis in combination with hydroxylamine electrophile reagents and poly(methylhydrosiloxane) (PMHS) as a cheap and environmentally friendly hydride source. The reaction tolerates a variety of functional groups and efficiently converts unactivated terminal alkenes, 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes, and cyclic alkenes to the corresponding amides with exclusive anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity (and high enantioselectivities/diastereoselectivities). Additionally, with minimal modification of the reaction conditions, alkynes can also undergo tandem hydrogenation&#8208;hydroaminocarbonylation to alkyl amides.

         <title>Ultrafast Detection of Monoamine Oxidase A in Live Cells and Clinical Glioma Tissues Using an Affinity Binding&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Photon Fluorogenic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By studying the interaction between small molecules and enzymes, we have successfully developed an affinity binding&#8208;based two&#8208;photon small&#8208;molecule fluorogenic probe (CD1) for the ultrafast detection of endogenous monoamine oxidase A (MAO&#8722;A) content in complex biological systems.







Abstract
Abnormal expression of monoamine oxidase A (MAO&#8722;A) has been implicated in the development of human glioma, making MAO&#8722;A a promising target for therapy. Therefore, a rapid determination of MAO&#8722;A is critical for diagnosis. Through in silico screening of two&#8208;photon fluorophores, we discovered that a derivative of N,N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;naphthalenamine (pre&#8208;mito) can effectively fit into the entrance of the MAO&#8722;A cavity. Substitutions on the N&#8208;pyridine not only further explore the MAO&#8722;A cavity, but also enable mitochondrial targeting ability. The aminopropyl substituted molecule, CD1, showed the fastest MAO&#8722;A detection (within 20&#8197;s), high MAO&#8722;A affinity and selectivity. It was also used for in situ imaging of MAO&#8722;A in living cells, enabling a comparison of the MAO&#8722;A content in human glioma and paracancerous tissues. Our results demonstrate that optimizing the affinity binding&#8208;based fluorogenic probes significantly improves their detection rate, providing a general approach for rapid detection probe design and optimization.

         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H arylation/DKR reaction was realized. This strategy provides an efficient and sustainable method for the synthesis of axially chiral biaryl&#8208;2&#8208;amines in good yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%ee).







Abstract
Highly efficient synthesis of axially chiral biaryl amines through cobalt&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H arylation using easily accessible cobalt(II) salt and salicyloxazoline ligand has been reported. This methodology provides a straightforward and sustainable access to a broad range of enantioenriched biaryl&#8208;2&#8208;amines in good yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The synthetic utility of the unprecedented method is highlighted by its scalability and diverse transformations.

         <title>Isoreticular Preparation of Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based Multicomponent Metallacages towards Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isoreticular tetraphenylethylene(TPE)&#8208;based multicomponent metallacages were prepared using TPE derivatives as the faces and different tetracarboxylic ligands as the pillars. The integration of TPE&#8208;based photosensitizers and open Re catalytic sites into a single metallacage promoted the directional electron transfer within the metallacage, offering good photocatalytic hydrogen production performance.







Abstract
Multicomponent metallacages can integrate the functions of their different building blocks to achieve synergetic effects for advanced applications. Herein, based on metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, we report the preparation of a series of isoreticular tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based metallacages, which are well characterized by multinuclear NMR, ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. The suitable integration of photosensitizing tetraphenylethylene units as faces and Re catalytic complexes as the pillars into a single metallacage offers a high photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of 1707&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is one of the highest values among reported metallacages. Femtosecond transient absorption and DFT calculations reveal that the metallacage can serve as a platform for the precise and organized arrangement of the two building blocks, enabling efficient and directional electron transfer for highly efficient photocatalytic performance. This study provides a general strategy to integrate multifunctional ligands into a certain metallacage to improve the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production, which will guide the future design of metallacages towards photocatalysis.

         <title>Tunable Synthesis of Monofluoroalkenes and Gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes via Solvent&#8208;Controlled Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylation of 1&#8208;Bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroethylene</title>

We report a solvent&#8208;controlled rhodium&#8208;catalyzed tunable arylation of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroethylene, which allows the synthesis of monofluoroalkenes and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes from readily available feedstocks. This study provides a useful strategy for the divergent synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing scaffolds and sheds light on the importance of solvent selection in catalytic reactions.







Abstract
Divergent synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing scaffolds starting from a suite of raw materials is an intriguing topic. Herein, we report the solvent&#8208;controlled rhodium&#8208;catalyzed tunable arylation of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroethylene. The selection of the reaction solvents provides switchable defluorinated or debrominated arylation from readily available feedstock resources (both arylboronic acids/esters and 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoroethylene are commercially available). This switch is feasible because of the difference in coordination ability between the solvent (CH2Cl2 or CH3CN) and the rhodium center, resulting in different olefin insertion. This protocol allows the convenient synthesis of monofluoroalkenes and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, both of which are important scaffolds in the fields of medicine and materials. Moreover, this newly developed solvent&#8208;regulated reaction system can be applied to the site&#8208;selective dechlorinated arylation of trichloroethylene. Overall, this study provides a useful strategy for the divergent synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing scaffolds and provides insight into the importance of solvent selection in catalytic reactions.

         <title>Continuous Flow Electrochemistry Enables Practical and Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a practical and cost&#8208;efficient electrochemical method for the highly selective monooxygenation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using continuous flow reactors. The electrochemical method demonstrates excellent scope and scalability by producing 115&#8197;g of one of the alcohol products.







Abstract
The selective oxygenation of ubiquitous C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds remains a highly sought&#8208;after method in both academia and the chemical industry for constructing functionalized organic molecules. However, it is extremely challenging to selectively oxidize a certain C(sp3)&#8722;H bond to afford alcohols due to the presence of multiple C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with similar strength and steric environment in organic molecules, and the alcohol products being prone to further oxidation. Herein, we present a practical and cost&#8208;efficient electrochemical method for the highly selective monooxygenation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds using continuous flow reactors. The electrochemical reactions produce trifluoroacetate esters that are resistant to further oxidation but undergo facile hydrolysis during aqueous workup to form benzylic alcohols. The method exhibits a broad scope and exceptional site selectivity and requires no catalysts or chemical oxidants. Furthermore, the electrochemical method demonstrates excellent scalability by producing 115&#8197;g of one of the alcohol products. The high site selectivity of the electrochemical method originates from its unique mechanism to cleave benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds through sequential electron/proton transfer, rather than the commonly employed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT).

         <title>Enzymatic Oxy&#8208; and Amino&#8208;Functionalization in Biocatalytic Cascade Synthesis: Recent Advances and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalytic cascades are a powerful tool for building complex molecules containing oxygen and nitrogen functionalities. Moreover, the combination of multiple enzymes in one pot offers the possibility to minimize downstream processing and waste production. In this review, we illustrate various recent efforts in the development of multi&#8208;step syntheses involving C&#8208;O and C&#8208;N bond&#8208;forming enzymes to produce high value&#8208;added compounds, such as pharmaceuticals and polymer precursors. Both in vitro and in vivo examples are discussed, revealing the respective advantages and drawbacks. The use of engineered enzymes to boost the cascades outcome is also addressed and current co&#8208;substrate and cofactor recycling strategies are presented, highlighting the importance of atom economy. Finally, tools to overcome current challenges for multi&#8208;enzymatic oxy&#8208; and amino&#8208;functionalization reactions are discussed, including flow systems with immobilized biocatalysts and cascades in confined nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Desaturation and Epoxidation with Oxygen by Sequential Flavin Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic desaturations are important strategies for the functionalization of organic molecules. In nature, flavoenzymes mediate the formation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds by concomitant cofactor reduction. Contrary to many laboratory methods for these reactions, such as the Saegusa&#8208;Ito oxidation, no transition metal reagents or catalysts are required. However, a molecular flavin&#8208;mediated variant has not been reported so far. We disclose a photochemical approach for silyl enol ether oxidation, which leads to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones (13&#160;examples) in very good yields. The flavin catalysts are stable throughout the desaturation reaction, and we successfully applied them in a subsequent aerobic epoxidation by simply changing the reaction conditions. This protocol allowed us to directly convert silyl enol ethers into &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxyketones in a one&#8208;pot fashion (12 examples). Sequential flavin catalysis is not limited to one specific reactivity combination and can, inter alia, couple the photochemical oxidation with radical additions. We anticipate that flavin&#8208;catalyzed desaturation will be applicable to other substrate classes and that its sequential catalytic activity will enable rapid substrate diversification.</dc:description>

         <title>Prussian Blue&#8208;Type Sodium&#8208;ion Conducting Solid Electrolytes for All Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional solid electrolyte frameworks typically consist of anions such as sulphur, oxygen, chlorine, and others, leading to inherent limitations in their properties. Despite the emergence of sulphide, oxide, and halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, their utilization is hampered by issues, including the evolution of H2S gas, the need for expensive elements, and poor contact. Here, we first introduce Prussian Blue analogue (PBA) open&#8208;framework structures as a solid electrolyte that demonstrates appreciable Na+ conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;2 mS cm&#8722;1). We delve into the relationship between Na+ conductivity and the lattice parameter of N&#8208;coordinated transition metal, which is attributed to the reduced interaction between Na+ and the framework, corroborated by the distribution of relaxation times and density functional theory calculations. Among the five PBAs studied, Mn&#8208;PBA have exhibited the highest Na+ conductivity of 9.1 &#215; 10&#8722;2 mS cm&#8722;1. Feasibility tests have revealed that Mn&#8208;PBA have maintained a cycle retention of 95.1% after 80 cycles at 30 &#176;C and a C&#8208;rate of 0.2C. Our investigation into the underlying mechanisms that play a significant role in governing the conductivity and kinetics of these materials contributes valuable insights for the development of alternative strategies to realize all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Photodegradation of CuBi2O4&#160;Films Evidenced by Fast Formation of Metallic Bi using Operando Surface&#8208;sensitive X&#8208;ray Scattering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CuBi2O4&#160;has recently emerged as a promising photocathode for photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, its fast degradation under operation currently poses a limit to its application. Here, we report a novel method to study operando the semiconductor&#8208;electrolyte interface during PEC operation by surface&#8208;sensitive high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray scattering. We find that a fast decrease in the generated photocurrents correlates directly with the formation of a metallic Bi phase. We further show that the slower formation of metallic Cu, as well as the dissolution of the electrode in contact with the electrolyte, further affect the CuBi2O4&#160;activity and morphology. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the degradation mechanisms affecting CuBi2O4&#160;electrodes under operation and poses the methodological basis to investigate the photocorrosion processes affecting a wide range of PEC materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Repurposing Iron&#8208; and 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Oxygenases to Catalyze Olefin Hydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mononuclear nonheme iron(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (Fe/2OG)&#8208;dependent oxygenases and halogenases are known to catalyze a diverse set of oxidative reactions including hydroxylation, halogenation, epoxidation, and desaturation in primary metabolism and natural product maturation. However, their use in abiotic transformations has mainly been limited to C&#8210;H oxidation. Herein, we show that various enzymes of this family, when reconstituted with Fe(II) or Fe(III), can catalyze Mukaiyama hydration&#8212;a redox neutral transformation. Distinct from the native reactions of the Fe/2OG enzymes wherein an oxygen atom transfer (OAT) catalyzed by an iron&#8208;oxo species is involved, this nonnative transformation proceeds through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathway in a 2OG&#8208;independent manner. Additionally, in contrast to the conventional inorganic catalysts wherein a dinuclear iron species is responsible for HAT, the Fe/2OG enzymes exploit a mononuclear iron center to support this reaction. Collectively, our work demonstrates that Fe/2OG enzymes have utility in catalysis beyond the current scope of catalytic oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>An S = 1 Iron(IV) Intermediate Revealed in a Non&#8208;Heme Iron Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative C&#8208;S Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ergothioneine (ESH) and ovothiol A (OSHA) are two natural thiol&#8208;histidine derivatives. ESH has been implicated as a longevity vitamin and OSHA inhibits the proliferation of hepatocarcinoma. The key biosynthetic step of ESH and OSHA in the aerobic pathways is the O2&#8208;dependent C&#8208;S bond formation catalyzed by non&#8208;heme iron enzymes (e.g., OvoA in ovothiol biosynthesis), but due to the lack of identification of key reactive intermediate, the mechanism of this novel reaction is unresolved. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a kinetically competent S = 1 iron(IV) intermediate supported by a four&#8208;histidine ligand environment (three from the protein residues and one from the substrate) in enabling C&#8208;S bond formation in OvoA from Methyloversatilis thermotoleran, which represents the first experimentally observed intermediate spin iron(IV) species in non&#8208;heme iron enzymes. Results reported in this study thus set the stage to further dissect the mechanism of enzymatic oxidative C&#8208;S bond formation in the OSHA biosynthesis pathway. They also afford new opportunities to study the structure&#8208;function relationship of high&#8208;valent iron intermediates supported by a histidine rich ligand environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking K+&#160;Concentration Limit on Cu Nanoneedles for Acidic Electrocatalytic CO2&#160;Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) in acidic electrolyte is one of the most advanced routes for tackling our current climate and energy crisis. However, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the poor selectivity towards the valuable C2+ products are the major obstacles for the upscaling of these technologies. High local potassium ions (K+) concentration at the cathode&#8217;s surface can inhibit proton&#8208;diffusion and accelerate the desirable carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8211;C) coupling process. However, the solubility limit of potassium salts in bulk solution constrains the maximum achievable K+ concentration at the reaction sites and thus the overall acidic CO2RR performance of most electrocatalysts. In this work, we demonstrate that Cu nanoneedles induce ultrahigh local K+ concentrations (4.22 M) &#8208; thus breaking the K+ solubility limit (3.5 M) &#8208; which enables a highly efficient CO2RR in 3 M KCl at pH = 1. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of 90.69&#177;2.15% for C2+ (FEC2+) can be achieved at 1400 mA.cm&#8208;2, simultaneous with a single pass carbon efficiency (SPCE) of 25.49&#177;0.82% at a CO2 flow rate of 7 sccm.</dc:description>

         <title>Histone Deacetylase 3&#8208;Directed PROTACs Have Anti&#8208;inflammatory Potential by Blocking Polarization of M0&#8208;like into M1&#8208;like Macrophages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrophage polarization plays a crucial role in inflammatory processes. The histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) has deacetylase&#8208;independent function that can activate pro&#8208;inflammatory gene expression in LPS&#8208;stimulated M1&#8208;like macrophages and cannot be blocked by traditional small&#8208;molecule HDAC3 inhibitors. Here we employ the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology to target the deacetylase&#8208;independent function of HDAC3. We developed a potent and selective HDAC3&#8208;directed PROTAC, denoted P7, which induces nearly complete HDAC3 degradation at low micromolar concentrations in both THP&#8208;1 cells and human primary macrophages. P7 increases the anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine secretion in THP&#8208;1 derived M1&#8208;like macrophages. Importantly, P7 decreases the secretion of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in M1&#8208;like macrophages derived from human primary macrophages. This can be explained by the observed inhibition of macrophage polarization from M0&#8208;like into M1&#8208;like macrophage. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the HDAC3&#8208;directed PROTAC P7 has anti&#8208;inflammatory activity and blocks macrophage polarization, which demonstrates that this molecular mechanism can be targeted with small molecule therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Along the Nonpolar Axis in Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The origin of the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) was considered as a built&#8208;in electric field formed by the macroscopic polarization of materials. Alternatively, the &#8220;shift current mechanism&#8221; has been gradually accepted as the more appropriate description of the BPVE. This mechanism implies that the photocurrent generated by the BPVE is a topological current featuring an ultrafast response and dissipation&#8208;less nature, which is very attractive for photodetector applications. Meanwhile, the origin of the BPVE in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has not been discussed and is still widely accepted as the classical mechanism without any experimental evidence. Herein, we observed the BPVE along the nonpolar axis in OIHPs, which is inconsistent with the classical explanation. Furthermore, based on the nonlinear optical tensor correlation, we substantiated that the BPVE in OIHPs is originated in the shift current mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Absorbing Monodispersed Oligomers Based on N&#8211;B&#8592;N Unit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules with near&#8208;infrared II (NIR II) light absorption are essential for many biological and opto&#8208;electronic applications. Herein, we report monodispersed oligomers as NIR II light absorber using a new molecular design strategy of resonant N&#8211;B&#8592;N unit, i.e. balanced resonant boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond (B&#8211;N) and boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N). We synthesize a series of monodispersed oligomers with thiophene&#8208;fused 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (TB), which contains resonant N&#8211;B&#8592;N unit, as the repeating unit. The TB pentamer exhibits the maximum absorption wavelength of 1169 nm, which is the longest for oligomers reported so far. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) with the TB tetramer as the electron acceptor shows the specific detectivity of 2.98 &#215; 1011 Jones at 1180 nm under zero bias. This performance is among the best for NIR II OPDs. These results indicate a new kind of NIR II absorbing molecules as excellent opto&#8208;electronic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexible, Miniaturized Sensing Probes Inspired by Biofuel Cells for Monitoring Synaptically Released Glutamate in the Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical biomarkers in the central nervous system can provide valuable quantitative measures to gain insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of neurological diseases. Glutamate, one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain, has been found to be upregulated in various neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, chronic pain, and migraines. However, quantitatively monitoring glutamate release in situ has been challenging. This work presents a novel class of flexible, miniaturized probes inspired by biofuel cells for monitoring synaptically released glutamate in the nervous system. The resulting sensors, with dimensions as low as 50 by 50 &#181;m2, can detect real&#8208;time changes in glutamate within the biologically relevant concentration range. Experiments exploiting the hippocampal circuit in mice models demonstrate the capability of the sensors in monitoring glutamate release via electrical stimulation using acute brain slices. These advances could aid in basic neuroscience studies and translational engineering, as the sensors provide a diagnostic tool for neurological disorders. Additionally, adapting the biofuel cell design to other neurotransmitters can potentially enable the detailed study of the effect of neurotransmitter dysregulation on neuronal cell signaling pathways and revolutionize neuroscience.</dc:description>

         <title>Dibenzothiophene Sulfone&#8208;Based Ambipolar&#8208;Transporting Blue&#8208;Emissive Organic Semiconductors Towards Simple&#8208;Structured Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of blue&#8208;emissive ambipolar organic semiconductor is an arduous target due to the large energy gap, but is an indispensable part for electroluminescent device, especially for the transformative display technology of simple&#8208;structured organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (SS&#8208;OLET). Herein, we designed and synthesized two new dibenzothiophene sulfone&#8208;based high mobility blue&#8208;emissive organic semiconductors (DNaDBSOs), which demonstrate superior optical property with solid&#8208;state photoluminescent quantum yield of 46%&#8208;67% and typical ambipolar&#8208;transporting properties in SS&#8208;OLETs with symmetric gold electrodes. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical characterizations reveal the natural of ambipolar property for such blue&#8208;emissive DNaDBSOs&#8208;based materials is ascribed to a synergistic effect on lowering LUMO level and reduced electron injection barrier induced by the interfacial dipoles effect on gold electrodes due to the incorporation of appropriate DBSO unit. Finally, efficient electroluminescence properties with high&#8208;quality blue emission (CIE (0.179, 0.119)) and a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 48 nm are achieved for DNaDBSOs&#8208;based SS&#8208;OLET, showing good spatial control of the recombination zone in conducting channel. This work provides a new avenue for designing ambipolar emissive organic semiconductors by incorporating the synergistic effect of energy level regulation and molecular&#8208;metal interaction, which would advance the development of superior optoelectronic materials and their high&#8208;density integrated optoelectronic devices and circuits.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Relative Nitrogen Locations of Diazine Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks for Overall H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered promising candidates for the overall photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the effects of the relative nitrogen locations remain obscured and photocatalytic performances of COFs need to be further improved. Herein, a collection of COFs functionalized by various diazines including pyridazine, pyrimidine, and pyrazine have been judiciously designed and synthesized for photogeneration of H2O2 without sacrificial agents. Compared with pyrimidine and pyrazine, pyridazine embedded in TpDz tends to stabilize endoperoxide intermediate species, leading toward&#160;the more efficient direct 2e&#8209; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway. Benefiting from the effective electron&#8208;hole separation, low charge transfer resistance, and high&#8208;efficiency ORR pathway, an excellent production rate of 7327 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) value of 0.62% has been achieved by TpDz, which ranks one of the best COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work might shed fresh light on the rational design of functional COFs targeting photocatalysts in H2O2 production.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction integrated with C&#8722;C/C&#8722;X bond&#8208;forming organic synthesis represents a substantially untapped opportunity to simultaneously tackle carbon neutrality and create an atom&#8208;/redox&#8208;economical chemical synthesis. Herein, we demonstrate the first cooperative photoredox catalysis of efficient and tunable CO2 reduction to syngas, paired with direct alkylation/arylation of unactivated allylic sp3 C&#8211;H bonds for accessing allylic C&#8211;C products, over SiO2&#8208;supported single Ni atoms&#8208;decorated CdS quantum dots (QDs). Our protocol not only bypasses additional oxidant/reductant and pre&#8208;functionalization of organic substrates, affording a broad of allylic C&#8211;C products with moderate to excellent yields, but also produces syngas with tunable CO/H2 ratios (1:2&#8211;5:1). Such win&#8208;win coupling catalysis highlights the high atom&#8208;, step&#8208; and redox&#8208;economy, and good durability, illuminating the tantalizing possibility of a renewable sunlight&#8208;driven chemical feedstocks manufacturing industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Configuration Tuning of Centrally Extended Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enabling Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency Approaching 19%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the molecular optimizations of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), extending the central core can tune the energy levels, reduce nonradiative energy loss, enhance the intramolecular (donor&#8211;acceptor and acceptor&#8211;acceptor) packing, facilitate the charge transport, and improve device performance. In this study, a new strategy was employed to synthesize acceptors featuring conjugation&#8208;extended electron&#8208;deficient cores. Among these, the acceptor&#160;CH&#8208;BBQ, embedded with benzobisthiadiazole, exhibited an optimal fibrillar network morphology, enhanced crystallinity, and improved charge generation/transport in blend films, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 18.94% for CH&#8208;BBQ&#8208;based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs; 18.19% for binary OSCs) owing to its delicate structure design and electronic configuration tuning. Both experimental and theoretical approaches were used to systematically investigate the influence of the central electron&#8208;deficient core on the properties of the acceptor and device performance. The electron&#8208;deficient core modulation paves a new pathway in the molecular engineering of NFAs, propelling relevant research forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Narrowband Pure Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) Ir(III) Complexes for Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode (OLED) with External Quantum Efficiency Over 16%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitters have significant applications in medical and optoelectronic fields, but the development stays a great challenge due to the energy gap law. Here, we report two NIR phosphorescent Ir(III) complexes which display emission peaks around 730 nm with a narrow full width at half maximum of only 43 nm. Therefore, pure NIR luminescence can be obtained without having a very long emission wavelength, thus alleviating the restriction of the energy gap law, and obtaining impressively high photoluminescence quantum yield up to 0.70. More importantly, the pure NIR organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) fabricated by the solution&#8208;processed mothed shows outstanding device performance with the highest external quantum efficiency of 16.43%, which sets a new record for solution&#8208;processed NIR&#8208;OLEDs based on different emitters. This work sheds light on the development of Ir(III) complexes with narrowband emissions as highly efficient pure NIR&#8208;emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Engineering for Efficient Low&#8208;Temperature Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photovoltaic technology with low weight, high specific power in cold environments, and compatibility with flexible fabrication is highly desired for near&#8208;space vehicles and polar region applications. Herein, we demonstrate efficient low&#8208;temperature flexible perovskite solar cells by improving the interfacial contact between electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) and perovskite layer. We find that the adsorbed oxygen active sites and oxygen vacancies of flexible tin oxide (SnO2) ETL layer can be effectively decreased by incorporating a trace amount of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4). The effective defects elimination at the interfacial increases the electron mobility of flexible SnO2 layer, regulates band alignment at the perovskite/SnO2 interface, induces larger perovskite crystal growth, and improves charge collection efficiency in a complete solar cell. Correspondingly, the improved interfacial contact transforms into high&#8208;performance solar cells under one&#8208;sun illumination (AM 1.5G) with efficiencies up to 23.7% at 218 K, which might open up a new era of application of this emerging flexible photovoltaic technology to low&#8208;temperature environments such as near&#8208;space and polar regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Furan&#8208;Based Acceptors for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and photostable furan&#8208;based n&#8208;type semiconductors were developed for organic solar cells. Important photodegradation mechanisms were revealed and analyzed and the findings lead to effective strategies to improve the photostability of non&#8208;fullerene electron acceptors.







Abstract
We explore a series of furan&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and report their optoelectronic properties, solid&#8208;state packing, photodegradation mechanism and application in photovoltaic devices. Incorporating furan building blocks leads to the expected enhanced backbone planarity, reduced band gap and red&#8208;shifted absorption of these acceptors. Still, their position in the molecule is critical for stability and device performance. We found that the photodegradation of these acceptors originates from two distinct pathways: electrocyclic photoisomerization and Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of singlet oxygen. These mechanisms are of general significance to most non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, and the photostability depends strongly on the molecular structure. Placement of furans next to the acceptor termini leads to better photostability, well&#8208;balanced hole/electron transport, and significantly improved device performance. Methylfuran as the linker offers the best photostability and power conversion efficiency (&gt;14&#8201;%), outperforming all furan&#8208;based acceptors reported to date and all indacenodithiophene&#8208;based acceptors. Our findings show the possibility of photostable furan&#8208;based alternatives to the currently omnipresent thiophene&#8208;based photovoltaic materials.

         <title>Dearomatization of (Hetero)arenes through Photodriven Interplay between Polysulfide Anions and Formate
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic protocol was developed for the dearomatization of substituted naphthalenes, indoles, and related heteroaromatic compounds through a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism induced by single&#8208;electron transfer from photoexcited polysulfide anions in the presence of methanol. The catalytic turnover is maintained by hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer between polysulfide radical anions and formate.







Abstract
The facile construction of C(sp3)&#8208;rich carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic compounds is a pivotal synthetic strategy to foster contemporary drug discovery programs. The downstream dearomatization of readily accessible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) planar arenes represents a direct pathway towards accessing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) aliphatic scaffolds. Here, we demonstrate that polysulfide anions are capable of catalyzing a dearomatization process of substituted naphthalenes, indoles, and other related heteroaromatic compounds in the presence of potassium formate and methanol under visible light irradiation. The developed protocol exhibits broad functional group tolerance, operational simplicity, scalability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, representing a practical and sustainable synthetic tool for the arene dearomatization.

     alt="Dearomatization of (Hetero)arenes through Photodriven Interplay between Polysulfide Anions and Formate**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photocatalytic protocol was developed for the dearomatization of substituted naphthalenes, indoles, and related heteroaromatic compounds through a radical-polar crossover mechanism induced by single-electron transfer from photoexcited polysulfide anions in the presence of methanol. The catalytic turnover is maintained by hydrogen-atom transfer between polysulfide radical anions and formate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facile construction of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-rich carbo- and heterocyclic compounds is a pivotal synthetic strategy to foster contemporary drug discovery programs. The downstream dearomatization of readily accessible two-dimensional (2D) planar arenes represents a direct pathway towards accessing three-dimensional (3D) aliphatic scaffolds. Here, we demonstrate that polysulfide anions are capable of catalyzing a dearomatization process of substituted naphthalenes, indoles, and other related heteroaromatic compounds in the presence of potassium formate and methanol under visible light irradiation. The developed protocol exhibits broad functional group tolerance, operational simplicity, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, representing a practical and sustainable synthetic tool for the arene dearomatization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral QUINAP Derivatives by Ketone&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ketone&#8208;catalyzed reaction for the enantioselective oxidation of N atoms was developed and effectively applied to the atroposelective kinetic resolution of QUINAPOs and related compounds. Both highly enantioenriched QUINAPO N&#8208;oxide products could be readily converted into QUINAPs without loss of chiral integrity. QUINAPO N&#8208;oxide was also shown to act as a chiral Lewis base catalyst in a series of enantioselective transformations.







Abstract
QUINAPs have emerged as a pivotal class of axially chiral compounds with remarkable features in the stereoinduction of diverse enantioselective transformations. However, the confined substrate range and extravagant price still pose challenges, limiting their broader utilization. Herein, we describe the first atroposelective oxidation of an N atom using a chiral ketone catalyst, allowing the kinetic resolution of QUINAPOs to give both the unreacted substrates and their corresponding N&#8208;oxides with excellent enantioselectivity. Importantly, the enantioenriched products can be readily converted into the QUINAP targets without any loss of stereochemical integrity. Mechanistic investigations indicate that a dioxirane, generated through the oxidation of the ketone with oxone, acts as the active catalytic species. Furthermore, we have successfully extended this catalytic system to the kinetic resolution of QUINOLs and the dynamic kinetic transformation of pyridine analogues of QUINAPO possessing a labile stereogenic axis. The practicality of the developed protocol is further demonstrated by the successful application of QUINAPO N&#8208;oxide as a Lewis base catalyst in a series of enantioselective transformations.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs are emerging and promising candidates in photocatalytic H2O2 production. Significant progress has developed in the past several years. However, comprehensive reviews on this specific field are lacking. This minireview presents an overview of the development of COFs in photocatalytic H2O2 production, highlighting the recent strategies to optimize COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. The insights into the future development of industrial&#8208;scale and cost&#8208;effective H2O2 production are also offered.







Abstract
Benefiting from the excellent structural tunability, robust framework, ultrahigh porosity, and rich active sites, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are widely recognized as promising photocatalysts in chemical conversions, and emerged in the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis in 2020. H2O2, serving as an environmental&#8208;friendly oxidant and a promising liquid fuel, has attracted increasing researchers to explore its potential. Over the past few years, numerous COFs&#8208;based photocatalysts are developed with encouraging achievements in H2O2 production, whereas no comprehensive review articles exist to summarize this specific and significant area. Herein we provide a systematic overview of the advances and challenges of COFs in photocatalytic H2O2 production. We first introduce the priorities of COFs in H2O2 photosynthesis. Then, various strategies to improve COFs photocatalytic efficiency are discussed. The perspective and outlook for future advances of COFs in this emerging field are finally offered. This timely review will pave the way for the development of highly efficient COFs photocatalysts for practical production of value&#8208;added chemicals not limited to H2O2.

         <title>Asymmetric Allylic Substitution&#8208;Isomerization for the Modular Synthesis of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Vinylquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization for the regio&#8208; and atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;vinylquinazolinones. The catalysis system was achieved by means of asymmetric transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis which afforded trisubstituted as well as E&#8208; and Z&#8208;tetrasubstituted N&#8208;vinylquinazolinone atropisomers, respectively.







Abstract
Axially chiral N&#8208;substituted quinazolinones are important bioactive molecules, which are presented in many synthetic drugs. However, most strategies toward their atroposelective synthesis are mainly limited to the axially chiral arylquinazolinone frameworks. The development of modular synthetic methods to access diverse quinazolinone&#8208;based atropisomers remains scarce and challenging. Herein, we report the regio&#8208; and atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral N&#8208;vinylquinazolinones via the strategy of asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization. The catalysis system utilized both asymmetric transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis to efficiently afford trisubstituted and tetrasubstituted N&#8208;vinylquinazolinone atropisomers, respectively. With the meticulous design of &#946;&#8208;substituted allylic substrates, both Z&#8208; and E&#8208;tetrasubstituted axially chiral N&#8208;vinylquinazolinones were obtained in good yields and high enantioselectivities.

         <title>Artificial Molecular Ratchets: Tools Enabling Endergonic Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How can we realize thermodynamically unfavored chemical processes? The operating principles of molecular machines&#8212;ratchet mechanisms&#8212;can help answer this. This tutorial Review provides an overview that balances experimental examples with rationalizations, while detaching from directional motion. A unifying picture is offered for chemical&#8208;, light&#8208;, and redox&#8208;driven systems, highlighting connections with active transport and bioenergetics, among others.







Abstract
Non&#8208;equilibrium chemical systems underpin multiple domains of contemporary interest, including supramolecular chemistry, molecular machines, systems chemistry, prebiotic chemistry, and energy transduction. Experimental chemists are now pioneering the realization of artificial systems that can harvest energy away from equilibrium. In this tutorial Review, we provide an overview of artificial molecular ratchets: the chemical mechanisms enabling energy absorption from the environment. By focusing on the mechanism type&#8212;rather than the application domain or energy source&#8212;we offer a unifying picture of seemingly disparate phenomena, which we hope will foster progress in this fascinating domain of science.

         <title>An Ultrathin Inorganic Molecular Crystal Interfacial Layer for Stable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inorganic molecular crystalline Sb2O3 film with an ultrathin thickness of 10&#8197;nm serves as an effective protection layer for Zn anodes to enable uniform under&#8208;layer Zn deposition with suppressed side reaction and tip growth effect, achieving a long&#8208;term cycling lifespan over 1000&#8197;h.







Abstract
Zn metal anode suffers from dendrite growth and side reactions during cycling, significantly deteriorating the lifespan of aqueous Zn metal batteries. Herein, we introduced an ultrathin and ultra&#8208;flat Sb2O3 molecular crystal layer to stabilize Zn anode. The in situ optical and atomic force microscopes observations show that such a 10&#8197;nm Sb2O3 thin layer could ensure uniform under&#8208;layer Zn deposition with suppressed tip growth effect, while the traditional WO3 layer undergoes an uncontrolled up&#8208;layer Zn deposition. The superior regulation capability is attributed to the good electronic&#8208;blocking ability and low Zn affinity of the molecular crystal layer, free of dangling bonds. Electrochemical tests exhibit Sb2O3 layer can significantly improve the cycle life of Zn anode from 72&#8197;h to 2800&#8197;h, in contrast to the 900&#8197;h of much thicker WO3 even in 100&#8197;nm. This research opens up the application of inorganic molecular crystals as the interfacial layer of Zn anode.

Herein, we introduced an ultrathin and ultra-flat Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecular crystal layer to stabilize Zn anode. The in situ optical and atomic force microscopes observations show that such a 10&#8197;nm Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; thin layer could ensure uniform under-layer Zn deposition with suppressed tip growth effect, while the traditional WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer undergoes an uncontrolled up-layer Zn deposition. The superior regulation capability is attributed to the good electronic-blocking ability and low Zn affinity of the molecular crystal layer, free of dangling bonds. Electrochemical tests exhibit Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer can significantly improve the cycle life of Zn anode from 72&#8197;h to 2800&#8197;h, in contrast to the 900&#8197;h of much thicker WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; even in 100&#8197;nm. This research opens up the application of inorganic molecular crystals as the interfacial layer of Zn anode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intermolecular Formal Cycloaddition of Indoles with Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes by Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intermolecular formal cycloaddition of indoles with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes promoted by commercially available Lewis acids has been disclosed, allowing one&#8208;step rapid construction of rigid indoline polycyclic structures via a cascade nucleophilic addition and Mannich reaction process.







Abstract
Herein, we develop a new approach to directly access architecturally complex polycyclic indolines from readily available indoles and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) through formal cycloaddition promoted by commercially available Lewis acids. The reaction proceeded through a stepwise pathway involving a nucleophilic addition of indoles to BCBs followed by an intramolecular Mannich reaction to form rigid indoline&#8208;fused polycyclic structures, which resemble polycyclic indole alkaloids. This new reaction tolerated a wide range of indoles and BCBs, thereby allowing the one&#8208;step construction of various rigid indoline polycycles containing up to four contiguous quaternary carbon centers.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Batrachotoxin Enabled by a Pd/Ag&#8208;Promoted Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Batrachotoxin is an extremely potent cardio&#8208; and neurotoxic steroidal alkaloid. Its 6/6/6/5&#8208;membered carbocyclic framework is functionalized with two double bonds, a six&#8208;membered hemiacetal, a seven&#8208;membered oxazepane, and a dimethylpyrrolecarboxy group. By a novel and simple convergent strategy involving Pd/Ag&#8208;promoted Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling and Dieckmann condensation reactions, the total synthesis of batrachotoxin was realized in 22 steps.







Abstract
Batrachotoxin is an extremely potent cardio&#8208; and neurotoxic steroidal alkaloid found in certain species of frogs, birds, and beetles. The steroidal 6/6/6/5&#8208;membered carbocycle (ABCD&#8208;ring) is U&#8208;shaped and functionalized with two double bonds, a six&#8208;membered C3&#8208;hemiacetal across the AB&#8208;ring, a seven&#8208;membered oxazepane on the CD&#8208;ring, and a dimethylpyrrolecarboxy group at the D&#8208;ring carbon chain. These structural features present an unusual and formidable synthetic challenge. Herein we report a total synthesis of batrachotoxin based on a newly devised convergent strategy through a 22&#8208;step sequence. Enantiopure AB&#8208;ring and D&#8208;ring fragments were prepared and subjected to a crucial C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) coupling reaction. Although both C(sp2) centers were sterically encumbered by proximal tetrasubstituted carbon atoms, Ag2O strongly promoted the Pd(PPh3)4&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction at room temperature, thereby connecting the two fragments without damaging their preexisting functionalities. Subsequent treatment with t&#8208;BuOK induced Dieckmann condensation to cyclize the C&#8208;ring. The judiciously optimized functionalizations realized oxazepane formation, carbon chain extension, and pyrrole carboxylic acid condensation to deliver batrachotoxin.

         <title>Direct Acylation of Unactivated Alkyl Halides with Aldehydes through N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aldehydes underwent cross&#8208;coupling with unactivated alkyl halides in the presence of an NHC organocatalyst, thus enabling the rapid synthesis of various ketones from readily available starting materials under mild conditions. This method was also applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical derivatives. Mechanistic investigations suggest a closed&#8208;shell nucleophilic substitution mechanism for this organocatalytic reaction.







Abstract
Catalytic acylation of organohalides with aldehydes is an ideal strategy for the direct synthesis of ketones. However, the utilization of unactivated alkyl halides in such a transformation remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we developed a cross&#8208;coupling reaction of aldehydes with unactivated alkyl halides through N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. With this protocol, various ketones could be rapidly synthesized from readily available starting materials under mild conditions. This organocatalytic system was successfully applied in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical derivatives. Mechanistic investigations suggest a closed&#8208;shell nucleophilic substitution mechanism for this reaction.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Raman Lasing from Metal&#8208;Linked Organic Dimer Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;wave Raman lasing is realized in a metal&#8208;linked organic dimer microcrystal. It has much enhanced Raman gain and notably improved stability. By virtue of the wide transparency window of the microcrystal, broadband tunable Raman lasing is achieved.







Abstract
Stimulated Raman scattering offers an alternative strategy to explore continuous&#8208;wave (c.w.) organic lasers, which, however, still suffers from the limitation of inadequate Raman gain in organic material systems. Here we propose a metal&#8208;linking approach to enhance the Raman gain of organic molecules. Self&#8208;assembled microcrystals of the metal linked organic dimers exhibit large Raman gain, therefore allowing for c.w. Raman lasing. Furthermore, broadband tunable Raman lasing is achieved in the organic dimer microcrystals by adjusting excitation wavelengths. This work advances the understanding of Raman gain in organic molecules, paving a way for the design of c.w. organic lasers.

         <title>Tuning C1/C2 Selectivity of CO2 Electrochemical Reduction over in&#8208;Situ Evolved CuO/SnO2 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we report a tuning C1/C2 selectivity of CO2 electrochemical reduction over in situ electrochemically evolved CuO/SnO2 heterostructure. Specifically, the synergetic absorption of *COOH and *CHOCO intermediates at the interface of the newly evolved Cu/SnO2&#8208;x facilitates ethanol generation.







Abstract
Heterostructured oxides with versatile active sites, as a class of efficient catalysts for CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER), are prone to undergo structure reconstruction under working conditions, thus bringing challenges to understanding the reaction mechanism and rationally designing catalysts. Herein, we for the first time elucidate the structural reconstruction of CuO/SnO2 under electrochemical potentials and reveal the intrinsic relationship between CO2ER product selectivity and the in situ evolved heterostructures. At &#8722;0.85&#8197;VRHE, the CuO/SnO2 evolves to Cu2O/SnO2 with high selectivity to HCOOH (Faradaic efficiency of 54.81&#8201;%). Mostly interestingly, it is reconstructed to Cu/SnO2&#8208;x at &#8722;1.05&#8197;VRHE with significantly improved Faradaic efficiency to ethanol of 39.8&#8201;%. In situ Raman spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the synergetic absorption of *COOH and *CHOCO intermediates at the interface of Cu/SnO2&#8208;x favors the formation of *CO and decreases the energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling, leading to high selectivity to ethanol.

         <title>A Rapidly Responsive Sensor for Wireless Detection of Early and Mature Microbial Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A setup for wireless detection of early and mature microbial biofilms has been developed by combining inkjet printing of nanomaterials, chip&#8208;less antenna, and electrogenicity of biofilms. Wireless sensing relies on the biofilm ability to electro&#8208;reduce antenna integrated AgCl to Ag. Detection of medically relevant biofilms formed by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa has been demonstrated, aiming for wireless wound infection sensing in clinics.







Abstract
Biofilm&#8208;associated infections, which are able to resist antibiotics, pose a significant challenge in clinical treatments. Such infections have been linked to various medical conditions, including chronic wounds and implant&#8208;associated infections, making them a major public&#8208;health concern. Early&#8208;detection of biofilm formation offers significant advantages in mitigating adverse effects caused by biofilms. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of employing a novel wireless sensor for tracking both early&#8208;stage and matured&#8208;biofilms formed by the medically relevant bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The sensor utilizes electrochemical reduction of an AgCl layer bridging two silver legs made by inkjet&#8208;printing, forming a part of near&#8208;field&#8208;communication tag antenna. The antenna is interfaced with a carbon cloth designed to promote the growth of microorganisms, thereby serving as an electron source for reduction of the resistive AgCl into a highly&#8208;conductive Ag bridge. The AgCl&#8722;Ag transformation significantly alters the impedance of the antenna, facilitating wireless identification of an endpoint caused by microbial growth. To the best of our knowledge, this study for the first time presents the evidence showcasing that electrons released through the actions of bacteria can be harnessed to convert AgCl to Ag, thus enabling the wireless, battery&#8208;less, and chip&#8208;less early&#8208;detection of biofilm formation.

Anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalytic micelles are introduced to expand the collection of systems catalysts compatible with anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis with a rich topic of general importance. They are of interest to realize anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis, anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalysis and anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; autocatalysis in water. Classics in supramolecular chemistry are installed to control substrate binding and positioning within the confined micellar space for access to emergent properties.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis operates by stabilizing anionic transition states on &#960;&#8208;acidic aromatic surfaces. In anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalysis, &#960; stacks add polarizability to strengthen interactions. In search of synthetic methods to extend &#960; stacks beyond the limits of foldamers, the self&#8208;assembly of micelles from amphiphilic naphthalenediimides (NDIs) is introduced. To interface substrates and catalysts, charge&#8208;transfer complexes with dialkoxynaphthalenes (DANs), a classic in supramolecular chemistry, are installed. In &#960;&#8208;stacked micelles, the rates of bioinspired ether cyclizations exceed rates on monomers in organic solvents by far. This is particularly impressive considering that anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis in water has been elusive so far. Increasing rates with increasing &#960; acidity of the micelles evince operational anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalysis. At maximal &#960; acidity, autocatalytic behavior emerges. Dependence on position and order in confined micellar space promises access to emergent properties. Anion&#8208;(&#960;)n&#8208;&#960; catalytic micelles in water thus expand supramolecular systems catalysis accessible with anion&#8208;&#960; interactions with an inspiring topic of general interest and great perspectives.

         <title>Dynamically Restructuring NixCryO Electrocatalyst for Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Real Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a NixCryO electrocatalyst that can dynamically restructure itself during the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and increase its porosity by Cr leaching. The enhancement of porosity improved electrolyte penetration and boosted electronic interaction between OH&#8722; and active sites, resulting in 2000, 275, and 100&#8197;h stability at 10, 100, and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, in real seawater.







Abstract
In the pursuit of long&#8208;term stability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in seawater, retaining the intrinsic catalytic activity is essential but has remained challenging. Herein, we developed a NixCryO electrocatalyst that manifested exceptional OER stability in alkaline condition while improving the activity over time by dynamic self&#8208;restructuring. In 1&#8197;M KOH, NixCryO required overpotentials of only 270 and 320&#8197;mV to achieve current densities of 100 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, with excellent long&#8208;term stability exceeding 475&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 280&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The combination of electrochemical measurements and in situ studies revealed that leaching and redistribution of Cr during the prolonged electrolysis resulted in increased electrochemically active surface area. This eventually enhanced the catalyst porosity and improved OER activity. NixCryO was further applied in real seawater from the Red Sea (without purification, 1&#8197;M KOH added), envisaging that the dynamically evolving porosity can offset the adverse active site&#8208;blocking effect posed by the seawater impurities. Remarkably, NixCryO exhibited stable operation for 2000, 275 and 100&#8197;h in seawater at 10, 100 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The proposed catalyst and the mechanistic insights represented a step towards realization of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based direct seawater splitting.

         <title>A Chemoselective Polarity&#8208;Mismatched Photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) Cross&#8208;Coupling Enabled by Synergistic Boron Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the development of a C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) coupling reaction using styrene boronic acids and redox&#8208;active esters under photoredox catalysis. The reaction proceeds through an unusual polarity&#8208;mismatched radical addition mechanism that is orthogonal to established processes. Synergistic activation of the radical precursor and organoboron are critical mechanistic events. Activation of an N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) ester by coordination to boron enables electron transfer, with decomposition leading to a nucleofuge rebound, activating the organoboron to radical addition. The unique mechanism enables chemoselective coupling of styrene boronic acids in the presence of other alkene radical acceptors. The scope and limitations of the reaction, and a detailed mechanistic investigation are presented.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Antimicrobial resistance, caused by persistent adaptation and growing resistance of pathogenic bacteria to overprescribed antibiotics, poses one of the most serious and urgent threats to global public health. The limited pipeline of experimental antibiotics in development further exacerbates this looming crisis and new drugs with alternative modes of action is needed to tackle evolving pathogenic adaptation and mutation. Transition metal complexes can replenish this diminishing stockpile of drug candidates by providing compounds with unique properties that are not easily accessible by pure organic scaffolds.

         <title>Engineered Biocatalytic Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;Substituted&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) are useful synthons for the development of new medicines, materials, and probes for bioactivity. Recently, enzyme engineering has been leveraged to produce a suite of highly active enzymes for synthesis of &#946;&#8208;substituted amino acids. However, there are few examples of biocatalytic N&#8208;substitution reactions to make &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diamino acids. Here, we use directed evolution to engineer the &#946;&#8208;subunit of tryptophan synthase, TrpB, for improved activity with diverse amine nucleophiles. Mechanistic analysis shows that high yields are hindered by product re&#8208;entry into the catalytic cycle and subsequent decomposition. Additional equivalents of L&#8208;serine can inhibit product reentry through kinetic competition, facilitating preparative scale synthesis. We show &#946;&#8208;substitution with a dozen aryl amine nucleophiles, including demonstration on a g&#8208;scale. These transformations yield an underexplored class of amino acids that can serve as unique building blocks for chemical biology and medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Potential Controllable Redox Couple for Mild and Efficient Lithium Recovery from Spent Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prosperity of the lithium&#8208;ion battery market is dialectically accompanied by the depletion of corresponding resources and the accumulation of spent batteries. It is an urgent priority to develop green and efficient battery recycling strategies for helping ease resources and environmental pressures at the current stage. Here, we propose a mild and efficient lithium extracting strategy based on potential controllable redox couple. Active lithium in the spent battery without discharging was extracted using a series of tailored aprotic solutions comprised of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ethers. This ensures a safe yet efficient recycling process with nearly ~100% lithium recovery. We further investigate the Li+&#8208;electron concerted redox reactions and the effect of solvation structure on kinetics during the extraction, and broaden the applicability of the Li&#8208;PAHs solution. This work can stimulate new inspiration for designing novel solutions to meet efficient and sustainable demands in recycling batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbene Formation or Reduction of the Diazo Functional Group? An Unexpected Solvent&#8208;Dependent Reactivity of Cyclic Diazo Imides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;dependent light&#8208;assisted divergent reactivities of cyclic diazo imides and thiols have been disclosed. In dichloromethane, an indane&#8208;fused pyrrolidine is formed via triplet a carbene intermediate. By switching the solvent to acetonitrile, the aryl thiol acts as a reductant and leads to the reduction of the diazo functional group to a hydrazone.







Abstract
The control of the reactivity of diazo compounds is commonly achieved by the choice of a suitable catalyst, e.g. via stabilization of singlet carbenes or radical intermediates. Herein, we report on the light&#8208;promoted reactivity of cyclic diazo imides with thiols, where the choice of solvent results in two fundamentally different reaction pathways. In dichloromethane (DCM), a carbene is formed initially and engages in a cascade C&#8722;H functionalization/thiolation reaction to deliver indane&#8208;fused pyrrolidines in good to excellent yields. When switching to acetonitrile solvent, the carbene pathway is shut down and an unusual reduction of the diazo compound occurs under otherwise identical reaction conditions, where the aryl thiol acts as reductant. A combined set of experimental and computational studies was carried out to obtain mechanistic understanding and to support that indane formation proceeds via the insertion of a triplet carbene, while the reduction of diazo imides proceeds via an electron transfer process.

         <title>Photoinduced Five&#8208;Component Radical Relay Aminocarbonylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical single carbonylation reactions with CO constitute a direct and robust strategy toward various carbonyl compounds from readily available chemicals, and have been extensively studied over the past decades. However, realizing highly selective catalytic systems for controlled double radical carbonylation reactions has remained a substantial challenge, particularly for the more advanced multi&#8208;component variants, despite their great potential value. Herein, we report a visible light&#8208;driven radical relayed five&#8208;component radical double aminocarbonylation reaction of unactivated alkenes using CO under metal&#8208;free conditions. This protocol provides direct access to valuable &#947;&#8208;trifluoromethyl &#945;&#8208;ketoamides with good yields and high selectivity. Crucial was the identification of distinct dual roles of amine coupling partners, sequentially acting as electron donors for the formation of photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes with radical precursors and then as a CO acceptor via nitrogen radical cations to form carbamoyl radicals. Cross&#8208;coupling of carbamoyl radicals with the acyl radicals that are formed in an alkene&#8208;based relay process affords double aminocarbonylation products.</dc:description>

         <title>Synchronous Switching of Dielectric Constant and Photoluminescence in Cyanidonitridorhenate&#8208;Based Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Switching of multiple physical properties by external stimuli in dynamic materials opens the applications in, e.g., smart sensors, biomedical tools, as well as data storage devices. Among stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, inorganic&#8208;organic molecular hybrids exhibiting thermal order&#8208;disorder phase transitions were tested as promising molecular switches of electrical characteristics, including dielectric constant. We aimed at broadening the multifunctional potential of such hybrid materials towards the switching of not only electrical but also other physical properties, e.g., light emission. We report two ionic salts based on luminescent tetracyanidonitro&#8208;rhenate(V) anions bearing two different diamine ligands, 1,2&#8208;diaminoethane (1) and 1,3&#8208;diaminopropane (2), both crystallizing with polar N&#8208;methyl&#8208;dabconium cations. They exhibit the order&#8208;disorder phase transition related to the heating&#8208;induced turning on of the rotation of polar cations. This leads to the unique synchronous switching of dielectric constant, as well as metal&#8208;complex&#8208;centered photoluminescence, as demonstrated by changes in, e.g., emission lifetime. The roles of organic cations, non&#8208;trivial Re(V) complexes, and their interaction, in achieving the coupled thermal switching of electrical and optical properties are discussed utilizing the experimental and theoretical approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Hollow STW&#8208;Type Zeolite Single Crystals with Aluminum Gradient for Highly&#8208;Selective Production of p&#8208;Xylene from Methanol&#8211;Toluene Alkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolites with uniform micropores are important shape&#8208;selective catalysts. However, the external acid sites of zeolites have the negative impact on shape&#8208;selective catalysis, and the sole microporosity may lead to serious diffusion limitation. Herein, we report on direct synthesis of hierarchical hollow STW&#8208;type zeolite single crystals with siliceous exterior. In an alkalinous fluoride medium, the nucleation of highly siliceous STW zeolite takes place first, and the nanocrystals are preferentially aligned on the outer surface of the gel agglomerates to grow into single crystalline shells upon crystallization. The lagged crystallization of the internal Al&#8208;rich amorphous gels onto the inner surface of nanocrystalline zeolite shells lead to the formation of hollow cavities in the core of the zeolite crystals. The hollow zeolite single crystals possess low&#8208;to&#8208;high aluminum gradient from the surface to the core, resulting in an intrinsic inert external surface, and exhibit superior catalytic performance in toluene methylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Diaryl Dihydrophenazine&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers Enhance Synergistic Catalysis in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic polymers (POPs) have emerged as a novel class of porous materials that are synthesized by the polymerization of various organic monomers with different geometries and topologies. The molecular tunability of organic building blocks allows the incorporation of functional units for photocatalytic organic transformations. Here, we report the synthesis of two POP&#8208;based photocatalysts via homo&#8208;polymerization of vinyl&#8208;functionalized diaryl dihydrophenazine (DADHP) monomer (POP1) and co&#8208;polymerization of vinyl&#8208;functionalized DADHP and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine monomers (POP2). The fluorescence lifetimes of DADHP units in the POPs significantly increased, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performances over homogeneous controls. POP1 is highly effective in catalysing visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven C&#8208;N bond forming cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Upon coordination with Ni2+ ions, POP2&#8208;Ni shows strong synergy between photocatalytic and Ni catalytic cycles due to the confinement effect within the POP framework, leading to high efficiency in energy, electron, and organic radical transfer. POP2&#8208;Ni displays excellent activity in catalysing C&#8208;P bond forming reactions between diarylphosphine oxides and aryl iodides. They&#160;increased the photocatalytic activities by more than 30&#8208;fold in C&#8208;N and C&#8208;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. These POP catalysts were readily recovered via centrifugal separation and reused in six catalytic cycles without loss of activities. Thus, photosensitizer&#8208;based POPs provide a promising platform for heterogeneous photocatalytic organic transformations.</dc:description>

Here, we report the synthesis of two POP-based photocatalysts via homo-polymerization of vinyl-functionalized diaryl dihydrophenazine (DADHP) monomer (POP1) and co-polymerization of vinyl-functionalized DADHP and 2,2&#8217;-bipyridine monomers (POP2). The fluorescence lifetimes of DADHP units in the POPs significantly increased, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performances over homogeneous controls. POP1 is highly effective in catalysing visible-light-driven C-N bond forming cross-coupling reactions. Upon coordination with Ni2+ ions, POP2-Ni shows strong synergy between photocatalytic and Ni catalytic cycles due to the confinement effect within the POP framework, leading to high efficiency in energy, electron, and organic radical transfer. POP2-Ni displays excellent activity in catalysing C-P bond forming reactions between diarylphosphine oxides and aryl iodides.

         <title>A DNA Logic Circuit Equipped with a Biological Amplifier Loaded into Biomimetic ZIF&#8208;8 Nanoparticles Enables Accurate Identification of Specific Cancers In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA logic circuits (DLC) enable the accurate identification of specific cell types, such as cancer cells, but they face the challenges of weak output signals and a lack of competent platforms that can efficiently deliver DLC components to the target site in the living body. To address these issues, we rationally introduced a cascaded biological amplifier module based on the Primer Exchange Reaction inspired by electronic circuit amplifier devices. As a paradigm, three abnormally expressed Hela cell microRNAs (&#8208;30a, &#8208;17, and &#8208;21) were chosen as "AND" gate inputs. DLC response to these inputs was boosted by the amplifier markedly enhancing the output signal. More importantly, the encapsulation of DLC and amplifier components into ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles resulted in their efficient delivery to the target site, successfully distinguishing the Hela tumor subtype from other tumors in vivo. Thus, we envision that this strategy has great potential for clinical cancer diagnosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface Engineering in Perovskite Solar Cells with 2D Carbides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Passivating the interfaces between the perovskite and charge transport layers is crucial for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here we report a dual&#8208;interface engineering approach to improving the performance of FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.95Br0.05)3&#8208;based PSCs by incorporating Ti3C2Clx Nano&#8208;MXene and o&#8208;TB&#8208;GDY nanographdiyne (NanoGDY) into the electron transport layer (ETL)/perovskite and perovskite/ hole transport layer (HTL) interfaces, respectively. The dual&#8208;interface passivation simultaneously suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination and promotes carrier extraction by forming the Pb&#8208;Cl chemical bond and strong coordination of &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation with undercoordinated Pb defects. The resulting perovskite film has an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 10 &#956;s and an enlarged crystal size exceeding 2.5 &#956;m. A maximum PCE of 24.86% is realized, with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.20 V. Unencapsulated cells retain 92% of their initial efficiency after 1464 hours in ambient air and 80% after 1002 hours of thermal stability test at 85&#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>MXene&#8208;based Membranes for Drinking Water Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The soaring development of industry exacerbates the shortage of fresh water, making drinking water production an urgent demand. Membrane techniques feature the merits of high efficiency, low energy consumption, and easy operation, deemed as the most potential technology to purify water. Recently, a new type of two&#8208;dimensional materials, MXenes as the transition metal carbides or nitrides in the shape of nanosheets, have attracted enormous interest in water purification due to their extraordinary properties such as adjustable hydrophilicity, easy processibility, antifouling resistance, mechanical strength, and light&#8208;to&#8208;heat transformation capability. In pioneering studies, MXene&#8208;based membranes have been evaluated in the past decade for drinking water production including the separation of bacteria, dyes, salts, and heavy metals. This review focuses on the recent advancement of MXene&#8208;based membranes for drinking water production. A brief introduction of MXenes is given first, followed by descriptions of their unique properties. Then, the preparation methods of MXene membranes are summarized. The various applications of MXene membranes in water treatment and the corresponding separation mechanisms are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and prospects of MXene membranes are presented with the hope to provide insightful guidance on the future design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance MXene membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Polyanionic Electrolytes for Highly Stable Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), the non&#8208;uniform Zn plating/stripping results in a high polarization and low Coulombic efficiency (CE), hindering the large&#8208;scale application of ZIBs. Here, inspired by biomass seaweed plants, an anionic polyelectrolyte alginate acid (SA) was used to initiate the in&#8208;situ formation of the high&#8208;performance solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Zn anode. Attribute to the anionic groups of &#8208;COO&#8208;, the affinity of Zn2+ ions to alginate acid induces a well&#8208;aligned accelerating channel for uniform plating. This SEI regulates the desolvation structure of Zn2+ and facilitates the formation of compact Zn (002) crystal planes. Even under high depth of discharge conditions (DOD), the SA&#8208;coated Zn anode still maintains a stable Zn stripping/plating behavior with a low potential difference (0.114 V). According to the classical nucleation theory, the nucleation energy for SA&#8208;coated Zn is 97% less than that of bare Zn, resulting in a faster nucleation rate. The Zn||Cu cell assembled with the SA&#8208;coated electrode exhibits an outstanding average CE of 99.8 % over 1,400 cycles. The design is successfully demonstrated in pouch cells, where the SA&#8208;coated Zn exhibits capacity retention of 96.9% compared to 59.1% for bare Zn anode, even under the high cathode mass loading (&gt;10 mg/cm2).</dc:description>
