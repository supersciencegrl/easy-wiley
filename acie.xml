         <title>Formation of a Porous Crystalline Mg1&#8210; x Al2O y  Overlayer on Metal Catalysts via Controlled Solid&#8208;State Reactions for High&#8208;temperature Stable Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst deactivation by sintering and coking is a long&#8208;standing issue in metal&#8208;catalyzed harsh high&#8208;temperature hydrocarbon reactions. Ultrathin oxide coatings of metal nanocatalysts have recently appeared attractive to address this issue, while the porosity of the overlayer is difficult to control to preserve the accessibility of embedded metal nanoparticles, thus often leading to a large decrease in activity. Here, we report that a nanometer&#8208;thick alumina coating of MgAl2O4&#8208;supported metal catalysts followed by high&#8208;temperature reduction can transform a nonporous amorphous alumina overlayer into a porous Mg1&#8210;xAl2Oy crystalline spinel structure with a pore size of 2&#8210;3 nm and weakened acidity. The high porosity stems from the restrained Mg migration from the MgAl2O4 support to the alumina overlayer through solid&#8208;state reactions at high temperatures. The resulting Ni/MgAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts with a porous crystalline Mg1&#8210;xAl2Oy overlayer achieved remarkably high stability while preserving much higher activity than the corresponding alumina&#8208;coated Ni and Pt catalysts on MgO and Al2O3 supports in the reactions of dry reforming of methane and propane dehydrogenation, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Responsive Colorimetric and Fluorometric Red&#8208;Shift in Triarylborane Derivatives: Dual Role of Phenazaborine as Lewis Acid and Electron Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of modulating photophysical properties by balancing the contradictory role of phenazaborine as a Lewis acid and an electron donor has been used to synthesize anion&#8208;responsive triarylborane compounds that displayed significant red&#8208;shift in their absorption and photoluminescence spectra in solution. This approach has also been successfully applied to modulate the emission color in polymer films.







Abstract
Photophysical modulation of triarylboranes (TABs) through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions is a fundamental approach for sensing anions. Yet, design principles for anion&#8208;responsive TABs displaying significant red&#8208;shift in absorption and photoluminescence (PL) have remained elusive. Herein, a new strategy for modulating the photophysical properties of TABs in a red&#8208;shift mode has been presented, by using a nitrogen&#8208;bridged triarylborane (1,4&#8208;phenazaborine: PAzB) with a contradictory dual role as a Lewis acid and an electron donor. Following the strategy, PAzB derivatives connected with an electron&#8208;deficient azaaromatic have been developed, and these compounds display a distinct red&#8208;shift in their absorption and PL in response to an anion. Spectroscopic analyses and quantum chemical calculations have revealed the formation of a tetracoordinate borate upon the addition of fluoride, narrowing the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and enhancing the charge&#8208;transfer character in the excited state. This approach has also been demonstrated in modulating the photophysical properties of solid&#8208;state films.

         <title>Layer&#8208;Controllable &#8220;2.5D&#8221; DNA Origami Crystals Synthesized by a Hierarchical Assembly Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical assembly strategy for fabricating &#8220;2.5D&#8221; (2.5 dimensional) DNA origami crystals with customizable layer properties and achieve various 2.5D assemblies with different layer numbers, interlayer distances and surface morphologies.







Abstract
The finite periodic arrangement of functional nanomaterials on the two&#8208;dimensional scale enables the integration and enhancement of individual properties, making them an important research topic in the field of tuneable nanodevices. Although layer&#8208;controllable lattices such as graphene have been successfully synthesized, achieving similar control over colloidal nanoparticles remains a challenge. DNA origami technology has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in programmed nanoparticle assembly. Based on this technology, we proposed a hierarchical assembly strategy to construct a universal DNA origami platform with customized layer properties, which we called 2.5&#8208;dimensional (2.5D) DNA origami crystals. Methodologically, this strategy divides the assembly procedure into two steps: 1) array synthesis, and 2) lattice synthesis, which means that the layer properties, including layer number, interlayer distance, and surface morphology, can be flexibly customized based on the independent designs in each step. In practice, these synthesized 2.5D crystals not only pioneer the expansion of the DNA origami crystal library to a wider range of dimensions, but also highlight the technological potential for templating 2.5D colloidal nanomaterial lattices.

         <title>Tensile Strain&#8208;Mediated Bimetallene Nanozyme for Enhanced Photothermal Tumor Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first report on a novel tensile strain&#8208;mediated local amorphous RhRu (la&#8208;RhRu) bimetallene with exceptional intrinsic photothermal effect and photo&#8208;enhanced multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Functioning as a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanozyme, la&#8208;RhRu exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the tremendous potential of atomic&#8208;scale tensile strain engineering strategy in enhancing tumor catalytic therapy.







Abstract
Nanozymes have demonstrated significant potential in combating malignant tumor proliferation through catalytic therapy. However, the therapeutic effect is often limited by insufficient catalytic performance. In this study, we propose the utilization of strain engineering in metallenes to fully expose the active regions due to their ultrathin nature. Here, we present the first report on a novel tensile strain&#8208;mediated local amorphous RhRu (la&#8208;RhRu) bimetallene with exceptional intrinsic photothermal effect and photo&#8208;enhanced multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Through geometric phase analysis, electron diffraction profile, and X&#8208;ray diffraction, it is revealed that crystalline&#8208;amorphous heterophase boundaries can generate approximately 2&#8201;% tensile strain in the bimetallene. The ultrathin structure and in&#8208;plane strain of the bimetallene induce an amplified strain effect. Both experimental and theoretical evidence support the notion that tensile strain promotes multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Functioning as a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanozyme, la&#8208;RhRu exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the tremendous potential of atomic&#8208;scale tensile strain engineering strategy in enhancing tumor catalytic therapy.

         <title>Achieving Exceptional Thermal and Hydrolytic Resistance in Chemically Circular Polyesters via In&#8208;Chain 1,3&#8208;Cyclobutane Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyesters P(4R&#8208;BL) (R=Ph, Bu), with 1,3&#8208;cyclobutane rings in the backbone, have been developed to demonstrate exceptional thermal stability (Td,5%=376&#8211;380&#8201;&#176;C) and resistance to hydrolysis (intact in pH&#8197;0&#8211;14). Distinguished from classic polyesters, they exhibit good chemical circularity and offer adjustable material performances comparable to those of non&#8208;degradable syndiotactic polystyrene and low&#8208;density polyethylene.







Abstract
Polyesters, a highly promising class of circular polymers for achieving a closed&#8208;loop sustainable plastic economy, inherently exhibit material stability defects, especially in thermal and hydrolytic instability. Here, we introduce a class of polyesters, P(4R&#8208;BL) (R=Ph, Bu), featuring conformationally rigid 1,3&#8208;cyclobutane rings in the backbone. These polyesters not only exhibit superior thermostability (Td,5%=376&#8211;380&#8201;&#176;C) but also demonstrate exceptional hydrolytic resistance with good integrity even after 1 year in basic and acidic aqueous solutions, distinguishing themselves from typical counterparts. Tailoring the flexibility of the side group R enables the controlled thermal and mechanical performance of P(4Ph&#8208;BL) and P(4Bu&#8208;BL) to rival durable syndiotactic polystyrene (SPS) and low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE), respectively. Significantly, despite their high stability, both polyesters can be effectively depolymerized into pristine monomers, establishing a circular life cycle.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Polysubstituted Conjugated Dienes Enabled by Photo&#8208;Driven Sequential Sigmatropic Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented photo&#8208;driven quadruple sequential sigmatropic rearrangements of &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazo alkynylketones with aminals via 1,6&#8208;dipolar ion intermediate is disclosed. This protocol provides a facile access to synthetically useful multi&#8208;substituted conjugated dienes in highly stereoselective manner via visible light catalysis in mild conditions.







Abstract
We here reported a highly stereoselective method for the synthesis of polysubstituted conjugated dienes from &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazo alkynyl ketones and pyrazole&#8208;substituted unsymmetric aminals under mild conditions, which was promoted by photo&#8208;irridation and involved with 1,6&#8208;dipolar intermediate and quadruple sigmatropic rearrangements, was successfully developed. In this transformation, the cleavage of four bonds and the recombination of five bonds were implemented in one operational step. This protocol provided a modular tool for constructing dienes from amines, pyrazoles and &#945;&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoketones in one&#8208;pot manner. The results of mechanistic investigation indicated that the plausible reaction path underwent the 1,6&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement instead of the 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement.

         <title>Magnetic Silica&#8208;Coated Fluorescent Microspheres (MagSiGlow) for Simultaneous Detection of Tumor&#8208;Associated Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid multiplexed, on&#8208;bead immune assay using highly fluorescent magnetic microspheres (MagSiGlow) loaded in microarrays to achieve simultaneous detection and co&#8208;localization of 7500 microspheres per image. We demonstrate remarkable sensitivity and an over 85&#8201;% reduction in signal cross&#8208;over in the simultaneous detection of tumor&#8208;associated protein biomarkers.







Abstract
Multiplexed bead assays for solution&#8208;phase biosensing often encounter cross&#8208;over reactions during signal amplification steps, leading to unwanted false positive and high background signals. Current solutions involve complex custom&#8208;designed and costly equipment, limiting their application in simple laboratory setup. In this study, we introduce a straightforward protocol to adapt a multiplexed single&#8208;bead assay to standard fluorescence imaging plates, enabling the simultaneous analysis of thousands of reactions per plate. This approach focuses on the design and synthesis of bright fluorescent and magnetic microspheres (MagSiGlow) with multiple fluorescent wavelengths serving as unique detection markers. The imaging&#8208;based, single&#8208;bead assay, combined with a scripted algorithm, allows the detection, segmentation, and co&#8208;localization on average of 7500 microspheres per field of view across five imaging channels in less than one second. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method with remarkable sensitivity at low protein detection limits (100&#8197;pg/mL). This technique showed over 85&#8201;% reduction in signal cross&#8208;over to the solution&#8208;based method after the concurrent detection of tumor&#8208;associated protein biomarkers. This approach holds the promise of substantially enhancing high throughput biosensing for multiple targets, seamlessly integrating with rapid image analysis algorithms.

         <title>An Expanded Palette of Fluorescent COS/H2S&#8208;Releasing Donors for H2S Delivery, Detection, and In Vivo Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a palette of fluorescent turn&#8208;on COS/H2S donors that are based on a sulfenyl thiocarbonate scaffold. Reaction with thiols generates H2S and a fluorescent response that can be monitored in situ, in live cells, and in live rats.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important reactive sulfur species that is involved in many biological functions, and H2S imbalances have been indicated as a potential biomarker for various diseases. Different H2S donors have been developed to deliver H2S directly to biological systems, but few reports include donors with optical responses that allow for tracking of H2S release. Moreover, donor systems that use the same chemistry to deliver H2S across a palette of fluorescent responses remain lacking. Here we report five thiol&#8208;activated fluorescence turn&#8208;on COS/H2S donors that utilize blue, yellow, orange, red, and near infrared&#8208;emitting dyes functionalized with an H2S&#8208;releasing sulfenyl thiocarbonate scaffold. Upon treatment with thiols, each donor provides a fluorescence turn&#8208;on response (3&#8211;310&#8208;fold) and high H2S release efficiencies (&gt;60&#8201;%). Using combined electrode and fluorescence experiments, we directly correlate the measured H2S release with the fluorescence response. All donors are biocompatible and release H2S in live cell environments. In addition, we demonstrate that the NIR donor allows for imaging H2S release in live rats via subcutaneous injection of the donor loaded into an alginate gel, which to the best of our knowledge is the first in vivo tracking of H2S release from a fluorogenic donor in non&#8208;transparent organisms.

         <title>Controllable Skeletal and Peripheral Editing of Pyrroles with Vinylcarbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly controllable molecular editing strategy of pyrroles was achieved by using trifluoromethyl vinyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as vinylcarbene precursors, which led to the first dearomative single&#8208;atom skeletal editing of pyrroles through carbon&#8208;atom insertion, as well as three types of peripheral editing reactions: &#945;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;selective C&#8722;H insertion, and [3+2] cycloaddition.







Abstract
The skeletal editing of azaarenes through insertion, deletion, or swapping of single atoms has recently gained considerable momentum in chemical synthesis. Here, we describe a practical skeletal editing strategy using vinylcarbenes in situ generated from trifluoromethyl vinyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones, leading to the first dearomative skeletal editing of pyrroles through carbon&#8208;atom insertion. Furthermore, depending on the used catalyst and substrate, three types of peripheral editing reactions of pyrroles are also disclosed: &#945;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;selective C&#8722;H insertion, and [3+2] cycloaddition. These controllable molecular editing reactions provide a powerful platform for accessing medicinally relevant CF3&#8208;containing N&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks, such as 2,5&#8208;dihydropyridines, piperidines, azabicyclo[3.3.0]octadienes, and allylated pyrroles from readily available pyrroles. Mechanistic insights from experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations shed light on the origin of substrate&#8208; or catalyst&#8208;controlled chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as the reaction mechanism.

         <title>The Tandem Nitrate and CO2 Reduction for Urea Electrosynthesis: Role of Surface N&#8208;Intermediates in CO2 Capture and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic coupling reaction of carbon dioxide and nitrate serves as a sustainable strategy for urea synthesis under ambient conditions. Herein we proposed a urea generation pathway via the tandem reduction of nitrate and CO2, in which the critical C&#8722;N coupling is achieved by the interaction between the nitrate reduction intermediate of *NH2 and free CO2.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 and nitrate offers a promising avenue to produce valuable chemicals through the using of greenhouse gas and nitrogen&#8208;containing wastewater. However, the generally proposed reaction pathway of concurrent CO2 and nitrate reduction for urea synthesis requires the catalysts to be both efficient in both CO2 and nitrate reduction, thus narrowing the selection range of suitable catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a distinct mechanism in urea synthesis, a tandem NO3&#8722; and CO2 reduction, in which the surface amino species generated by nitrate reduction play the role to capture free CO2 and subsequent initiate its activation. When using the TiO2 electrocatalyst derived from MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2, it intrinsically exhibits low activity in aqueous CO2 reduction, however, in the presence of both nitrate and CO2, this catalyst achieves an excellent urea yield rate of 43.37&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 48.88&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE in a flow cell. Even at a low CO2 level of 15&#8201;%, the Faradaic efficiency of urea synthesis remains robust at 42.33&#8201;%. The tandem reduction procedure was further confirmed by in situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations. This research provides new insights into the selection and design of electrocatalysts for urea synthesis.

     alt="The Tandem Nitrate and CO2 Reduction for Urea Electrosynthesis: Role of Surface N-Intermediates in CO2 Capture and Activation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic coupling reaction of carbon dioxide and nitrate serves as a sustainable strategy for urea synthesis under ambient conditions. Herein we proposed a urea generation pathway via the tandem reduction of nitrate and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in which the critical C&#8722;N coupling is achieved by the interaction between the nitrate reduction intermediate of *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and free CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and nitrate offers a promising avenue to produce valuable chemicals through the using of greenhouse gas and nitrogen-containing wastewater. However, the generally proposed reaction pathway of concurrent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and nitrate reduction for urea synthesis requires the catalysts to be both efficient in both CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and nitrate reduction, thus narrowing the selection range of suitable catalysts. Herein, we demonstrate a distinct mechanism in urea synthesis, a tandem NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, in which the surface amino species generated by nitrate reduction play the role to capture free CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and subsequent initiate its activation. When using the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalyst derived from MIL-125-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it intrinsically exhibits low activity in aqueous CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction, however, in the presence of both nitrate and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, this catalyst achieves an excellent urea yield rate of 43.37&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a Faradaic efficiency of 48.88&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE in a flow cell. Even at a low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; level of 15&#8201;%, the Faradaic efficiency of urea synthesis remains robust at 42.33&#8201;%. The tandem reduction procedure was further confirmed by in situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations. This research provides new insights into the selection and design of electrocatalysts for urea synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Sorting of Interfacial Compatibility in MOF&#8208;Based Mixed Matrix Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous partitioning of MOF particles into one polymer domain in a phase separated&#8208;mixed matrix membrane (PS&#8208;MMM) realizes rapid ranking of the interfacial compatibility of various MOF&#8208;polymer pairs. This strategy will be a valuable tool to guide the design of MMMs with more predictable gas separation properties.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have shown great promises to overcome the performance upper limit of polymeric membranes for various gas separation processes. However, the gas separation properties of the MMMs largely depend on the MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility which is a metric difficult to quantify. In most cases, whether a MOF filler and a polymer matrix make a good pair is not revealed until the gas transport experiments are performed. This is because there is a lack of characterization techniques to directly probe the MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility. In this work, we demonstrate a self&#8208;sorting method to rank the interface compatibility among several MOF&#8208;polymer pairs. By mixing one MOF with two polymers in an MMM, the demixing of two polymers will form two polymer domains. The MOF particles will preferably partition into the &#8220;preferred&#8221; polymer domain due to their higher interfacial affinity. By scanning different polymer pairs, a rank of MOF&#8208;polymer interfacial compatibility from high to low can be obtained. Moreover, based on this ranking, it was also found that a highly compatible MOF&#8208;polymer pair suggested by this method also corresponds to a more predictable MMM gas separation performance.

         <title>Switchable Dual Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Through&#8208;Space Conjugated Chiral Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials with switchable dual circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are highly desired because they can not only directly radiate tunable circularly polarized light themselves but also induce CPL for guests by providing chiral environment in self&#8208;assembled structures or serving as the hosts for energy transfer systems. However, most organic molecules only exhibit single CPL and it remains challenging to develop organic molecules with dual CPL. Herein, novel through&#8208;space conjugated chiral foldamers are constructed by attaching two biphenyl arms to the 9,10&#8208;positions of phenanthrene, and switchable dual CPL with opposite signs at different emission wavelengths are successfully realized in the foldamers containing high&#8208;polarizability substitutes (cyano, methylthio and methylsulfonyl). The combined experimental and computational results demonstrate that the intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation has significant contributions to stabilizing the folded conformations. Upon photoexcitation in high&#8208;polar solvents, strong interactions between the biphenyl arms substituted with cyano, methylthio or methylsulfonyl and the polar environment induce conformation transformation for the foldamers, resulting in two transformable secondary structures of opposite chirality, accounting for the dual CPL with opposite signs. These findings highlight the important influence of the secondary structures on chiroptical property of the foldamers and pave a new avenue towards efficient and tunable dual CPL materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective 1,12&#8208;Addition of Alkynyl Biphenyl Quinone Methides Formed In Situ</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of quinone methides formed in situ has been flourishing in recent years. In sharp contrast, the development and utilization of biphenyl quinone methides are rare. Herein, we achieved a remote stereocontrolled 1,12&#8208;conjugate addition of biphenyl quinone methides formed in situ for the first time. In the presence of a suitable chiral phosphoric acid, alkynyl biphenyl quinone methides were generated from &#945;&#8208;[4&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)phenyl]propargyl alcohols, followed by enantioselective 1,12&#8208;conjugate addition with indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates. The strategy enabled the additional alcohols to serve as efficient allenylation reagents, providing a practical access to a broad range of axially chiral allenes bearing (1,1'&#8208;biphenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;ol unit that are previously less accessible. Combined with control experiments, density functional theory calculations shed light on the reaction mechanism, indicating that enantioselectivity originates from the nucleophilic addition of alkynyl biphenyl quinone methides. Notably, not only the presence of biphenyl quinone methides as versatile intermediates was confirmed but also organocatalytic enantioselective 1,12&#8208;addition was established for the first time. This work enriched the family of quinone methides and provided a new platform for the remote stereocontrolled transformation of such versatile intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation Enhanced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence through Spin&#8208;Orbit&#160;Coupling Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) into thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters holds great promise for the advancement of highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Despite recent advancements, a thorough comprehension of the underlying mechanisms remains imperative for the practical application of such materials. In this work, we introduce a novel approach aimed at modulating the TADF process by manipulating dynamic processes in excited states through aggregation effect. Our findings reveal that aggregation not only enhances both prompt and delayed fluorescence simultaneously but also imposes constraints on molecular reorientation. This constraint reinforces spin&#8208;orbit coupling and reduces the energy gap between singlets and triplets. These insights deepen our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing the aggregation effect on TADF materials and provide valuable guidance for the design of high&#8208;efficiency photoluminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvation Structure Enables Stable Operation of Ether&#8208;Based Electrolyte in High&#8208;Voltage Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolytes with anion&#8208;dominated solvation are promising candidates to achieve dendrite&#8208;free and high&#8208;voltage potassium metal batteries. However, it's challenging to form anion&#8208;reinforced solvates at low salt concentrations. Herein, we construct an anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure at a moderate concentration of 1.5 M with weakly coordinated cosolvent ethylene glycol dibutyl ether. The unique solvation structure accelerates the desolvation of K+, strengthens the oxidative stability to 4.94 V and facilitates the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich and stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. These enable stable plating/stripping of K metal anode over 2200 h, high capacity retention of 83.0% after 150 cycles with a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5 V in K0.67MnO2//K cells, and even 91.5% after 30 cycles under 4.7 V. This work provides insight into weakly coordinated cosolvent and opens new avenues for designing ether&#8208;based high&#8208;voltage electrolytes.</dc:description>

While the careful design of molecular&#8208;scale devices often displays enhanced properties along with mechanical movements, controlling mechanics within solid&#8208;state molecular structures remains a significant challenge. Here, we explore the distinct mechanical properties of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) &#8211; frameworks that contain hidden mechanical components. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we uncover the machine&#8208;like capabilities of ZIFs, wherein connected composite building units operate similarly to a mechanical linkage system. Importantly, this research suggests that certain ZIF subunits act as core mechanical components, paving an innovative view for the future design of solid&#8208;state molecular machines.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Few&#8208;Atom Platinum&#160;Clusters by Zinc&#160;Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Glue for Efficient Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Alkene Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Few&#8208;atom metal clusters (FAMCs) exhibit superior performance in catalyzing complex molecular transformations due to their special spatial environments and electronic states, compared to single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, achieving the efficient and accurate synthesis of FAMCs while avoiding the formation of other species, such as nanoparticles and SACs, still remains challenges. Herein, we report a two&#8208;step strategy for synthesis of few&#8208;atom platinum (Pt) clusters by predeposition of zinc&#160;single&#8208;atom&#8208;glue (Zn1) on MgO nanosheets (Ptn&#8208;Zn1/MgO), where FAMCs can be obtained over a wide range of Pt contents (0.09 to 1.45 wt%). Zn atoms can act as Lewis acidic sites to allow electron transfer between Zn and Pt through bridging O atoms, which play a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of few&#8208;atom Pt clusters. Ptn&#8208;Zn1/MgO exhibited a high selectivity of 93% for anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrosilylation. Moreover, an excellent activity with a turnover frequency of up to 1.6 &#215;104 h&#8722;1 can be achieved, exceeding most of the reported Pt SACs. Further theoretical studies revealed that the Pt atoms in Ptn&#8208;Zn1/MgO possess moderate steric hindrance, which enables high selectivity and activity for hydrosilylation. This work presents some guidelines for utilizing atomic&#8208;scale species to increase the synthesis efficiency and precision of FAMCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridinium&#8208;Yne Click Polymerization: A Facile Strategy toward Functional Poly(Vinylpyridinium Salt)s with Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria Killing Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymeric materials with antibacterial properties hold great promise for combating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria, which pose a significant threat to public health. However, the synthesis of most antibacterial polymers typically involves complicated and time&#8208;consuming procedures. In this study, we demonstrate a simple and efficient strategy for synthesizing functional poly(vinylpyridinium salt)s via pyridinium&#8208;yne click polymerization. This click polymerization could proceed with high atom economy under mild conditions without any external catalyst, yielding soluble and thermally stable poly(vinylpyridinium salt)s with satisfactory molecular weights and well&#8208;defined structures in excellent yields. Additionally, the incorporation of luminescent units such as fluorene, tetraphenylethylene, and triphenylamine into the polymer backbone confers excellent aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission properties upon the resulting polymers, rendering them suitable for bacterial staining. Moreover, the existence of pyridinium salt imparts intrinsic antibacterial activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria to the polymers, enabling them to effectively inhibit wound bacterial infection and significantly expedite the healing process. This work not only provides an efficient method to prepare antibacterial polymers, but also opens up the possibility of various applications of polymers in healthcare and other antibacterial fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvation Properties of Neutral Gold Species in Supercritical Water Studied By THz Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supercritical water provides distinctly different solvation
properties compared to what is known from liquid water.
Despite its prevalence deep in the Earth&#8217;s crust and its role
in chemosynthetic ecosystems in the vicinity of hydrothermal vents,
molecular insights into its solvation mechanisms
are still very scarce compared to what is known for liquid
water. Recently, neutral metal particles have been detected
in hydrothermal fluids and proposed to explain the transport of
gold species to ore deposits on Earth. Using ab initio
molecular dynamics, we elucidate the solvation properties of
small gold species at supercritical conditions. The neutral
metal clusters themselves contribute enormous THz intensity
not because of their intramolecular vibrations, but due
to their pronounced electronic polarization coupling to the
dynamical supercritical solvent, leading to a continuum
absorption up to about 1000 cm&#8208;1 . On top, long&#8208;lived
interactions between the gold clusters and solvation water leads
at these supercritical conditions to a sharp THz resonance
that happens to be close to the one due to H&#8208;bonding in
liquid water at ambient conditions. The resulting distinct
resonances can be used to analyse the solvation properties
of neutral metal particles in supercritical aqueous solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Organo&#8208;Mediator Enabled Electrochemical Deuteration of Styrenes&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comparison between the recently reported organo&#8208;mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes by Qiu and previously published direct methods display that his transformation does not establish a novel concept, but simply an addition to the portfolio of known reactions. Addition of mediators to our established direct electrolysis protocol and direct conversion of reported scope examples serve further to strengthen this statement.







Abstract
The recently reported electrochemical, organo&#8208;mediator enabled deuteration of styrenes, a reaction referred to as &#8220;electrochemical deuterium atom transfer&#8221;, differs mechanistically from reported direct electrochemical hydrogenations/deuterations only by a mediated, homogeneous SET to the substrates. By comparing direct vs. mediated processes in general and for styrene reduction, we display that Qiu's work does not change the concept of this chemistry. Experiments with mediators and the direct reduction of examples from the reported scope show that even electron&#8208;rich substrates can be reduced when our direct protocol, published six months before Qiu's work, is applied.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalysed Heck Reaction: Fact or Fiction? Correspondence on &#8220;Unlocking the Chain Walking Process in Gold Catalysis&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that contrary to literature reports the putative gold&#8208;catalysed Heck reaction is a two&#8208;stage process: gold&#8208;based heteroarylation followed by gold&#8208;free carbocationic rearrangements to olefins and tetrahydronaphthalenes.







Abstract
Two recent high&#8208;profile publications reported the formation of Heck&#8208;type arylated alkenes catalysed by MeDalPhosAuCl/AgOTf (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 8810) and their cyclisation to tetralines (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2023, e202312786). It was claimed that these were the first demonstrations in gold catalysis of alkene insertion into Au&#8208;aryl bonds, &#946;&#8208;H elimination and chain&#8208;walking by Au&#8722;H dications. We show here that in fact this chemistry is a two&#8208;stage process. Only the first step, the production of an alkyl triflate ester as the primary organic product by the well&#8208;known alkene heteroarylation sequence, involves gold. The subsequent formation of Heck&#8208;type olefins and their cyclisation to tetralines represent classical H+&#8208;triggered carbocationic chemistry. These steps proceed in the absence of gold with identical results. Literature claims of new gold reactivity such as chain walking by the putative [LAuH]2+ dication have no basis in fact.

Literature claims of new gold reactivity such as chain walking by the putative [LAuH]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dication have no basis in fact.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes is an under&#8208;explored transformation that leads to moieties that are otherwise challenging to prepare. Herein, we report a hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;difluorination of homoallylic (aryl) ethers to give unreported 1,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;oxy groups with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. The transformation proceeds through a different mode of reactivity for 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization, in which a regioselective addition of fluoride opens a transiently formed oxonium intermediate to rearrange an alkyl chain. The optimized protocol is scalable and shown to proceed well with a variety of functional groups and substitution on the alkenyl chain, hence providing ready access to this fluorinated, conformationally controlled moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Ratchets and Kinetic Asymmetry: Giving Chemistry Direction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ratcheting is the mechanism by which stochastic molecular dynamics, and other random exchange processes in chemistry, can be directionally biased and driven away from equilibrium. In this Review we discuss the recognition, invention and development of molecular ratchets and kinetic asymmetry, which underpins it. We explain the design principles for different types of ratchet and energy sources, and outline some current challenges and opportunities for the future.







Abstract
Over the last two decades ratchet mechanisms have transformed the understanding and design of stochastic molecular systems&#8212;biological, chemical and physical&#8212;in a move away from the mechanical macroscopic analogies that dominated thinking regarding molecular dynamics in the 1990s and early 2000s (e.g. pistons, springs, etc), to the more scale&#8208;relevant concepts that underpin out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium research in the molecular sciences today. Ratcheting has established molecular nanotechnology as a research frontier for energy transduction and metabolism, and has enabled the reverse engineering of biomolecular machinery, delivering insights into how molecules &#8216;walk&#8217; and track&#8208;based synthesisers operate, how the acceleration of chemical reactions enables energy to be transduced by catalysts (both motor proteins and synthetic catalysts), and how dynamic systems can be driven away from equilibrium through catalysis. The recognition of molecular ratchet mechanisms in biology, and their invention in synthetic systems, is proving significant in areas as diverse as supramolecular chemistry, systems chemistry, dynamic covalent chemistry, DNA nanotechnology, polymer and materials science, molecular biology, heterogeneous catalysis, endergonic synthesis, the origin of life, and many other branches of chemical science. Put simply, ratchet mechanisms give chemistry direction. Kinetic asymmetry, the key feature of ratcheting, is the dynamic counterpart of structural asymmetry (i.e. chirality). Given the ubiquity of ratchet mechanisms in endergonic chemical processes in biology, and their significance for behaviour and function from systems to synthesis, it is surely just as fundamentally important. This Review charts the recognition, invention and development of molecular ratchets, focussing particularly on the role for which they were originally envisaged in chemistry, as design elements for molecular machinery. Different kinetically asymmetric systems are compared, and the consequences of their dynamic behaviour discussed. These archetypal examples demonstrate how chemical systems can be driven inexorably away from equilibrium, rather than relax towards it.

         <title>Rational Design of Local Reaction Environment for Electrocatalytic Conversion of CO2 into Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond engineering the catalyst, rational design of the local reaction environment near the catalyst surface, including local pH, the choice of the species of cations and anions as well as local reactant/intermediate concentrations, also acts as an effective approach for further improving the catalytic performance of CO2 reduction to valuable multicarbon products.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products provides an attractive route for storing intermittent renewable electricity as fuels and feedstocks with high energy densities. Although substantial progress has been made in selective electrosynthesis of C2+ products via engineering the catalyst, rational design of the local reaction environment in the vicinity of catalyst surface also acts as an effective approach for further enhancing the performance. Here, we discuss recent advances and pertinent challenges in the modulation of local reaction environment, encompassing local pH, the choice of the species and concentrations of cations and anions as well as local reactant/intermediate concentrations, for achieving high C2+ selectivity. In addition, mechanistic understanding in the effects of the local reaction environment is also discussed. Particularly, the important progress extracted from in situ and operando spectroscopy techniques provides insights into how local reaction environment affects C&#8722;C coupling and key intermediates formation that lead to reaction pathways toward a desired C2+ product. The possible future direction in understanding and engineering the local reaction environment is also provided.

         <title>Direct Observation of Polaritonic Chemistry by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Fabry&#8208;Perot optical cavities were developed that enable studying Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the London dispersion&#8208;driven conformational equilibrium of a molecular balance is altered when the C&#8722;H stretching vibration is strongly coupled to the cavity. Unexpectedly, VSC does not substantially affect molecular electron density distributions which has profound implications for the possible mechanisms at play in polaritonic chemistry.







Abstract
Polaritonic chemistry is emerging as a powerful approach to modifying the properties and reactivity of molecules and materials. However, probing how the electronics and dynamics of molecular systems change under strong coupling has been challenging due to the narrow range of spectroscopic techniques that can be applied in situ. Here we develop microfluidic optical cavities for vibrational strong coupling (VSC) that are compatible with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy using standard liquid NMR tubes. VSC is shown to influence the equilibrium between two conformations of a molecular balance sensitive to London dispersion forces, revealing an apparent change in the equilibrium constant under VSC. In all compounds studied, VSC does not induce detectable changes in chemical shifts, J&#8208;couplings, or spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times. This unexpected finding indicates that VSC does not substantially affect molecular electron density distributions, and in turn has profound implications for the possible mechanisms at play in polaritonic chemistry under VSC and suggests that the emergence of collective behavior is critical.

         <title>Elucidation of Palmarumycin Spirobisnaphthalene Biosynthesis Reveals a Set of Previously Unrecognized Oxidases and Reductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palmarumycins are a major type of fungal spirobisnaphthalenes that are biosynthesized by two distantly located biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) jointly. PalA, an unusual, multifunctional P450, catalyzes the dimerization of DHNs to form the unique spiroketal and 2,3&#8208;epoxy groups. PalB installs the 5&#8208;hydoxy group, while PalC functions as a 1&#8208;reductase/dehydrogenase and epoxide reductase. PalD catalyzes the 1&#8208;dehydrogenation to form 1&#8208;keto products.







Abstract
Spirobisnaphthalenes (SBNs) are a class of highly oxygenated, fungal bisnaphthalenes containing a unique spiroketal bridge, that displayed diverse bioactivities. Among the reported SBNs, palmarumycins are the major type, which are precursors for the other type of SBNs structurally. However, the biosynthesis of SBNs is unclear. In this study, we elucidated the biosynthesis of palmarumycins, using gene disruption, heterologous expression, and substrate feeding experiments. The biosynthetic gene cluster for palmarumycins was identified to be distant from the polyketide synthase gene cluster, and included two cytochrome P450s (PalA and PalB), and one short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (PalC) encoding genes as key structural genes. PalA is an unusual, multifunctional P450 that catalyzes the oxidative dimerization of 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene to generate the spiroketal linkage and 2,3&#8208;epoxy group. Chemical synthesis of key intermediate and in vitro biochemical assays proved that the oxidative dimerization proceeded via a binaphthyl ether. PalB installs the C&#8208;5 hydroxy group, widely found in SBNs. PalC catalyzes 1&#8208;keto reduction, the reverse 1&#8208;dehydrogenation, and 2,3&#8208;epoxide reduction. Moreover, an FAD&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase, encoded by palD, which locates outside the cluster, functions as a 1&#8208;dehydrogenase. These results provided the first genetic and biochemical evidence for the biosynthesis of palmarumycin SBNs.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Interlayer Spacings as Perfectly Selective Artificial Proton Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired artificial proton channels that can sieving protons out of ions or water molecules with perfectly selectivity are constructed. The channels use the interlayer spacings of covalent organic framework materials consisting of hydrophilic functional groups to sterically reject all atoms or molecules, while providing hydrogen bonding network for proton hopping.







Abstract
Biological proton channels have perfect selectivity in aqueous environment against almost all ions and molecules, a property that differs itself from other biological channels and a feature that remains challenging to realize for bulk artificial materials. The biological perfect selectivity originates from the fact that the channel has almost no free space for ion or water transport but generates a hydrogen bonded wire in the presence of protons to allow the proton hopping. Inspired by this, we used the interlayer spacings of covalent organic framework materials consisting of hydrophilic functional groups as perfectly selective artificial proton channels. The interlayer spacings are so narrow that no atoms or molecules can diffuse through. However, protons exhibit a diffusivity in the same order of magnitude as that in bulk water. Density functional theory calculations show that water molecules and the COF material form hydrogen bonded wires, allowing the proton hopping. We further demonstrate that the proton transport rate can be tuned by adjusting the acidity of the functional groups.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Titanium on Mesoporous Nitrogen, Oxygen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Efficient Photo&#8208;thermal Catalytic CO2 Cycloaddition by a Radical Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Ti&#8722;CNO catalysts are synthesized for photothermal catalytic cycloaddition of styrene oxide and CO2 to styrene carbonate, achieving an excellent catalytic performance (98.3&#8201;% in 6&#8197;h, 10&#8197;cycles). The addition of Ti single atoms creates abundant mesoporous structure, enhances photothermal effect and Lewis acidic/basic sites, which facilitate the activation of styrene oxide and CO2 to form styrene oxide&#8901;+ and CO2&#8901;&#8722;, respectively.







Abstract
Developing efficient and earth&#8208;abundant catalysts for CO2 fixation to high value&#8208;added chemicals is meaningful but challenging. Styrene carbonate has great market value, but the cycloaddition of CO2 to styrene oxide is difficult due to the high steric hindrance and weak electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the phenyl group. To utilize clean energy (such as optical energy) directly and effectively for CO2 value&#8208;added process, we introduce earth&#8208;abundant Ti single&#8208;atom into the mesoporous nitrogen, oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets (Ti&#8722;CNO) by a two&#8208;step method. The Ti&#8722;CNO exhibits excellent photothermal catalytic activities and stability for cycloaddition of CO2 and styrene oxide to styrene carbonate. Under light irradiation and ambient pressure, an optimal Ti&#8722;CNO produces styrene carbonate with a yield of 98.3&#8201;%, much higher than CN (27.1&#8201;%). In addition, it shows remarkable stability during 10 consecutive cycles. Its enhanced catalytic performance stems from the enhanced photothermal effect and improved Lewis acidic/basic sites exposed by the abundant mesopores. The experiments and theoretical simulations demonstrate the styrene oxide&#8901;+ and CO2&#8901;&#8722; radicals generated at the Lewis acidic (Ti&#948;+) and basic sites of Ti&#8722;CNO under light irradiation, respectively. This work furnishes a strategy for synthesizing advanced single&#8208;atom catalysts for photo&#8208;thermal synergistic CO2 fixation to high value products via a cycloaddition pathway.

         <title>Adaptive and Robust Vitrimers Fabricated by Synergy of Traditional and Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We couple boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8722;N) dative bonds and B&#8722;O covalent bonds to generate a new class of vitrimers, boron&#8208;nitrogen vitrimers (BNVs), to endow them with dynamic features at usage temperatures. Compared with boron&#8208;ester vitrimers (BEVs) without B&#8722;N dative bonds, the BNVs showcase enhanced mechanical performance.







Abstract
Vitrimers offer a unique combination of mechanical performance, reprocessability, and recyclability that makes them highly promising for a wide range of applications. However, achieving dynamic behavior in vitrimeric materials at their intended usage temperatures, thus combining reprocessability with adaptivity through associative dynamic covalent bonds, represents an attractive but formidable objective. Herein, we couple boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8722;N) dative bonds and B&#8722;O covalent bonds to generate a new class of vitrimers, boron&#8208;nitrogen vitrimers (BNVs), to endow them with dynamic features at usage temperatures. Compared with boron&#8208;ester vitrimers (BEVs) without B&#8722;N dative bonds, the BNVs with B&#8722;N dative bonds showcase enhanced mechanical performance. The excellent mechanical properties come from the synergistic effect of the dative B&#8722;N supramolecular polymer and covalent boron&#8208;ester networks. Moreover, benefiting from the associative exchange of B&#8722;O dynamic covalent bonds above their topological freezing temperature (Tv), the resultant BNVs also possess the processability. This study leveraged the structural characteristics of a boron&#8208;based vitrimer to achieve material reinforcement and toughness enhancement, simultaneously providing novel design concepts for the construction of new vitrimeric materials.

         <title>CO Intermediate&#8208;Assisted Dynamic Cu Sintering During Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction on Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalysts</title>

A novel pathway involving the evolution of Cu&#8722;(CO)x moieties driven by the synergistic adsorption of CO and H was identified for dynamic Cu sintering in Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts under CO2 reduction conditions.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to multicarbon products has been widely recognized for Cu&#8208;based catalysts. However, the structural changes in Cu&#8208;based catalysts during the eCO2RR pose challenges to achieving an in&#8208;depth understanding of the structure&#8211;activity relationship, thereby limiting catalyst development. Herein, we employ constant&#8208;potential density functional theory calculations to investigate the sintering process of Cu single atoms of Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts into clusters under eCO2RR conditions. Systematic constant&#8208;potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the leaching of Cu&#8722;(CO)x moieties and subsequent agglomeration into clusters can be facilitated by synergistic adsorption of H and eCO2RR intermediates (e.g., CO). Increasing the Cu2+ concentration or the applied potential can efficiently suppress Cu sintering. Both microkinetic simulations and experimental results further confirm that sintered Cu clusters play a crucial role in generating C2 products. These findings provide significant insights into the dynamic evolution of Cu&#8208;based catalysts and the origin of their activity toward C2 products during the eCO2RR.

Herein, we employ constant-potential density functional theory calculations to investigate the sintering process of Cu single atoms of Cu&#8722;N&#8722;C single-atom catalysts into clusters under eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR conditions. Systematic constant-potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the leaching of Cu&#8722;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; moieties and subsequent agglomeration into clusters can be facilitated by synergistic adsorption of H and eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR intermediates (e.g., CO). Increasing the Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration or the applied potential can efficiently suppress Cu sintering. Both microkinetic simulations and experimental results further confirm that sintered Cu clusters play a crucial role in generating C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products. These findings provide significant insights into the dynamic evolution of Cu-based catalysts and the origin of their activity toward C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products during the eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Selective Formation of Silver Nanoclusters and Their Transformation to the Same Product</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylthiacalix[4]arene protected silver nanoclusters (Ag54 and Ag33) with different stabilities were isolated from identical reactants under different temperatures. Upon stimulation with bpbenz (bpbenz=1,4&#8208;bis(pyrid&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene), the kinetically metastable Ag54 and the thermodynamically stable Ag33 can yield the same product of Ag31via the breakage&#8208;reorganization and ligand exchange transformation mechanism, respectively.







Abstract
Herein, two atomically precise silver nanoclusters, Ag54 and Ag33, directed by inner anion templates (CrO42&#8722; and/or Cl&#8722;), are initially isolated as a mixed phase from identical reactants across a wide temperature range (20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C). Interestingly, fine&#8208;tuning the reaction temperature can realize pure phase synthesis of the two nanoclusters; that is, a metastable Ag54 is kinetically formed at a low temperature (20&#8201;&#176;C), whereas such a system is steered towards a thermodynamically stable Ag33 at a relatively high temperature (80&#8201;&#176;C). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry illustrates that the stability of Ag33 is superior to that of Ag54, which is further supported by density functional theory calculations. Importantly, the difference in structural stability can influence the pathway of 1,4&#8208;bis(pyrid&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene induced transformation reaction starting from Ag54 and Ag33. The former undergoes a dramatic breakage&#8208;reorganization process to form an Ag31 dimer (Ag31), while the same product can be also achieved from the latter following a noninvasive ligand exchange process. Both the Ag54 and Ag33 have the potential for further remote laser ignition applications. This work not only demonstrates how temperature controls the isolation of a specific phase, but also sheds light on the structural transformation pathway of nanoclusters with different stability.

         <title>One&#8208;step Synthesis of Organic Terminal 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene Nanosheets by Etching of Ti3AlC2 in an Organic Lewis Acid Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High purity Ti3C2Tx (T=&#8722;CF3SO3) nanosheets were directly obtained via an etching route using an organic Lewis acid solvent that was completely free of HF. The obtained Ti3C2Tx terminated with &#8722;CF3SO3 had large nanosheets with an average size of approximately 4&#8197;&#956;m, the largest size reached 15&#8197;&#956;m, and the CF3SO3&#8722; surface chemistry could generally improve the stability of the suspension.







Abstract
The surface and interface chemistry are critical for controlling the properties of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes). Numerous efforts have been devoted to the functionalization of MXenes with small inorganic ligands; however, few etching methods have been reported on the direct bonding of organic groups to MXene surfaces. In this work, we demonstrated an efficient and rapid strategy for the direct synthesis of 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets with organic terminal groups in an organic Lewis acid (trifluoromethanesulfonic acid) solvent, without introducing additional intercalations. The dissolution of aluminum and the subsequent in situ introduction of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid resulted in the extraction of Ti3C2Tx MXene (T=CF3SO3&#8722;) (denoted as CF3SO3H&#8722;Ti3C2Tx) flakes with sizes reaching 15&#8197;&#956;m and high productivity (over 70&#8201;%) of monolayers or few layers. More importantly, the large CF3SO3H&#8722;Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets had high colloidal stability, making them promising as efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Structural Insights Into the Terpene Cyclization Domains of Two Fungal Sesterterpene Synthases and Enzymatic Engineering for Sesterterpene Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structures of the terpene cyclization (TC) domains of two fungal sesterterpene synthases (NfSS and PbSS) were determined. Modeling of carbocationic intermediates, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and isotope labeling provided detailed insights into their catalytic mechanisms. Structure&#8208;based engineering of NfSS and PbSS resulted in the formation of 20 sesterterpenes including 13 new compounds.







Abstract
Little is known about the structures and catalytic mechanisms of sesterterpene synthases (StTSs), which greatly hinders the structure&#8208;based engineering of StTSs for structural diversity expansion of sesterterpenes. We here report on the crystal structures of the terpene cyclization (TC) domains of two fungal StTSs: sesterfisherol synthase (NfSS) and sesterbrasiliatriene synthase (PbSS). Both TC structures contain benzyltriethylammonium chloride (BTAC), pyrophosphate (PPi), and magnesium ions (Mg2+), clearly defining the catalytic active sites. A combination of theory and experiments including carbocationic intermediates modeling, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and isotope labeling provided detailed insights into the structural basis for their catalytic mechanisms. Structure&#8208;based engineering of NfSS and PbSS resulted in the formation of 20 sesterterpenes including 13 new compounds and four pairs of epimers with different configurations at C18. These results expand the structural diversity of sesterterpenes and provide important insights for future synthetic biology research.

         <title>Cage&#8208;To&#8208;Cage Transformations in Self&#8208;Assembled Coordination Cages Using &#8220;Acid/Base&#8221; or &#8220;Guest Binding&#8208;Induced Strain&#8221; as Stimuli</title>

         <dc:description>
A pair of acid/base responsive cages that can be interconverted without affecting the coordination environment have been self&#8208;assembled from 1,5&#8208;enedione/pyrylium based ligands, leading to a three&#8208;state supramolecular switch that can be controlled through strong acid/bases. A guest&#8208;binding&#8208;induced strain&#8208;triggered cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation was found, in addition to chemical stimuli (acid/base, NH3) responsive cage transformations.







Abstract
Controlling supramolecular systems between different functional forms by utilizing acids/bases as stimuli is a formidable challenge, especially where labile coordination bonds are involved. A pair of acid/base responsive, interconvertible 1,5&#8208;enedione/pyrylium based Pd2L4&#8208;type cages are prepared that exhibit differential guest binding abilities towards disulfonates of varied sizes. A three&#8208;state switch has been achieved, where (i) a weakly coordinating base induced cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation in the first step, (ii) a strongly coordinating base triggered cage disassembly as the second step, and (iii) the third step shows acid(strong) promoted generation of initial cage, thereby completing the cycle. To our surprise, binding of a specific disulfonate guest facilitated cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations by inducing strain on the cage assembly thereby opening the labile pyrylium rings of the cage. Through a competitive guest binding study, we demonstrated the superior guest binding capability of the octacationic pyrylium&#8208;based cage over a similar&#8208;sized tetracationic cage. These results provide a reliable approach to reversibly modulate the guest binding properties of acid/base&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembled coordination cages.

         <title>Supertwisted Chiral Gyroid Mesophase in Chiral Rod&#8208;Like Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecules that cannot self&#8208;assemble in either layers or cylinders often form complex in&#8208;between &#8220;bicontinuous&#8221; structures made up of interpenetrating networks. The most widespread is the achiral &#8220;gyroid&#8221; phase, containing two antichiral networks. Here it is shown that the introduction of an asymmetric unit into the rod&#8208;like molecular core can rewind the segments of one of the nets, &#8220;supertwisting&#8221; them in reverse and making the famous gyroid chiral.







Abstract
Among the intriguing bicontinuous self&#8208;assembled structures, the gyroid cubic is the most ubiquitous. It is found in block and star polymers, surfactants with or without solvent, in thermotropic liquid crystals with end&#8208; or side&#8208;chains, and in biosystems providing structural color and modelling cell mitosis. It contains two interpenetrating networks of opposite chirality and is thus achiral if, as usual, the content of the two nets is the same. However, we now find that this is not the case for strongly chiral compounds. While achiral molecules follow the opposite twists of nets 1 and 2, molecules with a chiral center in their rod&#8208;like core fail to follow the 70&#176; twist between junctions in net 2 and instead wind against it by &#8722;110&#176; to still match the junction orientation. The metastable chiral gyroid is a high&#8208;entropy high&#8208;heat&#8208;capacity mesophase. The homochirality of its nets makes the CD signal of the thienofluorenone compounds close to that in the stable I23 phase with 3&#8197;isochiral nets.

         <title>Scalable Preparation of Ultraselective and Highly Permeable Fully Aromatic Polyamide Nanofiltration Membranes for Antibiotic Desalination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noncoplanar polyaromatic amine, 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;methanetetrayltetrakis(benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) (MTLB), was used as a molecular building block for fabricating thin&#8208;film composite membranes via interfacial polymerization. The resulting membrane exhibited a high salt/antibiotic selectivity and water permeance. The excellent antibiotic desalination performance can be maintained in industrial&#8208;scale spiral&#8208;wound module.







Abstract
Membranes are important in the pharmaceutical industry for the separation of antibiotics and salts. However, its widespread adoption has been hindered by limited control of the membrane microstructure (pore architecture and free&#8208;volume elements), separation threshold, scalability, and operational stability. In this study, 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;methanetetrayltetrakis(benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) (MTLB) as prepared as a molecular building block for fabricating thin&#8208;film composite membranes (TFCMs) via interfacial polymerization. The relatively large molecular size and rigid molecular structure of MTLB, along with its non&#8208;coplanar and distorted conformation, produced thin and defect&#8208;free selective layers (~27&#8197;nm) with ideal microporosities for antibiotic desalination. These structural advantages yielded an unprecedented high performance with a water permeance of 45.2&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1 and efficient antibiotic desalination (NaCl/adriamycin selectivity of 422). We demonstrated the feasibility of the industrial scaling of the membrane into a spiral&#8208;wound module (with an effective area of 2.0&#8197;m2). This module exhibited long&#8208;term stability and performance that surpassed those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes used for antibiotic desalination. This study provides a scientific reference for the development of high&#8208;performance TFCMs for water purification and desalination in the pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>Hydrogen Source Tuned Regiodivergent Asymmetric Hydroalkylations of 2&#8208;Substituted 1,3&#8208;Dienes with Aldehydes by Cobalt&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic methods to access different regio&#8208; and enantiomers by switching the least reaction parameters are attractive yet challenging. Herein, a Co&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective reductive hydroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aldehydes have been achieved, allowing for regio&#8208;switchable 1,2&#8208;hydroalkylation and 4,3&#8208;hydroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes to furnish different homoallylic alcohol architectures from identical starting materials.







Abstract
Catalytic methods allowing for the reliable prediction and control of diverse regioselectivity along with the control of enantioselectivity to access different regio&#8208; and enantiomers by switching the least reaction parameters are one of the most attractive ways in organic synthesis, which provide access to diverse enantioenriched architectures from identical starting materials. Herein, a Co&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective reductive hydroalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with aldehydes has been achieved, furnishing different enantioenriched homoallylic alcohol architectures in good levels of enantioselectivity. The reaction features the switch of regioselectivity tuned by the selection of proton source. The use of an acid as proton source provided asymmetric 1,2&#8208;hydroalkylation products under reductive conditions, yet asymmetric 4,3&#8208;hydroalkylation products were obtained with silane as hydride source. This catalytic protocol allows for the access of homoallylic alcohols with two continuous saturated carbon centers in good levels of regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Finding Natural, Dense, and Stable Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Wurtzite Crystal Surfaces for Small&#8208;Molecule Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs) are found on the stable wurtzite crystal surfaces. All the surface atoms serving as Lewis acid/base sites contribute to the surface density of SFLPs reaching up to the highest value to date. The approaching orbital orientations of SFLPs are the origin of the outstanding performance for the activation of small molecules, thereby demonstrating great potential in heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
The surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs) open up new opportunities for substituting noble metals in the activation and conversion of stable molecules. However, the applications of SFLPs on a larger scale are impeded by the complex construction process, low surface density, and sensitivity to the reaction environment. Herein, wurtzite&#8208;structured crystals such as GaN, ZnO, and AlP are found for developing natural, dense, and stable SFLPs. It is revealed that the SFLPs can naturally exist on the (100) and (110) surfaces of wurtzite&#8208;structured crystals. All the surface cations and anions serve as the Lewis acid and Lewis base in SFLPs, respectively, contributing to the surface density of SFLPs as high as 7.26&#215;1014&#8197;cm&#8722;2. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the SFLPs can keep stable under high temperatures and the reaction atmospheres of CO and H2O. Moreover, outstanding performance for activating the given small molecules is achieved on these natural SFLPs, which originates from the optimal orbital overlap between SFLPs and small molecules. Overall, these findings not only provide a simple method to obtain dense and stable SFLPs but also unfold the nature of SFLPs toward the facile activation of small molecules.

&lt;p&gt;The surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs) open up new opportunities for substituting noble metals in the activation and conversion of stable molecules. However, the applications of SFLPs on a larger scale are impeded by the complex construction process, low surface density, and sensitivity to the reaction environment. Herein, wurtzite-structured crystals such as GaN, ZnO, and AlP are found for developing natural, dense, and stable SFLPs. It is revealed that the SFLPs can naturally exist on the (100) and (110) surfaces of wurtzite-structured crystals. All the surface cations and anions serve as the Lewis acid and Lewis base in SFLPs, respectively, contributing to the surface density of SFLPs as high as 7.26&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the SFLPs can keep stable under high temperatures and the reaction atmospheres of CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Moreover, outstanding performance for activating the given small molecules is achieved on these natural SFLPs, which originates from the optimal orbital overlap between SFLPs and small molecules. Overall, these findings not only provide a simple method to obtain dense and stable SFLPs but also unfold the nature of SFLPs toward the facile activation of small molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Implanting Colloidal Nanoparticles into Single&#8208;Crystalline Zeolites for Catalytic Dehydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic zeolite with Fe3O4 colloidal nanoparticles nucleus and single&#8208;crystalline ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites shell have been fabricated by a stepwise crystallization strategy. The resulting Fe3O4@HZSM&#8208;5 catalyst shows a high catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for the dehydration of ethonal in a magnetically stabilized bed (MSB) reactor.







Abstract
The encapsulation of functional colloidal nanoparticles (100&#8197;nm) into single&#8208;crystalline ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites, aiming to create uniform core&#8211;shell structures, is a highly sought&#8208;after yet formidable objective due to significant lattice mismatch and distinct crystallization properties. In this study, we demonstrate the fabrication of a core&#8211;shell structured single&#8208;crystal zeolite encompassing an Fe3O4 colloidal core via a novel confinement stepwise crystallization methodology. By engineering a confined nanocavity, anchoring nucleation sites, and executing stepwise crystallization, we have successfully encapsulated colloidal nanoparticles (CN) within single&#8208;crystal zeolites. These grafted sites, alongside the controlled crystallization process, compel the zeolite seed to nucleate and expand along the Fe3O4 colloidal nanoparticle surface, within a meticulously defined volume (1.5&#215;107&#8804;V&#8804;1.3&#215;108&#8197;nm3). Our strategy exhibits versatility and adaptability to an array of zeolites, including but not restricted to ZSM&#8208;5, NaA, ZSM&#8208;11, and TS&#8208;1 with polycrystalline zeolite shell. We highlight the uniformly structured magnetic&#8208;nucleus single&#8208;crystalline zeolite, which displays pronounced superparamagnetism (14&#8197;emu/g) and robust acidity (~0.83&#8197;mmol/g). This innovative material has been effectively utilized in a magnetically stabilized bed (MSB) reactor for the dehydration of ethanol, delivering an exceptional conversion rate (98&#8201;%), supreme ethylene selectivity (98&#8201;%), and superior catalytic endurance (in excess of 100&#8197;hours).

         <title>Chloro&#8208;Functionalized Ether&#8208;Based Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage and Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ether&#8208;based electrolyte functionalized with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (chloro&#8208;substitution) enabled the formation of a dual halides&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), thereby enhancing the cycling stability (6000&#8197;cycles), high voltage (4.3&#8197;V) performance, and wide temperature operation (&#8722;5&#8201;&#176;C to 45&#8201;&#176;C) of potassium ion batteries.







Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolyte is beneficial to obtaining good low&#8208;temperature performance and high ionic conductivity in potassium ion batteries. However, the dilute ether&#8208;based electrolytes usually result in ion&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation of graphite, poor cycling stability, and hard to withstand high voltage cathodes above 4.0&#8197;V. To address the aforementioned issues, an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (chloro&#8208;substitution) was introduced to regulate the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and enhance the oxidative stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes. The dilute (~0.91&#8197;M) chloro&#8208;functionalized ether&#8208;based electrolyte not only facilitates the formation of homogeneous dual halides&#8208;based SEI, but also effectively suppress aluminum corrosion at high voltage. Using this functionalized electrolyte, the K||graphite cell exhibits a stability of 700&#8197;cycles, the K||Prussian blue (PB) cell (4.3&#8197;V) delivers a stability of 500&#8197;cycles, and the PB||graphite full&#8208;cell reveals a long stability of 6000&#8197;cycles with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.98&#8201;%. Additionally, the PB||graphite full&#8208;cell can operate under a wide temperature range from &#8722;5&#8201;&#176;C to 45&#8201;&#176;C. This work highlights the positive impact of electrolyte functionalization on the electrochemical performance, providing a bright future of ether&#8208;based electrolytes application for long&#8208;lasting, wide&#8208;temperature, and high Coulombic efficiency PIBs and beyond.

         <title>High&#8208;performance Pyroelectric Property Accompanied by Spin Crossover in a Single Crystal of Fe(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;crossover Fe(II) complex demonstrating high&#8208;performance pyroelectricity across a remarkably wide temperature range just above room temperature was reported. Detailed structural analyses revealed that pyroelectric response can be ascribed to a giant thermal expansion of polar axis accompanied by a gradual low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin transition of metal centers.







Abstract
Pyroelectric materials hold significant potential for energy harvesting, sensing, and imaging applications. However, achieving high&#8208;performance pyroelectricity across a wide temperature range near room temperature remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a single crystal of Fe(II) spin&#8208;crossover compound shows remarkable pyroelectric properties accompanied by a thermally controlled spin transition. In this material, the uniaxial alignment of polar molecules results in a polarization of the lattice. As the molecular geometry is modulated during a gradual spin transition, the polar axis experiences a colossal thermal expansion with a coefficient of 796&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;K&#8722;1. Consequently, the material's polarization undergoes significant modulation as a secondary pyroelectric effect. The considerable shift in polarization (pyroelectric coefficient, p=3.7&#8211;22&#8197;nC&#8201;K&#8722;1cm&#8722;2), coupled with a low dielectric constant (&#1013;&#8242;=4.4&#8211;5.4) over a remarkably wide temperature range of 298 to 400&#8197;K, suggests this material is a high&#8208;performance pyroelectric. The demonstration of pyroelectricity combined with magnetic switching in this study will inspire further investigations in the field of molecular electronics and magnetism.

         <title>Light Induced Proton Coupled Charge Transfer Triggers Counterion Directional Translocation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8208;triggered translocation of ClO4&#8722; anion from cationic to neutral&#8208;binding site along BPym&#8208;OH dye is visualized by emission. The combination of time&#8208;resolved fluorescence and molecular dynamic simulation allows its description in time and energy domains. This reaction generates dramatically red&#8208;shifted fluorescence extending to near&#8208;IR that appears at ~83&#8197;ps, resulting from electrochromic modulation of coupled proton&#8208;electron transfer.







Abstract
We demonstrate directed translocation of ClO4&#8722; anions from cationic to neutral binding site along the synthetized BPym&#8208;OH dye molecule that exhibits coupled excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) and charge&#8208;transfer (CT) reaction (PCCT). The results of steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy together with computer simulation and modeling show that in low polar toluene the excited&#8208;state redistribution of electronic charge enhanced by ESIPT generates the driving force, which is much stronger than by CT reaction itself and provides more informative gigantic shifts of fluorescence spectra signaling on ultrafast ion motion. The associated with ion translocation red&#8208;shifted fluorescence band (at 750&#8197;nm, extending to near&#8208;IR region) appears at the time ~83&#8197;ps as a result of electrochromic modulation of PCCT reaction. It occurs at substantial delay to PCCT that displayed fluorescence band at 640&#8197;nm and risetime of &lt;200&#8197;fs. Thus, it becomes possible to visualize the manifestations of light&#8208;triggered ion translocation and of its driving force by fluorescence techniques and to separate them in time and energy domains.

         <title>Tunable Narrow&#8208;Band Cyan&#8208;Emission of Eu2+&#8208;doped Nitridomagnesophosphates Ba3&#8722;xSrx[Mg2P10N20]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ (x=0&#8211;3)</title>

         <dc:description>
We present the first solid solution series of the new class of nitridomagnesophosphates with excellent luminescence properties in the cyan spectral range, tunable by Ba/Sr ratio. Extensive investigations have made it possible to attribute the luminescence to the doping of one crystallographic site. DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the influence of Mg in the P/N network for the first time.







Abstract
Tetrahedron&#8208;based nitrides offer a wide range of properties and applications. Highly condensed nitridophosphates are examples of nitrides that exhibit fascinating luminescence properties when doped with Eu2+, making them appealing for industrial applications. Here, we present the first nitridomagnesophosphate solid solution series Ba3&#8722;xSrx[Mg2P10N20]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ (x=0&#8211;3), synthesized by a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach using the multianvil technique (3&#8197;GPa, 1400&#8201;&#176;C). Starting from the binary nitrides P3N5 and Mg3N2 and the respective alkaline earth azides, we incorporate Mg into the P/N framework to increase the degree of condensation &#954; to 0.6, the highest observed value for alkaline earth nitridophosphates. The crystal structure was elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX), and solid&#8208;state NMR. DFT calculations were performed on the title compounds and other related highly condensed nitridophosphates to investigate the influence of Mg in the P/N network. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples of the solid solution series show a tunable narrow&#8208;band emission from cyan to green (492&#8211;515&#8197;nm), which is attributed to the preferred doping of a single crystallographic site. Experimental confirmation of this assumption was provided by overdoping experiments and STEM&#8208;HAADF studies on the series as well on the stoichiometric compound Ba2Eu[Mg2P10N20] with additional atomic resolution energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping.

         <title>[2+1] Cycloadditions Modulate the Hydrophobicity of Ni&#8208;N4 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microenvironment regulation of M&#8208;N4 single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is a promising way to tune their catalytic properties toward the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. However, strategies that can effectively introduce functional groups around the M&#8208;N4 sites through strong covalent bonding and under mild reaction conditions are highly desired. Taking the hydrophilic Ni&#8208;N4 SAC as a representative, we report herein a [2+1] cycloaddition reaction between Ni&#8208;N4 and in&#8208;situ generated difluorocarbene (F2C:), and enable the surface fluorocarbonation of Ni&#8208;N4, resulting in the formation of a super&#8208;hydrophobic Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;CF2 catalyst. Meanwhile, the mild reaction conditions allow Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;CF2 to inherit both the electronic and structural configuration of the Ni&#8208;N4 sites from Ni&#8208;N4. Enhanced electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Faradaic efficiency above 98% is achieved in a wide operating potential window from &#8722;0.7 V to &#8722;1.3 V over Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;CF2. In&#8208;situ spectroelectrochemical studies reveal that a highly hydrophobic microenvironment formed by the &#8722;CF2&#8722; group repels asymmetric H&#8208;bonded water at the electrified interface, inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction and promoting CO production. This work highlights the advantages of [2+1] cycloaddition reactions on the covalent modification of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Isomerization Driven Electrocatalytic Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prevailing view about molecular catalysts is that the central metal ion is responsible for the reaction mechanism and selectivity, whereas the ligands mainly affect the reaction kinetics. Here, we question this paradigm and show that ligands have a dramatic influence on the selectivity of the product. We show how even a seemingly small change in ligand isomerization sharply alters the selectivity of the well&#8208;researched oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) Co phthalocyanine catalyst from an indirect 2e&#8211; to a direct 4e&#8211; pathway. Detailed analysis reveals that intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions in the ligand activate the catalytic Co, directing the oxygen binding and thus deciding the final product. The resulting catalyst is the first example of a Co&#8208;based molecular catalyst catalyzing a direct 4e&#8211; ORR via ligand isomerization, for which it shows an activity close to the benchmark Pt in an actual H2&#8211;O2 fuel cell. The effect of the ligand isomerism is demonstrated with different central metal ions, thus highlighting the generalizability of the findings and their potential to open new possibilities in the design of molecular catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinase Inhibition via Small Molecule&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Protein Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Remarkable progress has been made in the development of cysteine&#8208;targeted covalent inhibitors. In kinase drug discovery, covalent inhibitors capable of targeting other nucleophilic residues (i.e. lysine, or K) has emerged in recent years. Besides a highly conserved catalytic lysine, almost all human protein kinases possess an equally conserved glutamate/aspartate (e.g. E/D) that forms a K&#8208;E/D salt bridge within the enzyme active&#8208;site. Electrophilic ynamides were previously used as effective peptide coupling reagents and to develop E/D&#8208;targeting covalent protein inhibitors/probes. In the present study, we report the first ynamide&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule inhibitors capable of inducing intramolecular cross&#8208;linking of various protein kinases, leading to subsequent irreversible inhibition of kinase activity. Our strategy took advantage of the close distance between the highly conserved catalytic K and E/D residues in a targeted kinase, thus providing a conceptually general approach to achieve irreversible kinase inhibition with high specificity and desirable cellular potency. Finally, this ynamide&#8208;facilitated, ligand&#8208;induced mechanism leading to intramolecular kinase cross&#8208;linking and inhibition was unequivocally established by using recombinant ABL kinase as a representative.</dc:description>

Thus, simple non&#8208;prefunctionalized arenes could be alkylated through the formation of aryldibenzothiophenium salts.

         <dc:description>In the presence of 1 mol% of a chiral iron porphyrin catalyst, various 3&#8208;arylmethyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;quinolones and 2&#8208;pyridones underwent an enantioselective amination reaction (20 examples; 93&#8208;99% ee). The substrates were used as the limiting reagents, and fluorinated aryl azides (1.5 equiv.) served as nitrene precursors. The reaction is triggered by visible light which allows a facile dediazotation at ambient temperature. The selectivity of the reaction is governed by a two&#8208;point hydrogen bond interaction between the ligand of the iron catalyst and the substrate. Hydrogen bonding directs the amination to a specific hydrogen atom within the substrate that is displaced by the nitrogen substituent either in a concerted fashion or by a rebound mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stable Chichibabin Diradicaloid with Near&#8208;Infrared Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated molecules with multiple radical centers such as the iconic Chichibabin diradicaloid hold promise as building blocks in materials for quantum sensing and quantum information processing. However, it is a considerable challenge to design simple analogues of the Chichibabin hydrocarbon that are chemically inert, exhibit high diradical character and emit light at a distinct wavelength that may offer an optical readout of the spin state in functional ensembles. Here we describe the serendipitous discovery of the stable TTM&#8208;TTM diradicaloid, which exhibits high diradical character, a striking sky&#8208;blue color and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission (in solution). This combination of properties is unique among related diradicaloids and is due to the presence of hydrogen and chlorine atoms in &#8220;just the right positions&#8221;, allowing a perfectly planar, yet predominantly benzenoid bridge to connect the two sterically stabilized radical centers. In&#8208;depth studies of the optical and magnetic properties suggest that this structural motif could become a mainstay building block of organic spin materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Mediated Photochemical C&#8722;H Arylation of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precious metal complexes remain ubiquitous in photoredox catalysis (PRC) despite concerted efforts to find more earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and replacements based on 3d metals in particular. Most otherwise plausible 3d metal complexes are assumed to be unsuitable due to short&#8208;lived excited states, which has led researchers to prioritize the pursuit of longer excited&#8208;state lifetimes through careful molecular design. However, we report herein that the C&#8722;H arylation of pyrroles and related substrates (which are benchmark reactions for assessing the efficacy of photoredox catalysts) can be achieved using a simple and readily accessible octahedral bis(diiminopyridine) cobalt complex, [1&#8209;Co](PF6)2. Notably, [1&#8209;Co]2+ efficiently functionalizes both chloro&#8208; and bromoarene substrates despite the short excited&#8208;state lifetime of the key photoexcited intermediate *[1&#8209;Co]2+ (8&#160;ps). We present herein the scope of this C&#8722;H arylation protocol and provide mechanistic insights derived from detailed spectroscopic and computational studies. These indicate that, despite its transient existence, reduction of *[1&#8209;Co]2+ is facilitated via pre&#8208;assembly with the NEt3 reductant, highlighting an alternative strategy for the future development of 3d metal&#8208;catalyzed PRC.</dc:description>

         <title>Patterned Photonic Actuators with Dynamic Shape&#8208;Morphing and Color&#8208;Changing Capabilities Fabricated by Athermal Embossing Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive patterned photonic actuators, characterized by their patterned nano/microscale structures and capacity to demonstrate synergistic color changes and shape morphing in response to external stimuli, have attracted intense scientific attention. However, traditional patterned photonic actuator systems still face limitations such as cumbersome and time&#8208;consuming preparation processes and small&#8208;scale deformations. Herein, we introduce a facile approach involving an athermal embossing technique to rapidly fabricate patterned photonic actuators based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers. The resulting patterned photonic actuators demonstrate remarkable features, including brilliant angle&#8208;dependent structural color, complex three&#8208;dimensional actuation, and good color durability under NIR light stimulation. As illustrative demonstrations of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we fabricate two light&#8208;fuelled patterned photonic soft actuators: a butterfly&#8208;inspired actuator that can produce wing&#8208;flapping dynamic changes in structural color, and an origami crane&#8208;shaped actuator with shape memory, structural color information storage, and dynamic display properties. This strategy provides distinct insights into the design and fabrication of various patterned photonic soft robotic devices and intelligent actuators.</dc:description>

         <title>NETosis&#8208;Inspired Cell Surface&#8208;Constrained Framework Nucleic Acids Traps (FNATs) for Cascaded Extracellular Recognition and Cellular Behavior Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upon pathogenic stimulation, activated neutrophils release nuclear DNA into the extracellular environment, forming web&#8208;like DNA structures known as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which capture and kill bacteria, fungi, and cancer cells. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as NETosis. Inspired by this, we introduce a cell surface&#8208;constrained web&#8208;like framework nucleic acids traps (FNATs) with programmable extracellular recognition capability and cellular behavior modulation. This approach facilitates dynamic key chemical signaling molecule recognition such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is elevated in the extracellular microenvironment, and triggers FNA self&#8208;assembly. This, in turn, leads to in situ tightly interwoven FNAs formation on the cell surface, thereby inhibiting target cell migration. Furthermore, it activates a photosensitizer&#8208;capturing switch, chlorin e6 (Ce6), and induces cell self&#8208;destruction. This cascade platform provides new potential tools for visualizing dynamic extracellular activities and manipulating cellular behaviors using programmable in situ self&#8208;assembling DNA molecular devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Vibration&#8208;Dependent Dual&#8208;Phosphorescent Cu4 Nanocluster with Remarkable Piezochromic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dual emission (DE) characteristics of atomically precise copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) are of significant theoretical and practical interest. Despite this, the underlying mechanism driving DE in Cu NCs remains elusive, primarily due to the complexities of excited state processes. Herein, a novel [Cu4(PPh3)4(C&#8801;C&#8208;p&#8208;NH2C6H4)3]PF6 (Cu4) NC, shielded by alkynyl and exhibiting DE, was synthesized. Hydrostatic pressure was applied to Cu4, for the first time, to investigate the mechanism of DE. With increasing pressure, the higher&#8208;energy emission peak of Cu4 gradually disappeared, leaving the lower&#8208;energy emission peak as the dominant emission. Additionally, the Cu4 crystal exhibited notable piezochromism transitioning from cyan to orange. Angle&#8208;dispersive synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction results revealed that the reduced inter&#8208;cluster distances under pressure brought the peripheral ligands closer, leading to the formation of new C&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N and N&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bonds in Cu4. It is proposed that these strengthened hydrogen bond interactions limit the ligands&#180; vibration, resulting in the vanishing of the higher&#8208;energy peak. In situ high&#8208;pressure Raman and vibrationally resolved emission spectra demonstrated that the benzene ring C=C stretching vibration is the structural source of the DE in Cu4.</dc:description>

         <title>Innovative Approach to Chiral Polyurethanes: Asymmetric Copolymerization with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups to chiral polymer backbones enables the tailoring of physical properties and offers opportunities for further post&#8208;polymerization modification. However, the substrate scope of such polymers is extremely limited because monomers having nitrogen&#8208;containing groups can change coordination state with respect to the metal centers, thus decreasing the activity and enantioselectivity and even poisoning the catalyst completely. In this paper, we report our attempts to carry out the asymmetric copolymerization of meso&#8208;epoxide with highly reactive isocyanates. In particular, we found that biphenol&#8208;linked bimetallic Co(III) complexes with multiple chiral centers are very efficient in catalyzing this asymmetric copolymerization reaction, affording optically active polyurethanes with a completely alternating nature and a high enantioselectivity of up to 94% ee. Crucially, we identified that the steric hindrance at the phenolate ortho position of the ligand strongly influences the catalytic activity and product enantioselectivity. In addition, density functional theory calculations revealed that the highly sterically bulky substituents change the mechanism from bimetallic to monometallic, and result in the unexpected inversion of the chiral induction direction. Moreover, the high stereoregularity of the produced polyurethanes enhances their thermal stability. This study offers a versatile methodology for the synthesis of chiral polymers containing nitrogen functionalities.</dc:description>

Crucially, we identified that the steric hindrance at the phenolate ortho position of the ligand strongly influences the catalytic activity and product enantioselectivity. In addition, density functional theory calculations revealed that the highly sterically bulky substituents change the mechanism from bimetallic to monometallic, and result in the unexpected inversion of the chiral induction direction. Moreover, the high stereoregularity of the produced polyurethanes enhances their thermal stability. This study offers a versatile methodology for the synthesis of chiral polymers containing nitrogen functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Trisulfides from S&#8208;Substituted Sulphenylthiosulphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trisulfide unit is widely found in natural products and has garnered attention due to the unique pharmacological and physiochemical properties. However, despite limited progress, widely applicable approaches for constructing unsymmetrical trisulfides have so far remain scarce. In this work, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare, solid&#8208;state and scalable reagent, S&#8208;substituted sulphenylthiosulphate, has been developed for the divergent synthesis of unsymmetrical trisulfides. Alkyl electrophile substrates, including bromides, chlorides, iodides and tosylates, with diverse substituents are smoothly converted to the corresponding trisulfides with S&#8208;substituted sulphenylthiosulphates and thiourea as another sulfur source. Furthermore, the late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules was successfully achieved through this method.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Redox&#8208;Neutral [3 + 2] Photocycloadditions of Cyclopropyl Ketones with Vinylazaarenes Enabled by Consecutive Photoinduced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPET) is a powerful and atom&#8208;economical protocol to overcome the limitations of the intrinsic redox potential of visible light&#8208;absorbing photosensitizers, thereby considerably improving the substrate and reaction types. Likely because such an exothermic single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process usually does not require the aid of chiral catalysts, resulting in an inevitable racemic background reaction, notably, no enantioselective manifolds have been reported. Herein, we report on the viability of cooperative ConPET and chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis for the [3 + 2] photocycloaddition of cyclopropyl ketones with vinylazaarenes. In addition to enabling the first use of olefins that preferentially interact with chiral catalysts, this catalysis platform paves the way for the efficient synthesis of pharmaceutically and synthetically important cyclopentyl ketones functionalized by azaarenes with high yields, ees and dr. The robust capacity of the method can be further highlighted by the low loading of the chiral catalyst (1.0 mol%), the good compatibility of both 2&#8208;azaarene and 3&#8208;pyridine&#8208;based olefins, and the successful concurrent construction of three stereocenters on cyclpentane rings involving an elusive but important all&#8208;carbon quaternary.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycol Monomethyl Ether&#8208;Substituted Carbazolyl Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency of 25.52%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic self&#8208;assembled molecules (OSAMs) based hole transporting materials play a pivotal role in achieving highly efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). However, the reported carbazol&#8208;based OSAMs have serious drawbacks, such as poor solubility in alcohol solution, worse matched energy arrangement with perovskite, and limited molecular species, which greatly limit the device performance. To address above problems, a novel OSAM 4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;glycol monomethyl ether&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) butyl]phosphonic acid (GM&#8208;4PACz) was synthesized as hole&#8208;transporting material by introducing glycol monomethyl ether (GM) side chains at carbazolyl unit. GM groups enhance the surface energy of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)/SAM substrate to facilitate the nucleation and growth of up perovskite film, suppress cation defects, release the residual stress at SAM/perovskite interface, and evaluate energy level for matching with perovskite. Consequently, the GM&#8208;4PACz based IPSC achieves a champion PCE of 25.52%, a respectable open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.21 V, a high stability, possessing 93.29% and 91.75% of their initial efficiency after aging in air for 2000 h or tracking at maximum power point for 1000 h, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Fields in Heterostructured Lamellar Membranes Enable Highly Efficient Rejection of Charged Mass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation membranes with homogeneous charge channels are the mainstream to reject charged mass by forming electrical double layer (EDL). However, the EDL often compresses effective solvent transport space and weakens channel&#8208;ion interaction. Here, built&#8208;in electric fields (BIEFs) are constructed in lamellar membranes by assembling the heterostructured nanosheets, which contain alternate positively&#8208;charged nanodomains and negatively&#8208;charged nanodomains. We demonstrate that the BIEFs are perpendicular to horizontal channel and the direction switches alternately, significantly weakening the EDL effect and forces ions to repeatedly collide with channel walls. Thus, highly efficient rejection for charged mass (salts, dyes, and organic acids/bases) and ultrafast water transport are achieved. Moreover, for desalination on four&#8208;stage filtration option, salt rejection reaches 99.9% and water permeance reaches 19.2 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 bar&#8208;1. Such mass transport behavior is quite different from that in homogeneous charge channels. Furthermore, the ion transport behavior in nanochannels is elucidated by validating horizontal projectile motion model.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Timely detection of early&#8208;stage cancer holds immense potential in enhancing prognostic outcomes. There is an increasing desire for versatile tools to enable simple, sensitive, and cost&#8208;effective cancer detection. By exploiting the extraintestinal metabolic inertness and efficiency renal clearance of sucrose, we designed a liposome nanosensor using sucrose as a messenger to convert tumor&#8208;specific esterase activity into glucose meter readout, enabling economical and sensitive uri&#8208;nalysis for cancer detection in point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT). Our results demonstrate that the nanosensors exhibited sig&#8208;nificant signal differences between tumor&#8208;bearing and healthy mice in both orthotopic and metastatic tumor models. Ad&#8208;ditionally, efficient elimination of the nanosensors through the hepatobiliary pathway was observed with no significant toxicity. Such a non&#8208;invasive diagnostic modality significantly assists in personalized pharmacological treatment and fol&#8208;low&#8208;up efficacy assessment. We envision that this modular liposome nanosensor platform might be applied for economi&#8208;cally detecting diverse diseases via a simple urinary test.</dc:description>

         <title>Autophagy&#8208;Inducing MoO3&#8208;x Nanowires Boost Photothermal&#8208;Triggered Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Autophagy could play suppressing role in cancer therapy by facilitating release of tumor antigens from dying cells and inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD). Therefore, discovery and rational design of more effective inducers of cytotoxic autophagy is expected to develop new strategies for finding innovative drugs for precise and successful cancer treatment. Herein, we develop MoO3&#8208;x nanowires (MoO3&#8208;x NWs) with high oxygen vacancy and strong photothermal responsivity to ablate tumors through hyperthermia, thus promote the induction of cytotoxic autophagy and severe ICD. As expected, the combination of MoO3&#8208;x NWs and photothermal therapy (PTT) effectively induces autophagy to promote the release of tumor antigens from the ablated cells, and induces the maturation and antigen presentation of dendritic cells (DCs), subsequently activates cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)&#8208;mediated adaptive immunity. Furthermore, the combination treatment of MoO3&#8208;x NWs with immune checkpoint blockade of PD&#8208;1 could promote the tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization into tumor&#8208;killing M1 macrophages, inhibit infiltration of Treg cells at tumor sites, and alleviate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, finally intensify the anti&#8208;tumor activity in vivo. This study provides a strategy and preliminary elucidation of the mechanism of using MoO3&#8208;x nanowires with high oxygen vacancy to induce autophagy and thus enhance photothermal immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Driven Efficient Conversion of CO2 and H2O into Pure Syngas with Controllable Wide H2/CO Ratios over Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Featuring In Situ&#160;Evolved Ligand Defects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the mild production of syngas (a mixture of H2 and CO) from CO2 and H2O is a promising alternative to the coal&#8208;based chemical engineering technologies, the inert nature of CO2 molecules, unfavorable splitting pathways of H2O and unsatisfactory catalysts lead to the challenge in the difficult integration of high CO2 conversion efficiency with produced syngas with controllable H2/CO ratios in a wide range. Herein, we report an efficient plasma&#8208;driven catalytic system for mild production of pure syngas over porous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) catalysts with rich confined H2O molecules, where their syngas production capacity is regulated by the in situ evolved ligand defects and the plasma&#8208;activated intermediate species of CO2 molecules. Specially, the Cu&#8208;based catalyst system achieves 61.9 % of CO2 conversion and the production of pure syngas with wide H2/CO ratios of 0.05:1&#8208;4.3:1. As revealed by the experimental and theoretical calculation results, the in situ dynamic structure evolution of Cu&#8208;containing MOF catalysts favors the generation of coordinatively unsaturated metal active sites with optimized geometric and electronic characteristics, the adsorption of reactants, and the reduced energy barriers of syngas&#8208;production potential&#8208;determining steps of the hydrogenation of CO2 to *COOH and the protonation of H2O to *H.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanical&#8208;Force&#8208;Induced Non&#8208;spontaneous Dehalogenative Deuteration of Aromatic Iodides Enabled by Using Piezoelectric Materials as a Redox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of green and efficient deuteration methods is of great significance for various fields such as organic synthesis, analytical chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we have developed a dehalogenative deuteration strategy using piezoelectric materials as catalysts in a solid&#8208;phase system under ball&#8208;milling conditions. This non&#8208;spontaneous reaction is induced by mechanical force. D2O can serve as both a deuterium source and an electron donor in the transformation, eliminating the need for additional stoichiometric exogenous reductants. A series of (hetero)aryl iodides can be transformed into deuterated products with high deuterium incorporation. This method not only effectively overcomes existing synthetic challenges but can also be used for deuterium labelling of drug molecules and derivatives. Bioactivity experiments with deuterated drug molecule suggest that the D&#8208;ipriflavone enhances the inhibitory effects on osteoclast differentiation of BMDMs in vitro.</dc:description>

         <title>Purely Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Molecule for High&#8208;Performance Non&#8208;Doped Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purely organic molecules with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are potential luminescent materials with high exciton utilization for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), but those exhibiting superb electroluminescence (EL) performances are rarely explored, mainly due to their long phosphorescence lifetimes. Herein, a robust purely organic RTP molecule, 3,6&#8208;bis(5&#8208;phenylindolo[3,2&#8208;a]carbazol&#8208;12(5H)&#8208;yl)&#8208;xanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT), is developed. The neat film of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT shows strong green RTP with a very short lifetime (2.9 &#956;s) and a high photoluminescence quantum yield (72%), and behaviors balanced bipolar charge transport. The RTP nature of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT is validated by steady&#8208;state and transient absorption and emission spectroscopies, and the working mechanism is deciphered by theoretical simulation. Non&#8208;doped multilayer OLEDs using thin neat films of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT furnish an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.91% with an extremely low roll&#8208;off (1.6%) at 1000 cd m&#8210;2. High&#8208;performance non&#8208;doped top&#8208;emitting and tandem OLEDs are also achieved, providing remarkable EQEs of 24.53% and 42.50%, respectively. Delightfully, non&#8208;doped simplified OLEDs employing thick neat films of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT are also realized, furnishing an excellent EQE of 17.79% and greatly enhanced operational lifetime. The temperature&#8208;dependent and transient EL spectroscopies demonstrate the electrophosphorescence attribute of 3,2&#8208;PIC&#8208;XT. These non&#8208;doped OLEDs are the best devices based on purely organic RTP materials reported so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Interphase Engineering via Solvent Molecule Chemistry for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated ethers are synthesized with weak&#8208;solvation ability owing to the duple steric effect derived from the designed longer carbon chain and methine group. The electrolyte solvation structure rich in AGGs (97.96&#8201;%) renders modified interphase and remarkable CE of 99.71&#8201;% as well as high CE of 98.56&#8201;% even at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. It also renders stable performance of pouch Li&#8208;S battery.







Abstract
Lithium metal battery has been regarded as promising next&#8208;generation battery system aiming for higher energy density. However, the lithium metal anode suffers severe side&#8208;reaction and dendrite issues. Its electrochemical performance is significantly dependant on the electrolyte components and solvation structure. Herein, a series of fluorinated ethers are synthesized with weak&#8208;solvation ability owing to the duple steric effect derived from the designed longer carbon chain and methine group. The electrolyte solvation structure rich in AGGs (97.96&#8201;%) enables remarkable CE of 99.71&#8201;% (25&#8201;&#176;C) as well as high CE of 98.56&#8201;% even at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the lithium&#8208;sulfur battery exhibits excellent performance in a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 50&#8201;&#176;C) ascribed to the modified interphase rich in LiF/LiO2. Furthermore, the pouch cell delivers superior energy density of 344.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and maintains 80&#8201;% capacity retention after 50&#8197;cycles. The novel solvent design via molecule chemistry provides alternative strategy to adjust solvation structure and thus favors high&#8208;energy density lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Steering sp&#8208;Carbon Content in Graphdiynes for Enhanced Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic 2eORR activity of the graphdiyne catalyst toward H2O2 production is successfully adjusted by steering the sp&#8208;carbon content in graphdiyne from 20&#8197;at&#8201;% to 50&#8197;at&#8201;%.







Abstract
Compared to sp2&#8208;hybridized graphene, graphdiynes (GDYs) composed of sp and sp2 carbon are highly promising as efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction into oxygen peroxide because of the high catalytic reactivity of the electron&#8208;rich sp&#8208;carbon atoms. The desired catalytic capacity of GDY, such as catalytic selectivity and efficiency, can theoretically be achieved by strategically steering the sp&#8208;carbon contents or the topological arrangement of the acetylenic linkages and aromatic bonds. Herein, we successfully tuned the electrocatalytic activity of GDYs by regulating the sp&#8208;to&#8208;sp2 carbon ratios with different organic monomer precursors. As the active sp&#8208;carbon atoms possess electron&#8208;sufficient &#960; orbitals, they can donate electrons to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) orbitals of O2 molecules and initiate subsequent O2 reduction, GDY with the high sp&#8208;carbon content of 50&#8197;at&#8201;% exhibits excellent capability of catalyzing O2 reduction into H2O2. It demonstrates exceptional H2O2 selectivity of over 95.0&#8201;% and impressive performance in practical H2O2 production, Faraday efficiency (FE) exceeding 99.0&#8201;%, and a yield of 83.3&#8197;nmol&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our work holds significant importance in effectively steering the inherent properties of GDYs by purposefully adjusting the sp&#8208;to&#8208;sp2 carbon ratio and highlights their immense potential for research and applications in catalysis and other fields.

         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;immunomodulator consisting of glutathione activable resiquimod and &#960;&#8208;extended NIR&#8208;absorbing system is engineered for spatiotemporally controlled photothermal immunotherapy. The synergistic immunity and photothermal effect lead to complete tumor ablation against both primary and distal tumors, presenting a generic strategy for engineering nano&#8208;immunomodulator to achieve a precise regulation of photothermal immunotherapy.







Abstract
A nano&#8208;immunomodulator (R&#8208;NPT NP) comprising a tumor microenvironment (TME) activable resiquimod (R848) and a &#960;&#8208;extended NIR&#8208;absorbing naphthophenanthrolinetetraone (NPT) has been engineered for spatiotemporal controlled photothermal immunotherapy. R&#8208;NPT NP demonstrated excellent photostability, while R848 promoted synergistic immunity as a toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist. Upon accumulation at the tumor site, R&#8208;NPT NP released R848 in response to redox metabolite glutathione (GSH), triggering dendritic cell (DC) activation. The photothermal effect endowed by R&#8208;NPT NP can ablate tumors directly and trigger immunogenic cell death to augment immunity after photoirradiation. The synergistic effect of GSH&#8208;liable TLR7/8 agonist and released immunogenic factors leads to a robust evocation of systematic immunity through promoted DC maturation and T cell infiltration. Thus, R&#8208;NPT NP with photoirradiation achieved 99.3&#8201;% and 98.2&#8201;% growth inhibition against primary and distal tumors, respectively.

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Active Site Structure on the Conversion of Methane to Methanol in Cu&#8208;Exchanged Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We modify activation conditions to stabilize different Cu&#8208;oxo and Cu&#8208;hydroxyl dimers in the zeolite SSZ&#8208;13. Subsequently we combine theory and experiment to investigate how the Cu site structure impacts the conversion of methane to methanol. Our results indicate that site stoichiometry controls methanol production in a stepwise conversion process.







Abstract
In the past, Cu&#8208;oxo or &#8208;hydroxy clusters hosted in zeolites have been suggested to enable the selective conversion of methane to methanol, but the impact of the active site's stoichiometry and structure on methanol production is still poorly understood. Herein, we apply theoretical modeling in conjunction with experiments to study the impact of these two factors on partial methane oxidation in the Cu&#8208;exchanged zeolite SSZ&#8208;13. Phase diagrams developed from first&#8208;principles suggest that Cu&#8208;hydroxy or Cu&#8208;oxo dimers are stabilized when O2 or N2O are used to activate the catalyst, respectively. We confirm these predictions experimentally and determine that in a stepwise conversion process, Cu&#8208;oxo dimers can convert twice as much methane to methanol compared to Cu&#8208;hydroxyl dimers. Our theoretical models rationalize how Cu&#8208;di&#8208;oxo dimers can convert up to two methane molecules to methanol, while Cu&#8208;di&#8208;hydroxyl dimers can convert only one methane molecule to methanol per catalytic cycle. These findings imply that in Cu clusters, at least one oxo group or two hydroxyl groups are needed to convert one methane molecule to methanol per cycle. This simple structure&#8211;activity relationship allows to intuitively understand the potential of small oxygenated or hydroxylated transition metal clusters to convert methane to methanol.

         <title>Neighbouring Synergy in High&#8208;Density Single Ir Atoms on CoGaOOH for Efficient Alkaline Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts was strictly limited by isolated single&#8208;atom sites. Fabricating high&#8208;density single atoms to realize the synergetic interaction in neighbouring single atoms exhibited great potential to break performance limitations. Herein, we revealed that the synergetic interaction in neighbouring Ir single atoms contributes to enhanced performance for oxygen evolution relative to isolated Ir single atoms.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts was strictly limited by isolated single&#8208;atom sites. Fabricating high&#8208;density single atoms to realize the synergetic interaction in neighbouring single atoms could optimize the adsorption behaviors of reaction intermediates, which exhibited great potential to break performance limitations and deepen mechanistic understanding of electrocatalysis. However, the catalytic behavior governed by neighbouring single atoms is particularly elusive and has yet to be understood. Herein, we revealed that the synergetic interaction in neighbouring single atoms contributes to superior performance for oxygen evolution relative to isolated Ir single atoms. Neighbouring single atoms was achieved by fabricating high&#8208;density single atoms to narrow the distance between single atoms. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the Nei&#8208;Ir1/CoGaOOH with neighbouring Ir single atoms exhibited a low overpotential of 170&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and long&#8208;durable stability over 2000&#8197;h for oxygen evolution. Mechanistic studies revealed that neighbouring single atoms synergetic stabilized the *OOH intermediates via extra hydrogen bonding interactions, thus significantly reducing the reaction energy barriers, as compared to isolated Ir single atoms. The discovery of the synergetic interaction in neighbouring single atoms could offer guidance for the development of efficient electrocatalysts, thus accelerating the world&#8216;s transition to sustainable energy.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of novel triene&#8208;yne systems, interesting azuleno[b]thiophenes and azuleno[c]thiophenes were synthesized and characterized. UV/Vis spectra, CVs and DFT calculations were performed.







Abstract
We report the direct synthesis of new azulene derivatives through gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reactions. A five&#8208;membered ring as backbone in the applied triene&#8208;yne substrates turned out to be crucial to induce the 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization mode necessary to trigger azulene formation. The obtained targets are of high interest due to their potential applications in different fields, like organic materials, medicine or cosmetics. UV/Vis spectra and cyclic voltammetry were measured, based on these the electronic properties were determined. Short two or three step sequences towards the applied starting materials make this approach synthetically highly attractive.

         <title>Universal crRNA Acylation Strategy for Robust Photo&#8208;Initiated One&#8208;Pot CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a Nucleic Acid Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal and accessible acylation strategy for fabricating cloaked crRNA to realize photo&#8208;initiated one&#8208;pot CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a assays regardless of the crRNA sequences has been developed. This innovative acylation strategy can bring great advantages and convenience in photo&#8208;controlled CRISPR technologies, highlighting their potential in genomic editing, disease therapy, and cell imaging.







Abstract
Spatiotemporal regulation of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is attractive for precise gene editing and accurate molecular diagnosis. Although many efforts have been made, versatile and efficient strategies to control CRISPR system are still desirable. Here, we proposed a universal and accessible acylation strategy to regulate the CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a system by efficient acylation of 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyls (2&#8242;&#8208;OH) on crRNA strand with photolabile agents (PLGs). The introduction of PLGs confers efficient suppression of crRNA function and rapid restoration of CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a reaction upon short light exposure regardless of crRNA sequences. Based on this strategy, we constructed a universal PhotO&#8208;Initiated CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a system for Robust One&#8208;pot Testing (POIROT) platform integrated with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), which showed two orders of magnitude more sensitive than the conventional one&#8208;step assay and comparable to the two&#8208;step assay. For clinical sample testing, POIROT achieved high&#8208;efficiency detection performance comparable to the gold&#8208;standard quantitative PCR (qPCR) in sensitivity and specificity, but faster than the qPCR method. Overall, we believe the proposed strategy will promote the development of many other universal photo&#8208;controlled CRISPR technologies for one&#8208;pot assay, and even expand applications in the fields of controllable CRISPR&#8208;based genomic editing, disease therapy, and cell imaging.

Based on this strategy, we constructed a universal PhotO-Initiated CRISPR&#8211;Cas12a system for Robust One-pot Testing (POIROT) platform integrated with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), which showed two orders of magnitude more sensitive than the conventional one-step assay and comparable to the two-step assay. For clinical sample testing, POIROT achieved high-efficiency detection performance comparable to the gold-standard quantitative PCR (qPCR) in sensitivity and specificity, but faster than the qPCR method. Overall, we believe the proposed strategy will promote the development of many other universal photo-controlled CRISPR technologies for one-pot assay, and even expand applications in the fields of controllable CRISPR-based genomic editing, disease therapy, and cell imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanogels with Metal&#8208;Organic Cages as Functional Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;organic cages with acrylamide side chains were incorporated in N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;based nanogels by precipitation polymerization. Due to the presence of cage crosslinks, the resulting nanogels can be used as specific sorbents for chloride ions.







Abstract
A dinuclear metal&#8208;organic cage with four acrylate side chains was prepared by self&#8208;assembly. Precipitation polymerization of the cage with N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide yielded a thermoresponsive nanogel. The host properties of the cage were retained within the gel matrix, endowing the nanogel with the capability to serve as a sorbent for chloride ions in water. Moreover, a heteroleptic cage with the drug abiraterone as co&#8208;ligand was integrated into a nanogel. The addition of chloride ions induced a structural rearrangement of the metal&#8208;ligand assembly, resulting in the gradual release of abiraterone.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Triggered J&#8208;Aggregation&#8208;Regulated Therapy Conversion: from Photodynamic/Photothermal Therapy to Long&#8208;Lasting Chemodynamic Therapy for Effective Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;triggered J&#8208;aggregates system is developed for a converting cancer therapy with enhanced therapeutic outcomes. The photodegradation of cyanine leads to the destruction of J&#8208;aggregation, facilitating the conversion from photodynamic/photothermal therapy to long&#8208;lasting chemodynamic therapy. This work presents a safe and effective strategy for prolonging the therapeutic efficacy of ROS&#8208;based therapy.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have become an effective tool for tumor treatment. The combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) takes advantage of various ROS and enhances therapeutic effects. However, the activation of CDT usually occurs before PDT, which hinders the sustained maintenance of hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and reduces the treatment efficiency. Herein, we present a light&#8208;triggered nano&#8208;system based on molecular aggregation regulation for converting cancer therapy from PDT/photothermal therapy (PTT) to a long&#8208;lasting CDT. The ordered J&#8208;aggregation enhances the photodynamic properties of the cyanine moiety while simultaneously suppressing the chemodynamic capabilities of the copper&#8208;porphyrin moiety. Upon light irradiation, Cu&#8208;PCy JNPs demonstrate strong photodynamic and photothermal effects. Meanwhile, light triggers a rapid degradation of the cyanine backbone, leading to the destruction of the J&#8208;aggregation. As a result, a long&#8208;lasting CDT is sequentially activated, and the sustained generation of &#8901;OH is observed for up to 48&#8197;hours, causing potent cellular oxidative stress and apoptosis. Due to their excellent tumor accumulation, Cu&#8208;PCy JNPs exhibit effective in vivo tumor ablation through the converting therapy. This work provides a new approach for effectively prolonging the chemodynamic activity in ROS&#8208;based cancer therapy.

         <title>Benchmarking the Intrinsic Activity of Transition Metal Oxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction with Advanced Nanoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We innovatively adopted an electrodeposition&#8208;annealing method, synthesizing transition metal oxides (TMOs) single&#8208;particle nanoelectrode with well&#8208;defined structure and composition. Not only did we accurately measure their electrocatalytic activity, but we also specially designed a structure with a conductive core wrapped in a semiconductor (SEMI) shell, to support the actual evaluation of perovskite&#8208;type SEMI catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER).







Abstract
The intrinsic activity assessment of transition metal oxides (TMOs) as key electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has not been standardized due to uncertainties regarding their structure and composition, difficulties in accurately measuring their electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), and deficiencies in mass&#8208;transfer (MT) rates in conventional measurements. To address these issues, we utilized an electrodeposition&#8208;thermal annealing method to precisely synthesize single&#8208;particle TMOs with well&#8208;defined structure and composition. Concurrently, we engineered low roughness, spherical surfaces for individual particles, enabling precise measurement of their ECSA. Furthermore, by constructing a conductor&#8208;core semiconductor&#8208;shell structure, we evaluated the inherent OER activity of perovskite&#8208;type semiconductor materials, broadening the scope beyond just conductive TMOs. Finally, using single&#8208;particle nanoelectrode technique, we systematically measured individual TMO particles of various sizes for OER, overcoming MT limitations seen in conventional approaches. These improvements have led us to propose a precise and reliable approach to evaluating the intrinsic activity of TMOs, not only validating the accuracy of theoretical calculations but also revealing a strong correlation of OER activity on the melting point of TMOs. This discovery holds significant importance for future high&#8208;throughput material research and applications, offering valuable insights in electrocatalysis.

         <title>Unlocking Spin Gates of Transition Metal Oxides via Strain Stimuli to Augment Potassium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unlocked birdcage symbolizes the material opening its spin gates, with the liberated bird representing charges. By unlocking the spin gates, the movement of charges becomes smooth and unrestricted, corresponding to the enhanced dynamics and stability of transition metal oxides during energy storage processes.







Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are key in electrochemical energy storage, offering cost&#8208;effectiveness and a broad potential window. However, their full potential is limited by poor understanding of their slow reaction kinetics and stability issues. This study diverges from conventional complex nano&#8208;structuring, concentrating instead on spin&#8208;related charge transfer and orbital interactions to enhance the reaction dynamics and stability of TMOs during energy storage processes. We successfully reconfigured the orbital degeneracy and spin&#8208;dependent electronic occupancy by disrupting the symmetry of magnetic cobalt (Co) sites through straightforward strain stimuli. The key to this approach lies in the unfilled Co 3d shell, which serves as a spin&#8208;dependent regulator for carrier transfer and orbital interactions within the reaction. We observed that the opening of these &#8242;spin gates&#8242; occurs during a transition from a symmetric low&#8208;spin state to an asymmetric high&#8208;spin state, resulting in enhanced reaction kinetics and maintained structural stability. Specifically, the spin&#8208;rearranged Al&#8722;Co3O4 exhibited a specific capacitance of 1371&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is 38&#8201;% higher than that of unaltered Co3O4. These results not only shed light on the spin effects in magnetic TMOs but also establish a new paradigm for designing electrochemical energy storage materials with improved efficiency.

Metal poly(heptazine imide) (MPHI), a novel 2D ionic carbon nitride, has been recognized as an emerging photocatalyst with distinctive properties. In this minireview, we first delineate the forefront innovations of MPHI photocatalysts, spanning from synthetic strategies and solving structures to the exploration of novel properties. We place special emphasis on the structural design principles aimed at developing high&#8208;performance MPHI systems toward photocatalytic solar fuel production such as H2 evolution, H2O oxidation, H2O2 production and CO2 reduction.

         <title>Consolidation of the oxidant&#8211;free Au(I)/Au(III) catalysis enabled by the hemilabile ligand strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this minireview we survey the challenges and strategies in gold redox catalysis. Gold's reluctance to oxidative addition reactions due to its high redox potential limits its applicability.&#160;Initial attempts to overcome this problem focused on the use of sacrificial external oxidants in stoichiometric amounts to bring Au(I) compounds to Au(III) reactive species. Recently, innovative approaches focused on employing hemilabile ligands, which are capable of coordinating to Au(I) and stabilizing square&#8208;planar Au(III) intermediates, thus facilitating oxidative addition steps and enabling oxidant&#8211;free catalysis. Notable examples include the use of the (P^N) bidendate MeDalphos ligand to achieve various cross&#8211;coupling reactions&#160;via&#160;oxidative addition Au(I)/Au(III). Importantly, hemilabile ligand&#8211;enabled catalysis allows merging oxidative addition with &#960;&#8211;activation, such as oxy&#8211; and aminoarylation of alkenols and alkenamines using organohalides, expanding gold's versatility in C&#8211;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bond formations and unprecedented cyclizations. Moreover, recent advancements in enantioselective catalysis using chiral hemilabile (P^N) ligands are also surveyed. Strikingly, versatile bidentate (C^N) hemilabile ligands as competitors of MeDalphos have appeared recently, by designing scaffolds where phosphine groups are substituted by N&#8208;heterocyclic or mesoionic carbenes. Overall, these approaches highlight the evolving landscape of gold redox catalysis and its tremendous potential in a broad scope of transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Driven 1,4&#8208;Aryl Migration via Radical Fluoromethylation of N&#8208;allylbenzamides: a Straightforward Access to Functionalized &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical radical Truce Smiles rearrangement of N&#8208;allylbenzamides is documented herein. The selective 1,4&#8208;aryl migration was triggered by the radical fluoromethylation of the alkene providing a direct route to fluoro derivatives of the highly privileged &#946;&#8208;arylethylamine pharmacophore. This practical transformation utilizes readily available starting materials and employs an electrical current to drive the oxidative process under mild reaction conditions. It accommodates a variety of migratory aryl groups with different electronic properties and substitution patterns. Careful selection of the protecting group on the nitrogen atom of the N&#8208;allylbenzamide is crucial to outcompete the undesired 6&#8208;endo cyclization and achieve high level of selectivity towards the 1,4&#8208;aryl migration. DFT calculations support the reaction mechanism and unveil the origin of selectivity between the two competitive pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal and photoinduced radical cascade annulation using aryl isonitriles: An approach to quinoline&#8208;derived benzophosphole oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present a radical cascade addition cyclization sequence to access quinoline&#8208;based benzophosphole oxides from ortho&#8208;alkynylated aromatic phosphine oxides using various aryl isonitriles as radical acceptors and inexpensive tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;hydroperoxide (TBHP) as a terminal oxidant in the presence of a catalytic amount of silver acetate. Alternatively, the same cascade can be realized through a sustainable photochemical approach utilizing 1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as an organic photocatalyst at room temperature. The introduced modular approach shows broad functional group tolerance and offers straightforward access to complex P,N&#8208;containing polyheterocyclic arenes. These novel &#960;&#8208;extended benzophosphole oxides exhibit interesting photophysical and electrochemical properties such as absorption in the visible region, emission and reversible reduction at low potentials, which makes them promising for potential materials science applications. The photophysical properties can further be tuned by addition of external Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Microfluidic Platform for Extravasation Studies Based on DNA Origami &#8211; Cell Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The adhesion of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to the endothelial lumen and their extravasation to surrounding tissues are crucial in the seeding of metastases and remain the most complex events of the metastatic cascade to study. Integrins expressed on CTCs are major regulators of the extravasation process. This knowledge is primarily derived from animal models and biomimetic systems based on artificial endothelial layers, but these methods have ethical or technical limitations. We present a versatile microfluidic device to study cancer cell extravasation that mimics the endothelial barrier by using a porous membrane functionalized with DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) that display nanoscale patterns of adhesion peptides to circulating cancer cells. The device simulates physiological flow conditions and allows direct visualization of cell transmigration through microchannel pores using 3D confocal imaging. Using this system, we studied integrin&#8208;specific adhesion in the absence of other adhesive events. Specifically, we show that the transmigration ability of the metastatic cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 is influenced by the type, distance, and density of adhesion peptides present on the DONs. Furthermore, studies with mixed ligand systems indicate that integrins binding to RGD (arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid) and IDS (isoleucine&#8208;aspartic acid&#8208;serine) did not synergistically enhance the extravasation process of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Entry into &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;Oxepane Scaffolds through a Chalcogen Bonding Catalyzed Strain&#8208;Release C&#8208;Septanosylation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utility of unconventional noncovalent interactions (NCIs) such as chalcogen bonding has lately emerged as a robust platform to access synthetically difficult glycosides stereoselectively. Herein, we disclose the versatility of a phosphonochalcogenide (PCH) catalyst to facilitate access into the challenging, but biologically interesting 7&#8208;membered ring &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;disubstituted oxepane core through an &#945;&#8208;selective strain&#8208;release C&#8208;glycosylation. Methodically, this strategy represents a switch from more common but entropically less desired macrocyclizations to a thermodynamically favored ring&#8208;expansion approach. In light of the general lack of stereoselective methods to access C&#8208;septanosides, a remarkable palette of silyl&#8208;based nucleophiles can be reliably employed in our method. This include a broad variety of useful synthons, such as easily available silyl&#8208;allyl, silyl&#8208;enol ether, silyl&#8208;ketene acetal, vinylogous silyl&#8208;ketene acetal, silyl&#8208;alkyne and silylazide reagents. Mechanistic investigations suggest that a mechanistic shift towards an intramolecular aglycone transposition involving a pentacoordinate silicon intermediate is likely responsible in steering the stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Meta&#8208;Anchoring Strategy in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Remarkable Promotion of Quantum Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregation is a conventional method to enhance the quantum yields (QYs) of pure organic luminophores due to the restriction of intramolecular motions (RIM). However, how to realize RIM in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is still unclear and challenging. In this work, the ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy is first proposed and proved to be an effective and systematic approach to restrict the intramolecular motions of MOFs for the QY improvement. By simply shifting the substituent position in the ligand from para to meta, the QY of the resulting MOF is significantly enhanced by eleven&#8208;fold. The value is even higher than that of ligand aggregates, demonstrating the strong RIM effect of this ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy. The introduction of co&#8208;ligand induces the appearance of visible yellow room temperature phosphorescence with a lifetime of 222 ms due to the QY enhancement and the charge transfer between the donor and accepter units. The present work thus broadens the understanding of the RIM mechanism from a new perspective, develops a novel method to realize RIM and expands the applicable objects from pure organic materials to organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The tert&#8208;butyl group is a common aliphatic motif extensively employed to implement steric congestion and conformational rigidity in organic and organometallic molecules. Because of the combination of a high bond dissociation energy (~ 100 kcal mol&#8208;1) and limited accessibility, in the absence of directing groups, neither radical nor organometallic approaches are effective for the chemical modification of tert&#8208;butyl C&#8722;H bonds. Herein we overcome these limits by employing a highly electrophilic manganese catalyst, [Mn(CF3bpeb)(OTf)2], that operates in the strong hydrogen bond donor solvent nonafluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl alcohol (NFTBA) and catalytically activates hydrogen peroxide to generate a powerful manganese&#8208;oxo species that effectively oxidizes tert&#8208;butyl C&#8722;H bonds. Leveraging on the interplay of steric, electronic, medium and torsional effects, site&#8208;selective and product chemoselective hydroxylation of the tert&#8208;butyl group is accomplished with broad reaction scope, delivering primary alcohols as largely dominant products in preparative yields. Late&#8208;stage hydroxylation at tert&#8208;butyl sites is demonstrated on 6 densely functionalized molecules of pharmaceutical interest. This work uncovers a novel disconnection approach, harnessing tert&#8208;butyl as a potential functional group in strategic synthetic planning for complex molecular architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Revision of a Widespread Marine Sulfonolipid Class Based on Isolation and Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The planar structure of a newly reported group of bacterial sulfur&#8208;containing aminolipids was revised and their absolute configuration determined by a combination of analytical techniques, isolation, degradation experiments, and total synthesis. The revised structures, termed cysteinolides, diverge from previous homotaurine&#8208;based proposals, revealing a composition of a cysteinolic acid containing head group acylated with various (&#945;&#8208;hydroxy)carboxylic acids.







Abstract
The cosmopolitan marine Roseobacter clade is of global biogeochemical importance. Members of this clade produce sulfur&#8208;containing amino lipids (SALs) involved in biofilm formation and marine surface colonization processes. Despite their physiological relevance and abundance, SALs have only been explored through genomic mining approaches and lipidomic studies based on mass spectrometry, which left the relative and absolute structures of SALs unresolved, hindering progress in biochemical and functional investigations. Herein, we report the structural revision of a new group of SALs, which we named cysteinolides, using a combination of analytical techniques, isolation and degradation experiments and total synthetic efforts. Contrary to the previously proposed homotaurine&#8208;based structures, cysteinolides are composed of an N,O&#8208;acylated cysteinolic acid&#8208;containing head group carrying various different (&#945;&#8208;hydroxy)carboxylic acids. We also performed the first validated targeted&#8208;network based analysis, which allowed us to map the distribution and structural diversity of cysteinolides across bacterial lineages. Beyond offering structural insight, our research provides SAL standards and validated analytical data. This information holds significance for forthcoming investigations into bacterial sulfonolipid metabolism and biogeochemical nutrient cycling within marine environments.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A hitherto unknown class of C4&#8208;symmetric Caryl&#8722;C&#946; (C3, C8, C13, C18) axially chiral porphyrins has been synthesized and the application of their iridium (Ir) complexes in catalytic asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization is documented. Cyclotetramerization of enantioenriched axially chiral 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;3&#8208;naphthyl pyrroles under mild acidic conditions affords, after oxidation with 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ), the C4&#8208;symmetric &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;atropenantiomer as an only isolable diastereomer. Both regioisomeric Ir(Por*)(CO)(Cl) complexes catalyze the carbene C&#8722;H insertion reaction affording the same enantiomer, albeit with slight difference in enantioselectivity. With the optimum Ir&#8208;complex 3e, the 2&#8208;substituted arylacetic acid derivatives were generated from diazo compounds and cyclohexadiene in excellent yields and enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Free Radical (R&#8729;) Inactivates NF&#8208;&#954;B for Radical Capping Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inactivating hyperactivated transcription factors can overcome tumor therapy resistance, but their undruggable features limit the development of conventional inhibitors. Here, we report that carbon&#8208;centered free radicals (R&#8729;) can inactivate NF&#8208;&#954;B transcription by capping the active sites in both NF&#8208;&#954;B and DNA. We construct a type of thermosensitive R&#8729; initiator loaded amphiphilic nano&#8208;micelles to facilitate intracellular delivery of R&#8729;. At a temperature of 43&#176;C, the generated R&#8729; engage in electrophilic radical addition towards double bonds in nucleotide bases, and simultaneously cap the sulfhydryl residues in NF&#8208;&#954;B through radical chain reaction. As a result, both NF&#8208;&#954;B nuclear translocation and NF&#8208;&#954;B&#8208;DNA binding are suppressed, leading to a remarkable NF&#8208;&#954;B inhibition of up to 94.1%. We have further applied R&#8729; micelles in a clinical radiofrequency ablation tumor therapy model, showing remarkable NF&#8208;&#954;B inactivation and consequently tumor metastasis inhibition. Radical capping strategy not only provides a method to solve the heat&#8208;sink effect in clinic tumor hyperthermia, but also suggests a new perspective for controllable modification of biomacromolecules in cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>N2 Functionalization via Molybdenum&#8208;Nitride Complex: Stepwise BH Bond Additions.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactivity of (triphosphine)MoIV&#8208;nitrido complex generated by N2 splitting, toward boranes is reported. The simple adduct Mo&#8801;N&#8594;BH3 is observed with BH3.SMe2 while 1,2 addition is evidenced with 9&#8208;BBN leading to H&#8208;Mo=NBR2. A second addition of BH3.SMe2 is facile and forms an unprecedented complex featuring two bridging H between two B and the Mo centers. Addition of PMe3 or BH3.SMe2 promotes reductive elimination and N&#8208;H bond formation. The full sequence of functionalization at Mo&#8801;N obtained after N2 splitting is therefore evidenced in this work.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct ortho&#8208;Arylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and broadly applicable rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct ortho&#8208;arylation of anilines with aryl iodides relying on readily available aminophosphines as traceless directing groups is reported. Its scope and functional group compatibility were both found to be quite broad as a large variety of both aminophosphines and (hetero)aryl iodides, including complex ones, could be utilized. The ortho&#8208;arylated anilines could be obtained in high average yields, without any competing diarylation and with full regioselectivity, which constitutes a major step forward compared to other processes. The reaction is moreover not limited to aryl iodides, as an aryl bromide and a triflate could be successfully used, and could be extended to diarylation. Mechanistic studies revealed the key and unique role of the aminophosphine, acting not only as a substrate but also as a ligand for the rhodium catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust, Efficient, and Recoverable Thermocells with Zwitterion&#8208;Boosted Hydrogel Electrolytes for Energy&#8208;Autonomous and Wearable Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid growth of flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state thermocells (TECs) provides a fresh way forward for wearable electronics. However, their insufficient mechanical strength and power output still hinder their further applications. This work demonstrates a one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds strategy to synergistically enhance the mechanical and thermoelectrochemical properties of the [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/4&#8722;&#8208;based TECs. By introducing multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions via betaine zwitterions, the mechanical strength of the conventional brittle gelatin hydrogel electrolytes is substantially improved from 50 to 440 kPa, with a high stretchability approaching 250%. Meanwhile, the betaine zwitterions strongly affect the solvation structure of [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; ions, thus enlarging the entropy difference and raising the thermoelectrochemical Seebeck coefficient from 1.47 to 2.2 mV K&#8722;1. The resultant quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state TECs exhibit a superior normalized output power density of 0.48 mW m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2, showing a notable improvement in overall performance compared to their counterparts without zwitterion regulation. In addition, the intrinsic thermo&#8208;reversible property allows the TECs to repeatedly self&#8208;recover through sol&#8208;gel transformations, ensuring reliable energy output and even recycling of TECs in case of extreme mechanical damages. An energy&#8208;autonomous smart glove consisting of eighteen individual TECs is further designed, which can simultaneously monitor the temperature of different positions of any touched object, demonstrating high potential in wearable applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Metal(II)&#8208;Sulfate Site Catalysts toward Low Overpotential Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction to Fuel Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise regulation of the active site structure is an important means to enhance the activity and selectivity of catalysts in CO2 electroreduction. Here, we creatively introduce anionic groups, which can not only stabilize metal sites with strong coordination ability but also have rich interactions with protons at active sites to modify the electronic structure and proton transfer process of catalysts. This strategy helps to convert CO2 into fuel chemicals at low overpotentials. As a typical example, a composite catalyst, CuO/Cu&#8208;NSO4/CN, with highly dispersed Cu(II)&#8208;SO4 sites has been reported, in which CO2 electroreduction to formate occurs at a low overpotential with a high Faradaic efficiency (&#8722;0.5 V vs. RHE, FEHCOO&#8722;=87.4%). Pure HCOOH is produced with an energy conversion efficiency of 44.3% at a cell voltage of 2.8 V. Theoretical modeling demonstrates that sulfate promotes CO2 transformation into a carboxyl intermediate followed by HCOOH generation, whose mechanism is significantly different from that of the traditional process via a formate intermediate for HCOOH production.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and Selective Construction of 412 Metalla&#8208;links Using Weak C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Halogen Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, weak C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;halogen interactions together with aromatic stacking interactions are strategically utilized to selectively realize the construction of one unlocked metallacycle and four doubly interlocked metalla&#8208;links.







Abstract
Through a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly method, four 
 metalla&#8208;links and one tetranuclear monocycle were constructed with high selectivity and yield by adjusting the substituent species of the building blocks, as evidenced using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, electrospray ionization&#8208;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight/mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;TOF/MS), elemental analysis and detailed solution&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Based on X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and independent gradient model analysis, a significant factor leading to the formation of 
 metalla&#8208;links was the introduction of F, Cl, Br and I atoms, which generated additional weak C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X (X=F, Cl, Br and I) interactions. Furthermore, the dynamic conversion of 
 metalla&#8208;links to monocyclic rings in methanol solution was systematically investigated using quantitative 1H NMR techniques.

         <title>Metalla&#8208;Carbaporphyrinoids Consisting of an Acyclic N&#8208;Confused Tetrapyrrole Analogue Served as Stable Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Dyes</title>

         <dc:description>
Breaking the tetrapyrrolic &#960;&#8208;skeleton and implementing N&#8208;confusion modification offer a distinctive ligand platform for metalla&#8208;carbaporphyrinoid species. Through d&#8208;&#960; orbital interaction, the resultant open&#8208;ring Pd/Pt complexes demonstrate near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II absorption capability and high photothermal conversion efficiency.







Abstract
We present herein the synthesis of novel pseudo&#8208;metalla&#8208;carbaporphyrinoid species (1M: M=Pd and Pt) achieved through the inner coordination of palladium(II) and platinum(II) with an acyclic N&#8208;confused tetrapyrrin analogue. Despite their tetrapyrrole frameworks being small, akin to well&#8208;known porphyrins, these species exhibit an unusually narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, resulting in an unprecedentedly low&#8208;energy absorption in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed unique d&#960;&#8208;p&#960;&#8208;conjugated electronic structures involving the metal d&#960;&#8208;ligand p&#960; hybridized molecular orbitals of 1M. Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy confirmed distinct electronic structures. Remarkably, the complexes feature an open&#8208;metal coordination site in the peripheral NN dipyrrin site, forming hetero&#8208;metal complexes (1Pd&#8208;BF2 and 1Pt&#8208;BF2) through boron difluoride complexation. The resulting hetero metalla&#8208;carbaporphyrinoid species displayed further redshifted NIR&#8208;II absorption, highly efficient photothermal conversion efficiencies (&#951;; 62&#8211;65&#8201;%), and exceptional photostability. Despite the challenges associated with the theoretical and experimental assessment of d&#960;&#8208;p&#960;&#8208;conjugated metalla&#8208;aromaticity in relatively larger (more than 18&#960; electrons) polycyclic ring systems, these organometallic planar tetrapyrrole systems could serve as potential molecular platforms for aromaticity&#8208;relevant NIR&#8208;II dyes.

         <title>Diversified Synthesis of Chiral Fluorinated Cyclobutane Derivatives Enabled by Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydroboration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first asymmetric hydroboration of cyclobutenes using Rh catalysis is reported, providing gem&#8208;difluorinated &#945;&#8208;boryl cyclobutanes in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Upon in situ B,F&#8208;elimination (Pd is required for R=aryl), monofluorinated cyclobutenes are obtained through formal hydrodefluorination. Versatile downstream transformations make this method a platform for the diversified synthesis of chiral fluorinated cyclobutanes.







Abstract
The diversified synthesis of chiral fluorinated cyclobutane derivatives has remained a difficult task in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present an approach for asymmetric hydroboration and formal hydrodefluorination of gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclobutenes through rhodium catalysis, providing chiral gem&#8208;difluorinated &#945;&#8208;boryl cyclobutanes and monofluorinated cyclobutenes with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, respectively. The key to the success of the two transformations relies on an efficient, mild and highly selective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration with HBPin (pinacolborane), in which the subsequent addition of a base, and a catalytic amount of palladium in some cases, results in the formation of formal hydrodefluorination products with the four&#8208;membered ring retained. The obtained chiral gem&#8208;difluorinated &#945;&#8208;boryl cyclobutanes are versatile building blocks that provide a platform for the synthesis of enantioenriched fluorinated cyclobutane derivatives to a great diversity.

Here we report the mechanisms of two unusual CYP3A&#8208;mediated cleavages of non&#8208;polar, unstrained C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds in the metabolism of tyrosine kinase inhibitor pexidartinib. One bond is cleaved by CYP3A&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;addition of activated oxygen, and the other occurs by a pseudo&#8208;retro&#8208;aldol reaction after hydroxylation of a C(sp3) site.







Abstract
Mammalian cytochrome P450 drug&#8208;metabolizing enzymes rarely cleave carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonds and the mechanisms of such cleavages are largely unknown. We identified two unusual cleavages of non&#8208;polar, unstrained C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds in the FDA&#8208;approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor pexidartinib that are mediated by CYP3A4/5, the major human phase I drug metabolizing enzymes. Using a synthetic ketone, we rule out the Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation mechanism that is commonly invoked to address P450&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C bond cleavages. Our studies in 18O2 and H218O enriched systems reveal two unusual distinct mechanisms of C&#8722;C bond cleavage: one bond is cleaved by CYP3A&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;addition of oxygen to a C(sp2) site of N&#8208;protected pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amines, and the other occurs by a pseudo&#8208;retro&#8208;aldol reaction after hydroxylation of a C(sp3) site. This is the first report of CYP3A&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C bond cleavage in drug metabolism via ipso&#8208;addition of oxygen mediated mechanism. CYP3A&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;addition is also implicated in the regioselective C&#8722;C cleavages of several pexidartinib analogs. The regiospecificity of CYP3A&#8208;catalyzed oxygen ipso&#8208;addition under environmentally friendly conditions may be attractive and inspire biomimetic or P450&#8208;engineering methods to address the challenging task of C&#8722;C bond cleavages.

         <title>Helicene Aromaticity Deviates from the Clar Rule&#8212;On the Electronic Dissimilarity of Large Isomeric Fibonacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long isomeric fibonacenes&#8212;a phenacene, a helicene and a croissant&#8208;shaped isomer&#8212;are found to show strikingly different absorption and emission spectra, despite their equivalent Kekul&#233; structures. Complementary computations based either on magnetic or electronic criteria for aromaticity indicate that in long helicenes, the Clar and Kekul&#233; rules of preferred sextet localization do not hold.







Abstract
This combined experimental and theoretical study illustrates the profound consequences of non&#8208;planarity on the electronic properties of polycyclic arenes. Three isomeric [10]fibonacene tetraesters were synthesized through a robust and regiocontrolled Perkin/Mallory approach: a nearly planar [10]phenacene derivative, a moderately twisted [10]semicircle derivative, and a 3D non&#8208;planar [10]helicene derivative. The photophysical properties of the 3D [10]helicene isomer were found to be dramatically different from the comparable ones of the [10]phenacene and [10]semicircle isomers. The aromatic properties of the [10]phenacene and [10]semicircle isomers conform well with their predictive Kekul&#233; and Clar analyses, but the [10]helicene isomer deviates from these general topological rules, which appears to be a general phenomenon for [n]fibonacenes with n&#8805;9.

         <title>Expanding the Hydrophobic Cavity Surface of Azocalix[4]arene to Enable Biotin/Avidin Affinity with Controlled Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hypoxia&#8208;responsive azocalix[4]arene (Naph&#8208;SAC4A) has been developed that can achieve a biotin/(strept&#8722;)avidin&#8208;level binding affinity (up to 1013&#8197;M&#8722;1 ) through its expanded hydrophobic surface. Naph&#8208;SAC4A demonstrated the sensitive recognition of rocuronium in serum and a hypoxia&#8208;responsive delivery of doxorubicin with minimum leakage at the cellular level.







Abstract
The development of artificial receptors that combine ultrahigh&#8208;affinity binding and controllable release for active guests holds significant importance in biomedical applications. On one hand, a complex with an exceedingly high binding affinity can resist unwanted dissociation induced by dilution effect and complex interferents within physiological environments. On the other hand, stimulus&#8208;responsive release of the guest is essential for precisely activating its function. In this context, we expanded hydrophobic cavity surface of a hypoxia&#8208;responsive azocalix[4]arene, affording Naph&#8208;SAC4A. This modification significantly enhanced its aqueous binding affinity to 1013&#8197;M&#8722;1, akin to the naturally occurring strongest recognition pair, biotin/(strept&#8722;)avidin. Consequently, Naph&#8208;SAC4A emerges as the first artificial receptor to simultaneously integrate ultrahigh recognition affinity and actively controllable release. The markedly enhanced affinity not only improved Naph&#8208;SAC4A&#8242;s sensitivity in detecting rocuronium bromide in serum, but also refined the precision of hypoxia&#8208;responsive doxorubicin delivery at the cellular level, demonstrating its immense potential for diverse practical applications.

         <title>Photoinduced Remote C(sp3)&#8722;H Phosphonylation of Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective phosphonylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bond distal to the amide group was achieved at room temperature under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, photocatalyzed conditions.







Abstract
The present study reports an unprecedented protocol for the phosphonylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. By utilizing 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% 4DPAIPN (1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(diphenylamino)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene) as the catalyst, satisfactory yields of &#947;&#8208;phosphonylated amides are obtained through a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced reaction between N&#8208;((4&#8208;cyanobenzoyl)oxy)alkanamides and 9&#8208;fluorenyl o&#8208;phenylene phosphite at room temperature. This protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope and wide functional group compatibility.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Acetobacter pasteurianus Lipid&#8201;A with a Unique Tetrasaccharide Backbone and Evaluation of Its Immunological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid A contained in fermented foods is expected to be a safe immunostimulant. The first chemical synthesis of fermentative bacteria Acetobacter pasteurianus lipid&#8197;A, an immune component in black rice vinegar, was achieved via borinic acid catalyzed 1,1&#8217;&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;glycosylation. Furthermore, glucuronic acid residue, a unique structure of A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;A, was found to largely contribute to its immunological and acid&#8208;stable properties.







Abstract
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell surface component of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, activates innate immunity. Its active principle is the terminal glycolipid lipid&#8197;A. Acetobacter pasteurianus is a Gram&#8208;negative bacterium used in the fermentation of traditional Japanese black rice vinegar (kurozu). In this study, we focused on A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;A, which is a potential immunostimulatory component of kurozu. The active principle structure of A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;A has not yet been identified. Herein, we first systematically synthesized three types of A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;As containing a common and unique tetrasaccharide backbone. We developed an efficient method for constructing the 2&#8208;trehalosamine skeleton utilizing borinic acid&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation to afford 1,1&#8217;&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;glycoside in high yield and stereoselectivity. A common tetrasaccharide intermediate with an orthogonal protecting group pattern was constructed via [2+2] glycosylation. After introducing various fatty acids, all protecting groups were removed to achieve the first chemical synthesis of three distinct types of A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;As. After evaluating their immunological function using both human and murine cell lines, we identified the active principles of A.&#8197;pasteurianus LPS. We also found the unique anomeric structure of A.&#8197;pasteurianus lipid&#8197;A contributes to its high chemical stability.

We developed an efficient method for constructing the 2-trehalosamine skeleton utilizing borinic acid-catalyzed glycosylation to afford 1,1&#8217;-&#945;,&#945;-glycoside in high yield and stereoselectivity. A common tetrasaccharide intermediate with an orthogonal protecting group pattern was constructed via [2+2] glycosylation. After introducing various fatty acids, all protecting groups were removed to achieve the first chemical synthesis of three distinct types of &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;pasteurianus&lt;/i&gt; lipid&#8197;As. After evaluating their immunological function using both human and murine cell lines, we identified the active principles of &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;pasteurianus&lt;/i&gt; LPS. We also found the unique anomeric structure of &lt;i&gt;A.&#8197;pasteurianus&lt;/i&gt; lipid&#8197;A contributes to its high chemical stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Butadiene Purification in a Sulfonate&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Framework through Synergistic Separation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sulfonate&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework ZU&#8208;609 realizes 1,3&#8208;butadiene purification from complex C4 mixtures via synergistic size&#8208;exclusion and thermodynamic mechanisms, and polymer&#8208;grade C4H6 (99.5&#8201;%) is obtained via a single adsorption&#8208;desorption cycle under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Porous materials that could recognize specific molecules from complex mixtures are of great potential in improving the current energy&#8208;intensive multistep separation processes. However, due to the highly similar structures and properties of the mixtures, the design of desired porous materials remains challenging. Herein, a sulfonate&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework ZU&#8208;609 with suitable pore size and pore chemistry is designed for 1,3&#8208;butadiene (C4H6) purification from complex C4 mixtures. The sulfonate anions decorated in the channel achieve selective recognition of C4H6 from other C4 olefins with subtle polarity differences through C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O&#8722;S interactions, affording recorded C4H6/trans&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 selectivity (4.4). Meanwhile, the shrunken mouth of the channel with a suitable pore size (4.6&#8197;&#197;) exhibits exclusion effect to the larger molecules cis&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8, iso&#8208;C4H8, n&#8208;C4H10 and iso&#8208;C4H10. Benefiting from the moderate C4 olefins binding affinity exhibited by sulfonate anions, the adsorbed C4H6 could be easily regenerated near ambient conditions. Polymer&#8208;grade 1,3&#8208;butadiene (99.5&#8201;%) is firstly obtained from 7&#8208;component C4 mixtures via one adsorption&#8208;desorption cycle. The work demonstrates the great potential of synergistic recognition of size&#8208;sieving and thermodynamically equilibrium in dealing with complex mixtures.

         <title>Bayesian Inference for Model Analyses of Supramolecular Complexes: A Case Study with Nanocarbon Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large bowl&#8208;shaped nanocarbon molecule with 126&#8197;&#960; electrons was synthesized, and a ball&#8208;in&#8208;bowl complex was obtained by capturing C70 at the concave site. A method for elucidating the stoichiometries in solution&#8208;phase equilibria was devised by developing a procedure to estimate the Occam factors for Bayesian inference.







Abstract
A 126&#8197;&#960;&#8208;electron nanobowl molecule, phenine tridehydrosumanene, was synthesized in 12&#8197;steps through the development of a polygon cyclization strategy that assembled the polygonal precursors by Ni&#8208;mediated macrocyclization. The bowl&#8208;shaped structure accommodated C70 as a guest at the concave site, and the ball&#8208;in&#8208;bowl structure was determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The host&#8211;guest equilibrium in solution was studied with titration experiments using isothermal calorimetry, which provided an interesting test case for studying the host&#8211;guest stoichiometry. Bayesian inference was introduced for stoichiometric analyses of the equilibrium, and a procedure to estimate the volume of prior probability in the parameter space was developed. The Bayesian procedure functioned as Occam's razor and provided quantitative support for a specific stoichiometry. The method was examined with five host&#8211;guest examples comprising nanocarbon hosts, which suggested the versatility of Bayesian inference for studies of supramolecular complexes.

         <title>Tandem Catalysts Enabling Efficient C&#8722;N Coupling toward the Electrosynthesis of Urea</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem catalyst of Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co) exhibited excellent activity in the electrosynthesis of urea, in which the two types of active sites independently stabilized the key intermediates of *CONH2 in urea formation via tandem catalysis.







Abstract
The development of a methodology for synthesizing value&#8208;added urea (CO(NH2)2) via a renewable electricity&#8208;driven C&#8722;N coupling reaction under mild conditions is highly anticipated. However, the complex catalytic active sites that act on the carbon and nitrogen species make the reaction mechanism unclear, resulting in a low efficiency of C&#8722;N coupling from the co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;). Herein, we propose a novel tandem catalyst of Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co), in which the Mo sites serve to facilitate nitrate reduction to the *NH2 intermediate, while the Co sites enhance CO2 reduction to carbonic oxide (CO), thus synergistically promoting C&#8722;N coupling. The synthesized Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co) catalyst exhibited a noteworthy urea yield rate of 844.11&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, alongside a corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 33.90&#8201;% at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). By combining in situ spectroscopic techniques with density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that efficient C&#8722;N coupling is attributed to a tandem system in which the *NH2 and *CO intermediates produced by the Mo and Co active sites of Mo&#8208;PCN&#8208;222(Co) stabilize the formation of the *CONH2 intermediate. This study provides an effective avenue for the design and synthesis of tandem catalysts for electrocatalytic urea synthesis.

         <title>Unveiling Low Temperature Assembly of Dense Fe&#8208;N4 Active Sites via Hydrogenation in Advanced Oxygen Reduction Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Innovative low&#8208;temp synthesis of single&#8208;atom Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts prevents Fe nanoparticles sintering, ensuring dense Fe&#8208;N4 site formation, and leads to improved ORR activity and fuel cell efficiency, with potential for diverse high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom materials.&#8221;







Abstract
The single&#8208;atom Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C is a prominent material with exceptional reactivity in areas of sustainable energy and catalysis research. It is challenging to obtain the dense Fe&#8208;N4 site without the Fe nanoparticles (NPs) sintering during the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C synthesis via high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. Thus, a novel approach is devised for the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C synthesis at low temperatures. Taking FeCl2 as Fe source, a hydrogen environment can facilitate oxygen removal and dichlorination processes in the synthesis, efficiently favouring Fe&#8208;N4 site formation without Fe NPs clustering at as low as 360&#8201;&#176;C. We shed light on the reaction mechanism about hydrogen promoting Fe&#8208;N4 formation in the synthesis. By adjusting the temperature and duration, the Fe&#8208;N4 structural evolution and site density can be precisely tuned to directly influence the catalytic behaviour of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C material. The FeNC&#8208;H2&#8208;360 catalyst demonstrates a remarkable Fe dispersion (8.3&#8197;wt&#8201;%) and superior acid ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85&#8197;V and a peak power density of 1.21&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in fuel cell. This method also generally facilitates the synthesis of various high&#8208;performance M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials (M=Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, Zn, Ru) with elevated single&#8208;atom loadings.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Micro&#8208;Architected Copper based on an Ion&#8208;Exchangeable Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and straightforward strategy has been developed to create intricate and dense micro&#8208;architected copper structures using an ion&#8208;exchangeable hydrogel. The resulting copper geometries showcase a minimum feature size of around 40&#8197;&#956;m, coupled with a notable twin density, electrical conductivity, and hardness. This methodology presents an effective pathway for the fabrication of micro&#8208;architected 3D metal structures.







Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) of copper through laser&#8208;based processes poses challenges, primarily attributed to the high thermal conductivity and low laser absorptivity of copper powder or wire as the feedstock. Although the use of copper salts in vat photopolymerization&#8208;based AM techniques has garnered recent attention, achieving micro&#8208;architected copper with high conductivity and density has remained elusive. In this study, we present a facile and efficient process to create complex 3D micro&#8208;architected copper structures with superior electrical conductivity and hardness. The process entails the formulation of an ion&#8208;exchangeable photoresin, followed by the utilization of digital light processing (DLP) printing to sculpt 3D hydrogel scaffolds, which were transformed into Cu2+&#8208;chelated polymer frameworks (Cu&#8208;CPFs) with a high loading of Cu2+ ions through ion exchange, followed by debinding and sintering, results in the transformation of Cu&#8208;CPFs into miniaturized copper architectures. This methodology represents an efficient pathway for the creation of intricate micro&#8208;architected 3D metal structures.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution Polymerization Enabled Chemical Synthesis of Perfectly Isotactic Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isotactic polythioesters (PTEs) that are thioester analogs to natural polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have attracted growing attention due to their distinct properties. However, the development of chemically synthetic methods for preparing isotactic PTEs has long been an intricate endeavour. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of perfectly isotactic PTEs via stereocontrolled ring&#8208;opening polymerization. This binaphthalene&#8208;salen aluminium (SalBinam&#8208;Al) catalyst promoted a robust polymerization of rac&#8208;&#945;&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#946;&#8208;propiothiolactones (rac&#8208;BTL and rac&#8208;PTL) with highly kinetic resolution, affording perfectly isotactic P(BTL) and P(PTL) with Mn up to 276 kDa. Impressively, the isotactic P(BTL) formed a supramolecular stereocomplex with improved thermal property (Tm = 204 &#176;C). Ultimately, this kinetic resolution polymerization enabled the facile isolation of enantiopure (S)&#8208;BTL, which could efficiently convert to an important pharmaceutical building block (S)&#8208;2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercapto&#8208;propanoic acid. Isotactic P(PTL) served as a tough and ductile material comparable to the commercialized polyolefins. This synthetic system allowed to access of isotactic PTEs, establishing a powerful platform for the discovery of sustainable plastics.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosensor Strip for Rapid On&#8208;site Assessment of Levodopa Pharmacokinetics along with Motor Performance in Parkinson&#8217;s Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While levodopa (L&#8208;Dopa) is the primary treatment for alleviating Parkinson's disease (PD), its efficacy is hindered by challenges such as a short half&#8208;life and inconsistent plasma levels. As PD progresses, the rising need for increased and more frequent L&#8208;Dopa doses coupled with symptom fluctuations and dyskinesias underscores the urgency for improved comprehension of the interplay between L&#8208;Dopa levels and PD motor symptoms. Addressing this critical need, we present a decentralized testing method using a disposable biosensor strip and a universal slope (U&#8208;slope) calibration&#8208;free approach. This enables reliable, rapid, simple, and cost&#8208;effective decentralized L&#8208;Dopa measurements from capillary blood. A pilot study with PD persons demonstrates the ability to monitor real&#8208;time L&#8208;Dopa pharmacokinetics from fingerstick blood after oral L&#8208;Dopa&#8208;Carbidopa (C&#8208;Dopa) tablet administration. Correlating capillary blood L&#8208;Dopa levels with PD motor scores revealed a well&#8208;defined inverse correlation with temporal motor fluctuations. We compared the resulting dynamic capillary blood L&#8208;Dopa levels with plasma L&#8208;Dopa levels using the traditional but clinically impractical high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography technique. By providing timely feedback on a proper L&#8208;Dopa dosing regimen in a decentralized and rapid fashion, this new biosensing platform will facilitate tailored optimal L&#8208;Dopa dosing, towards improving symptom management and enhancing health&#8208;related quality of life.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling nano and atomic electric field confinement for robust alkaline oxygen evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a promising avenue for producing clean fuels and storing intermittent energy. However, challenges such as excessive OH&#8211; consumption and strong adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates hinder the development of alkaline OER. In this study, we propose a cooperative strategy by leveraging both nano&#8208;scale and atomically local electric fields for alkaline OER, demonstrated through the synthesis of Mn single atom doped CoP nanoneedles (Mn SA&#8208;CoP NNs). Finite element method simulations and density functional theory calculations predict that the nano&#8208;scale local electric field enriches OH&#8208; around the catalyst surface, while the atomically local electric field improves *O desorption. Experimental validation using in situ attenuated total reflection infrared and Raman spectroscopy confirms the effectiveness of the nano&#8208;scale and atomically electric fields. Mn SA&#8208;CoP NNs exhibit an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 189 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 and stable operation over 100 hours at ~100 mA cm&#8211;2 during alkaline OER. This innovative strategy provides new insights for enhancing catalyst performance in energy conversion reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclic Sulfones via Ligand&#8208;Controlled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic sulfones have demonstrated important applications in drug discovery. However, the catalytic and enantioselective synthesis of chiral cyclic sulfones remains challenging. Herein, we develop nickel&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroalkylation of sulfolenes to streamline the synthesis of chiral alkyl cyclic sulfones. The method has broad scope and high functional group tolerance. The regioselectivity can be controlled by ligands only. A neutral PYROX ligand favors C3&#8208;alkylation whereas an anionic BOX ligand favors C2&#8208;alkylation. This control is kinetic in origin as the C2&#8208;bound Ni intermediates are always thermodynamically more stable. Reactivity study of a wide range of relevant Ni intermediates reveal a NiI/NiIII catalytic cycle with a NiII&#8208;H species as the resting state. The regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;determining step is the insertion of this NiII&#8208;H species into 2&#8208;sulfolene. This work provides an efficient catalytic method for the synthesis of an important class of organic compounds and enhances the mechanistic understanding of Ni&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective hydroalkylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Type I Photoinitiator Based on Sustainable Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sustainable carbon dots comprising surficial oxime ester groups following homolytic bond cleavage exhibit potential as photoinitiators for traditional free radical photopolymerization. Carbon dots were made following a solvothermal procedure from sustainable furfural available from lignocellulose. Surficial aldehyde moieties reacted with hydroxylamine to the respective oxime while reaction with benzoyl chloride resulted in a biobased Type I photoinitiator comprising sustainable carbon dot (CD&#8208;PI). Photoinitiating ability was compared with the traditional photoinitiator (PI) ethyl (2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl benzoyl) phenyl phosphinate (TPO&#8208;L) by real&#8208;time FTIR with UV exposure at 365 nm. Photopolymer composition based on a mixture of urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) and tripropylene glycol diethacrylate (TPGDA) resulted in a similar final conversion of about 70% using either CD&#8208;PI or TPO&#8208;L. Nevertheless, it appeared homogeneous in the case of compositions processed with CD&#8208;PI, while those made with TPO&#8208;L were heterogeneous as shown by two glass transition temperatures. Moreover, the migration rate of CD&#8208;PI in the cured samples was lower in comparison with those samples using TPO&#8208;L as PI.</dc:description>

Photopolymer composition based on a mixture of urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) and tripropylene glycol diethacrylate (TPGDA) resulted in a similar final conversion of about 70% using either CD-PI or TPO-L. Nevertheless, it appeared homogeneous in the case of compositions processed with CD-PI, while those made with TPO-L were heterogeneous as shown by two glass transition temperatures. Moreover, the migration rate of CD-PI in the cured samples was lower in comparison with those samples using TPO-L as PI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Cyclotrimerization: A Versatile Tool to Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Stacking Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce the first mechanochemical cyclotrimerization of nitriles, a facile strategy for synthesizing triazine&#8208;containing molecules and materials, overcoming challenges related to carbonization and solubility. Conducting this solid&#8208;state approach in a mixer ball mill with 4&#8208;Methylbenzonitrile, we synthesize Tris(4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine quantitatively in as little as 90 minutes. Just as fast, this mechanochemical method facilitates the synthesis of the covalent triazine framework CTF&#8208;1 using 1,4 Dicyanobenzene. Material characterization confirms its porous (650m&#178;g&#8208;1) and crystalline nature. Adjusting the induced mechanical energy allows control over the obtained stacking conformation of the resulting CTFs &#8208; from a staggered AB arrangement to an eclipsed AA stacking conformation. Finally, a substrate scope demonstrates the versatility of this approach, successfully yielding various CTFs.</dc:description>

         <title>H8&#8208;BINOL&#8208;Derived Chiral &#951;6&#8208;Benzene Ligands: New Opportunities for the Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the tremendous success of (p&#8208;cymene)RuII&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation over the past 20 years, the community has long been aware that the development of chiral &#951;6&#8208;benzene (Ben) ligands should be a potent strategy for achieving the attractive but incredibly underdeveloped ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. However, it has rarely been achieved due to the severe difficulty in developing proper chiral Ben ligands. In particular, designing chiral Ben ligands by connecting a benzene fragment to a chiral framework including benzene rings remained an unsolved challenge until this effort. Here we present a novel class of axially chiral Ben ligands derived from readily available (S)&#8208;5,5',6,6',7,7',8,8'&#8208;octahydro&#8208;1,1'&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol ((S)&#8208;H8&#8208;BINOL) in 4&#8208;8 steps. Notably, when coordinated with ruthenium, such chiral Ben ligand containing three benzene rings only forms one of the three possible isomeric BenRuII complexes. The related chiral BenRuII catalysts could effectively catalyze the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of N&#8208;sulfonyl ketimines with alkynes, affording a range of chiral spirocyclic sultams in up to 99% yield with up to &gt;99% ee. These catalysts are expected to find broad applications in future.</dc:description>

         <title>Enable the Domino&#8208;like Structural Recovering in Bismuth Anode to Achieve Fast and Durable Na/K Storages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alloying&#8208;type anodes show capacity and density advantages for sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs), but they encounter serious structural degradation upon cycling, which cannot be resolved through conventional nanostructuring techniques. Herein, we present an in&#8208;depth study to reveal the intrinsic reason for the pulverization of bismuth (Bi) materials upon (de)alloying and report a novel particle&#8208;in&#8208;bulk architecture with Bi nanospheres inlaid in the bulk carbon (BiNC) to achieve durable Na/K storage. We simulate the volume&#8208;expansion&#8208;resistant mechanism of Bi during the (de)alloying reaction and unveil that the irreversible phase transition upon (de)alloying underlies the fundamental origin for the structural degradation of Bi anode, while a proper compressive stress (~10%) raised by the bulk carbon can trigger a &#8220;domino&#8208;like&#8221; Bi crystal recovering. Consequently, the as obtained BiNC exhibits a record high volumetric capacity (823.1 mAh cm&#8722;3 for SIBs, 848.1 mAh cm&#8722;3 for PIBs) and initial coulombic efficiency (95.3% for SIBs, 96.4% for PIBs), and unprecedented cycling stability (15000 cycles for SIBs with only 0.0015% degradation per cycle), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. This work provides new insights on the undesirable structural evolution and proposes basic guidelines for design of the anti&#8208;degradation structure for alloy&#8208;type electrode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning Crystal Structures of Lead Bromide Perovskite Nanocrystals by Trace Cadmium(II) Doping Enables Efficient Color&#8208;Saturate Green LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decreasing perovskite nanocrystal size increases radiative recombination&#160;due to the quantum confinement effect, but also increases the Auger recombination rate which leads to carrier imbalance in the emitting layers of electroluminescent devices. Here, we overcome this trade&#8208;off by increasing the exciton effective mass without affecting the size, which is realized through the trace Cd2+&#160;doping of formamidinium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals. We observe an ~2.7 times increase in the exciton binding energy benefiting from a slight distortion of the [BX6]4&#8722;&#160;octahedra caused by doping in the case of that the Auger recombination rate is almost unchanged. As a result, bright color&#8208;saturated green emitting perovskite nanocrystals with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 96% are obtained. The&#160;light&#8208;emitting devices based on those nanocrystals reached a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 29.4% corresponding to a current efficiency of 123&#8201;cd&#8201;A&#8208;1, and showed dramatically improved device lifetime, with a narrow bandwidth of 22 nm and Commission Internationale de I&#8217;Eclairage coordinates of&#160;(0.20, 0.76) for color&#8208;saturated green emission for the electroluminescence peak centered at 534 nm, thus being fully compliant with the latest standard for wide color gamut displays.</dc:description>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;assisted Fast Synthesis of a Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Framework towards Photooxidative Amidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) at bulk&#160;scale&#160;require robust, straightforward, and&#160;cost&#8208;effective techniques. However, the traditional solvothermal synthetic methods of COFs suffer low scalability as well as requirement of sensitive reaction environment and multiday reaction time (2&#8208;10 days) which greatly restricts their practical application. Here, we report&#160; microwave assisted&#160; rapid&#160; and optimized synthesis of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) based highly crystalline COF, TzPm&#8208;COF in second (10 sec) to minute (10 min) time scale. With the increasing of the time from seconds to minutes crystallinity, porosity and morphological changes are also observed for TzPm&#8208;COF. Owing to visible range light absorption, suitable band alignment, and low exciton binding energy (Eb=64.6&#160;meV),&#160;TzPm&#8208;COF can&#160;efficaciously produce superoxide radical anion (O2&#8226;&#8722;) after activating molecular oxygen (O2) which eventually drives aerobic photooxidative amidation reaction with high recyclability. This photocatalytic approach works well with a variety of substituted aromatic aldehydes having electron&#8208;withdrawing or donating groups and cyclic, acyclic, primary or secondary amines with moderate to high yield. Furthermore, catalytic mechanism was established by monitoring the real&#8208;time reaction progress through in&#8208;situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopic (DRIFTS) study.</dc:description>

         <title>Shell Modulation of Hollow Metal Sulfide Nanocomposite for Stable Potassium Storage at Room and High Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The large size of K&#8208;ion makes the pursuit of stable high&#8208;capacity anodes for K&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) a formidable challenge, particularly for high temperature KIBs as the electrode instability becomes more aggravated with temperature climbing.  Herein, we demonstrate that a hollow ZnS@C nanocomposite (h&#8208;ZnS@C) with a precise shell modulation can resist electrode disintegration to enable stable high&#8208;capacity potassium storage at room and high temperature. Based on a model electrode, we identify an interesting  structure&#8208;function correlation of the h&#8208;ZnS@C: with an increase in the shell thickness, the cyclability increases while the rate and capacity decreases, shedding light on the design of high&#8208;performance h&#8208;ZnS@C anodes via engineering the shell thickness. Typically, the h&#8208;ZnS@C anode with a shell thickness of 60 nm can deliver an impressive comprehensive performance at room temperature; the h&#8208;ZnS@C with shell thickness increasing to 75 nm can achieve an extraordinary stability (88.6% capacity retention over 450 cycles) with a high capacity (450 mAh g&#8208;1) and a superb rate even at an extreme temperature of 60 &#8451;, which is much superior than those reported anodes. This contribution envisions new perspectives on rational design of functional metal sulfides composite toward high&#8208;performance KIBs with insights into the significant structure&#8208;function correlation.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The large size of K-ion makes the pursuit of stable high-capacity anodes for K-ion batteries (KIBs) a formidable challenge, particularly for high temperature KIBs as the electrode instability becomes more aggravated with temperature climbing.

         <title>Potent Immunomodulators Developed from an Unstable Bacterial Metabolite of Vitamin B2 Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial synthesis of vitamin B2 generates a by&#8208;product, 5&#8208;(2&#8208;oxopropylideneamino)&#8208;d&#8208;ribityl&#8208;aminouracil (5&#8208;OP&#8208;RU), with potent immunological properties in mammals, but rapid inactivation in water limits practical uses. This natural product covalently bonds to immunological protein MR1 in antigen presenting cells (APCs), enabling MR1 to traffic to the cell surface, where it interacts with T cell receptors (TCRs) on mucosal associated invariant T lymphocytes (MAIT cells), activating their immunological and antimicrobial properties. Here, we develop several new series of water&#8208;stable compounds tailored for powerful and distinctive immunological functions. We report their water stability, capacity to bind MR1 and traffic it to the cell surface (EC50 17 nM), potent activation (EC50 56 pM) or inhibition (IC50 80 nM) of interacting MAIT cells,&#160;and develop compounds with diazirine&#8208;alkyne, biotin, or fluorophore labels for studying cellular MR1. Computer modelling casts new light on the molecular mechanism&#160;of activation, revealing that activators are first captured in MR1 via&#160; pi&#8208;interactions and H&#8208;bonds, before tighter&#160;covalent bonding to Lys43 in MR1. This chemical study advances our molecular understanding of how bacterial metabolites are captured by MR1, influence cell surface expression of MR1, interact and modify human T cells;&#160;offering&#160;new clues for developing novel vaccine adjuvants, immunotherapeutics, and cancer drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Enhanced Photoreforming of Biomass Furans over a&#160;Urea&#8208;Incorporated Cu(II) Porphyrin Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven upgrading of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxylmethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) holds great promise for sustainable production of bio&#8208;plastics and resins. However, the process is limited by poor selectivity and sluggish kinetics due to the vertical coordination of HMF at relatively strong metal sites. Here, we purposely developed a Cu(II) porphyrin framework featuring side&#8208;chain incorporated urea linkages, denoted as TBUPP&#8208;Cu MOF, to render HMF a weak hydrogen bond at the urea site and flat adsorption via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking with the benzyl moiety. The unique configuration promotes the approaching of &#8211;CHO of HMF to the photoexcited porphyrin ring towards kinetically and thermodynamically favourable intermediate formation and subsequent desorption. The charge localization and orbital energy alignment enable the selective activation of O2 over the porphyrin to generate &#183;O2&#8722; and 1O2 instead of highly oxidative H2O2 and &#183;OH via spin&#8208;flip electron transfer, which drive the ambient oxidation of proximal &#8211;CHO. The effective utilisation of redox species and circumvented over&#8208;oxidation facilitate a FDCA selectivity of &gt;90% with a high turnover number of 193 molHMF molCu&#8722;1. The facile purification of high&#8208;purity FDCA and zero&#8208;waste recycling of intermediates and durable catalyst feature TBUPP&#8208;Cu MOF a promising photo&#8208;oxidation platform towards net&#8208;zero biorefining and organic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Guiding Transient Peptide Assemblies with Structural Elements Embedded in Abiotic Phosphate Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite great progress on the construction of non&#8208;equilibrium systems, most approaches do not consider the structure of the fuel as a critical element to control the processes. Herein, we show that the amino acid side chains (A, F, Nal) in the structure of abiotic phosphates can direct assembly and reactivity during transient structure formation. The fuels bind covalently to substrates and subsequently influence the structures in the assembly process. We focus on the ways in which the phosphate esters guide structure formation and how structures and reactivity cross regulate when constructing assemblies. Through the chemical functionalization of energy&#8208;rich aminoacyl phosphate esters, we are able to control the yield to esters and thioesters upon adding dipeptides containing tyrosine or cysteine residues. The structural elements around the phosphate esters guide the lifetime of the structures formed and their supramolecular assemblies. These properties can further be influenced by the peptide sequence of substrates, incorporating anionic, aliphatic and aromatic residues. Furthermore, we illustrate that oligomerization of esters can be initiated from a single aminoacyl phosphate ester incorporating a tyrosine residue (Y). These findings suggest that activated amino acids with varying reactivity and energy contents can pave the way for designing and fabricating structured fuels.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal&#8208;driven Dispersion of Bismuth Nanoparticles among Carbon Matrix for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The poor electrocatalytic stability and rapid deactivation of metal electrocatalysts are always present in the electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to the harsh reduction condition. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable dispersion of ultrafine bismuth nanoparticles among the hollow carbon shell (Bi@C&#8208;700&#8208;4) simply by a thermal&#8208;driven diffusion process. The confinement effect of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix is able to low the surface energy of bismuth nanoparticles against the easy aggregation commonly observed for the thermal treatment. On the basis of the synergistic effect and confinement effect between bismuth nanoparticles and carbon matrix, the highly dispersed active sites render the obviously improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for carbon dioxide reduction into formate. The in&#8208;situ experimental observation on the reduction process and theoretical calculations reveal that the incorporation of bismuth nanoparticles with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix would promote the activation of CO2 and the easy formation of key intermediate (*OCHO), thus leading the enhanced electrocatalytic activity, with a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of formate about 94.8% and the long&#8208;time stability. Furthermore, the coupling of an anode for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) in solar&#8208;driven system renders the high 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) yield of 81.2%, presenting the impressive solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Lithium Salt Molecule Tuning for Fast Charging/Discharging Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By attaching an electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfone group near N atom, the distance of Li&#8722;N is tuned from 2.069&#8197;&#197; in LiFEA to 4.367&#8197;&#197; in LiETFSI, which enhances ionic separation degree and achieves a more balanced donor number and tuned self&#8208;cleaning intensity for a reinforced SEI. Consequently, the fast charging/discharging capability of lithium metal batteries with this self&#8208;folded lithium salt is progressively improved.







Abstract
The electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are plagued by a low Li+ transference number (T+) of conventional lithium salts and inability to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, we synthesized a self&#8208;folded lithium salt, lithium 2&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxy ethoxy)ethoxy]ethanesulfonyl(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiETFSI), and comparatively studied with its structure analogue, lithium 1,1,1&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;N&#8208;[2&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)]ethyl]methanesulfonamide (LiFEA). The special anion chemistry imparts the following new characteristics: i) In both LiFEA and LiETFSI, the ethylene oxide moiety efficiently captures Li+, resulting in a self&#8208;folded structure and high T+ around 0.8. ii) For LiFEA, a Li&#8722;N bond (2.069&#8197;&#197;) is revealed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, indicating that the FEA anion possesses a high donor number (DN) and thus an intensive interphase &#8220;self&#8208;cleaning&#8221; function for an ultra&#8208;thin and compact SEI. iii) Starting from LiFEA, an electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfone group is introduced near the N atom. The distance of Li&#8722;N is tuned from 2.069&#8197;&#197; in LiFEA to 4.367&#8197;&#197; in LiETFSI. This alteration enhances ionic separation, achieves a more balanced DN, and tunes the self&#8208;cleaning intensity for a reinforced SEI. Consequently, the fast charging/discharging capability of LMBs is progressively improved. This rationally tuned anion chemistry reshapes the interactions among Li+, anions, and solvents, presenting new prospects for advanced LMBs.

&lt;p&gt;The electrolytes for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are plagued by a low Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number (T&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;) of conventional lithium salts and inability to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, we synthesized a self-folded lithium salt, lithium 2-[2-(2-methoxy ethoxy)ethoxy]ethanesulfonyl(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiETFSI), and comparatively studied with its structure analogue, lithium 1,1,1-trifluoro-N-[2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)]ethyl]methanesulfonamide (LiFEA). The special anion chemistry imparts the following new characteristics: i) In both LiFEA and LiETFSI, the ethylene oxide moiety efficiently captures Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in a self-folded structure and high T&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; around 0.8. ii) For LiFEA, a Li&#8722;N bond (2.069&#8197;&#197;) is revealed by single crystal X-ray diffraction, indicating that the FEA anion possesses a high donor number (DN) and thus an intensive interphase &#8220;self-cleaning&#8221; function for an ultra-thin and compact SEI. iii) Starting from LiFEA, an electron-withdrawing sulfone group is introduced near the N atom. The distance of Li&#8722;N is tuned from 2.069&#8197;&#197; in LiFEA to 4.367&#8197;&#197; in LiETFSI. This alteration enhances ionic separation, achieves a more balanced DN, and tunes the self-cleaning intensity for a reinforced SEI. Consequently, the fast charging/discharging capability of LMBs is progressively improved. This rationally tuned anion chemistry reshapes the interactions among Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, anions, and solvents, presenting new prospects for advanced LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diastereoselective Hydrogenation of Tetrasubstituted Olefins using a Heterogeneous Pt&#8208;Ni Alloy Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt&#8722;Ni alloy nanocatalyst is developed for the diastereoselective directed hydrogenation of tetrasubstituted olefins in a cyclopentene scaffold. For this substrate class, established homogeneous catalysts generate hydrogenolysis side products, and commercial heterogeneous catalysts are not stereoselective. Uniform alloying of the noble metal and base metal combined with high catalyst dispersion is critical to enabling good reactivity and diastereoselectivity for a range of sterically&#8208;hindered olefins.







Abstract
Stereoselective hydrogenation of tetrasubstituted olefins is an attractive method to access compounds with two contiguous stereocenters. However, homogeneous catalysts for enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective hydrogenation exhibit low reactivity toward tetrasubstituted olefins due to steric crowding between the ligand scaffold and the substrate. Monometallic heterogeneous catalysts, on the other hand, provide accessible surface active sites for hindered olefins but exhibit unpredictable and inconsistent stereoinduction. In this work, we develop a Pt&#8722;Ni bimetallic alloy catalyst that can diastereoselectively hydrogenate unactivated, sterically&#8208;bulky tetrasubstituted olefins, utilizing the more oxophilic Ni atoms to adsorb a hydroxyl directing group and direct facially&#8208;selective hydrogen addition to the olefin via the Pt atoms. Structure&#8208;activity studies on several Pt&#8722;Ni compositions underscore the importance of exposing a uniform PtNi alloy surface to achieve high diastereoselectivity and minimize side reactions. The optimized Pt&#8722;Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibits good functional group tolerance and broad scope for tetrasubstituted olefins in a cyclopentene scaffold, generating cyclopentanol products with three contiguous stereocenters. The synthetic utility of the method is demonstrated in a four&#8208;step synthesis of (1R,2S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;cis&#8208;methyldihydrojasmonate with high yield and enantiopurity.

         <title>Anion&#8208;modulated Ion Conductor with Chain Conformational Transformation for stabilizing Interfacial Phase of High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional polymer electrolyte for high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal batteries was constructed by modulating the behavior of supramolecular poly (vinylene carbonate) from linear to low entropy globular conformation driven by a multi&#8208;ion environment and achieving the maximum compatibility of the polymer solid electrolyte in situ&#8208;derived poly(carbonate) anionic coating with the electrodes. This work emphasizes the importance of modulating the polymer chain segment conformation for the in situ construction of the solid&#8208;state electrolyte interphase.







Abstract
In solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs), the inhomogeneous electrolyte&#8208;electrode interphase layer aggravates the interfacial stability, leading to discontinuous interfacial ion/charge transport and continuous degradation of the electrolyte. Herein, we constructed an anion&#8208;modulated ionic conductor (AMIC) that enables in situ construction of electrolyte/electrode interphases for high&#8208;voltage SSLMBs by exploiting conformational transitions under multiple interactions between polymer and lithium salt anions. Anions modulate the decomposition behavior of supramolecular poly (vinylene carbonate) (PVC) at the electrode interface by changing the spatial conformation of the polymer chains, which further enhances ion transport and stabilizes the interfacial morphology. In addition, the AMIC weakens the &#8220;Li+&#8208;solvation&#8221; and increases Li+ vehicle sites, thereby enhancing the lithium&#8208;ion transport number (tLi+=~0.67). Consequently, Li&#8201;||&#8201;LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cell maintains about 85&#8201;% capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.8&#8201;% in 200 cycles at a charge cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#8197;V. This study provides a new understanding of lithium salt anions regulating polymer chain segment behavior in the solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) and highlights the importance of the ion environment in the construction of interfacial phases and ionic conduction.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis and Structural Revision of DAT2, an Antigenic Glycolipid from Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric synthesis of four stereoisomers of DAT2, an important antigen of M. tuberculosis, showed that the commonly accepted structure of DAT2 and its acyl substituent mycolipanolic acid had to be corrected. DAT2 is an effective ligand activating Mincle, an important pattern recognition receptor of the immune system.







Abstract
DAT2 is a member of the diacyl trehalose family (DAT) of antigenic glycolipids located in the mycomembrane of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Recently it was shown that the molecular structure of DAT2 had been incorrectly assigned, but the correct structure remained elusive. Herein, the correct molecular structure of DAT2 and its methyl&#8208;branched acyl substituent mycolipanolic acid is determined. For this, four different stereoisomers of mycolipanolic acid were prepared in a stereoselective and unified manner, and incorporated into DAT2. A rigorous comparison of the four isomers to the DAT isolated from Mtb H37Rv by NMR, HPLC, GC, and mass spectrometry allowed a structural revision of mycolipanolic acid and DAT2. Activation of the macrophage inducible Ca2+&#8208;dependent lectin receptor (Mincle) with all four stereoisomers shows that the natural stereochemistry of mycolipanolic acid / DAT2 provides the strongest activation, which indicates its high antigenicity and potential application in serodiagnostics and vaccine adjuvants.

         <title>The Transfer Dehydrogenation Method Enables a Family of High Crystalline Benzimidazole&#8208;linked Cu (II)&#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we proposed a transfer dehydrogenation method to prepare a novel series of imidazole&#8208;linked phthalocyanine Cu (II)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (BICuPc&#8208;COFs) films and powders. The high crystalline BICuPc&#8208;COFs films that possess intrinsic conductivity (0.022&#8211;0.218&#8197;S/m) were fabricated into synaptic devices, which have small source&#8208;drain voltage (VDS=1&#8197;V) and response light from visible to near&#8208;infrared.







Abstract
Heterocycle&#8208;linked phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs with close&#8208;packed &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugated structures are a kind of material with intrinsic electrical conductivity, and they are considered to be candidates for photoelectrical devices. Previous studies have revealed their applications for energy storage, gas sensors, and field&#8208;effect transistors. However, their potential application in photodetector is still not fully studied. The main difficulty is preparing high&#8208;quality films. In our study, we found that our newly designed benzimidazole&#8208;linked Cu (II)&#8208;phthalocyanine&#8208;based COFs (BICuPc&#8208;COFs) film can hardly formed with a regular aerobic oxidation method. Therefore, we developed a transfer dehydrogenation method with N&#8208;benzylideneaniline (BA) as a mild reagent. With this in hand, we successfully prepared a family of high crystalline BICuPc&#8208;COFs powders and films. Furthermore, both of these new BICuPc&#8208;COFs films showed high electrical conductivity (0.022&#8211;0.218&#8197;S/m), higher than most of the reported COFs materials. Due to the broad absorption and high conductivity of BICuPc&#8208;COFs, synaptic devices with small source&#8208;drain voltage (VDS=1&#8197;V) were fabricated with response light from visible to near&#8208;infrared. Based on these findings, we expect this study will provide a new perspective for the application of conducting heterocycle&#8208;linked COFs in synaptic devices.

In our study, we found that our newly designed benzimidazole-linked Cu (II)-phthalocyanine-based COFs (BICuPc-COFs) film can hardly formed with a regular aerobic oxidation method. Therefore, we developed a transfer dehydrogenation method with N-benzylideneaniline (BA) as a mild reagent. With this in hand, we successfully prepared a family of high crystalline BICuPc-COFs powders and films. Furthermore, both of these new BICuPc-COFs films showed high electrical conductivity (0.022&#8211;0.218&#8197;S/m), higher than most of the reported COFs materials. Due to the broad absorption and high conductivity of BICuPc-COFs, synaptic devices with small source-drain voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;DS&lt;/sub&gt;=1&#8197;V) were fabricated with response light from visible to near-infrared. Based on these findings, we expect this study will provide a new perspective for the application of conducting heterocycle-linked COFs in synaptic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalization of Chlorotonils: Dehalogenil as Promising Lead Compound for In Vivo Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The natural product chlorotonil was modified by late&#8208;stage functionalization and novel reactions. After modifying new positions, activity and selectivity were shown against multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and Plasmodium falciparum. Lacking chlorine groups critical for toxicity, the new substance, dehalogenil, was tested in vivo showing strongly improved pharmacokinetics and efficacy in different mouse models of S. aureus infection.







Abstract
The natural product chlorotonil displays high potency against multidrug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and Plasmodium falciparum. Yet, its scaffold is characterized by low solubility and oral bioavailability, but progress was recently made to enhance these properties. Applying late&#8208;stage functionalization, we aimed to further optimize the molecule. Previously unknown reactions including a sulfur&#8208;mediated dehalogenation were revealed. Dehalogenil, the product of this reaction, was identified as the most promising compound so far, as this new derivative displayed improved solubility and in vivo efficacy while retaining excellent antimicrobial activity. We confirmed superb activity against multidrug&#8208;resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. and mature transmission stages of Plasmodium falciparum. We also demonstrated favorable in vivo toxicity, pharmacokinetics and efficacy in infection models with S. aureus. Taken together, these results identify dehalogenil as an advanced lead molecule.

         <title>Unveiling Phenoxazine's Unique Reversible Two&#8208;Electron Transfer Process and Stable Redox Intermediates for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unveils the unique reversible two&#8208;electron redox process of phenoxazine in the aqueous electrolytes, a noteworthy departure from its less reversible second oxidation process in the non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes. Laying the foundation of phenoxazine for realizing multi&#8208;electron storage capacities in high&#8208;performance aqueous ZIBs.







Abstract
The low specific capacity determined by the limited electron transfer of p&#8208;type cathode materials is the main obstruction to their application towards high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). To overcome this challenge, boosting multi&#8208;electron transfer is essential for improving the charge storage capacity. Here, as a typical heteroaromatic p&#8208;type material, we unveil the unique reversible two&#8208;electron redox properties of phenoxazine in the aqueous electrolytes for the first time. The second oxidation process is stabilized in the aqueous electrolytes, a notable contrast to its less reversibility in the non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes. A comprehensive investigation of the redox chemistry mechanism demonstrates remarkably stable redox intermediates, including a stable cation radical PNO&#8901;+ characterized by effective electron delocalization and a closed&#8208;shell state dication PNO2+. Meanwhile, the heightened aromaticity contributes to superior structural stability during the redox process, distinguishing it from phenazine, which features a non&#8208;equivalent hybridized sp2&#8208;N motif. Leveraging these synergistic advantages, the PNO electrodes deliver a high capacity of 215&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 compared to other p&#8208;type materials, and impressive long cycling stability with 100&#8201;% capacity retention over 3500&#8197;cycles. This work marks a crucial step forward in advanced organic electrodes based on multi&#8208;electron transfer phenoxazine moieties for high&#8208;performance aqueous ZIBs.

         <title>A Halogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Artificial Chloride&#8208;Selective Channel Constructed from 5&#8208;Iodoisophthalamide&#8208;based Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8208;Iodoisophthalamide&#8208;based compounds that can self&#8208;assemble in a lipid bilayer and show ion transport aided by halogen bonding in addition to hydrogen bonding have been reported. Ion transport studies show that the hexyl&#8208;substituted derivative exhibits the highest level of activity compared to the other derivatives.







Abstract
Despite considerable emphasis on advancing artificial ion channels, progress is constrained by the limited availability of small molecules with the necessary attributes of self&#8208;assembly and ion selectivity. In this study, a library of small molecules based on 5&#8208;haloisophthalamide and a non&#8208;halogenated isophthalamide were examined for their ion transport properties across the lipid bilayer membranes, and the finding demonstrates that the di&#8208;hexyl&#8208;substituted 5&#8208;iodoisophthalamide derivative exhibits the highest level of activity. Furthermore, it was established that the highest active compound facilitates the selective chloride transport that occurs via an antiport&#8208;mediated mechanism. The crystal structure of the compound unveils a distinctive self&#8208;assembly of molecules, forming a zig&#8208;zag channel pore that is well&#8208;suited for the permeation of anions. Planar bilayer conductance measurements proved the formation of chloride selective channels. A molecular dynamics simulation study, relying on the self&#8208;assembled component derived from the crystal structure, affirmed the paramount significance of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the formation of supramolecular barrel&#8208;rosette structures that span the bilayer. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the transport of chloride across the lipid bilayer membrane is facilitated by the synergistic effects of halogen bonding and hydrogen bonding within the channel.

         <title>Overcoming a Radical Polarity Mismatch in Strain&#8208;Release Pentafluorosulfanylation of [1.1.0]Bicyclobutanes: An Entryway to Sulfone&#8208; and Carbonyl&#8208;Containing SF5&#8208;Cyclobutanes</title>

         <dc:description>
Synthetic methods for strain&#8208;release chloropentafluorosulfanylation and hydropentafluorosulfanylation of [1.1.0]bicyclobutanes were developed to access unique SF5&#8208;cyclobutane hybrid isosteres via a polarity mismatch radical addition. Structural and mechanistic insight, as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for tetrafluoro(aryl)pentafluorosulfanylation, tetrafluoro(trifluoromethyl)pentafluorosulfanylation, and three&#8208;component reactions, are also provided.







Abstract
The first assortment of achiral pentafluorosulfanylated cyclobutanes (SF5&#8208;CBs) are now synthetically accessible through strain&#8208;release functionalization of [1.1.0]bicyclobutanes (BCBs) using SF5Cl. Methods for both chloropentafluorosulfanylation and hydropentafluorosulfanylation of sulfone&#8208;based BCBs are detailed herein, as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that the logic extends to tetrafluoro(aryl)sulfanylation, tetrafluoro(trifluoromethyl)sulfanylation, and three&#8208;component pentafluorosulfanylation reactions. The methods presented enable isolation of both syn and anti isomers of SF5&#8208;CBs, but we also demonstrate that this innate selectivity can be overridden in chloropentafluorosulfanylation; that is, an anti&#8208;stereoselective variant of SF5Cl addition across sulfone&#8208;based BCBs can be achieved by using inexpensive copper salt additives. Considering the SF5 group and CBs have been employed individually as nonclassical bioisosteres, structural aspects of these unique SF5&#8208;CB &#8220;hybrid isosteres&#8221; were then contextualized using SC&#8208;XRD. From a mechanistic standpoint, chloropentafluorosulfanylation ostensibly proceeds through a curious polarity mismatch addition of electrophilic SF5 radicals to the electrophilic sites of the BCBs. Upon examining carbonyl&#8208;containing BCBs, we also observed rare instances whereby radical addition to the 1&#8208;position of a BCB occurs. The nature of the key C(sp3)&#8722;SF5 bond formation step &#8211; among other mechanistic features of the methods we disclose &#8211; was investigated experimentally and with DFT calculations. Lastly, we demonstrate compatibility of SF5&#8208;CBs with various downstream functionalizations.

         <title>Universal Design and Efficient Synthesis for High Ambipolar Mobility Emissive Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a universal design principle and synthetic shortcut towards HAME&#8208;CPs are developed. A series of simple non&#8208;fused polymers composed of charge transfer units, &#960; bridges and emissive units are synthesized via a two&#8208;step microwave assisted C&#8722;H arylation and direct arylation polymerization protocol with high total yields up to 61&#8201;%. The synthetic protocol is verified valid among 7 monomers and 8 polymers. Most importantly, all 8 conjugated polymers have strong solid&#8208;state emission with high photoluminescence quantum yields up to 24&#8201;%. Furthermore, 4 polymers exhibit high ambipolar field effect mobility up to 10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
High ambipolar mobility emissive conjugated polymers (HAME&#8208;CPs) are perfect candidates for organic optoelectronic devices, such as polymer light emitting transistors. However, due to intrinsic trade&#8208;off relationship between high ambipolar mobility and strong solid&#8208;state luminescence, the development of HAME&#8208;CPs suffers from high structural and synthetic complexity. Herein, a universal design principle and simple synthetic approach for HAME&#8208;CPs are developed. A series of simple non&#8208;fused polymers composed of charge transfer units, &#960; bridges and emissive units are synthesized via a two&#8208;step microwave assisted C&#8722;H arylation and direct arylation polymerization protocol with high total yields up to 61&#8201;%. The synthetic protocol is verified valid among 7 monomers and 8 polymers. Most importantly, all 8 conjugated polymers have strong solid&#8208;state emission with high photoluminescence quantum yields up to 24&#8201;%. Furthermore, 4 polymers exhibit high ambipolar field effect mobility up to 10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, and can be used in multifunctional optoelectronic devices. This work opens a new avenue for developing HAME&#8208;CPs by efficient synthesis and rational design.

         <title>A NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Probe for High Spatial Quantitative Imaging of Tumor Nitric Oxide in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that spatial quantification of in vivo NO dynamics is possible using a photoacoustic probe with absorption in the second near&#8208;infrared window as the imaging agent. We have clarified the &#8220;double&#8208;edged&#8208;sword&#8221; function of NO plays in pathophysiology by pinpointing an essential concentration threshold of around 80&#8197;nmol/cm3 for NO, and unveiled the possibility of NO&#8208;mediated communication between the tumor and the liver.







Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) exhibits both pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;tumor effects. Therefore, real&#8208;time in vivo imaging and quantification of tumor NO dynamics are essential for understanding the conflicting roles of NO played in pathophysiology. The current molecular probes, however, cannot provide high&#8208;resolution imaging in deep tissues, making them unsuitable for these purposes. Herein, we designed a photoacoustic probe with an absorption maximum beyond 1000&#8197;nm for high spatial quantitative imaging of in vivo tumor NO dynamics. The probe exhibits remarkable sensitivity, selective ratiometric response behavior, and good tumor&#8208;targeting abilities, facilitating ratiometric imaging of tumor NO throughout tumor progression in a micron&#8208;resolution level. Using the probe as the imaging agent, we successfully quantified NO dynamics in tumor, liver and kidney. We have pinpointed an essential concentration threshold of around 80&#8197;nmol/cm3 for NO, which plays a crucial role in the &#8220;double&#8208;edged&#8208;sword&#8221; function of NO in tumors. Furthermore, we revealed a reciprocal relationship between the NO concentration in tumors and that in the liver, providing initial insights into the possible NO&#8208;mediated communication between tumor and the liver. We believe that the probe will help resolve conflicting aspects of NO biology and guide the design of imaging agents for tumor diagnosis and anti&#8208;cancer drug screening.

         <title>Nanoscale Local Contacts Enable Inverted Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with 20.8&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile post&#8208;treatment method is developed to fabricate efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) by dynamically spin&#8208;coating 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromopyridine&#8208;2&#8208;formamide (ABF) in methanol on the surface of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film. A record&#8208;high efficiency of 20.80&#8201;% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n single&#8208;junction IPSCs was obtained (certified efficiency of 20.02&#8201;%). Furthermore, an inorganic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell was successfully demonstrated, with an impressive efficiency of 26.26&#8201;%.







Abstract
Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) have gained significant attention due to their excellent thermal stability and suitable band gap (~1.7&#8197;eV) for tandem solar cell applications. However, the defect&#8208;induced non&#8208;radiative recombination losses, low charge extraction efficiency, energy level mismatches, and so on render the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency inverted IPSCs remains challenging. Here, the use of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromopyridine&#8208;2&#8208;formamide (ABF) in methanol was dynamically spin&#8208;coated on the surface of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film, which facilitates the limited etching of defect&#8208;rich subsurface layer, resulting in the formation of vertical PbI2 nanosheet structures. This enabled localized contacts between the perovskite film and the electron transport layer, suppress the recombination of electron&#8208;hole and beneficial to electron extraction. Additionally, the C=O and C=N groups in ABF effectively passivated the undercoordinated Pb2+ at grain boundaries and on the surface of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film. Eventually, we achieved a champion efficiency of 20.80&#8201;% (certified efficiency of 20.02&#8201;%) for inverted IPSCs with enhanced stability, which is the highest value ever reported to date. Furthermore, we successfully prepared p&#8208;i&#8208;n type monolithic inorganic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (IPSTSCs) with an efficiency of 26.26&#8201;%. This strategy provided both fast extraction and efficient passivation at the electron&#8208;selective interface.

Here, the use of 3-amino-5-bromopyridine-2-formamide (ABF) in methanol was dynamically spin-coated on the surface of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2.85&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt; film, which facilitates the limited etching of defect-rich subsurface layer, resulting in the formation of vertical PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheet structures. This enabled localized contacts between the perovskite film and the electron transport layer, suppress the recombination of electron-hole and beneficial to electron extraction. Additionally, the C=O and C=N groups in ABF effectively passivated the undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; at grain boundaries and on the surface of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2.85&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt; film. Eventually, we achieved a champion efficiency of 20.80&#8201;% (certified efficiency of 20.02&#8201;%) for inverted IPSCs with enhanced stability, which is the highest value ever reported to date. Furthermore, we successfully prepared p-i-n type monolithic inorganic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (IPSTSCs) with an efficiency of 26.26&#8201;%. This strategy provided both fast extraction and efficient passivation at the electron-selective interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ultralow&#8208;concentration and Moisture&#8208;resistant Electrolyte of Lithium Difluoro(oxalato)borate in Carbonate Solvents for Stable Cycling in Practical Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

We developed an ultra&#8208;low concentration, moisture&#8208;resistant, and environmentally friendly electrolyte of 0.16&#8197;M LiDFOB/EC&#8208;DMC, which is fully compatible with commercial battery materials, leading to long cycling performance.







Abstract
The electrolyte concentration not only impacts the battery performance but also affects the battery cost and manufacturing. Currently, most studies focus on high&#8208;concentration (&gt;3&#8197;M) or localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (~1&#8197;M); however, the expensive lithium salt imposes a major concern. Most recently, ultralow concentration electrolytes (&lt;0.3&#8197;M) have emerged as intriguing alternatives for battery applications, which feature low cost, low viscosity, and extreme&#8208;temperature operation. However, at such an early development stage, many works are urgently needed to further understand the electrolyte properties. Herein, we introduce an ultralow concentration electrolyte of 2&#8197;wt&#8201;% (0.16&#8197;M) lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) in standard carbonate solvents. This electrolyte exhibits a record&#8208;low salt/solvent mass ratio reported to date, thus pointing to a superior low cost. Furthermore, this electrolyte is highly compatible with commercial Li&#8208;ion materials, forming stable and inorganic&#8208;rich interphases on the lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) cathode and graphite anode. Consequently, the LiCoO2&#8208;graphite full cell demonstrates excellent cycling performance. Besides, this electrolyte is moisture&#8208;resistant and effectively suppresses the generation of hydrogen fluoride, which will markedly facilitate the battery assembly and recycling process under ambient conditions.

         <title>Highly Selective Acetylene&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Electroreduction Over Cd&#8208;Decorated Cu Catalyst with Efficiently Inhibited Carbon&#8208;Carbon Coupling</title>

Cd&#8208;decoration breaks the inherent property of carbon&#8208;carbon coupling over Cu&#8208;based catalysts for acetylene electroreduction reaction, achieving a significantly inhibited C4H6 Faradaic efficiency of 0.06&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 5&#8197;vol&#8201;% acetylene feed gas and an ethylene selectivity of 99.99&#8201;% in a simulated crude ethylene feedstock.







Abstract
Electrochemical acetylene reduction (EAR) employing Cu catalysts represents an environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective method for ethylene production and purification. However, Cu&#8208;based catalysts encounter product selectivity issues stemming from carbon&#8208;carbon coupling and other side reactions. We explored the use of secondary metals to modify Cu&#8208;based catalysts and identified Cd decoration as particular effective. Cd decoration demonstrated a high ethylene Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.38&#8201;% with well&#8208;inhibited carbon&#8208;carbon coupling reactions (0.06&#8201;% for butadiene FE at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) in a 5&#8197;vol&#8201;% acetylene gas feed. Notably, ethylene selectivity of 99.99&#8201;% was achieved in the crude ethylene feed during prolonged stability tests. Theoretical calculations revealed that Cd metal accelerates the water dissociation on neighboring Cu surfaces allowing more H* to participate in the acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation, while increasing the energy barrier for carbon&#8208;carbon coupling, thereby contributing to a high ethylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation efficiency and significant inhibition of carbon&#8208;carbon coupling. This study provides a paradigm for a deeper understanding of secondary metals in regulating the product selectivity of EAR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Bond&#8208;Forming for the Synthesis of Skipped Dienes with Synergistic Aminocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A synergistic catalytic strategy has addressed the great challenge in Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;C bond coupling. A variety of structurally diverse skipped 1,4&#8208;dienes are furnished in synthetically useful yields and good enantioselectivity. This strategy has also been applied for the total synthesis of the analogues of (&#8722;)&#8208;Blepharocalyxin D.







Abstract
Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions represent a great challenge in homogeneous catalysis primarily due to a limited understanding of its mechanistic principles. Herein, we have developed an interesting catalytic strategy that leverages a synergistic combination of a dimeric manganese(I) catalyst and a chiral aminocatalyst to address this issue. A range of conjugated dienals and trienals can exclusively proceed 1,4&#8208;hydroalkenylation by using readily available aromatic and aliphatic alkenyl boronic acids as coupling partners, producing a rich library of skipped diene aldehydes in synthetically useful yields and high levels of enantioselectivities. Notably, downstream transformations of these products can not only afford a concise approach to construct enantioenriched skipped trienes but also realize enantioselective total synthesis of analogues to (&#8722;)&#8208;Blepharocalyxin D in four steps. DFT calculations suggest the 1,4&#8208;hydroalkenylation is kinetically more favorable than 1,6&#8208;hydroalkenylation.

A room&#8208;temperature Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O coupling method has been developed utilizing a new N1,N2&#8208;diarylbenzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine ligand. These reactions feature mild reaction conditions, no need to use excess alcohol, and a unique mechanism that does not feature rate&#8208;determining reductive elimination.







Abstract
We disclose the development of a Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O coupling method utilizing a new N1,N2&#8208;diarylbenzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine ligand, L8. Under optimized reaction conditions, structurally diverse aryl and heteroaryl bromides underwent efficient coupling with a variety of alcohols at room temperature using an L8&#8208;based catalyst. Notably, the L8&#8208;derived catalyst exhibited enhanced activity when compared to the L4&#8208;based system previously disclosed for C&#8722;N coupling, namely the ability to functionalize aryl bromides containing acidic functional groups. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that C&#8722;O coupling utilizing L8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cu involves rate&#8208;limiting alkoxide transmetallation, resulting in a mechanism of C&#8722;O bond formation that is distinct from previously described Pd&#8208;, Cu&#8208;, or Ni&#8208;based systems. This lower energy pathway leads to rapid C&#8722;O bond formation; a 7&#8208;fold increase relative to what is seen with other ligands. The results presented in this report overcome limitations in previously described C&#8722;O coupling methods and introduce a new ligand that we anticipate may be useful in other Cu&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Involved Solvation Structure of Lithium Polysulfides in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li salt anions tend to enter the first solvation sheath of cationic lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and form contact ion pairs in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The anion&#8208;involved solvation structure of LiPSs significantly influences the intrinsic kinetics of the sulfur redox reactions and impacts the performance of practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are pivotal intermediates involved in all the cathodic reactions in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. Elucidating the solvation structure of LiPSs is the first step for rational design of electrolyte and improving Li&#8722;S battery performances. Herein, we investigate the solvation structure of LiPSs and find that Li salt anions tend to enter the first solvation sheath of LiPSs and form contact ion pairs in electrolyte. The anion&#8208;involved solvation structure of LiPSs significantly influences the intrinsic kinetics of the sulfur redox reactions. In particular, the LiPS solvation structure modified by lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide endows Li&#8722;S batteries with reduced polarization and enhanced rate performances under high sulfur areal loading and lean electrolyte volume conditions. This work updates the fundamental understanding of the solvation chemistry of LiPSs and highlights electrolyte engineering for promoting the performances of Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Extended Enrichment for Ultrasensitive Detection of Low&#8208;Frequency Mutations by Long Blocker Displacement Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative long blocker design for mutation hotspots detection in colorectal cancer tissue samples. Long blocker extended enrichment region offers superior enrichment capability for variants in mutation&#8208;rich areas, streamlining detection. Unlike traditional blockers, LBDA&#8208;qPCR minimizes the need for multiple entities, optimizing comprehensive mutation analysis.







Abstract
Detecting low&#8208;frequency DNA mutations hotspots cluster is critical for cancer diagnosis but remains challenging. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is constrained by sensitivity, and allele&#8208;specific PCR is restricted by throughput. Here we develop a long blocker displacement amplification (LBDA) coupled with qPCR for ultrasensitive and multiplexed variants detection. By designing long blocker oligos to perfectly match wildtype sequences while mispairing with mutants, long blockers enable 14&#8211;44&#8197;nt enrichment regions which is 2&#8208;fold longer than normal BDA in the experiments. For wild template with a specific nucleotide, LBDA can detect different mutation types down to 0.5&#8201;% variant allele frequency (VAF) in one reaction, with median enrichment fold of 1,000 on 21&#8197;mutant DNA templates compared to the wild type. We applied LBDA&#8208;qPCR to detect KRAS and NRAS mutation hotspots, utilizing a single plex assay capable of covering 81&#8197;mutations and tested in synthetic templates and colorectal cancer tissue samples. Moreover, the mutation types were verified through Sanger sequencing, demonstrating concordance with results obtained from next generation sequencing. Overall, LBDA&#8208;qPCR provides a simple yet ultrasensitive approach for multiplexed detection of low VAF mutations hotspots, presenting a powerful tool for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.

         <title>Total Syntheses of Borolithochromes A, D and G</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total syntheses of borolithochromes A, D and G, spiroborate natural products possessing polyaromatic ligands, were achieved by a strategy including a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction followed by a one&#8208;pot S&#8208;methylation/intramolecular Corey&#8211;Chaykovsky reaction/epoxide rearrangement. A method for the synthesis of heterocomplexes possessing different multicyclic aromatic ligands is also described.







Abstract
Total syntheses of borolithochromes A, D and G, red pigments isolated from fossils of Jurassic putative red alga Solenopora jurassica, have been achieved. The benzo[gh]tetraphene skeletons of the borate ligands in these substances were constructed using Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of aryl dienes with naphthoquinone, followed by intramolecular Corey&#8211;Chaykovsky reactions. Complexation of these ligands with trimethyl borate generated homocomplexes, which upon sequential O&#8208;demethylation produced borolithochromes A and G. In the route to borolithochrome D, a heterocomplex was prepared by stepwise complexation of the ligands with 2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl dimethyl borate. The strategy devised to accomplish the first total synthesis of borolithochromes A, D and G should be applicable to the preparation of other borolithochromes as well as spiroborates possessing two fused polycyclic aromatic ligands.

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Tolerance Electrolyte Design for High&#8208;Energy Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrophilicity (EPT) and coordination ability (CDA) of solvents dominate their reductive stability and delineate the SEI formed on Li or silicon (Si) anodes. Electrolyte with a high reductive stability achieves a high retention rate of 82&#8201;% after 100 cycles in anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) pouch cells.







Abstract
Lithium batteries employing Li or silicon (Si) anodes hold promise for the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, their cycling behavior encounters rapid capacity degradation due to the vulnerability of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). Though anion&#8208;derived SEIs mitigate this degradation, the unavoidable reduction of solvents introduces heterogeneity to SEIs, leading to fractures during cycling. Here, we elucidate how the reductive stability of solvents, dominated by the electrophilicity (EPT) and coordination ability (CDA), delineates the SEI formed on Li or Si anodes. Solvents exhibiting lower EPT and CDA demonstrate enhanced tolerance to reduction, resulting in inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs with homogeneity. Guided by these criteria, we synthesized three promising solvents tailored for Li or Si anodes. The decomposition of these solvents is dictated by their EPTs under similar solvation structures, imparting distinct characteristics to SEIs and impacting battery performance. The optimized electrolyte, 1&#8197;M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) in N&#8208;Pyrrolidine&#8208;trifluoromethanesulfonamide (TFSPY), achieves 600 cycles of Si anodes with a capacity retention of 81&#8201;% (1910&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). In anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523) pouch cells, this electrolyte sustains over 100 cycles with an 82&#8201;% capacity retention. These findings illustrate that reducing solvent decomposition benefits SEI formation, offering valuable insights for the designing electrolytes in high&#8208;energy lithium batteries.

         <title>Stable Anion Exchange Membrane Bearing Quinuclidinium for High&#8208;performance Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic ammonium molecule 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;diphenyl quinuclidinium and a series of branched poly(aryl&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PAQ&#8208;x) anion exchange membranes (AEMs) with excellent alkaline stability were successfully developed. Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based (PGM&#8208;free) anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs) with PAQ&#8208;5 achieved the highest current density (8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 2&#8197;V and the longest durability among all PGM&#8208;free AEM&#8208;WEs reported so far.







Abstract
Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) are core components in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs). However, the stability of functional quaternary ammonium cations, especially under high temperatures and harsh alkaline conditions, seriously affects their performance and durability. Herein, we synthesized a 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;diphenylquinuclidinium molecular building unit. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and accelerated aging analysis indicated that the quinine ring structure was exceedingly stable, and the SN2 degradation mechanism dominated. Through acid&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts polymerization, a series of branched poly(aryl&#8208;quinuclidinium) (PAQ&#8208;x) AEMs with controllable molecular weight and adjustable ion exchange capacity (IEC) were prepared. The stable quinine structure in PAQ&#8208;x was verified and retained in the ex situ alkaline stability. Furthermore, the branched polymer structure reduces the swelling rate and water uptake to achieve a tradeoff between dimensional stability and ionic conductivity, significantly improving the membrane's overall performance. Importantly, PAQ&#8208;5 was used in non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based AEM&#8208;WE, achieving a high current density of 8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2&#8197;V and excellent stability over 2446&#8197;h in a gradient constant current test. Based on the excellent alkaline stability of this diaryl&#8208;quinuclidinium group, it can be further considered as a multifunctional building unit to create multi&#8208;topological polymers for energy conversion devices used in alkaline environments.

         <title>A Highly&#8208;Fluorinated Lithium Borate Main Salt Empowering Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly&#8208;fluorinated lithium borate main salt of lithium perfluoropinacolatoborate (LiFPB) is designed to enhance cycling performance of practical lithium metal batteries (LMBs). The superior stability of LiFPB and the as&#8208;formed favorable CEI/SEI endow LMBs (50&#8197;&#956;m of lithium anode) excellent cycling stability even under high temperature (100&#8201;&#176;C) and voltage (4.5&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+) conditions without any generation of HF.







Abstract
Traditional lithium salts are difficult to meet practical application demand of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) under high voltages and temperatures. LiPF6, as the most commonly used lithium salt, still suffers from notorious moisture sensitivity and inferior thermal stability under those conditions. Here, we synthesize a lithium salt of lithium perfluoropinacolatoborate (LiFPB) comprising highly&#8208;fluorinated and borate functional groups to address the above issues. It is demonstrated that the LiFPB shows superior thermal and electrochemical stability without any HF generation under high temperatures and voltages. In addition, the LiFPB can form a protective outer&#8208;organic and inner&#8208;inorganic rich cathode electrolyte interphase on LiCoO2 (LCO) surface. Simultaneously, the FPB&#8722; anions tend to integrate into lithium ion solvation structure to form a favorable fast&#8208;ion conductive LiBxOy based solid electrolyte interphase on lithium (Li) anode. All these fantastic features of LiFPB endow LCO (1.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2)/Li metal cells excellent cycling under both high voltages and temperatures (e.g., 80&#8201;% capacity retention after 260&#8197;cycles at 60&#8201;&#176;C and 4.45&#8197;V), and even at an extremely elevated temperature of 100&#8201;&#176;C. This work emphasizes the important role of salt anions in determining the electrochemical performance of LMBs at both high temperature and voltage conditions.

         <title>Large Organic Polar Molecules Tailored Electrode Interfaces for Stable Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trace of large organic polar molecules of lithium phytate was introduced to the carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, triggering a competitive solvent attraction mechanism against the solvated Li+, and tailoring both the anode and cathode interfaces with great ability to withstand stable cycling of high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are deemed as ones of the most promising energy storage devices for next electrification applications. However, the uneven Li electroplating process caused by the diffusion&#8208;limited Li+ transportation at the Li metal surface inherently promotes the formation of dendritic morphology and instable Li interphase, while the sluggish Li+ transfer kinetic can also cause lithiation&#8208;induced stress on the cathode materials suffering from serious structural stability. Herein, a novel electrolyte designing strategy is proposed to accelerate the Li+ transfer by introducing a trace of large organic polar molecules of lithium phytate (LP) without significantly altering the electrolyte structure. The LP molecules can afford a competitive solvent attraction mechanism against the solvated Li+, enhancing both the bulk and interfacial Li+ transfer kinetic, and creating better anode/cathode interfaces to suppress the side reactions, resulting in much improved cycling efficiency of LMBs. Using LP&#8208;based electrolyte, the performance of LMB pouch cell with a practical capacity of ~1.5&#8197;Ah can be improved greatly. This strategy opens up a novel electrolyte designing route for reliable LMBs.

Coordination of B(C6F5)3 to 1 afforded diradical 2 by intramolecular integer electron transfer, which is reversible and photo&#8208;controllable. 2 can be obtained in one&#8208;pot reaction, and also displays excellent NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion efficiency of 62.26&#8201;% and high&#8208;quality PT imaging.







Abstract
We have synthesized a quinone&#8208;incorporated bistriarylamine donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) semiconductor 1 by B(C6F5)3 (BCF) catalyzed C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross coupling via radical ion pair intermediates. Coordination of Lewis acids BCF and Al(ORF)3 (RF=C(CF3)3) to the semiconductor 1 afforded diradical zwitterions 2 and 3 by integer electron transfer. Upon binding to Lewis acids, the LUMO energy of 1 is significantly lowered and the band gap of the semiconductor is significantly narrowed from 1.93&#8197;eV (1) to 1.01&#8197;eV (2) and 1.06&#8197;eV (3). 2 and 3 are rare near&#8208;infrared (NIR) diradical dyes with broad absorption both centered around 1500&#8197;nm. By introducing a photo BCF generator, 2 can be generated by light&#8208;dependent control. Furthermore, the integer electron transfer process can also be reversibly regulated via the addition of CH3CN. In addition, the temperature of 2 sharply increased and reached as high as 110&#8201;&#176;C in 10&#8197;s upon the irradiation of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) laser (1064&#8197;nm, 0.7&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2), exhibiting a fast response to laser. It displays excellent photothermal stability with a photothermal (PT) conversion efficiency of 62.26&#8201;% and high&#8208;quality PT imaging.

         <title>Cyanide&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Overall Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cyanide&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TBTN&#8208;COF) exhibits ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer (&lt;500&#8197;fs) and prolonged excited state lifetime (748&#8197;ps). A favorable H2O2 generation mechanism via Yeager&#8208;type *O2&#8226;&#8208; intermediates in the cyanide active site can be demonstrated. These features contribute to an excellent hydrogen peroxide yield rate of 11&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 in pure water.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reduction to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a promising route to providing oxidants for various industrial applications. However, the lack of well&#8208;designed photocatalysts for efficient overall H2O2 production in pure water has impeded ongoing research and practical thrusts. Here we present a cyanide&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TBTN&#8208;COFs) combining 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbonitrile (TBTN) and benzotrithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;tricarbaldehyde (BTT) building blocks with water&#8208;affinity and charge&#8208;separation. The ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer (&lt;500&#8197;fs) and prolonged excited state lifetime (748&#8197;ps) can be realized by TBTN&#8208;COF, resulting in a hole accumulated BTT and electron&#8208;rich TBTN building block. Under one sun, the 11013&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 yield rate of H2O2 can be achieved without any sacrificial agent, outperforming most previous reports. Furthermore, the DFT calculation and in situ DRIFTS spectrums suggesting a Yeager&#8208;type absorption of *O2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate in the cyanide active site, which prohibits the formation of superoxide radical and revealing a favored H2O2 production pathway.

         <title>N&#8208;Heteroaromatic Fluoroalkylation through Ligand Coupling Reaction of Sulfones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoroalkylated N&#8208;heteroarenes are efficiently synthesized from fluoroalkyl 2&#8208;azaheteroarylsulfones via Grignard reagent&#8208;promoted formal SO2 extrusion reaction. The reaction proceeds through the ligand coupling of a pentacoordinate sulfur(VI) intermediate and exhibits unique fluorine effect.







Abstract
Ligand coupling on hypervalent main group elements has emerged as a pivotal methodology for the synthesis of functionalized N&#8208;heteroaromatic compounds in recent years due to the avoidance of transition metals and the mildness of the reaction conditions. In this direction, the reaction of N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfur(IV) and N&#8208;heteroaryl phosphorus(V) compounds has been well studied. However, the ligand coupling of sulfur(VI) is still underdeveloped and the reaction of alkyl N&#8208;heteroarylsulfones is still elusive, which does not match the high status of sulfones as the chemical chameleons in organic synthesis. Here we present a ligand coupling&#8208;enabled formal SO2 extrusion of fluoroalkyl 2&#8208;azaheteroarylsulfones under the promotion of Grignard reagents, which not only enriches the chemistry of sulfones, but also provides a novel and practical synthetic tool towards N&#8208;heteroaromatic fluoroalkylation.

         <title>Molecule and Microstructure Modulations of Cyano&#8208;Containing Electrodes for High&#8208;Performance Fully Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecule and microstructure modulations of cyano&#8208;containing electrodes craft a groundbreaking CNT@PFDCB with core&#8211;shell heterostructure, which breaks through the limitations of cyano&#8208;containing electrodes including inevitable self&#8208;dissolution and sluggish reaction kinetics. As a result, the novel CNT@PFDCB achieves high capacity, elevated voltage, superior rate ability, and exceptional cycling stability, standing out among the reported organic cathodes.







Abstract
Cyano&#8208;containing electrodes usually promise high theoretical potentials while suffering from uncontrollable self&#8208;dissolution and sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, to remedy their limitations, an unprecedented core&#8211;shell heterostructured electrode of carbon nanotubes encapsulated in poly(1,4&#8208;dicyanoperfluorobenzene sulfide) (CNT@PFDCB) is rationally crafted via molecule and microstructure modulations. Specifically, the linkage of sulfide bridges of PFDCB prevents the active cyano groups from dissolving, resulting in a robust structure. The fluorinations modulate the electronic configurations in frontier orbitals, allowing higher electrical conductivity and elevated output voltage. Combined with the core&#8211;shell architecture to unlock the sluggish diffusion kinetics for both electrons and guest ions, the CNT@PFDCB exhibits an impressive capacity (203.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), remarkable rate ability (127.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and exceptional cycling stability (retaining 81.1&#8201;% capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Additionally, the Li&#8208;storage mechanisms regarding PFDCB are thoroughly revealed by in situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and theoretical simulations, which involve the coordination interaction between Li ions and cyano groups and the electron delocalization along the conjugated skeleton. More importantly, a practical fully organic cell based on the CNT@PFDCB is well&#8208;validated that demonstrates a tremendous potential of cyanopolymer as the cathode to replace its inorganic counterparts.

         <title>Activating Interfacial Electron Redistribution in Lattice&#8208;Matched Biphasic Ni3N&#8208;Co3N for Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Production via Coupled Hydrazine Degradation</title>

Mn functions as an electric field engine, activating electronic redistribution at the interface of Ni3N&#8208;Co3N with highly lattice&#8208;matched lattices, thereby enabling energy&#8208;efficient hydrogen production coupled with hydrazine degradation.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;purity and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density green hydrogen through water electrolysis holds immense promise, but issues such as electrocatalyst costs and power consumption have hampered its practical application. In this study, we present a promising solution to these challenges through the use of a high&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for energy&#8208;efficient hydrogen production via coupled hydrazine degradation. The biphasic metal nitrides with highly lattice&#8208;matched structures are deliberately constructed, forming an enhanced local electric field between the electron&#8208;rich Ni3N and electron&#8208;deficient Co3N. Additionally, Mn is introduced as an electric field engine to further activate electron redistribution. Our Mn@Ni3N&#8208;Co3N/NF bifunctional electrocatalyst achieves industrial&#8208;grade current densities of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.49&#8197;V without degradation, saving at least 53.3&#8201;% energy consumption compared to conventional alkaline water electrolysis. This work will stimulate the further development of metal nitride electrocatalysts and also provide new perspectives on low&#8208;cost hydrogen production and environmental protection.

The immobilization of Co single atoms on the surface oxide layer of titanium foam favors the rapid diffusion of generated atomic hydrogen to adjacent Co single atoms through the reverse hydrogen spillover effect for more efficient electrochemical dechlorination of chloramphenicol, offering a promising atomic hydrogen utilization strategy for environmental and energy applications.







Abstract
Efficient water dissociation to atomic hydrogen (H*) with restrained recombination of H* is crucial for improving the H* utilization for electrochemical dechlorination, but is currently limited by the lack of feasible electrodes. Herein, we developed a monolithic single&#8208;atom electrode with Co single atoms anchored on the inherent oxide layer of titanium foam (Co1&#8722;TiOx/Ti), which can efficiently dissociate water into H* and simultaneously inhibit the recombination of H*, by taking advantage of the single&#8208;atom reverse hydrogen spillover effect. Experimental and theoretical calculations demonstrated that H* could be rapidly generated on the oxide layer of titanium foam, and then overflowed to the adjacent Co single atom for the reductive dechlorination. Using chloramphenicol as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept verification, the resulting Co1&#8722;TiOx/Ti monolithic electrode exhibited an unprecedented performance with almost 100&#8201;% dechlorination at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V, far superior to that of traditional indirect reduction&#8208;driven commercial Pd/C (52&#8201;%) and direct reduction&#8208;driven Co1&#8722;N&#8722;C (44&#8201;%). Moreover, its dechlorination rate constant of 1.64&#8197;h&#8722;1 was 4.3 and 8.6 times more active than those of Pd/C (0.38&#8197;h&#8722;1) and Co1&#8722;N&#8722;C (0.19&#8197;h&#8722;1), respectively. Our research sheds light on the rational design of hydrogen spillover&#8208;related electrocatalysts to simultaneously improve the H* generation, transfer, and utilization for environmental and energy applications.

         <title>Aluminagerma[5]pyramidanes&#8212;Formation and Skeletal Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of &#951;5&#8208;alumole complexes of Ge(II) 3 is reported. The alumole complex 3 (R1=NCy2) is in equilibrium with its isomeric aluminylene germole complex 4. This equilibrium between aluminagerma[5]pyramidanes 3 and 4 marks an intriguing example for an exchange of two heteroatoms at the apical position of a pentagonal pyramidal structure under ambient conditions.







Abstract
The salt metathesis reaction of dipotassium germacyclopentadienediide with aluminum(III) dichlorides provides either half&#8208;sandwich alumole complexes of germanium(II) or aluminylene germole complexes. Their molecular structure and the delocalized bonding situation, revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, are equally described as isomeric aluminagerma[5]pyramidanes with either the germanium or the aluminum atom in the apical position of the pentagonal pyramid. The product formation and the selectivity of the reaction depends on the third substituent of the aluminum dichloride. Aryl&#8208;substituents favor the formation of alumole complexes and Cp*&#8208;substituents that of the isomeric germole complexes. With amino&#8208;substituents at the aluminum atom mixtures of both isomers are formed and the positional exchange of the two heteroatoms is shown by NMR spectroscopy. The alumole complexes of germanium(II) undergo facile reductive elimination of germanium and form the corresponding alumoles.

         <title>Rocking&#8208;Chair Aqueous Fluoride&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by Hydrogen Bonding Competition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room temperature rocking&#8208;chair aqueous fluoride ion battery with the development of electrolytes with KOAc&#8208;KF binary salts is constructed, which exhibits concurrent fluorination or defluorination reactions occurring at both cathode and anode electrodes. Weakening of the F&#8722;&#8722;H2O hydrogen bonding by OAc&#8722; anion in the electrolyte is responsible for the optimized electrochemical process.







Abstract
Aqueous fluoride ion batteries (FIBs) have garnered attention for their high theoretical energy density, yet they are challenged by sluggish fluorination kinetics, active material dissolution, and electrolyte instability. Here, we present a room temperature rocking&#8208;chair aqueous FIBs featuring KOAc&#8208;KF binary salt electrolytes, enabling concurrent fluorination and defluorination reactions at both cathode and anode electrodes. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that acetate ions in the electrolyte compete with fluoride ions in hydrogen bonding formation, weakening the excessively strong solvation between H2O and F&#8722; ions. This results in the suppression of detrimental HF formation and a reduced desolvation energy of F&#8722; ions, enhancing the electrochemical reaction kinetics. The bismuth&#8208;based cathode exhibits direct conversion in the optimized electrolyte, effectively suppressing the detrimental disproportionation reactions from Bi2+ intermediates. Additionally, zinc anode undergoes a typical fluorination process, forming solid KZnF3 as the electrode product, minimizing the risks of hydrogen evolution. The proposed aqueous FIBs with the optimized electrolyte demonstrate high discharge capacity, long&#8208;term cycling stability and excellent rate capabilities.

         <title>Two Sesterterpene Synthases from Lentzea atacamensis Demonstrate the Role of Conformational Variability in Terpene Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genome mining of Lentzea atacamensis uncovered two multiproduct sesterterpene synthases with the main products lentzeadiene and atacamatriene. For lentzeadiene an intriguing thermal [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement was observed, reminiscent of vitamin D3 biosynthesis. The cyclisation mechanisms were investigated through isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations, showing the importance of conformational changes during terpene cyclizations.







Abstract
Mining of two multiproduct sesterterpene synthases from Lentzea atacamensis resulted in the identification of the synthases for lentzeadiene (LaLDS) and atacamatriene (LaATS). The main product of LaLDS (lentzeadiene) is a new compound, while one of the side products (lentzeatetraene) is the enantiomer of brassitetraene B and the other side product (sestermobaraene F) is known from a surprisingly distantly related sesterterpene synthase. LaATS produces six new compounds, one of which is the enantiomer of the known sesterterpene Bm1. Notably, for both enzymes the products cannot all be explained from one and the same starting conformation of geranylfarnesyl diphosphate, demonstrating the requirement of conformational flexibility of the substrate in the enzymes&#8217; active sites. For lentzeadiene an intriguing thermal [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement was discovered, reminiscent of the biosynthesis of vitamin D3. All enzyme reactions and the [1,5]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement were investigated through isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. The results also emphasize the importance of conformational changes during terpene cyclizations.

         <title>The Influence of Ions on the Electrochemical Stability of Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is known that the type and concentration of dissolved salts dictate the thermodynamics of the electrolytic reactions of aqueous electrolytes, whereas the whole picture of the mechanism remains elusive. Besides the varying O&#8722;H bond strength, we found the essential contribution from the hydration energies of protons and hydroxides, the products of OER and HER, respectively. The findings will reshape the design principles of the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes.







Abstract
The electrochemical stability window of water is known to vary with the type and concentration of dissolved salts. However, the underlying influence of ions on the thermodynamic stability of aqueous solutions has not been fully understood. Here, we investigated the electrolytic behaviors of aqueous electrolytes as a function of different ions. Our findings indicate that ions with high ionic potentials, i.e., charge density, promote the formation of their respective hydration structures, enhancing electrolytic reactions via an inductive effect, particularly for small cations. Conversely, ions with lower ionic potentials increase the proportion of free water molecules&#8212;those not engaged in hydration shells or hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks&#8212;leading to greater electrolytic stability. Furthermore, we observe that the chemical environment created by bulky ions with lower ionic potentials impedes electrolytic reactions by frustrating the solvation of protons and hydroxide ions, the products of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. We found that the solvation of protons plays a more substantial role than that of hydroxide, which explains a greater shift for OER than for HER, a puzzle that cannot be rationalized by the notion of varying O&#8722;H bond strengths of water. These insights will help the design of aqueous systems.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical stability window of water is known to vary with the type and concentration of dissolved salts. However, the underlying influence of ions on the thermodynamic stability of aqueous solutions has not been fully understood. Here, we investigated the electrolytic behaviors of aqueous electrolytes as a function of different ions. Our findings indicate that ions with high ionic potentials, i.e., charge density, promote the formation of their respective hydration structures, enhancing electrolytic reactions via an inductive effect, particularly for small cations. Conversely, ions with lower ionic potentials increase the proportion of free water molecules&#8212;those not engaged in hydration shells or hydrogen-bonding networks&#8212;leading to greater electrolytic stability. Furthermore, we observe that the chemical environment created by bulky ions with lower ionic potentials impedes electrolytic reactions by frustrating the solvation of protons and hydroxide ions, the products of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. We found that the solvation of protons plays a more substantial role than that of hydroxide, which explains a greater shift for OER than for HER, a puzzle that cannot be rationalized by the notion of varying O&#8722;H bond strengths of water. These insights will help the design of aqueous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Porous Ceramic Metal&#8208;Based Flow Battery Composite Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rigid hierarchical porous ceramic MF membrane coated with small amounts of a polyelectrolyte was used in a zinc&#8208;iron flow battery. The rigid porous structure of the ceramic membrane not only provided fast ion transport channels but also prevented dendrite formation and enhanced zinc deposition within the ceramic cavities, significantly increasing the areal capacity up to 260&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintained an average EE of &gt;80&#8201;% for more than 1000&#8197;h.







Abstract
In metal&#8208;based flow battery, membranes significantly impact energy conversion efficiency and security. Unfortunately, damages to the membrane occur due to gradual accumulation of metal dendrites, causing short circuits and shortening cycle life. Herein, we developed a rigid hierarchical porous ceramic flow battery composite membrane with a sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm&#8208;thick polyelectrolyte coating to achieve high ion selectivity and conductivity, to restrain dendrite, and to realize long cycle life and high areal capacity. An aqueous zinc&#8208;iron flow battery prepared using this membrane achieved an outstanding energy efficiency of &gt;80%, exhibiting excellent long&#8208;term stability (over 1000&#8197;h) and extremely high areal capacity (260&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Low&#8208;field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, in situ infrared spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state NMR analysis, and nano&#8208;computed tomography revealed that the rigid hierarchical pore structures and numerous hydrogen bonding networks in the membrane contributed to the stable operation and superior battery performance. This study contributes to the development of next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based flow battery membranes for energy and power generation.

         <title>Unlocking Four&#8208;electron Conversion in Tellurium Cathodes for Advanced Magnesium&#8208;based Dual&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a magnesium aluminum chloride complex electrolyte with Mg(TFSI)2 additive, a four&#8208;electron Te0/Te4+ conversion is initiated in elemental Te, enabling the demonstration of high&#8208;performance Mg//Te dual&#8208;ion batteries. The Mg(TFSI)2 additive is uncovered to play a crucial role in facilitating Cl&#8722; dissociation and mitigating corrosion and passivation of Mg anodes.







Abstract
Magnesium (Mg) batteries hold promise as a large&#8208;scale energy storage solution, but their progress has been hindered by the lack of high&#8208;performance cathodes. Here, we address this challenge by unlocking the reversible four&#8208;electron Te0/Te4+ conversion in elemental Te, enabling the demonstration of superior Mg//Te dual&#8208;ion batteries. Specifically, the classic magnesium aluminum chloride complex (MACC) electrolyte is tailored by introducing Mg bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2), which initiates the Te0/Te4+ conversion with two distinct charge&#8208;storage steps. Te cathode undergoes Te/TeCl4 conversion involving Cl&#8722; as charge carriers, during which a tellurium subchloride phase is presented as an intermediate. Significantly, the Te cathode achieves a high specific capacity of 543&#8197;mAh&#8201;gTe&#8722;1 and an outstanding energy density of 850&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgTe&#8722;1, outperforming most of the previously reported cathodes. Our electrolyte analysis indicates that the addition of Mg(TFSI)2 reduces the overall ion&#8208;molecule interaction and mitigates the strength of ion&#8208;solvent aggregation within the MACC electrolyte, which implies the facilized Cl&#8722; dissociation from the electrolyte. Besides, Mg(TFSI)2 is verified as an essential buffer to mitigate the corrosion and passivation of Mg anodes caused by the consumption of the electrolyte MgCl2 in Mg//Te dual&#8208;ion cells. These findings provide crucial insights into the development of advanced Mg&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Cavity&#8208;Directed Synthesis of Labile Polyoxometalates for Catalysis in Confined Spaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of labile polyoxometalates (POMs) in aqueous solutions has been achieved within the confined cavity of a robust and water&#8208;soluble coordination cage. This encapsulation significantly enhances the stability of these POMs in water, rendering them into green catalysts with high reactivity and selectivity. This cavity&#8208;directed approach represents the first example of utilizing the coordination cage for synthesizing metallic clusters.







Abstract
The artificial microenvironments inside coordination cages have gained significant attention for performing enzyme&#8208;like catalytic reactions by facilitating the formation of labile and complex molecules through a &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; approach. Despite many fascinating examples, this approach remains scarcely explored in the context of synthesizing metallic clusters such as polyoxometalates (POMs). The development of innovative approaches to control and influence the speciation of POMs in aqueous solutions would greatly advance their applicability and could ultimately lead to the formation of elusive clusters that cannot be synthesized by using traditional methods. In this study, we employ host&#8211;guest stabilization within a coordination cage to enable a novel cavity&#8208;directed synthesis of labile POMs in aqueous solutions under mild conditions. The elusive Lindqvist [M6O19]2&#8722; (M=Mo or W) POMs were successfully synthesized at room temperature via the condensation of molybdate or tungstate building blocks within the confined cavity of a robust and water&#8208;soluble Pt6L4(NO3)12 coordination cage. Importantly, the encapsulation of these POMs enhances their stability in water, rendering them efficient catalysts for environmentally friendly and selective sulfoxidation reactions using H2O2 as a green oxidant in a pure aqueous medium. The approach developed in this paper offers a means to synthesize and stabilize the otherwise unstable metal&#8208;oxo clusters in water, which can broaden the scope of their applications.

         <title>Dimethyl Carbonate Synthesis from CO2 over CeO2 with Electron&#8208;Enriched Lattice Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron enriched lattice oxygen species provided abundant base sites for CO2 adsorption and simultaneously facilitated the weakly absorbed methoxy formation, thus shifting the rate determining&#8208;step from *CH3OCOO formation to *CH3OCOO dissociation and lowering the energy barrier of dimethyl carbonate synthesis.







Abstract
Direct synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) from CO2 plays an important role in carbon neutrality, but its efficiency is still far from the practical application, due to the limited understanding of the reaction mechanism and rational design of efficient catalyst. Herein, abundant electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen species were introduced into CeO2 catalyst by constructing the point defects and crystal&#8208;terminated phases in the crystal reconstruction process. Benefitting from the acid&#8208;base properties modulated by the electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen, the optimized CeO2 catalyst exhibited a much higher DMC yield of 22.2 mmol g&#8208;1 than the reported metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based catalysts at the similar conditions. Mechanistic investigations illustrated that the electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen can provide abundant sites for CO2 adsorption and activation, and was advantageous of the formation of the weakly adsorbed active methoxy species. These were facilitating to the coupling of methoxy and CO2 for the key *CH3OCOO intermediate formation. More importantly, the weakened adsorption of *CH3OCOO on the electron&#8208;enriched lattice oxygen can switch the rate&#8208;determining&#8208;step (RDS) of DMC synthesis from *CH3OCOO formation to *CH3OCOO dissociation, and lower the corresponding activation barriers, thus giving rise to a high performance. This work provides insights into the underlying reaction mechanism for DMC synthesis from CO2 and methanol and the design of highly efficient catalysts.

Mechanistic investigations illustrated that the electron-enriched lattice oxygen can provide abundant sites for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and activation, and was advantageous of the formation of the weakly adsorbed active methoxy species. These were facilitating to the coupling of methoxy and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the key *CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OCOO intermediate formation. More importantly, the weakened adsorption of *CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OCOO on the electron-enriched lattice oxygen can switch the rate-determining-step (RDS) of DMC synthesis from *CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OCOO formation to *CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OCOO dissociation, and lower the corresponding activation barriers, thus giving rise to a high performance. This work provides insights into the underlying reaction mechanism for DMC synthesis from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and methanol and the design of highly efficient catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synchronous Regulation of D&#8211;Band Centers in Zn Substrates and Weakening Pauli Repulsion of Zn Ions Using the Ascorbic Acid Additive for Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>

The vitamin C molecule tends to regulate the d band center of the Zn substrate as well as adjust the solvation structure. Under this circumstance, active H+ was fixed to the Zn substrate so that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was restrained, and the Zn deposition was uniform.







Abstract
The advanced aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs) are still challenging due to the harmful reactions including hydrogen evolution and corrosion. Here, a natural small molecule acid vitamin C (Vc) as an aqueous electrolyte additive has been selectively identified. The small molecule Vc can adjust the d band center of Zn substrate which fixes the active H+ so that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is restrained. Simultaneously, it could also fine&#8211;tune the solvation structure of Zn ions due to the enhanced electrostatics and reduced Pauli repulsion verified by energy decomposition analysis (EDA). Hence, the cell retains an ultra&#8211;long cycle performance of over 1300&#8197;cycles and a superior Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5&#8201;%. The prepared full cells display increased rate capability, cycle lifetime, and self&#8211;discharge suppression. Our results shed light on the mechanistic principle of electrolyte additives on the performance improvement of ZIBs, which is anticipated to render a new round of studies.

         <title>Lowering Entropic Barriers in Triplex DNA Switches Facilitating Biomedical Applications at Physiological pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short dsDNA&#8208;containing clamp&#8208;like triplex nanoswitch, termed CTNSds, was constructed. The CTNSds design could reduce the entropic barriers (&#8722;T&#9653;S) associated with the formation of a triplex motif, thereby increasing its triplex&#8208;forming ratio to 91&#8201;% at pH&#8197;7.4, which was nearly three times higher than that of the classical clamp&#8208;like triplex nanoswitch.







Abstract
Triplex DNA switches are attractive allosteric tools for engineering smart nanodevices, but their poor triplex&#8208;forming capacity at physiological conditions limited the practical applications. To address this challenge, we proposed a low&#8208;entropy barrier design to facilitate triplex formation by introducing a hairpin duplex linker into the triplex motif, and the resulting triplex switch was termed as CTNSds. Compared to the conventional clamp&#8208;like triplex switch, CTNSds increased the triplex&#8208;forming ratio from 30&#8201;% to 91&#8201;% at pH&#8197;7.4 and stabilized the triple&#8208;helix structure in FBS and cell lysate. CTNSds was also less sensitive to free&#8208;energy disturbances, such as lengthening linkers or mismatches in the triple&#8208;helix stem. The CTNSds design was utilized to reversibly isolate CTCs from whole blood, achieving high capture efficiencies (&gt;86&#8201;%) at pH&#8197;7.4 and release efficiencies (&gt;80&#8201;%) at pH&#8197;8.0. Our approach broadens the potential applications of DNA switches&#8208;based switchable nanodevices, showing great promise in biosensing and biomedicine.

         <title>Turning Non&#8208;Emissive Schiff Bases Into Aggregate Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cocrystallization&#8208;induced emission strategy to turn non&#8208;emissive Schiff bases into aggregate emitters has been realized. This study not only highlights the potential of developing new C=N structural motifs for AIEgens but also could boost advancements in related structure motifs like C=C and N=N.







Abstract
Schiff bases are a crucial component in various functional materials but often exhibit non&#8208;emissive behavior which significantly limits their potential applications as luminescent materials. However, traditional approaches to convert them into aggregate emitters often require intricate molecular design, tedious synthesis, and significant time and resource consumption. Herein, we present a cocrystallization&#8208;induced emission strategy that can transform non&#8208;emissive (hetero)aryl&#8208;substituted Schiff bases into green&#8208;yellow to yellow aggregate emitters via even simple grinding of a mixture of Schiff bases and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCB) mixtures. The combined experimental and theoretical analysis revealed that the cocrystallization inhibits the C=N isomerization and promotes face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction, which restricts access to both the dark state and canonical intersection to ultimately induce emission. Furthermore, the induced emission enables the observation of solid&#8208;state molecular diffusion through fluorescence signals, advancing white light emission diodes, and notably, solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on cocrystal for the first time. This study not only highlights the potential of developing new C=N structural motifs for AIEgens but also could boost advancements in related structure motifs like C=C and N=N.

         <title>Unveiling the Mysteries: Acetonitrile's Dance with Weakly&#8208;Solvating Electrolytes in Shaping Gas Evolution and Electrochemical Performance of Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetonitrile electrolyte additive is found to delay hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) evolution reactions in aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs). It also suppresses vanadium (V) dissolution, or V&#8208;ion crosstalk, from the vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) cathode. Practically, acetonitrile&#8208;added electrolyte enabled a high and stable areal capacity of 3.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using a 26&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 V2O5 dry&#8208;film cathode.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;metal battery (AZMB) is a promising candidate for future large&#8208;scale energy storage with commendable capacity, exceptional safety characteristics, and low cost. Acetonitrile (AN) has been widely used as an effective electrolyte constituent to improve AZMBs&#8217; performance. However, its functioning mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we unveiled the critical roles of AN in AZMBs via comparative in situ electrochemical, gaseous, and morphological analyses. Despite its limited ability to solvate Zn ions, AN&#8208;modulated Zn&#8208;ion solvation sheath with increased anions and decreased water achieves a weakly&#8208;solvating electrolyte. As a result, the Zn||Zn cell with AN addition exhibited 63&#8197;times longer cycle life than cell without AN and achieved a 4&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 accumulated capacity with no H2 generation. In V2O5||Zn cells, for the first time, AN suppressing CO2 generation, elevating CO2&#8208;initiation voltage from 2&#8594;2.44&#8197;V (H2: 2.43&#8594;2.55&#8197;V) was discovered. AN&#8208;impeded transit and Zn&#8208;side deposition of dissolved vanadium ions, known as &#8220;crosstalk,&#8221; ameliorated inhomogeneous Zn deposition and dendritic Zn growth. At last, we demonstrated an AN&#8208;enabled high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity AZMB (3.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) using high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading V2O5 cathode (26&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This study shed light on the strategy of constructing fast&#8208;desolvation electrolytes and offered insights for future electrolyte accommodation for high&#8208;voltage AZMB cathodes.

At last, we demonstrated an AN-enabled high-areal-capacity AZMB (3.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) using high-mass-loading V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; cathode (26&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This study shed light on the strategy of constructing fast-desolvation electrolytes and offered insights for future electrolyte accommodation for high-voltage AZMB cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Solid Sulfur Conversion for Energetic All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Na&#8722;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design methodology for matrix featuring separated bi&#8208;catalytic sites that direct one&#8208;step reversible sulfur conversion during battery cycling was proposed. And the tandem electrocatalysis manipulated tunable quasi&#8208;solid sulfur redox chemistry smoothen the efficient entrapping&#8208;catalysis&#8208;conversion polysulfide speciation for practical all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
The high theoretical energy density (1274&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and high safety enable the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S batteries with great promise for stationary energy storage system. However, the uncontrollable solid&#8211;liquid&#8208;solid multiphase conversion and its associated sluggish polysulfides redox kinetics pose a great challenge in tunning the sulfur speciation pathway for practical Na&#8722;S electrochemistry. Herein, we propose a new design methodology for matrix featuring separated bi&#8208;catalytic sites that control the multi&#8208;step polysulfide transformation in tandem and direct quasi&#8208;solid reversible sulfur conversion during battery cycling. It is revealed that the N, P heteroatom hotspots are more favorable for catalyzing the long&#8208;chain polysulfides reduction, while PtNi nanocrystals manipulate the direct and full Na2S4 to Na2S low&#8208;kinetic conversion during discharging. The electrodeposited Na2S on strongly coupled PtNi and N, P&#8208;codoped carbon host is extremely electroreactive and can be readily recovered back to S8 without passivation of active species during battery recharging, which delivers a true tandem electrocatalytic quasi&#8208;solid sulfur conversion mechanism. Accordingly, stable cycling of the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state soft&#8208;package Na&#8722;S pouch cells with an attractive specific capacity of 876&#8197;mAh gS&#8722;1 and a high energy of 608&#8197;Wh kgcathode&#8722;1 (172&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, based on the total mass of cathode and anode) at 60&#8201;&#176;C are demonstrated.

         <title>Introducing Carborane Clusters into Crystalline Frameworks via Thiol&#8208;Yne Click Chemistry for Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through thiol&#8208;yne click chemistry, the energy&#8208;rich and reductive carborane subunits were covalently incorporated into the pores of energetic frameworks. This innovative decoration approach enables integrate multiple functionalities, ultimately achieving enhanced energy density, improved safety and shortened ignition delay time of the energetic frameworks.







Abstract
Crystalline frameworks represent a cutting&#8208;edge frontier in material science, and recently, there has been a surge of interest in energetic crystalline frameworks. However, the well&#8208;established porosity often leads to diminished output energy, necessitating a novel approach for performance enhancement. Thiol&#8208;yne coupling, a versatile metal&#8208;free click reaction, has been underutilized in crystalline frameworks. As a proof of concept, we herein demonstrate the potential of this approach by introducing the energy&#8208;rich, size&#8208;matched, and reductive 1,2&#8208;dicarbadodecaborane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol (CB&#8722;SH) into an acetylene&#8208;functionalized framework, Zn(AIm)2, via thiol&#8208;yne click reaction. This innovative decoration strategy resulted in a remarkable 46.6&#8201;% increase in energy density, a six&#8208;fold reduction in ignition delay time (4&#8197;ms) with red fuming nitric acid as the oxidizer, and impressive enhancement of stability. Density functional theory calculations were employed to elucidate the mechanism by which CB&#8722;SH promotes hypergolic ignition. The thiol&#8208;yne click modification strategy presented here permits engineering of crystalline frameworks for the design of advanced energetic materials.

         <title>A Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Based Elastomer Bearing Loop Structures with Dissipating Characteristics and Enhanced Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated that a special loop structure of dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 incorporated into the network enables substantial energy dissipation and exceptional elasticity, significantly enhancing mechanical performance, while the recognition of dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 and guest molecules, such as potassium ions and secondary ammonium salts, significantly enhances the recovery performance of the material.







Abstract
Loops are prevalent topological structures in cross&#8208;linked polymer networks, resulting from the folding of polymer chains back onto themselves. Traditionally, they have been considered as defects that compromise the mechanical properties of the network, leading to extensive efforts in synthesis to prevent their formation. In this study, we introduce the inclusion of cyclic dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) moieties within the polymer network strands to form CCNs, and surprisingly, these loops enhance the mechanical performances of the network, leading to tough elastomers. The toughening effect can be attributed to the unique cyclic structure of DB24C8. The relatively small size and the presence of rigid phenyl rings provide the loops with relatively stable conformations, allowing for substantial energy dissipation upon the application of force. Furthermore, the DB24C8 rings possess a broad range of potential conformations, imparting the materials with exceptional elasticity. The synergistic combination of these two features effectively toughens the materials, resulting in a remarkable 66&#8208;fold increase in toughness compared to the control sample of covalent networks. Moreover, the mechanical properties, particularly the recovery performance of the network, can be effectively tuned by introducing guests to bind with DB24C8, such as potassium ions and secondary ammonium salts.

         <title>Catechol&#8208;Siderophore Mimics Convey Nucleic Acid Therapeutics into Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic siderophores are conjugated to antibacterial antisense sequences to efficiently deliver them into bacteria. The conjugates display effective protein downregulation and potent antibacterial properties. Whole&#8208;genome sequencing of resistant mutants and competition experiments with the endogenous siderophore demonstrate transport through the siderophore&#8208;mediated iron uptake pathway.







Abstract
Antibacterial resistance is a major threat for human health. There is a need for new antibacterials to stay ahead of constantly&#8208;evolving resistant bacteria. Nucleic acid therapeutics hold promise as powerful antibiotics, but issues with their delivery hamper their applicability. Here, we exploit the siderophore&#8208;mediated iron uptake pathway to efficiently transport antisense oligomers into bacteria. We appended a synthetic siderophore to antisense oligomers targeting the essential acpP gene in Escherichia coli. Siderophore&#8208;conjugated PNA and PMO antisense oligomers displayed potent antibacterial properties. Conjugates bearing a minimal siderophore consisting of a mono&#8208;catechol group showed equally effective. Targeting the lacZ transcript resulted in dose&#8208;dependent decreased &#946;&#8208;galactosidase production, demonstrating selective protein downregulation. Applying this concept to Acinetobacter baumannii also showed concentration&#8208;dependent growth inhibition. Whole&#8208;genome sequencing of resistant mutants and competition experiments with the endogenous siderophore verified selective uptake through the siderophore&#8208;mediated iron uptake pathway. Lastly, no toxicity towards mammalian cells was found. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that large nucleic acid therapeutics can be efficiently transported into bacteria using synthetic siderophore mimics.

         <title>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Chemical Shift as a Probe for Single&#8208;Molecule Charge Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical shift observed in NMR spectroscopy has been recently found to be a descriptor for the frontier molecular orbitals of organic/organometallic compounds. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that it can be applied to rationalise charge transport through such compounds, equipping the molecular electronics toolbox with another useful technique.







Abstract
Existing modelling tools, developed to aid the design of efficient molecular wires and to better understand their charge&#8208;transport behaviour and mechanism, have limitations in accuracy and computational cost. Further research is required to develop faster and more precise methods that can yield information on how charge transport properties are impacted by changes in the chemical structure of a molecular wire. In this study, we report a clear semilogarithmic correlation between charge transport efficiency and nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts in multiple series of molecular wires, also accounting for the presence of chemical substituents. The NMR data was used to inform a simple tight&#8208;binding model that accurately captures the experimental single&#8208;molecule conductance values, especially useful in this case as more sophisticated density functional theory calculations fail due to inherent limitations. Our study demonstrates the potential of NMR spectroscopy as a valuable tool for characterising, rationalising, and gaining additional insights on the charge transport properties of single&#8208;molecule junctions.

         <title>Electrostatic Field in Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis Driven C&#8722;F Bond Cleavage of Perfluoroalkyl Substances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel approach using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as the catalyst under low frequency ultrasound irradiation to degrade perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). A strong interfacial electrostatic field (IEF) on PTFE surface has shown great success in triggering C&#8722;F bond cleavage and achieving near&#8208;complete defluorination. This catalytic mechanism brings new PFASs treatment technologies for sustainable demands.







Abstract
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent and toxic to human health. It is demanding for high&#8208;efficient and green technologies to remove PFASs from water. In this study, a novel PFAS treatment technology was developed, utilizing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) particles (1&#8211;5&#8197;&#956;m) as the catalyst and a low frequency ultrasound (US, 40&#8197;kHz, 0.3&#8197;W/cm2) for activation. Remarkably, this system can induce near&#8208;complete defluorination for different structured PFASs. The underlying mechanism relies on contact electrification between PTFE and water, which induces cumulative electrons on PTFE surface, and creates a high surface voltage (tens of volts). Such high surface voltage can generate abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS, i.e., O2&#8901;&#8722;, HO&#8901;, etc.) and a strong interfacial electrostatic field (IEF of 109~1010&#8197;V/m). Consequently, the strong IEF significantly activates PFAS molecules and reduces the energy barrier of O2&#8901;&#8722; nucleophilic reaction. Simultaneously, the co&#8208;existence of surface electrons (PTFE*(e&#8722;)) and HO&#8901; enables synergetic reduction and oxidation of PFAS and its intermediates, leading to enhanced and thorough defluorination. The US/PTFE method shows compelling advantages of low energy consumption, zero chemical input, and few harmful intermediates. It offers a new and promising solution for effectively treating the PFAS&#8208;contaminated drinking water.

         <title>Binding FSI&#8722; to Construct a Self&#8208;Healing SEI Film for Li&#8208;Metal Batteries by In situ Crosslinking Vinyl Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing SEI film containing bound FSI&#8722; anions as repairing agent is constructed via the cross&#8208;linking of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (VMI&#8208;FSI) to improve the performances of lithium anode. When they encounter lithium metal, the FSI&#8722; groups are chemically decomposed into LiF &amp; Li3N, which assist forming SEI membrane on lithium sheet and repairing SEI membrane in the cracks lacerated by lithium dendrite.







Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) membrane on the Li metal anode tends to breakdown and undergo reconstruction during operation, causing Li metal batteries to experience accelerated decay. Notably, an SEI membrane with self&#8208;healing characteristics can help considerably in stabilizing the Li&#8208;electrolyte interface; however, uniformly fixing the repairing agent onto the anode remains a challenging task. By leveraging the noteworthy film&#8208;forming attributes of bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI&#8722;) anions and the photopolymerization property of the vinyl group, the ionic liquid 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (VMI&#8208;FSI) was crosslinked with polyethylene oxide (PEO) in this study to form a self&#8208;healing film fixing FSI&#8722; groups as the repairing agent. When they encounter lithium metal, the FSI&#8722; groups are chemically decomposed into LiF &amp; Li3N, which assist forming SEI membrane on lithium sheet and repairing SEI membrane in the cracks lacerated by lithium dendrite. Furthermore, the FSI&#8722; anions exchanged from film are electrochemically decomposed to generate inorganic salts to strengthen the SEI membrane. Benefiting from the self&#8208;healing behavior of the film, Li/LiCoO2 cells with the loading of 16.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 exhibit the initial discharge capacities of 183.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and are stably operated for 500&#8197;cycles with the retention rates of 81.4&#8201;% and the average coulombic efficiency of 99.97&#8201;%, operated between 3.0&#8211;4.5&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li. This study presents a new design approach for self&#8208;healing Li metal anodes and durable lithium metal battery.

         <title>Photoluminescence Enhancement in Silica&#8208;Confined Ligand&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanocrystals by Suppression of Silanol&#8208;Induced Traps and Phase Impurities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presence of a high density of silanol sites induces the formation of CsPb2Br5 impurities and traps along with the crystallization of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) in mesoporous silica. Silanol elimination leads to a substantial improvement (up to 160&#8208;fold) in the photoluminescence quantum yield of CsPbBr3 NCs confined in mesoporous silica.







Abstract
The detriments of intrinsic silanol groups in mesoporous silica to the photoluminescence (PL) of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP NCs) confined in the template have never been determined and clearly elucidated. Here, we disclose that silanol&#8208;induced Cs+ and Br&#8722; deficiencies prompt the generation of traps and CsPb2Br5 impurities. The temperature&#8208;dependent PL spectra verify the higher energetic barrier of trap states in CsPbBr3 NCs confined in silanol&#8208;rich mesoporous silica. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra reveal the trapped state mediates a broadband photoinduced absorption and long&#8208;lived decay pathway of CsPbBr3 NCs in silanol&#8208;rich templates. A remarkable improvement (up to 160&#8208;fold) in PL quantum yields is realized by simple silanol elimination. This work demonstrates the detrimental effects of silanol sites on the PL properties of LHP NCs impregnated in mesoporous silica and provides a new perspective for the ligand&#8208;free synthesis of high&#8208;quality LHP NCs in mesoporous templates by facile impregnation for practical applications.

         <title>Bridged Bicyclic Lactam Enables Chemically Recyclable Nylon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the ROP of bridged bicyclic lactam 5&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]octan&#8208;6&#8208;one (5/6&#8208;LM), yielding chemically recyclable nylon with high molecular weight (up to 75.7&#8197;kDa) and impressive thermostability (up to 283&#8201;&#176;C). Notably, the 5/6&#8208;LM can be scaled to 50&#8197;g per batch in the lab, with the efficient recycling of the Pd/C catalyst and methanol over 8 cycles, highlighting the process&#8216;s efficiency and promising scalability for future applications.







Abstract
Nylon, a widely&#8208;used high&#8208;performance thermoplastic, boasts exceptional durability and resistance to various solvents and weak acids, making it indispensable across diverse applications. However, its nonbiodegradable nature has led to alarming environmental pollution in land and oceans. Chemical recycling to monomers (CRM) stands as a crucial strategy for establishing a circular plastic economy, but the CRM of nylon remains largely unexplored. Herein, we introduce the bridged bicyclic lactam 5&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]octan&#8208;6&#8208;one (5/6&#8208;LM), evolved from &#948;&#8208;valerolactam and pyrrolidone, to solve the trade&#8208;off in depolymerizability and performance. Notably, 5/6&#8208;LM exhibits nearly 95&#8201;% conversion in mild polymerization conditions and efficient depolymerization catalyzed by lewis acids. This compound is synthetically accessible from commercially available chemicals in a single step at room temperature, demonstrating high efficiency and scalability up to 50&#8197;g in laboratory. Furthermore, the resulting polyamide displays remarkable attributes including high crystallinity and thermostability up to 283&#8201;&#176;C, significantly broadening the scope of chemically recyclable nylons.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Activation of Diorganyl Bis(pyridylimino) Isoindolide Aluminum(III) Complexes and Their Organometallic Radical Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the synthesis of varied bis(pyridylimino) isoindolide aluminum complexes and a detailed study of its charge&#8208;transfer induced metal&#8208;carbon bond homolysis in a transition&#8208;metal mimicking fashion as well as following reactivity studies.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis and characterization of a series of (mostly) air&#8208;stable diorganyl bis(pyridylimino) isoindolide (BPI) aluminum complexes and their chemistry upon visible&#8208;light excitation. The redox non&#8208;innocent BPI pincer ligand allows for efficient charge transfer homolytic processes of the title compounds. This makes them a universal platform for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals. The photo&#8208;induced homolytic cleavage of the Al&#8722;C bonds was investigated by means of stationary and transient UV/Vis spectroscopy, spin trapping experiments, as well as EPR and NMR spectroscopy. The experimental findings were supported by quantum chemical calculations. Reactivity studies enabled the utilization of the aluminum complexes as reactants in tin&#8208;free Giese&#8208;type reactions and carbonyl alkylations under ambient conditions, which both indicated radical&#8208;polar crossover behavior. A deeper understanding of the physical fundamentals and photochemical process was provided, furnishing in turn a new strategy to control the reactivity of bench&#8208;stable aluminum organometallics.

         <title>Enhancing Chiroptical Responses in Helical Nanographenes via Geometric Engineering of Double [7]Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended helical nanographenes (ED7Hs) have been synthesized where the two embedded [7]helicene units are fused at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; or para&#8208;position of the middle benzene ring, respectively. The obtained ED7Hs display exceptional fivefold amplification in chiroptical responses with enhanced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) brightness up to 176&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Helical nanographenes with high quantum yields and strong chiroptical responses are pivotal for developing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. Here, we present the successful synthesis of novel &#960;&#8208;extended double [7]helicenes (ED7Hs) where two helicene units are fused at the meta&#8208; or para&#8208;position of the middle benzene ring, respectively, as the structural isomers of the reported ortho&#8208;fused ED7H. The structural geometry of these ED7Hs is clearly characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Notably, this class of ED7Hs exhibits bright luminescence with high quantum yields exceeding 40&#8201;%. Through geometric regulation of two embedded [7]helicene units from ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; to para&#8208;position, these ED7Hs display exceptional amplification in chiroptical responses. This enhancement is evident in a remarkable approximate fivefold increase in the absorbance and luminescence dissymmetry factors (gabs and glum), respectively, along with a boosted CPL brightness up to 176&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, surpassing the performance of most helicene&#8208;based chiral NGs. Furthermore, DFT calculations elucidate that the geometric adjustment of two [7]helicene units allows the precise alignment of electric and magnetic transition dipole moments, leading to the observed enhancement of their chiroptical responses. This study offers an effective strategy for magnifying the CPL performance in chiral NGs, promoting their expanded application as CPL emitters.

Against the backdrop of a floating glass bottle, the novel concept of a &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; approach is visualized. This approach enables the cavity&#8208;directed synthesis of otherwise unstable polyoxometalates (POM) employing a coordination cage. The image captures the essence of innovation and sustainability, with the water and shimmering lights symbolizing the transformative potential of this novel concept in synthesizing complex molecules and facilitating green and sustainable catalysis, as demonstrated by Cui&#8208;Lian Liu, Tatjana&#8197;N. Parac&#8208;Vogt et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202401940).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Against the backdrop&lt;/b&gt; of a floating glass bottle, the novel concept of a &#8220;ship-in-a-bottle&#8221; approach is visualized. This approach enables the cavity-directed synthesis of otherwise unstable polyoxometalates (POM) employing a coordination cage. The image captures the essence of innovation and sustainability, with the water and shimmering lights symbolizing the transformative potential of this novel concept in synthesizing complex molecules and facilitating green and sustainable catalysis, as demonstrated by Cui-Lian Liu, Tatjana&#8197;N. Parac-Vogt et&#8197;al. in their Research Article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202401940"&gt;(e202401940)&lt;/a&gt;.

The chelating ligand of one of the title complexes shown on the cover picture is coordinated by three nitrogen donors (blue) to the central aluminum atom (wine&#8208;red). The latter consists of two more substituents, i.e. two phenyl rings. One of these phenyl rings is &#8220;blown&#8221; away by the wave of light coming from the right of the picture. The homolytic bond rupture event is highlighted and the phenyl ring flying away is shown in red due to its &#8220;hot&#8221;, i.e. radical nature. Details of the study are reported by Andreas&#8208;Neil Unterreiner, Frank Breher et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402885).

Lithium polysulfides (Li2Sn, n=4&#8722;8) serve as vital intermediates in Li&#8211;S batteries. However, the solvation structure of LiPSs in electrolyte remains elusive, especially regarding how LiPSs interact with other electrolyte components and form specific ion&#8722;solvent complexes. In their Research Article (e202400343), Bo&#8208;Quan Li, Qiang Zhang et&#8197;al. systematically investigate the specific solvation structure of LiPSs in electrolyte and pioneeringly find that Li salt anions are favored to enter the first solvation sheath of cationic LiPSs and form contact ion pairs, which updates the basic understanding towards the ion&#8211;solvent interaction in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Charge Transfer Dynamics in Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Heterostructures&#8212;Insights by Vibrational&#8208;Sum Frequency Generation Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intricate structures of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid heterostructures used in organic photovoltaics, DSSCs, and organic optoelectronics demand an in&#8208;depth investigation of their functional interface. This minireview offers a perspective on the application of time&#8208;resolved vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy for exploring the charge dynamics and their influence on the interfacial structure of these devices.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic heterostructures play a pivotal role in modern electronic and optoelectronic applications including photodetectors and field effect transistors, as well as in solar energy conversion such as photoelectrodes of dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells, photoelectrochemical cells, and in organic photovoltaics. To a large extent, performance of such devices is controlled by charge transfer dynamics at and across (inner) interfaces, e.g., between a wide band gap semiconductor and molecular sensitizers and/or catalysts. Hence, a detailed understanding of the structure&#8208;dynamics&#8208;function relationship of such functional interfaces is necessary to rationalize possible performance limitations of these materials and devices on a molecular level. Vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy, as an interface&#8208;sensitive spectroscopic technique, allows to obtain chemically specific information from interfaces and combines such chemical insights with ultrafast time resolution, when integrated as a spectroscopic probe into a pump&#8208;probe scheme. Thus, this minireview discusses the advantages and potential of VSFG spectroscopy for investigating interfacial charge transfer dynamics and structural changes at inner interfaces. A critical perspective of the unique spectroscopic view of otherwise inaccessible interfaces is presented, which we hope opens new opportunities for an improved understanding of function&#8208;determining processes in complex materials, and brings together communities who are devoted to designing materials and devices with spectroscopists.

         <title>Palladium (II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation with Bifunctional Ligands: From Curiosity to Industrialization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>

In 2001, our curiosity about the stereochemistry of Pd C&#8722;H metalation prompted our research into Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. Since then, we have developed many new strategies to solve the four central challenges of reactivity, site&#8208;selectivity, enantioselectivity, and practicality.







Abstract
In 2001, our curiosity to understand the stereochemistry of C&#8722;H metalation with Pd prompted our first studies in Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation (RSC Research appointment: 020 7451 2545, Grant: RG 36873, Dec. 2002). We identified four central challenges: 1.&#8197;poor reactivity of simple Pd salts with native substrates; 2.&#8197;few strategies to control site selectivity for remote C&#8722;H bonds; 3.&#8197;the lack of chiral catalysts to achieve enantioselectivity via asymmetric C&#8722;H metalation, and 4.&#8197;low practicality due to limited coupling partner scope and the use of specialized oxidants. These challenges necessitated new strategies in catalyst and reaction development. For reactivity, we developed approaches to enhance substrate&#8211;catalyst affinity together with novel bifunctional ligands which participate in and accelerate the C&#8722;H cleavage step. For site&#8208;selectivity, we introduced the concept of systematically modulating the distance and geometry between a directing template, catalyst, and substrate to selectively access remote C&#8722;H bonds. For enantioselectivity, we devised predictable stereomodels for catalyst&#8208;controlled enantioselective C&#8722;H activation based on the participation of bifunctional ligands. Finally, for practicality, we have developed varied catalytic manifolds for Pd(II) to accommodate diverse coupling partners while employing practical oxidants such as simple peroxides. These advances have culminated in numerous C&#8722;H activation reactions, setting the stage for broad industrial applications.

Chiroptical sensing of the absolute configuration, enantiomeric ratio and concentration of organic compounds has developed into a mature field with practical applications, including high&#8208;throughput asymmetric reaction screening and chromatography&#8208;free analysis of multicompound mixtures. This review covers fundamental milestones and highlights recent advances with machine learning assistance, chemometric data processing and other developments.







Abstract
The analysis of the absolute configuration, enantiomeric composition, and concentration of chiral compounds are frequently encountered tasks across the chemical and health sciences. Chiroptical sensing methods can streamline this work and allow high&#8208;throughput screening with remarkable reduction of operational time and cost. During the last few years, significant methodological advances with innovative chirality sensing systems, the use of computer&#8208;generated calibration curves, machine learning assistance, and chemometric data processing, to name a few, have emerged and are now matched with commercially available multi&#8208;well plate CD readers. These developments have reframed the chirality sensing space and provide new opportunities that are of interest to a large group of chemists. This review will discuss chirality sensing strategies and applications with representative small&#8208;molecule CD sensors. Emphasis will be given to important milestones and recent advances that accelerate chiral compound analysis by outperforming traditional methods, conquer new directions, and pioneering efforts that lie at the forefront of chiroptical high&#8208;throughput screening developments. The goal is to provide the reader with a thorough understanding of the current state and a perspective of future directions of this rapidly emerging field.

         <title>Photocatalytic Upcycling and Depolymerization of Vinyl Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As environmental concerns associated with the ultimate fate of polymers grow, researchers are exploring methods to enhance the recycling and sustainability of these ubiquitous materials. Enhanced upcycling, degradation and depolymerization strategies have recently been achieved via photocatalysis and are summarized in this Mini Review.







Abstract
Photocatalytic upcycling and depolymerization of vinyl polymers have emerged as promising strategies to combat plastic pollution and promote a circular economy. This mini review critically summarizes current developments in the upcycling and degradation of vinyl polymers including polystyrene and poly(meth)acrylates. Of these material classes, polymethacrylates possess the unique possibility to undergo a photocatalytic depolymerization back to monomer under thermodynamically favourable conditions, thus presenting significant advantages over traditional thermal strategies. Our perspective on current formidable challenges and potential future directions are also discussed.

         <title>Mechanochemical Approaches to Fundamental Studies in Soft&#8208;Matter Physics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The promise of polymer mechanochemistry to improve mechanical properties of polymers is widely recognized. This review highlights a complementary, so&#8208;far underexploited, potential of this emerging field to yield quantitative molecular insights into many complex physical problems in soft matter, of both practical and fundamental significance, including fractures of mechanically&#8208;loaded materials and dynamics of macromolecules in rapid flows.







Abstract
Stretching a segment of a polymer beyond its contour length makes its (primarily backbone) bonds more dissociatively labile, which enables polymer mechanochemistry. Integrating some backbone bonds into suitably designed molecular moieties yields mechanistically and kinetically diverse chemistry, which is becoming increasingly exploitable. Examples include, most prominently, attempts to improve mechanical properties of bulk polymers, as well as prospective applications in drug delivery and synthesis. This review aims to highlight an emerging effort to apply the concepts and experimental tools of mechanochemistry to fundamental physical questions in soft matter. A succinct summary of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;knowledge of the field, with emphasis on foundational concepts and generalizable observations, is followed by analysis of 3 recent examples of mechanochemistry yielding molecular&#8208;level details of elastomer failure, macromolecular chain dynamics in elongational flows and kinetic allostery. We conclude with reasons to assume that the highlighted approaches are generalizable to a broader range of physical problems than considered to date.

         <title>PyrAtes: Modular Organic Salts with Large Stokes Shifts for Fluo&#8208;rescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here the discovery of a powerful novel fluorophore class with an imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridinium core, termed PyrAtes. The synthesis was achieved in a single step, demonstrating a wide array of substrates with Stokes shifts as large as 240&#8197;nm, while also reaching NIR&#8722;I emissions at &#955;max up to 720&#8197;nm. These novel fluorophores were successfully applied in live cell imaging in HEK293 cells, suggesting PyrAtes as potent intracellular markers.







Abstract
The deployment of small&#8208;molecule fluorescent agents plays an ever&#8208;growing role in medicine and drug development. Herein, we complement the portfolio of powerful fluorophores, reporting the serendipitous discovery and development of a novel class with an imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridinium triflate core, which we term PyrAtes. These fluorophores are synthesized in a single step from readily available materials (&gt;60&#8197;examples) and display Stokes shifts as large as 240&#8197;nm, while also reaching NIR&#8722;I emissions at &#955;max as long as 720&#8197;nm. Computational studies allow the development of a platform for the prediction of &#955;max and &#955;Em. Furthermore, we demonstrate the compatibility of these novel fluorophores with live cell imaging in HEK293 cells, suggesting PyrAtes as potent intracellular markers.

         <title>Deprotective Functionalization: A Direct Conversion of Nms&#8208;Amides to Carboxamides Using Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a concept termed &#8220;deprotective functionalization&#8221;, which we have applied to the coupling of Nms&#8208;protected amines with carboxylic acids. Notably, this approach circumvents the need for a dedicated amine&#8208;deprotection step and obviates the use of additional reagents for carboxylate activation. The reaction was shown to be, in many cases, superior to deprotection followed by functionalization, both in terms of yield and atom economy.







Abstract
The nature of protecting group chemistry necessitates a deprotection step to restore the initially blocked functionality prior to further transformation. As this aspect of protecting group manipulation inevitably adds to the step count of any synthetic sequence, the development of methods enabling simultaneous deprotection and functionalization (&#8220;deprotective functionalization&#8221;&#8212;distinct from &#8220;deprotection followed by functionalization&#8221;) is appealing, as it has the potential to improve efficiency and streamline synthetic routes. Herein, we report a deprotective functionalization of the newly introduced Nms&#8208;amides guided by density functional theory (DFT) analysis, which exploits the inherent Nms reactivity. Mechanistic studies further substantiate and help rationalize the exquisite reactivity of Nms&#8208;amides, as other commonly used protecting groups are shown not to exhibit the same reactivity patterns. The practicality of this approach was ultimately demonstrated in selected case studies.

         <title>Mechanistic Understanding of Oxygen Activation on Bulk Au(111) Surface Using Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen activation on bulk Au(111) surface is revealed for the first time using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Activation of molecular oxygen on bulk Au(111) surface is found to occur via a water&#8208;promoted mechanism.







Abstract
Gaining mechanistic understanding of oxygen activation on metal surfaces is a topical area of research in surface science. However, direct investigation of on&#8208;surface oxidation processes at the nanoscale and the empirical validation of oxygen activation pathways remain challenging for the conventional analytical tools. In this study, we applied tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to gain mechanistic insights into oxygen activation on bulk Au(111) surface. Specifically, oxidation of 4&#8208;aminothiophenol (4&#8208;ATP) to 4&#8208;nitrothiophenol (4&#8208;NTP) on Au(111) surface was investigated using hyperspectral TERS imaging. Nanoscale TERS images revealed a markedly higher oxidation efficiency in disordered 4&#8208;ATP adlayers compared to the ordered adlayers signifying that the oxidation of 4&#8208;ATP molecules proceeds via interaction with the on&#8208;surface oxidative species. These results were further validated via direct oxidation of the 4&#8208;ATP adlayers with H2O2 solution. Finally, TERS measurements of oxidized 4&#8208;ATP adlayers in the presence of H2O18 provided the first empirical evidence for the generation of oxidative species on bulk Au(111) surface via water&#8208;mediated activation of molecular oxygen. This study expands our mechanistic understanding of oxidation chemistry on bulk Au surface by elucidating the oxygen activation pathway.

     alt="Mechanistic Understanding of Oxygen Activation on Bulk Au(111) Surface Using Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen activation on bulk Au(111) surface is revealed for the first time using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Activation of molecular oxygen on bulk Au(111) surface is found to occur via a water-promoted mechanism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaining mechanistic understanding of oxygen activation on metal surfaces is a topical area of research in surface science. However, direct investigation of on-surface oxidation processes at the nanoscale and the empirical validation of oxygen activation pathways remain challenging for the conventional analytical tools. In this study, we applied tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to gain mechanistic insights into oxygen activation on bulk Au(111) surface. Specifically, oxidation of 4-aminothiophenol (4-ATP) to 4-nitrothiophenol (4-NTP) on Au(111) surface was investigated using hyperspectral TERS imaging. Nanoscale TERS images revealed a markedly higher oxidation efficiency in disordered 4-ATP adlayers compared to the ordered adlayers signifying that the oxidation of 4-ATP molecules proceeds via interaction with the on-surface oxidative species. These results were further validated via direct oxidation of the 4-ATP adlayers with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution. Finally, TERS measurements of oxidized 4-ATP adlayers in the presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; provided the first empirical evidence for the generation of oxidative species on bulk Au(111) surface via water-mediated activation of molecular oxygen. This study expands our mechanistic understanding of oxidation chemistry on bulk Au surface by elucidating the oxygen activation pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>RNA&#8208;Templated Peptide Bond Formation Promotes L&#8208;Homochirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the RNA&#8208;peptide world, non&#8208;canonical nucleotides on complementary RNA strands can be used for RNA&#8208;templated peptide bond formation reactions. Both L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids can be loaded onto a donor RNA strand to give an equimolar mixture of products. The isomeric mixture of donor RNA strands can be coupled with an acceptor RNA strand to form the L,L&#8208;homochiral product in good yield and high diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
The world in which we live is homochiral. The ribose units that form the backbone of DNA and RNA are all D&#8208;configured and the encoded amino acids that comprise the proteins of all living species feature an all&#8208;L&#8208;configuration at the &#945;&#8208;carbon atoms. The homochirality of &#945;&#8208;amino acids is essential for folding of the peptides into well&#8208;defined and functional 3D structures and the homochirality of D&#8208;ribose is crucial for helix formation and base&#8208;pairing. The question of why nature uses only encoded L&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids is not understood. Herein, we show that an RNA&#8208;peptide world, in which peptides grow on RNAs constructed from D&#8208;ribose, leads to the self&#8208;selection of homo&#8208;L&#8208;peptides, which provides a possible explanation for the homo&#8208;D&#8208;ribose and homo&#8208;L&#8208;amino acid combination seen in nature.

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Heterocycles via Cycloisomerization of Unactivated Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, intramolecular cycloisomerization of unactivated olefins with pendant N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and C&#8208; nucleophiles is reported. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, yielding a number of different heterocycles including, but not limited to, pyrrolidines, piperidines, oxazolidinones, and lactones. Use of both a benzothiazinoquinoxaline as organophotocatalyst and a Co&#8208;salen catalyst obviates the need for stoichiometric oxidant or reductant.







Abstract
We report a general, intramolecular cycloisomerization of unactivated olefins with pendant nucleophiles. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and tolerates ethers, esters, protected amines, acetals, pyrazoles, carbamates, and arenes. It is amenable to N&#8208;, O&#8208;, as well as C&#8208;nucleophiles, yielding a number of different heterocycles including, but not limited to, pyrrolidines, piperidines, oxazolidinones, and lactones. Use of both a benzothiazinoquinoxaline as organophotocatalyst and a Co&#8208;salen catalyst obviates the need for stoichiometric oxidant or reductant. We showcase the utility of the protocol in late&#8208;stage drug diversification and synthesis of several small natural products.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Phosphine Boranes via Crystallization&#8208;Induced Dynamic Resolution of Lithiated Intermediate by Understanding the Underlying Epimerization Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the synthesis of chiral phosphine boranes in high e.r.s utilizing the inexpensive ligand (R,R)&#8208;TMCDA by crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic resolution of its &#945;&#8208;lithiated intermediate. By in&#8208;depth mechanistical studies, the as stereochemically stable known intermediate epimerizes in presence of remaining starting material rendering this method promising for other important P&#8208;stereogenic compounds.







Abstract
Described herein is the successful crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic resolution (CIDR) of an &#945;&#8208;lithiated phosphine borane utilizing the easily accessible and inexpensive ligand (R,R)&#8208;TMCDA. Starting from the essential P&#8208;prochiral building block dimethyl phenyl phosphine borane we were able to obtain phosphine boranes in yields up to 80&#8201;% and e.r. up to 98&#8201;:&#8201;2 by crystallization of the lithiated intermediate prior to the trapping reaction. NMR&#8208;based deuterium labeling experiments indicate that the epimerization in solution is based on the intermolecular proton transfer between nonlithiated phosphine borane and the corresponding lithiated intermediate, rendering the presence of the remaining starting compound in an optimized solvent mixture the main factor for successful enantioselective synthesis. Quantum chemical calculations using different model systems based on solid state structures confirm these experimental results. By gaining insights into the epimerization mechanism, essential principles for CIDR of lithiated phosphine boranes are elucidated that may be expanded to other important P&#8208;stereogenic compounds and simple chiral amines.

         <title>Radicalizing CO by Mononuclear Palladium(I)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A T&#8208;shaped palladium(I) metalloradical has been isolated and fully characterized. Upon coordination of CO, it confers a significant amount of spin density from the metal to the carbon atom. The carbon centered radical reactivity was investigated towards the homolytic S&#8722;S cleavage of a bulky disulfide.







Abstract
A mononuclear, T&#8208;shaped palladium(I) d9 metalloradical (3), stabilized by a bulky carbazole&#8208;based PNP&#8208;ligand, was obtained by reduction of palladium chloride or thermal Pd&#8722;C bond homolysis of the corresponding neopentyl complex. Pressurizing with CO gave the Pd(I) carbonyl complex, which was structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Delocalization of the unpaired electron to the carbonyl carbon was detected by EPR spectroscopy and theoretically modeled by DFT and ab initio methods. The partially reduced and radicalized CO slowly reacts with di(tert&#8208;butyl) disulfide under homolytic S&#8722;S cleavage and C&#8722;S bond formation to give the corresponding metallathioester.

         <title>Iso&#8208;E&#8208;Codelock: A Rebuilding&#8208;free Electrochemical Chip with a Customizable Decoding Probe for Real&#8208;Time and Portable Pathogen Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop an electrochemical sensing strategy (Iso&#8208;E&#8208;Codelock) and a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use multichannel instrument (BioAlex PHE&#8722;T) for portable isothermal amplification detection. Our method provides high sensitivity &amp; selectivity, signal&#8208;on response, &#8220;zero&#8221; background, one&#8208;pot operation and real&#8208;time signal collection.







Abstract
In order to realize portable pathogen diagnostics with easier quantitation, digitization and integration, we develop a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use electrochemical sensing strategy (Iso&#8208;E&#8208;Codelock) for real&#8208;time detection of isothermal nucleic acid amplification. Bridged by a branched DNA as codelock, the isothermal amplicon is transduced into increased current of an electrochemical probe, holding multiple advantages of high sensitivity, high selectivity, signal&#8208;on response, &#8220;zero&#8221; background and one&#8208;pot operation. Through a self&#8208;designed portable instrument (BioAlex PHE&#8722;T), the detection can be implemented on a multichannel microchip and output real&#8208;time amplification curves just like an expensive commercial PCR machine. The microchip is a rebuilding&#8208;free and disposable component. The branch codelock probe can be customized for different targets and designs. Such high performance and flexibility have been demonstrated utilizing four virus (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, African swine fever, FluA and FluB) genes as targets, and two branch (3&#8208;way and 4&#8208;way) DNAs as codelock probes.

         <title>Elastic Relaxor Ferroelectric by Thiol&#8208;ene Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relaxor ferroelectrics possess unique advantages, such as high electric&#8208;mechanical responsiveness and high sensitivity to changes in electric fields, which can be potentially employed as the energy storage and actuation in wearable electronics. Herein, we propose a novel approach utilizing thiol&#8208;ene click reaction to develop elastic relaxor ferroelectrics, which is under a mild condition and a compatible procedure with photolithography.







Abstract
As ferroelectrics hold significance and application prospects in wearable devices, the elastification of ferroelectrics becomes more and more important. Nevertheless, achieving elastic ferroelectrics requires stringent synthesis conditions, while the elastification of relaxor ferroelectric materials remains unexplored, presenting an untapped potential for utilization in energy storage and actuation for wearable electronics. The thiol&#8208;ene click reaction offers a mild and rapid reaction platform to prepare functional polymers. Therefore, we employed this approach to obtain an elastic relaxor ferroelectric by crosslinking an intramolecular carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds (CF=CH) polymer matrix with multiple thiol groups via a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. The resulting elastic relaxor ferroelectric demonstrates pronounced relaxor&#8208;type ferroelectric behaviour. This material exhibits low modulus, excellent resilience, and fatigue resistance, maintaining a stable ferroelectric response even under strains up to 70&#8201;%. This study introduces a straightforward and efficient approach for the construction of elastic relaxor ferroelectrics, thereby expanding the application possibilities in wearable electronics.

         <title>Boosted Second Harmonic Generation of a Chiral Hybrid Lead Halide Resonant to Charge Transfer Exciton from Metal Halide Octahedra to Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal octahedra to ligand charge transfer excitons of chiral metal halides have been demonstrated to serve as a new resonant channel with an appropriate resonant energy level to boost second&#8208;order optical nonlinearity. Ultimately, these single crystals exhibit remarkably resonant enhanced SHG signals, of one order of magnitude higher than that of urea and two orders of magnitude higher than that of KDP.







Abstract
Chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides (HOMHs) offer an ideal platform for the advancement of second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) materials owing to their inherent noncentrosymmetric structures. The enhancement of optical nonlinearity of chiral HOMHs could be achieved by matching the free exciton and/or self&#8208;trapped exciton energy levels with desired NLO frequencies. However, the current scarcity of resonance modes and low resonance ratio hamper the further improvements of NLO performance. Herein, we propose a new resonant channel of charge transfer (CT) excited states from metal halide polyhedra to organic ligand to boost the second&#8208;order optical nonlinearity of chiral HOMHs. The model lead halide (C7H10N)PbBr3 (C7H10N=1&#8208;ethylpyridinium) exhibits a drastically enhanced second harmonic generation in resonance to the deep CT exciton energy, with intensity of up to 111.0 times that of KDP and 10.9 times that of urea. The effective NLO coefficient has been determined to be as high as ~40.2&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1, balanced with a large polarization ratio and high laser damage threshold. This work highlights the contribution of organic ligands in the construction of a resonant channel for enhancing second&#8208;order NLO coefficients of metal halides, and thus provides guidelines for designing new chiral HOMHs materials for advanced nonlinear photonic applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Arylation of Anisole Derivatives via Pd/S,O&#8208;Ligand Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient directing group free C&#8722;H arylation of anisoles via Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand catalytic system is reported. This method can be applied to a wide variety of anisole derivatives and aryl iodides and is also applicable for late&#8208;stage arylation of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
Non&#8208;directed C&#8722;H arylation is one of the most efficient methods to synthesize biaryl compounds without the need of the prefuctionalization of starting materials, or the installment and removal of directing groups on the substrate. A direct C&#8722;H arylation of simple arenes as limiting reactants remains a challenge. Here we disclose a non&#8208;directed C&#8722;H arylation of anisole derivatives as limiting reagents with aryl iodides under mild reaction conditions. The arylated products are obtained in synthetically useful yields and the arylation of bioactive molecules is also demonstrated. Key to the success of this methodology is the use of a one&#8208;step synthesized S,O&#8208;ligand.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Dragocins A&#8722;C through Electrochemical Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical cyclization is leveraged to forge the central 9&#8208;membered ring in the hybrid metabolites dragocins A&#8722;C. The route features several stereocontrolled reactions to address the stereotetrad of the pyrrolidine fragment and a penultimate decarboxylative chlorination and global deprotection to furnish both dragocins B and C. Dragocin A was prepared through simple methanolysis of dragocin C.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of dragocins A&#8722;C, remarkable natural products containing an unusual C4&#8217; oxidized ribose architecture bridged by a polyhydroxylated pyrrolidine, is presented through a route featuring a number of uncommon maneuvers. Several generations towards the target molecules are presented, including the spectacular failure of a key C&#8722;H oxidation on a late&#8208;stage intermediate. The final route features rapid, stereocontrolled access to a densely functionalized pyrrolidine and an unprecedented diastereoselective oxidative electrochemical cyclization to forge the hallmark 9&#8208;membered ring. Preliminary studies suggest this electrochemical oxidation protocol is generally useful.

         <title>Catalytic Mechanism of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase: On the Detection and Stability of the Initial Carbonyloxy Radical Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical decarboxylation reaction pathway and spectral calculations of aliphatic and aromatic carbonyloxy radicals demonstrate that they have distinct electronic absorption properties and that the former are much more unstable. These findings pertain to a controversy on the mechanism of the photoenzyme fatty acid photodecarboxylase. They support the here reinforced experimental observation of intrinsic CO2 dissociation in &#8810;300&#8197;ps.







Abstract
In fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP), light&#8208;induced formation of the primary radical product RCOO&#8901; from fatty acid RCOO&#8722; occurs in 300&#8197;ps, upon which CO2 is released quasi&#8208;immediately. Based on the hypothesis that aliphatic RCOO&#8901; (spectroscopically uncharacterized because unstable) absorbs in the red similarly to aromatic carbonyloxy radicals such as 2,6&#8208;dichlorobenzoyloxy radical (DCB&#8901;), much longer&#8208;lived linear RCOO&#8901; has been suggested recently. We performed quantum chemical reaction pathway and spectral calculations. These calculations are in line with the experimental DCB&#8901; decarboxylation dynamics and spectral properties and show that in contrast to DCB&#8901;, aliphatic RCOO&#8901; radicals a) decarboxylate with a very low energetic barrier and on the timescale of a few ps and b) exhibit little red absorption. A time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy experiment confirms very rapid, &#8810;300&#8197;ps RCOO&#8901; decarboxylation in FAP. We argue that this property is required for the observed high quantum yield of hydrocarbons formation by FAP.

         <title>Dynamic&#8208;Bond&#8208;Mediated Chain Reptation Enhances Energy Dissipation of Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy dissipation of elastomers is precisely enhanced by dynamic&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated chain reptation, where the characteristic time of chain reptation is dominated by the presence of well&#8208;defined dissociation time of dynamic bonds and almost independent of their molar mass.







Abstract
Vibrations with various frequencies in daily life and industry can cause health hazards and fatigue failure of critical structures, which requires the development of elastomers with high energy dissipation at desired frequencies. Current strategies relying on tuning characteristic relaxation time of polymer chains are mostly qualitative empirical methods, and it is difficult to precisely control damping performances. Here, we report a general strategy for constructing dynamic crosslinked polymer fluid gels that provide controllable ultrahigh energy dissipation. This is realized by dynamic&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated chain reptation of polymer fluids in a crosslinked network, where the characteristic time of chain reptation is dominated by the presence of well&#8208;defined dissociation time of dynamic bonds and almost independent of their molar mass. Using prototypical supramolecular polydimethylsiloxane elastomers, we demonstrate that dynamic crosslinked polymer fluid gels exhibit a controllable ultrahigh damping performance at desired frequencies (10&#8722;2~102&#8197;Hz), exceeding that of typical state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art silicone damping materials. Their shock absorption is over 300&#8201;% higher than that of commercial silicone rubber under the same impact force.

         <title>Collective Synthesis of Highly Oxygenated (Furano)germacranolides Derived from Elephantopus mollis and Elephantopus tomentosus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The collective synthesis of six (furano)germacranolides derived from Elephantopus mollis and Elephantopus tomentosus was achieved. The assembly of the highly oxygenated ten&#8208;membered ring of molephantin and tomenphantopin F was enabled by diastereoselective Barbier allylation coupled with Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi macrocyclization. The photoinduced cycloisomerization of molephantin enabled access to four furanogermacranolides, such as tomenphantopin C.







Abstract
Germacranolides, secondary metabolites produced by plants, have garnered academic and industrial interest due to their diverse and complex topology as well as a wide array of pharmacological activities. Molephantin, a highly oxygenated germacranolide isolated from medicinal plants, Elephantopus mollis and Elephantopus tomentosus, has exhibited antitumor, inflammatory, and leishmanicidal activities. Its chemical structure is based on a highly strained ten&#8208;membered macrocyclic backbone with an (E,Z)&#8208;dienone moiety, which is fused with an &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone and adorned with four successive stereogenic centers. Herein, we report the first synthesis of molephantin in 12 steps starting from readily available building blocks. The synthesis features the highly diastereoselective intermolecular Barbier allylation of the &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde with optically active 3&#8208;bromomethyl&#8208;5H&#8208;furan&#8208;2&#8208;one intermediate and ensuing Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) macrocyclization for the construction of the highly oxygenated ten&#8208;membered macrocyclic framework. This synthetic route enabled access to another germacranolide congener, tomenphantopin F. Furthermore, cycloisomerization of molephantin into 2&#8208;deethoxy&#8208;2&#946;&#8208;hydroxyphantomolin could be facilitated by irradiation with ultraviolet A light (&#955;max=370&#8197;nm), which opened a versatile and concise access to the related furanogermacranolides such as EM&#8208;2, phantomolin, 2&#8208;O&#8208;demethyltomenphantopin C, and tomenphantopin C.

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Keto Primary Chlorides by Selective Chlorocarbonylation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;economical strategy for rapid access to &#946;&#8208;keto primary chlorides by regioselective chlorocarbonylation of alkenes was developed using dual Ni/photoredox catalysis. The transformation features broad functional group tolerance and operational simplicity. Preliminary control experiments and DFT mechanistic studies suggest the photocatalytic generation of Cl&#8901; and subsequent addition to the alkene followed by nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
Functionalized primary alkyl chlorides are precursors to a plethora of scaffolds but their access from chemical feedstocks remains challenging. Herein, we report a concise dual Ni/photoredox catalytic protocol for regioselective chlorocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes that enables rapid access to &#946;&#8208;keto primary chlorides. The catalytic process features an extensive substrate scope, scalability and functional group tolerance. The Ni/photocatalytic Cl&#8901; generation and subsequent cross&#8208;coupling is implicated for the process based on the control experiments and DFT study. The synthetic utility of the protocol has been further corroborated through functionalization of complex substrates and modifications of the product.

         <title>Photocatalytic Functionalization of Dehydroalanine&#8208;Derived Peptides in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic hydroarylation of dehydroalanine (Dha) and Dha&#8208;containing peptides with versatile arylthianthrenium salts was developed in batch and in flow, enabling expedient scale&#8208;up. The mild nature of the photocatalytic approach allowed the diversification of peptides featuring various sensitive functional groups and the effective stitching of Dha&#8208;containing peptides with a myriad of arenes and drug scaffolds.







Abstract
Unnatural amino acids, and their synthesis by the late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF) of peptides, play a crucial role in areas such as drug design and discovery. Historically, the LSF of biomolecules has predominantly utilized traditional synthetic methodologies that exploit nucleophilic residues, such as cysteine, lysine or tyrosine. Herein, we present a photocatalytic hydroarylation process targeting the electrophilic residue dehydroalanine (Dha). This residue possesses an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated moiety and can be combined with various arylthianthrenium salts, both in batch and flow reactors. Notably, the flow setup proved instrumental for efficient scale&#8208;up, paving the way for the synthesis of unnatural amino acids and peptides in substantial quantities.

&lt;p&gt;A photocatalytic hydroarylation of dehydroalanine (Dha) and Dha-containing peptides with versatile arylthianthrenium salts was developed in batch and in flow, enabling expedient scale-up. The mild nature of the photocatalytic approach allowed the diversification of peptides featuring various sensitive functional groups and the effective stitching of Dha-containing peptides with a myriad of arenes and drug scaffolds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unnatural amino acids, and their synthesis by the late-stage functionalization (LSF) of peptides, play a crucial role in areas such as drug design and discovery. Historically, the LSF of biomolecules has predominantly utilized traditional synthetic methodologies that exploit nucleophilic residues, such as cysteine, lysine or tyrosine. Herein, we present a photocatalytic hydroarylation process targeting the electrophilic residue dehydroalanine (Dha). This residue possesses an &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-unsaturated moiety and can be combined with various arylthianthrenium salts, both in batch and flow reactors. Notably, the flow setup proved instrumental for efficient scale-up, paving the way for the synthesis of unnatural amino acids and peptides in substantial quantities. Our photocatalytic approach, being inherently mild, permits the diversification of peptides even when they contain sensitive functional groups. The readily available arylthianthrenium salts facilitate the seamless integration of Dha-containing peptides with a wide range of arenes, drug blueprints, and natural products, culminating in the creation of unconventional phenylalanine derivatives. The synergistic effect of the high functional group tolerance and the modular characteristic of the aryl electrophile enables efficient peptide conjugation and ligation in both batch and flow conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Peptide Cysteine Manipulation on Demand and Difficult Protein Chemical Synthesis Enabled by Controllable Acidolysis of N,S&#8208;Benzylidene Thioacetals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 19, May 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;containing substituted N,S&#8208;benzylidene thioacetals exhibit controllable acidolysis kinetics, which can be applied to selective peptide modification and protein chemical synthesis. Detailed kinetic studies, various examples of peptide modification and the first chemical synthesis of the native PD&#8208;L1 IgV domain were included in this study.







Abstract
Although solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis combining with chemical ligation provides a way to build up customized polypeptides in general, many targets are still presenting challenges for the conventional synthetic process, such as hydrophobic proteins. New methods and strategies are still required to overcome these obstacles. In this study, kinetic studies of Cys/Pen ligation and its acidolysis were performed, from which the fast acidolysis of substituted N,S&#8208;benzylidene thioacetals (NBTs) was discovered. The study demonstrates the potential of NBTs as a promising Cys switchable protection, facilitating the chemical synthesis of peptides and proteins by efficiently disrupting peptide aggregation. The compatibility of NBTs with other commonly adopted Cys protecting groups and their applications in sequential disulfide bond formation were also investigated. The first chemical synthesis of the native human programmed death ligand 1 immunoglobulin V&#8208;like (PD&#8208;L1 IgV) domain was achieved using the NBT strategy, showcasing its potential in difficult protein synthesis.

&#8220;The most important thing I have learned from my students is how fundamental positive feedback and support are&#8230; If I could have dinner with a well&#8208;known historic figure, I would invite Rita Levi&#8208;Montalcini (1986 Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine) and I would ask her to help me design an experiment involving molecules I isolate and characterize.&#8221; Find out more about Flaviana Di Lorenzo in her Introducing&#8230; Profile.
