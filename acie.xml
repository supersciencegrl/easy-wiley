         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective C(sp3)&#8211;H Alkenylation of Thioamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H alkenylation of thioamides with but&#8208;2&#8208;ynoate ester coupling partners employing thioamide directing groups is presented. The method is operationally simple and requires only mild reaction conditions, while providing alkenylated products as single regioisomers in excellent yields (up to 85%) and high enantiomeric excess [up to 91:9 enantiomeric ratio (er), or up to &gt;99:1 er after a single recrystallization]. Diverse downstream derivatizations of the products are demonstrated, delivering a range of enantioenriched constructs. Extensive computational studies using density functional theory provide insight into the detailed reaction mechanism, origin of enantiocontrol, and the unusual regioselectivity of the alkenylation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Quadruplex Structure with a Unique Cation Dependency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA quadruplex structures provide an additional layer of regulatory control in genome maintenance and gene expression and are widely used in nanotechnology. We report the discovery of a novel tetrastranded structure formed from a native G&#8208;rich DNA sequence originating from the telomeric region of Caenorhabditis elegans. The structure is defined by multiple properties that distinguish it from all other known DNA quadruplexes. Most notably, the formation of a stable so&#8208;called KNa&#8208;quadruplex (KNaQ) requires concurrent coordination of K+ and Na+ ions at two distinct binding sites. This structure provides novel insight into G&#8208;rich DNA folding under ionic conditions relevant to eukaryotic cell physiology and the structural evolution of telomeric DNA. It highlights the differences between the structural organization of human and nematode telomeric DNA, which should be considered when using C. elegans as a model in telomere biology, particularly in drug screening applications. Additionally, the absence/presence of KNaQ motifs in the host/parasite introduces an intriguing possibility of exploiting the KNaQ fold as a plausible antiparasitic drug target. The structure's unique shape and ion dependency and the possibility of controlling its folding by using low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight ligands can be exploited for the design or discovery of novel recognition DNA elements and sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Low&#8208;temperature Hydrogen Production by Electrochemical&#8208;assisted Methanol Steam Reforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methanol steam reforming (MSR) provides an alternative way for efficient production and safe&#160;transportation&#160;of hydrogen but requires harsh conditions and complicated purification processes. In this work, an efficient electrochemical&#8208;assisted&#160;MSR reaction for pure H2 production at lower temperature (~140 &#176;C) is&#160;developed by coupling the electrocatalysis reaction into the MSR in a polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis reactor. By electrochemically assisted, the two critical steps including the methanol dehydrogenation&#160;and water&#8208;gas shift reaction&#160;are&#160;accelerated,&#160;which is attributed to decreasing the methanol dehydrogenation energy and promoting the dissociation of H2O to OH* by&#160;the applied potential. Furthermore,&#160;the reduced H2&#160;partial pressure by the hydrogen oxidation and reduction process further promotes MSR. The combination of these&#160;advantages not only&#160;efficiently&#160;decreases&#160;the MSR temperature but also achieves the high rate of hydrogen production of 505 mmol H2&#160;g Pt&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1&#160;with exceptionally high H2&#160;selectivity (99%) at 180 &#176;C and a low voltage (0.4 V), and the productivity is about 30&#8208;fold&#160;than that of traditional MSR. This study opens up a new avenue to design novel electrolysis cells for hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Ground&#8208;State Orbital Descriptors for Accelerated Development of Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are in high demand for optoelectronics and bioelectronics. Developing RTP materials highly relies on expert experience and costly excited&#8208;state calculations. It is a challenge to find a tool for effectively screening RTP materials.   Herein we first establish ground&#8208;state orbital descriptors (&#960;FMOs) derived from the &#960;&#8208;electron component of the frontier molecular orbitals to characterize the RTP lifetime (tp), achieving a  balance in screening efficiency and accuracy. Using the &#960;FMOs, a data&#8208;driven machine learning model gains a high accuracy in classifying long tp, filtering out 836 candidates with long&#8208;lived RTP from a virtual library of 19,295 molecules. With the aid of the excited&#8208;state calculations, 287 compounds are predicted with high RTP efficiency. Impressively, experiments further confirm the reliability of this workflow, opening a novel avenue for designing high&#8208;performance RTP materials for potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Orbital Engineering Mediated by Cation Conjugation in Luminescent Uranyl&#8208;Organic Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of compounds of the form [HAr]2[UO2X4] is reported here, wherein Ar is systematically varied between pyridine (1&#8208;X), quinoline (2&#8208;X), acridine (3&#8208;X), 2,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazine (4&#8208;X), quinoxaline (5&#8208;X), and phenazine (6&#8208;X), and X = Cl or Br. With greater conjugation in the organic cation, a larger quenching in uranyl luminescence is observed in the solid state. Supporting our luminescence experiments with computation, we map out the potential energy diagrams for the singlet and triplet states of both the [HAr]+ cations and [UO2Cl4]2&#8722; anion in the crystalline state, and of the assembly. The distinct energy transfer pathways in each compound are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Synergistic Effect of Cu&#8208;In Dual Sites Confined on the Edge of Monolayer CuInP 2 S 6 &#160;toward Selective Photoreduction of CO 2 &#160;into Multi&#8208;Carbon Solar Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;unit&#8208;cell, single&#8208;crystal, hexagonal CuInP2S6&#160;atomically thin sheets of ~ 0.81 nm in thickness was successfully synthesized for photocatalytic reduction of CO2. Exciting ethene (C2H4) as the main product was dominantly generated with the yield&#8208;based selectivity reaching ~56.4%, and the electron&#8208;based selectivity as high as ~74.6%. The tandem synergistic effect of charge&#8208;enriched Cu&#8211;In dual sites confined on the lateral edge of the CuInP2S6 monolayer (ML) is mainly responsible for efficient conversion and high selectivity of the C2H4&#160;product as the basal surface site of the ML, exposing S atoms, can not derive the CO2&#160;photoreduction due to the high energy barrier for the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer of CO2&#160;into *COOH. The marginal In site of the ML preeminently targets CO2&#160;conversion to *CO under light illumination, and the *CO then migrates to the neighbor Cu sites for the subsequent C&#8208;C coupling reaction into C2H4&#160;with thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility. Moreover, ultrathin structure of the ML also allows to shorten the transfer distance of charge carriers from the interior onto the surface, thus inhibiting electron&#8208;hole recombination and enabling more electrons to survive and accumulate on the exposed active sites for CO2&#160;reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Intelligent DNA nanoreactor&#160;for&#160;in vivo&#160;easy&#8208;to&#8208;read tumor imaging&#160;and precise therapy</title>

         <dc:description>Nanomaterial&#8208;based&#160;in vivo&#160;tumor imaging&#160;and therapy have attracted extensive attention, however,&#160;they suffer from the unintelligent &#8220;always ON&#8221; or single&#8208;parameter responsive signal output, substantial&#160;off&#8208;target effects,&#160;and&#160;high&#160;cost.&#160;Therefore, achieving in vivo&#160;easy&#8208;to&#8208;read tumor imaging and&#160;precise therapy&#160;in a multi&#8208;parameter responsive and intelligent manner remains challenging. Herein, an intelligent DNA nanoreactor (iDNR) was constructed&#160;following the&#160;&#8220;AND&#8221; Boolean logic algorithm to address these issues. iDNR&#8208;mediated in situ&#160;deposition of photothermal substance polydopamine (PDA) can only be satisfied in tumor tissues with abundant membrane protein biomarkers &#8220;AND&#8221; hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Therefore, intelligent temperature&#8208;based in vivo&#160;easy&#8208;to&#8208;read tumor imaging is realized&#160;without expensive instrumentation, and&#160;its diagnostic performance matches with&#160;that of flow cytometry, and&#160;photoacoustic imaging. Moreover, precise photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumors could be achieved via&#160;intelligent heating of tumor tissues.&#160;The precise PTT&#160;of primary tumors in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy suppresses&#160;the growth of distant tumors and inhibits&#160;tumor recurrence. Therefore,&#160;highly programmable iDNR is&#160;a powerful tool for intelligent&#160;biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Complete Biochemical Characterization of Pantaphos Biosynthesis Highlights an Unusual Role for a SAM&#8208;Dependent Methyltransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pantaphos is small molecule virulence factor made by the plant pathogen Pantoea ananatis. An eleven gene operon, designated hvr for high virulence, is required for production of this phosphonic acid natural product, but the metabolic steps used in its production have yet to be established. Here, we determine the complete biosynthetic pathway using a combination of bioinformatics, in vitro biochemistry and in vivo heterologous expression. Only six of the eleven hvr genes are needed to produce pantaphos, while a seventh is likely to be required for export. Surprisingly, the pathway involves a series of O&#8208;methylated intermediates, which are then hydrolyzed to produce the final product. The methylated intermediates are produced by an irreversible S&#8208;adenosylmethione (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyltransferase that is required to drive a thermodynamically unfavorable dehydration in the preceding step, a function not previously attributed to members of this enzyme class. Methylation of pantaphos by the same enzyme is also likely to limit its toxicity in the producing organism. The pathway also involves a novel flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase that differs from homologous proteins due to its endogenous flavin&#8208;reductase activity. Heterologous production of pantaphos by Escherichia coli strains expressing the minimal gene set strongly supports the in vitro biochemical data.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;domain Chirality Transfer in Self&#8208;Assembly of Chiral Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality transfer is essential to acquire helical hierarchical superstructures from the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular materials. By taking advantage of chirality transfers at different length scales through intra&#8208;chain and inter&#8208;chain chiral interactions, helical phase (H*) can be formed from the self&#8208;assembly of chiral block copolymers (BCPs*). In this study, chiral triblock terpolymers, polystyrene&#8208;b&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;lactide) (PS&#8208;PEO&#8208;PLLA), and polystyrene&#8208;b&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;lactide) (PS&#8208;P4VP&#8208;PLLA) are synthesized for self&#8208;assembly. For PS&#8208;PEO&#8208;PLLA with an achiral PEO mid&#8208;block that is compatible with PLLA (chiral end&#8208;block), H* can be formed while the block length is below a critical value. By contrast, for the one with achiral P4VP mid&#8208;block that is incompatible with PLLA, the formation of H* phase would be suppressed regardless of the length of the mid&#8208;block, giving cylinder phase. Those results elucidate a new type of chirality transfer across the phase domain that is referred as cross&#8208;domain chirality transfer, providing complementary understanding of the chirality transfer at the interface of phase&#8208;separated domains.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Two&#8208;dimentional Layered Composite Carbosilicates from in situ Unzipped Carbon Nanotubes and Exfoliated Bulk Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A key task in today&#8217;s inorganic synthetic chemistry is to develop effective reactions, routes, and associated techniques aiming to create new functional materials with specifically desired multilevel structures and properties. Herein, we report an ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional layered composite of graphene ribbon and silicate via a simple and scalable one&#8208;pot reaction, which leads to the creation of a novel carbon&#8208;metal&#8208;silicate hybrid family: carbosilicate. The graphene ribbon is in&#8208;situ formed by unzipping carbon nanotubes, while the ultrathin silicate is in&#8208;situ obtained from bulk silica or commercial glass; transition metals (Fe or Ni) oxidized by water act as bridging agent, covalently bonding the two structures. The unprecedented structure combines the superior properties of the silicate and the nanocarbon, which triggers some specific novel properties. All processes during synthesis are complementary to each other. The associated synergistic chemistry could stimulate the discovery of a large class of more interesting, functionalized structures and materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Radiochemistry with Fluorine&#8208;18, Carbon&#8208;11 and Zirconium&#8208;89</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review discusses recent advances in light&#8208;driven radiochemistry for three key isotopes: fluorine&#8208;18, carbon&#8208;11, and zirconium&#8208;89, and their applications in positron emission tomography (PET). In the case of fluorine&#8208;18, the predominant approach involves the use of cyclotron&#8208;produced [18F]fluoride or reagents derived thereof. Light serves to activate either the substrate or the fluorine&#8208;18 labeled reagent. Advancements in carbon&#8208;11 photomediated radiochemistry have been leveraged for the radiolabeling of small molecules, achieving various transformations, including 11C&#8208;methylation, 11C&#8208;carboxylation, 11C&#8208;carbonylation, and 11C&#8208;cyanation. Contrastingly, zirconium&#8208;89 photomediated radiochemistry differs from fluorine&#8208;18 and carbon&#8208;11 approaches. In these cases, light facilitates a postlabeling click reaction, which has proven valuable for the labeling of large biomolecules such as monoclonal antibodies. New technological developments, such as the incorporation of photoreactors in commercial radiosynthesizers, illustrate the commitment the field is making in embracing photochemistry. Taken together, these advances in photomediated radiochemistry enable radiochemists to apply new retrosynthetic strategies in accessing novel PET radiotracers.</dc:description>

         <title>Bridging Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis: Phosphine&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphine&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (P&#8208;MOFs) as an emerging class of coordination polymers, have provided novel opportunities for the development of heterogeneous catalysts. Yet, compared with the ubiquitous phosphine systems in homogeneous catalysis, heterogenization of phosphines in MOFs is still at its early stage. In this Minireview, we summarize the synthetic strategies, characterization and catalytic reactions based on the P&#8208;MOFs reported in literature. In particular, various catalytic reactions are discussed in detail in terms of phosphine ligand structure&#8208;function relationship, including the potential obstacles for future development. Finally, we discuss the possible solutions, including new types of reactions and techniques as the perspectives for the development of P&#8208;MOF catalysts, highlighting the opportunities and challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of NH&#8208; Group Adjacent to Naked Silicon(II) Atom in Base Stabilized Aminosilylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aminosilylene, comprising reactive NH&#8211; and Si(II) sites next to each other, is an intriguing class of compounds due to its ability to show diverse reactivity. However, stabilizing the reactive NH&#8211; group next to the free Si(II) atom is challenging and has not yet been achieved. Herein, we report the first examples of base stabilized free aminosilylenes Ar*NHSi(PhC(NtBu)2) (1a) and Mes*NHSi(PhC(NtBu)2) (1b) (Ar* = 2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl and Mes* = 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl), tolerating a NH&#8211; group next to the naked Si(II) atom. Remarkably, 1a and 1b exhibited interesting differences in their reactivity upon heating. With 1a, an intramolecular C(sp3)&#8211;H activation of one of the benzhydryl methine hydrogen atoms to the Si(II) atom produced the five&#8208;membered cyclic silazane 2. However, with 1b, a rare 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift to the Si(II) atom afforded a silanimine 3, with a hydride ligand attached to an unsaturated silicon atom. Further, the coordination capabilities of 1a were also tested with Ru(II) and Fe(0) precursors. Treatments of 1a with [Ru(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2 led to the isolation of a &#951;6&#8208;arene tethered complex [RuCl2{Ar*NHSi(PhC(tBuN)2)&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;Si&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene}] (4), whereas with the Fe(CO)5 precursor a Fe(0) complex [Fe(CO)4{Ar*NHSi(PhC(tBuN)2)&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;Si}] (5) was obtained. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to shed light on the structural, bonding, and energetic aspects in 1&#8208;5.</dc:description>

         <title>Craig&#8208;H&#252;ckel Hybrid Aromatic Metalla&#8208;dehydro[11]annulenes Constructed by a Formal [10+1] Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic metalla&#8208;annulenes are important aromatic compounds, research into which has been mainly concentrated on metal&#8208;benzenes and their lower homologues. Reports on their superior homologs are rare, and this has greatly limited the systematic study of their properties. In this work, a series of osma&#8208;dehydro[11]annulenes with good air and thermal stability were prepared in high yields through a simple [10+1] strategy, by incorporating a metal fragment into conjugated ten&#8208;carbon chains in a one&#8208;pot reaction. They are the first monometallic aromatic metalla&#8208;[n]annulenes with the ring size larger than 6, and their Craig&#8208;H&#252;ckel hybrid aromaticity is supported by various physical and computational parameters. Besides, these complexes show versatile reactivities, not only giving further evidence for their aromaticity, but also demonstrating their physical and chemical properties can easily be regulated. This work enriches the metalla&#8208;aromatic chemistry, and provides a new avenue for the synthesis of large metalla&#8208;annulenes with different ring sizes.</dc:description>

         <title>Wingtip&#8208;Flexible N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Unsymmetrical Connection between IMes and IPr</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>IMes (IMes = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and IPr (IPr = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) represent by far the most frequently used N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands in homogenous catalysis, however, despite numerous advantages, these ligands are limited by the lack of steric flexibility of catalytic pockets. We report a new class of unique unsymmetrical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands that are characterized by freely&#8208;rotatable N&#8208;aromatic wingtips in the imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene architecture. The combination of rotatable N&#8211;CH2Ar bond with conformationally&#8208;fixed N&#8211;Ar linkage results in a highly modular ligand topology, entering the range of geometries inaccessible to IMes and IPr. These ligands are highly reactive in Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;hydroboration of alkynes, an archetypal borylcupration process that has had a transformative impact on the synthesis of boron&#8208;containing compounds. The most reactive Cu(I)&#8211;NHC in this class has been commercialized in collaboration with MilliporeSigma to enable broad access of the synthetic chemistry community. The ligands gradually cover %Vbur geometries ranging from 37.3% to 52.7%, with the latter representing the largest %Vbur described to date for an IPr analogue, while retaining full flexibility of N&#8208;wingtip. Considering the modular access to novel geometrical space in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis, we anticipate that this concept will enable new opportunities in organic synthesis, drug discovery and stabilization of reactive metal centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Crucial Photosensitizing Factors to Promote CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitizing ability of catalytic system was closely related to the visible&#8208;light absorption ability, excited&#8208;state lifetime, redox potential, and electron transfer rate of photosensitizers (PSs), however it remains a great challenge to concurrently mediate these factors to boost CO2 photoreduction. Herein, a series of Ir(III)&#8208;based PSs (Ir&#8208;1 &#8211; Ir&#8208;6) were prepared as molecular platforms to understand the interplay of these factors and identify the primary factors for efficient CO2 photoreduction. Among them, less efficient visible&#8208;light absorption capacity results in lower CO yields of Ir&#8208;1, Ir&#8208;2, or Ir&#8208;4&#8208;. Ir&#8208;3 shows most efficient photocatalytic activity among these mononuclear PSs due to some comprehensive parameters. Although the Kobs of Ir&#8208;3 is ~10 times higher than that of Ir&#8208;5, the CO yield of Ir&#8208;3 is slightly higher that that of Ir&#8208;5 due to the compensation of its strong visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing ability. Ir&#8208;6 exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance due to its strongest visible&#8208;light absorption ability, comparable thermodynamic driving force, and electron transfer rate among these PSs. Remarkably, the CO2 photoreduction to CO with Ir&#8208;6 can achieve 91.5 &#956;mol, over 54 times higher than Ir&#8208;1, and the TONC&#8208;1 was optimized to 28160. Various photophysical properties of the PSs were concurrently adjusted by fine ligand modification to promote CO2 photoreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Trapping of a Polyketide Synthase Module After C&#8208;C Bond Formation Reveals Transient Acyl Carrier Domain Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are giant assembly lines producing an impressive range of biologically active compounds. However, our understanding of the structural dynamics of these megasynthases, specifically the delivery of acyl carrier protein (ACP)&#8208;bound building blocks to the catalytic site of the ketosynthase (KS) domain, remains severely limited. Using a multipronged structural approach, we report details of the inter&#8208;domain interactions after C&#8208;C bond formation in a chain&#8208;branching module of the rhizoxin PKS. Mechanism&#8208;based crosslinking of an engineered module was achieved using a synthetic surrogate that serves as a Michael acceptor. The crosslinked protein allowed to identify an asymmetric state of the dimeric protein complex upon C&#8208;C bond formation by cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM). The possible existence of two ACP binding sites, one of them a potential &#8220;parking position&#8221; for substrate loading, was also indicated by AlphaFold2 predictions. NMR spectroscopy showed that a transient complex is formed in solution independent of the linker domains, and photochemical crosslinking/mass spectrometry on the standalone domains allowed to pinpoint the interdomain interaction sites. The structural insights into a branching PKS module arrested after C&#8208;C bond formation allow a better understanding of domain dynamics and provide valuable information for the rational design of modular assembly lines.</dc:description>

         <title>A Catalytic Method to Activate Nitromethane by the Cooperation of Homo&#8208; and Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The achievement of directly activating and utilizing bulk small molecules has remained a longstanding objective in the field of chemical synthesis. The present work reports a catalytic activation method for bulk chemical nitromethane (MeNO2). This method combines homogeneous Lewis acid with recyclable heterogeneous Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis, featuring practicality, sustainability, and low cost, thus solving the inherent drawbacks of previous Nef processes where stoichiometric reductants or activators were required. By combining the advantages of both homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;geneous catalysts, this chemistry may not only offer new opportunities for the further development of MeNO2 as a nitrogen source for organic synthesis, but also promote the catalysis design in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Ion&#8208;Induced Large Fragment Deactivation: A Different Strategy for Site&#8208;Selectivity in a Complex Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex natural product functionalizations generally involve the use of highly engineered reagents, catalysts, or enzymes to achieve site&#8208;selectivity by lowering a selected transition state energy. We invert this strategy by raising the energy of transition states representing undesirable sites through metal ion chelation, leaving desirable ones accessible to functionalization by a potentially wide variety of electrophilic synthetic methods.







Abstract
Complex natural product functionalizations generally involve the use of highly engineered reagents, catalysts, or enzymes to react exclusively at a desired site through lowering of a select transition state energy. In this communication, we report a new, complementary strategy in which all transition states representing undesirable sites in a complex ionophore substrate are simultaneously energetically increased through the chelation of a metal ion to the large fragment we wish to neutralize. In the case of an electrophilic, radical based fluorination reaction, charge repulsion (electric field effects), induced steric effects, and electron withdrawal provide the necessary deactivation and proof of principle to afford a highly desirable natural product derivative. We envisage that many other electrophilic or charge based synthetic methods may be amenable to this approach as well.

         <title>Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to HCOOH and CO by a Phosphine&#8208;Bipyridine&#8208;Phosphine Ir(III) Catalyst: Photophysics, Nonadiabatic Effects, Mechanism, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly accurate multi&#8208;reference calculations reveal the photophysical processes of a PNNP&#8208;type iridium catalyst, namely [Ir(III)H]+, and its subsequent reduction reactions to either HCOOH or CO. The present results depict the efficient reaction scenario, explain the origin of the HCOOH selectivity, and contribute to design new photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is one of the best solutions to solve the global energy crisis and to realize carbon neutralization. The tetradentate phosphine&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;phosphine (PNNP)&#8208;type Ir(III) photocatalyst, Mes&#8208;IrPCY2, was reported with a high HCOOH selectivity but the photocatalytic mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we employ electronic structure methods in combination with radiative, nonradiative, and electron transfer rate calculations, to explore the entire photocatalytic cycle to either HCOOH or CO, based on which a new mechanistic scenario is proposed. The catalytic reduction reaction starts from the generation of the precursor metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) state. Subsequently, the divergence happens from the 3MLCT state, the single electron transfer (SET) and deprotonation process lead to the formation of one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced species and Ir(I) species, which initiate the reduction reaction to HCOOH and CO, respectively. Interestingly, the efficient occurrence of proton or electron transfer reduces barriers of critical steps. In addition, nonadiabatic transitions play a nonnegligible role in the cycle. We suggest a lower free&#8208;energy barrier in the reaction&#8208;limiting step and the very efficient SET in 3MLCT are cooperatively responsible for a high HCOOH selectivity. The gained mechanistic insights could help chemists to understand, regulate, and design photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction of similar function&#8208;integrated molecular photocatalyst.

         <title>Dynamic Monkey Bar Mechanism of Superionic Li&#8208;ion Transport in LiTaCl6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning force field molecular dynamics simulations reveal the superionic Li+ transport in glassy LiTaCl6 via the dynamic monkey bar mechanism&#8211;the high density and dynamics of the vibrating Cl&#8722; ions (the dynamic bars) allow Li ions to hold on to them while moving fast through the lattice.







Abstract
The LiTaCl6 solid electrolyte has the lowest activation energy of ionic conduction at ambient conditions (0.165&#8197;eV), with a record high ionic conductivity for a ternary compound (11&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). However, the mechanism has been unclear. We train machine&#8208;learning force fields (MLFF) on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) data on&#8208;the&#8208;fly and perform MLFF MD simulations of AIMD quality up to the nanosecond scale at the experimental temperatures, which allows us to predict accurate activation energy for Li&#8208;ion diffusion (at 0.164&#8197;eV). Detailed analyses of trajectories and vibrational density of states show that the large&#8208;amplitude vibrations of Cl&#8722; ions in TaCl6&#8722; enable the fast Li&#8208;ion transport by allowing dynamic breaking and reforming of Li&#8722;Cl bonds across the space in between the TaCl6&#8722; octahedra. We term this process the dynamic&#8208;monkey&#8208;bar mechanism of superionic Li+ transport which could aid the development of new solid electrolytes for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Origin of Stability and Activity Enhancements in Pt&#8208;based Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalysts via Defect&#8208;Mediated Dopant Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhanced activity and stability of surface&#8208;doped Pt alloy catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is linked to the formation of stable transition metal oxy(hydroxy) structures. Here, an atomic&#8208;scale description for group VI transition metal oxide&#8208;doped Pt metals is developed, and a link between structure and reactivity is established. Mo and Ir are identified as doping elements that stabilize Pt edge sites and enhance ORR activity.







Abstract
Platinum alloys are highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic conditions. However, these alloys are susceptible to metal loss through leaching and degradation, leading to reduced catalyst stability and activity. Recently, it has been shown that doping with oxophilic elements can significantly alleviate these problems, with a prominent example being Mo&#8208;doped Pt alloys. Here, to achieve atomic scale understanding of the exceptional activity and stability of these alloys, we present a detailed density functional theory description of the dopants&#8217; structures and impact on electrocatalyst properties. Beginning with the Mo/Pt system, we demonstrate that Mo can be stabilized in the form of low&#8208;dimensional oxyhydroxide moieties on Pt defects. The resulting structures enhance stability and activity via distinct physical processes, with the Mo moieties both directly inhibiting Pt dissolution at defects and indirectly enhancing ORR activity by generation of strain fields on surrounding Pt terraces. We then generalize these analyses to other metal dopant elements, and we demonstrate that similar low&#8208;dimensional oxyhydroxide structures control the electrocatalytic properties through an intricate interplay of the structures&#8217; acid stability, intrinsic activity for the ORR, and ability to induce ORR&#8208;promoting strain fields on Pt.

         <title>Carbonyl Olefin Metathesis and Dehydrogenative Cyclization of Aromatic Ketones and gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reaction of readily available aromatic ketones and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes under oxidant&#8208;free, acid&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free conditions for the synthesis of phenanthrenes. Carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis and dehydrogenative cyclization proceed in a one&#8208;pot reaction. The reactions show broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The beauty of one&#8208;pot cascade reaction lies in the efficient disconnection and construction of several bonds in a single reaction flask, without the isolation of any intermediates. Herein, we report the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reactions of readily available aromatic ketones and aromatic gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of phenanthrenes which possess potential utility in drug design and materials science. The reaction combines carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis (cascade photoinduced [2+2] cyclization and thermally controlled retro [2+2] cyclization) and dehydrogenative cyclization (cascade photoinduced conrotatory 6&#960; electrocyclization and collidine&#8208;promoted dehydrogenative aromatization) together in one pot. The oxidant&#8208;free, acid&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free reaction shows broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of one-pot cascade reaction lies in the efficient disconnection and construction of several bonds in a single reaction flask, without the isolation of any intermediates. Herein, we report the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reactions of readily available aromatic ketones and aromatic &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of phenanthrenes which possess potential utility in drug design and materials science. The reaction combines carbonyl-olefin metathesis (cascade photoinduced [2+2] cyclization and thermally controlled retro [2+2] cyclization) and dehydrogenative cyclization (cascade photoinduced conrotatory 6&#960; electrocyclization and collidine-promoted dehydrogenative aromatization) together in one pot. The oxidant-free, acid-free and metal-free reaction shows broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning CH Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Based Receptors toward Picomolar Anion Affinity via the Inductive Effect of Distant Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh binding affinity of bambusuril receptors toward halides is achieved and continuously increases with increasing electron&#8208;withdrawing power of groups installed on its benzyl substituents, as measured by 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Inspired by nature, artificial hydrogen bond&#8208;based anion receptors have been developed to achieve high anion selectivity; however, their binding affinity is usually low. The potency of these receptors is usually increased by the introduction of aryl substituents, which withdraw electrons from their binding site through the resonance effect. Here, we show that the polarization of the C(sp3)&#8208;H binding site of bambusuril receptors, and thus their potency to bind anions, can be modulated by the inductive effect. The presence of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on benzyl substituents of bambusurils significantly increases their binding affinities to halides, resulting in the strongest iodide receptor reported to date with an association constant greater than 1013&#8197;M&#8722;1 in acetonitrile. A Hammett plot showed that while the bambusuril affinity toward halides linearly increases with the electron&#8208;withdrawing power of their substituents, their binding selectivity remains essentially unchanged.

         <title>Revisiting the Paradigm of Reaction Optimization in Flow with a Priori Computational Reaction Intelligence</title>

         <dc:description>
To flow or not to flow ? Assessing feasibility and guiding chemists with a priori computational intelligence for reaction optimization under continuous flow conditions.







Abstract
The use of micro/meso&#8208;fluidic reactors has resulted in both new scenarios for chemistry and new requirements for chemists. Through flow chemistry, large&#8208;scale reactions can be performed in drastically reduced reactor sizes and reaction times. This obvious advantage comes with the concomitant challenge of re&#8208;designing long&#8208;established batch processes to fit these new conditions. The reliance on experimental trial&#8208;and&#8208;error to perform this translation frequently makes flow chemistry unaffordable, thwarting initial aspirations to revolutionize chemistry. By combining computational chemistry and machine learning, we have developed a model that provides predictive power tailored specifically to flow reactions. We show its applications to translate batch to flow, to provide mechanistic insight, to contribute reagent descriptors, and to synthesize a library of novel compounds in excellent yields after executing a single set of conditions.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Ring Pyrrole&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Organic RTP Material for Persistent Afterglow Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) nano&#8208;probes with long emission wavelength faces challenges. In this work, organic RTP materials with near&#8208;infrared emission have been designed and cell membrane encapsulation has been used to optimize the nanomaterial process, achieving high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and imaging penetration depth.







Abstract
Organic near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials offer remarkable advantages in bioimaging due to their characteristic time scales and background noise elimination. However, developing near&#8208;infrared RTP materials for deep tissue imaging still faces challenges since the small band gap may increase the non&#8208;radiative decay, resulting in weak emission and short phosphorescence lifetime. In this study, fused&#8208;ring pyrrole&#8208;based structures were employed as the guest molecules for the construction of long wavelength emissive RTP materials. Compared to the decrease of the singlet energy level, the triplet energy level showed a more effectively decrease with the increase of the conjugation of the substituent groups. Moreover, the sufficient conjugation of fused ring structures in the guest molecule suppresses the non&#8208;radiative decay of triplet excitons. Therefore, a near&#8208;infrared RTP material (764&#8197;nm) was achieved for deep penetration bioimaging. Tumor cell membrane is used to coat RTP nanoparticles (NPs) to avoid decreasing the RTP performance compared to traditional coating by amphiphilic surfactants. RTP NPs with tumor&#8208;targeting properties show favorable phosphorescent properties, superior stability, and excellent biocompatibility. These NPs are applied for time&#8208;resolved luminescence imaging to eliminate background interference with excellent tissue penetration. This study provides a practical solution to prepare long&#8208;wavelength and long&#8208;lifetime organic RTP materials and their applications in bioimaging.

         <title>Unraveling Dynamic Helicity Inversion and Chirality Transfer through the Synthesis of Discrete Azobenzene Oligomers by an Iterative Exponential Growth Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete azooligomers and their corresponding assemblies were synthesized by an iterative exponential growth strategy involving dynamic helicity inversion and chirality transfer. The interconversion of H&#8208;aggregates and J&#8208;aggregates in discrete azooligomer assemblies results in different helicity reversals and morphological transitions.







Abstract
Unraveling the chirality transfer mechanism of polymer assemblies and controlling their handedness is beneficial for exploring the origin of hierarchical chirality and developing smart materials with desired chiroptical activities. However, polydisperse polymers often lead to an ambiguous or statistical evaluation of the structure&#8211;property relationship, and it remains unclear how the iterative number of repeating units function in the helicity inversion of polymer assemblies. Herein, we report the macroscopic helicity and dynamic manipulation of the chiroptical activity of supramolecular assemblies from discrete azobenzene&#8208;containing oligomers (azooligomers), together with the helicity inversion and morphological transition achieved solely by changing the iterative chain lengths. The corresponding assemblies also differ from their polydisperse counterparts in terms of thermodynamic properties, chiroptical activities, and morphological control.

         <title>Chemical Engineering of Artificial Transcription Factors by Orthogonal Palladium(II)&#8208;Mediated S&#8208;Arylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orthogonal palladium(II) strategy is reported for the site&#8208;selective editing of multiple cysteine residues in peptides and proteins. The power of this approach was demonstrated by the preparation of complex and uniquely modified proteins. The reported palladium(II) chemistry enables rapid and controlled protein editing, opening new avenues to engineer novel biomolecules for fundamental research and therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective functionalization strategies are in high demand to prepare well&#8208;defined homogeneous proteins for basic research and biomedical applications. In this regard, cysteine&#8208;based reactions have enabled a broad set of transformations to produce modified proteins for various applications. However, these approaches were mainly employed to modify a single reactive site with a specific transformation. Achieving site selectivity or multiple transformations, essential for preparing complex biomolecules, remains challenging. Herein we demonstrate the power of combining palladium(II)&#8208;mediated C&#8722;S bond formation and C&#8722;S bond cleavage reactions to selectively edit desired cysteine sites in complex and uniquely modified proteins. We developed an orthogonal palladium(II) strategy for rapid and effective diversification of multiple cysteine sites (3&#8211;6 residues) with various transformations. Importantly, we employed our approach to prepare 10 complex analogues, including modified, stapled, and multimeric proteins on a milligram scale. Furthermore, we also synthesized a focused library of stabilized artificial transcription factors that displayed enhanced stability and potent DNA binding activity. Our approach enables rapid and effective protein editing and opens new avenues to engineer new biomolecules for fundamental research and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Versatile Neuromorphic Modulation and Biosensing based on N&#8208;type Small&#8208;molecule Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors</title>

         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;molecule n&#8208;type semiconductor&#8208;based organic electrochemical neuronal synapse (OENS) enables superior synapse characteristics in a single device with an unprecedented combination of facile fabrication, excellent ambient stability, and robust and flexible tunability. The OENS was used as a biosensor to detect dopamine at sub&#8208;micromolar level in aqueous electrolyte.







Abstract
The ion/chemical&#8208;based modulation feature of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) are critical to advancing next generation bio&#8208;integrated neuromorphic hardware. Despite achievements with polymeric OMIECs in organic electrochemical neuronal synapse (OENS). However, small molecule OMIECs based OENS has not yet been realized. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate an effective materials design concept of combining n&#8208;type fused all&#8208;acceptor small molecule OMIECs with subtle side chain optimization that enables robustly and flexibly modulating versatile synaptic behavior and sensing neurotransmitter in solid or aqueous electrolyte, operating in accumulation modes. By judicious tuning the ending side chains, the linear oligoether and butyl chain derivative gNR&#8208;Bu exhibits higher recognition accuracy for a model artificial neural network (ANN) simulation, higher steady conductance states and more outstanding ambient stability, which is superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art n&#8208;type OMIECs based OENS. These superior artificial synapse characteristics of gNR&#8208;Bu can be attributed to its higher crystallinity with stronger ion bonding capacities. More impressively, we unprecedentedly realized n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule OMIECs based OENS as a neuromorphic biosensor enabling to respond synaptic communication signals of dopamine even at sub&#8208;&#956;M level in aqueous electrolyte. This work may open a new path of small&#8208;molecule ion&#8208;electron conductors for next&#8208;generation ANN and bioelectronics.

         <title>meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Aniline Derivatives via Palladium/ S,O&#8208;Ligand/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meta&#8208;arylated anilines are directly synthesised via Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand/norbornene cooperative catalysis without the need for additional synthetic steps. This method can be applied to a wide variety of aniline derivatives to provide a unique method for their direct meta&#8208;arylation. The isolation of several Pd complexes provides some useful insights into the factors influencing the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation step.







Abstract
Aromatic amines are ubiquitous moieties in organic molecules and their direct functionalization is of great interest in many research areas due to their prevalence in pharmaceuticals and organic electronics. While several synthetic tools exist for the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;functionalization of anilines, the functionalization of the less reactive meta&#8208;position is not easy to achieve with current methods. To date, the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of aniline derivatives has been restricted to either the use of directing groups &amp; templates, or their transformation into anilides &amp; quaternary anilinium salts. Herein, we report the first general and efficient meta&#8208;C&#8722;H&#8208;arylation of non&#8208;directed aniline derivatives via cooperative catalysis with a palladium&#8211;S,O&#8208;ligand&#8211;norbornene system. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with a wide range of aniline derivatives and aryl iodides, while being operationally simple and scalable. Our preliminary mechanistic investigation&#8211;including the isolation of several palladium complexes and deuterium experiments&#8211;reveal useful insights into the substituent&#8208;effects of both the aniline&#8208;substrate and the norbornene&#8208;mediator during the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation step.

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Tetracyclic Cycloheptanols through (4+3) Annulation via C&#8722;C/C&#8722;H Activation Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular (4+3) annulation of &#945;&#8208;arylalkene&#8211;benzocyclobutenols has been developed, which proceeds through sequential &#946;&#8208;carbon elimination of alcohols, migratory insertion with alkenes, 1,4&#8208;Rh shift, and nucleophilic addition to the in situ formed ketones. The protocol offers a diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective approach to dihydrofuran&#8208;annulated dibenzocycloheptanols with two discontinuous chiral carbon centers built.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed annulations of four&#8208;membered rings via C&#8722;C activation are powerful tools to construct complex fused and bridged ring systems. Despite significant progress in (4+1), (4+2) and (4+4) annulations, the (4+3) annulation remains unexplored. Herein, we develop an asymmetric Rh&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular (4+3) annulation of &#945;&#8208;arylalkene&#8208;tethered benzocyclobutenols for the synthesis of dihydrofuran&#8208;annulated dibenzocycloheptanols with two discontinuous chiral carbon centers via a C&#8722;C and C&#8722;H activation cascade. The reaction features excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities and 100&#8201;% atom economy, and is applicable to late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules.

         <title>Partially Ion&#8208;Paired Solvation Structure Design for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries under Extreme Operating Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A partially ion&#8208;paired solvation structure design is demonstrated that combines the beneficial characteristics of contact&#8208;ion pair (CIP) and solvent&#8208;separated ion pair (SSIP) structures. A facile desolvation and preferential reduction of anion/fluorinated co&#8208;solvent for LiF&#8208;dominated interphases are achieved without compromising ionic conductivity, effectively expanding the operational capabilities of lithium batteries under extreme conditions.







Abstract
Achieving increased energy density under extreme operating conditions remains a major challenge in rechargeable batteries. Herein, we demonstrate an all&#8208;fluorinated ester&#8208;based electrolyte comprising partially fluorinated carboxylate and carbonate esters. This electrolyte exhibits temperature&#8208;resilient physicochemical properties and moderate ion&#8208;paired solvation, leading to a half solvent&#8208;separated and half contact&#8208;ion pair in a sole electrolyte. As a result, facile desolvation and preferential reduction of anions/fluorinated co&#8208;solvents for LiF&#8208;dominated interphases are achieved without compromising ionic conductivity (&gt;1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 even at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). These advantageous features were found to apply to both lithium metal and sulfur&#8208;based electrodes even under extreme operating conditions, allowing stable cycling of Li&#8201;||&#8201;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) full cells with high SPAN loading (&gt;3.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and thin Li anode (50&#8197;&#956;m) at &#8722;40, 23 and 50&#8201;&#176;C. This work offers a promising path for designing temperature&#8208;resilient electrolytes to support high energy density Li metal batteries operating in extreme conditions.

         <title>Empowering Site&#8208;Specific Bioconjugations In Vitro and In Vivo: Advances in Sortase Engineering and Sortase&#8208;Mediated Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) is extensively employed in site&#8208;specific bioconjugations. This review presents an overview of recent advancements in sortase engineering and the resulting innovative in vitro and in vivo SML applications. Moreover, we explore the potential future impact of integrating SML with cutting&#8208;edge techniques, such as click chemistry, unnatural amino acid incorporation, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, for interdisciplinary research.







Abstract
Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) has emerged as a powerful and versatile methodology for site&#8208;specific protein conjugation, functionalization/labeling, immobilization, and design of biohybrid molecules and systems. However, the broader application of SML faces several challenges, such as limited activity and stability, dependence on calcium ions, and reversible reactions caused by nucleophilic side&#8208;products. Over the past decade, protein engineering campaigns and particularly directed evolution, have been extensively employed to overcome sortase limitations, thereby expanding the potential application of SML in multiple directions, including therapeutics, biorthogonal chemistry, biomaterials, and biosensors. This review provides an overview of achieved advancements in sortase engineering and highlights recent progress in utilizing SML in combination with other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art chemical and biological methodologies. The aim is to encourage scientists to employ sortases in their conjugation experiments.

Over the past decade, protein engineering campaigns and particularly directed evolution, have been extensively employed to overcome sortase limitations, thereby expanding the potential application of SML in multiple directions, including therapeutics, biorthogonal chemistry, biomaterials, and biosensors. This review provides an overview of achieved advancements in sortase engineering and highlights recent progress in utilizing SML in combination with other state-of-the-art chemical and biological methodologies. The aim is to encourage scientists to employ sortases in their conjugation experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Activation by Single Ru Atoms for Enhanced High&#8208;Temperature CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable single Ru atoms on the surface of Ce0.8Sm0.2O2&#8208;&#948; (SDC) could evidently modify the electronic structure of SDC surface for favorable oxygen vacancy formation and enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, finally evoking the electrocatalytic activity of SDC for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis.







Abstract
Cathodic CO2 adsorption and activation is essential for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). However, the component of oxygen ionic conductor in the cathode displays limited electrocatalytic activity. Herein, stable single Ruthenium (Ru) atoms are anchored on the surface of oxygen ionic conductor (Ce0.8Sm0.2O2&#8208;&#948;, SDC) via the strong covalent metal&#8208;support interaction, which evidently modifies the electronic structure of SDC surface for favorable oxygen vacancy formation and enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, finally evoking the electrocatalytic activity of SDC for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis. Experimentally, SOEC with the Ru1/SDC&#8208;La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; cathode exhibits a current density as high as 2.39&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.6&#8197;V and 800&#8201;&#176;C. This work expands the application of single atom catalyst to the high&#8208;temperature electrocatalytic reaction in SOEC and provides an efficient strategy to tailor the electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity of SOEC cathode at the atomic scale.

         <title>Polyoxometalate Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40 Electrolytes for High&#8208;energy All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalates are proposed as a groundbreaking platform for high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Benefiting from rational structure design, Li3PW12O4o electrolytes exhibit remarkable cost&#8208;effectiveness ($5.68&#8197;kg&#8722;1), electrochemical stability, and high ionic conductivity (0.89&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The lithium&#8208;metal batteries utilizing sustainable electrolyte achieve more than 200 cycles and the lithium&#8208;air batteries operate over 600 cycles.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) batteries promise both high energy density and safety while existing solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) fail to satisfy the rigorous requirements of battery operations. Herein, novel polyoxometalate SSEs, Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40, are synthesized, which exhibit excellent interfacial compatibility with electrodes and chemical stability, overcoming the limitations of conventional SSEs. A high ionic conductivity of 0.89&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.23&#8197;eV are obtained due to the optimized three&#8208;dimensional Li+ migration network of Li3PW12O40. Li3PW12O40 exhibits a wide window of electrochemical stability that can both accommodate the Li anode and high&#8208;voltage cathodes. As a result, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries fabricated with Li/Li3PW12O40/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 display a stable cycling up to 100 cycles with a cutoff voltage of 4.35&#8197;V and an areal capacity of more than 4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, as well as a cost&#8208;competitive SSEs price of $5.68&#8197;kg&#8722;1. Moreover, Li3PMo12O40 homologous to Li3PW12O40 was obtained via isomorphous substitution, which formed a low&#8208;resistance interface with Li3PW12O40. Applications of Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40 in Li&#8208;air batteries further demonstrate that long cycle life (650 cycles) can be achieved. This strategy provides a facile, low&#8208;cost strategy to construct efficient and scalable solid polyoxometalate electrolytes for high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

         <title>Precise Preparation of Triarylboron&#8208;Based Graphdiyne Analogues for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of triarylboron&#8208;based graphdiyne analogues (TAB&#8208;GDY) with clear structure and tunable pore size were prepared through copper mediated coupling reaction. Due to its rich microporous structure, the electron deficiency of the TAB group and the electron richness of the acetylene bond, TAB&#8208;GDY exhibits certain IAST selectivity in binary gas and is expected to be used for gas capture and separation.







Abstract
A series of triarylboron&#8208;based graphdiyne analogues (TAB&#8208;GDYs) with tunable pore size were prepared through copper mediated coupling reaction. The elemental composition, chemical bond, morphology of TAB&#8208;GDYs were well characterized. The crystallinity was confirmed by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and stacking modes were studied in combination with high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and structure simulation. The absorption and desorption isotherm revealed relatively high specific surface area of these TAB&#8208;GDYs up to 788&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 for TMTAB&#8208;GDY, which decreased as pore size enlarged. TAB&#8208;GDYs exhibit certain selectivity for CO2/N2 (21.9), CO2/CH4 (5.3), CO2/H2 (41.8) and C2H2/CO2 (2.3). This work has developed a series of boron containing two&#8208;dimensional frameworks with clear structures and good stability, and their tunable pore sizes have laid the foundation for future applications in the gas separation field.

         <title>Metal Vapour Synthesis of an Organometallic Barium(0) Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For over half a century, Mg(anthracene) has been a well&#8208;known complex that reacts as a form of &#8220;atomic&#8221; Mg0, however, heavier alkaline&#8208;earth metal anthracene complexes are unknown. Reaction of Ba0 vapour with an anthracene ligand gave a Ba anthracene complex that crystallizes as a cyclic octamer and reacts as a Ba0 synthon.







Abstract
A hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble barium anthracene complex was prepared by means of metal vapour synthesis. Reaction of 9,10&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)anthracene (Anth&#8242;&#8242;) with barium vapour gave deep purple Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;) which after extraction with diethyl ether crystallised as the cyclic octamer [Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;)&#8901;Et2O]8. Dissolution in benzene or toluene led to replacement of the Et2O ligand with a softer arene ligand and isolation of Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;)&#8901;arene. Diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY&#8197;NMR ) measurements in benzene&#8208;d6 indicate solution species with a molecular weight that equals a trimeric constitution. Natural population analysis (NPA) assigned charges of +1.70 and &#8722;1.70 to Ba and Anth&#8242;&#8242;, respectively, relating to highly ionic Ba2+/Anth&#8242;&#8242;2&#8722; bonding. Preliminary reactivity studies with air, Ph2C=NPh, or H2 show that the complex reacts as a Ba0 synthon by release of neutral Anth&#8242;&#8242;. This soluble molecular Ba0/BaII redox synthon provides new routes for the syntheses of barium complexes under mild conditions.

Reaction of 9,10-bis(trimethylsilyl)anthracene (Anth&#8242;&#8242;) with barium vapour gave deep purple Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;) which after extraction with diethyl ether crystallised as the cyclic octamer [Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;)&#8901;Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. Dissolution in benzene or toluene led to replacement of the Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ligand with a softer arene ligand and isolation of Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;)&#8901;arene. Diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY&#8197;NMR ) measurements in benzene-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; indicate solution species with a molecular weight that equals a trimeric constitution. Natural population analysis (NPA) assigned charges of +1.70 and &#8722;1.70 to Ba and Anth&#8242;&#8242;, respectively, relating to highly ionic Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Anth&#8242;&#8242;&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; bonding. Preliminary reactivity studies with air, Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=NPh, or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; show that the complex reacts as a Ba&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; synthon by release of neutral Anth&#8242;&#8242;. This soluble molecular Ba&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/Ba&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; redox synthon provides new routes for the syntheses of barium complexes under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design and Reticulation of Infinite qbe Rod Secondary Building Units into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks through a Global Desymmetrization Approach for Inverse C3H8/C3H6 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linker desymmetrization approach was used to fabricate infinite rod secondary building unit (SBU) based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) structures carrying unique gfc net. The rod SBU can be simplified as 1&#8208;periodic cylindric sphere packing described in 1978 as 44 (3,3) and in the RCSR database as qbe, which has rarely been observed in MOF chemistry. The resulting MOF has nonpolar/inert pore surfaces and unusual inverse C3H8/C3H6 separation potential.







Abstract
The development of reticular chemistry has enabled the construction of a large array of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with diverse net topologies and functions. However, dominating this class of materials are those built from discrete/finite secondary building units (SBUs), yet the designed synthesis of frameworks involving infinite rod&#8208;shaped SBUs remain underdeveloped. Here, by virtue of a global linker desymmetrization approach, we successfully targeted a novel Cu&#8208;MOF (Cu&#8208;ASY) incorporating infinite Cu&#8208;carboxylate rod SBUs with its structure determined by micro electron diffraction (MicroED) crystallography. Interestingly, the rod SBU can be simplified as a unique cylindric sphere packing qbe tubule made of [43.62] tiles, which further connect the tritopic linkers to give a newly discovered 3,5&#8208;connected gfc net. Cu&#8208;ASY is a permanent ultramicroporous material featuring 1D channels with highly inert surfaces and shows a preferential adsorption of propane (C3H8) over propene (C3H6). The efficiency of C3H8 selective Cu&#8208;ASY is validated by multicycle breakthrough experiments, giving C3H6 productivity of 2.2&#8197;L/kg. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that C3H8 molecules form multiple C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and atypical C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901; H&#8722;C van der Waals interactions with the inner nonpolar surfaces. This work therefore highlights the linker desymmetrization as an encouraging and intriguing strategy for achieving unique MOF structures and properties.

         <title>Catalytic HF Shuttling between Fluoroalkanes and Alkynes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic method to transfer formal equivalents of HF from fluoroalkanes to an alkyne is reported. The method leads to a simple approach generating geminal difluoroalkanes and it tolerates numerous sensitive functional groups including halogen, protected amine, ester and thiophene substituents. Poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) was shown to act as an HF donor in place of the fluoroalkane.







Abstract
In this paper, we report BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 as a catalyst to shuttle equivalents of HF from a fluoroalkane to an alkyne. Reactions of terminal and internal aliphatic alkynes led to formation of difluoroalkane products, while diarylalkynes can be selectively converted into fluoroalkenes. The method tolerates numerous sensitive functional groups including halogen, protected amine, ester and thiophene substituents. Mechanistic studies (DFT, probe experiments) suggest the catalyst is involved in both the defluorination and fluorination steps, with BF3 acting as a Lewis acid and OEt2 a weak Lewis base that mediates proton transfer. In certain cases, the interconversion of fluoroalkene and difluoroalkane products was found to be reversible. The new catalytic system was applied to demonstrate proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept recycling of poly(vinylidene difluoride).

         <title>Mesoscale Clusters in the Crystallisation of Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is a surge in research on mesoscale clusters of organic molecules in light of the limitations of classical nucleation theory. This mini&#8208;review offers a fresh perspective on calling upon nanoscale characterisation techniques to evaluate the interdependence of solution properties and sample treatment on cluster properties to go alongside their role in nucleation, all based on literature&#8208;based experimental evidence.







Abstract
The early stages of the molecular self&#8208;assembly pathway leading to crystal nucleation have a significant influence on the properties and purity of organic materials. This mini review collates the work on organic mesoscale clusters and discusses their importance in nucleation processes, with a particular focus on their critical properties and susceptibility to sample treatment parameters. This is accomplished by a review of detection methods, including dynamic light scattering, nanoparticle tracking analysis, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. Considering the challenges associated with crystallisation of flexible and large&#8208;molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients, the dynamic nature of mesoscale clusters has the potential to expand the discovery of novel crystal forms. By collating literature on mesoscale clusters for organic molecules, a more comprehensive understanding of their role in nucleation will evolve and can guide further research efforts.

         <title>Enabling High Throughput Kinetic Experimentation by Using Flow as a Differential Kinetic Technique
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By performing a series of instantaneous rate experiments, flow chemistry can be used to collect differential kinetic profiles. The time taken to collect a profile becomes independent of the time it takes a reaction to reach completion. This effectively enables high throughput kinetic experimentation, where data can be collected faster than a reaction can run. The process can also probe catalytic stability, offering further mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Kinetic data is most commonly collected through the generation of time&#8208;series data under either batch or flow conditions. Existing methods to generate kinetic data in flow collect integral data (concentration over time) only. Here, we report a method for the rapid and direct collection of differential kinetic data (direct measurement of rate) in flow by performing a series of instantaneous rate measurements on sequential small&#8208;scale reactions. This technique decouples the time required to generate a full kinetic profile from the time required for a reaction to reach completion, enabling high throughput kinetic experimentation. In addition, comparison of kinetic profiles constructed at different residence times allows the robustness, or stability, of homogeneously catalysed reactions to be interrogated. This approach makes use of a segmented flow platform which was shown to quantitatively reproduce batch kinetic data. The proline mediated aldol reaction was chosen as a model reaction to perform a high throughput kinetic screen of 216 kinetic profiles in 90&#8197;hours, one every 25 minutes, which would have taken an estimated continuous 3500&#8197;hours in batch, an almost 40&#8208;fold increase in experimental throughput matched by a corresponding reduction in material consumption.

         <title>Structural Element of Vitamin U&#8208;Mimicking Antibacterial Polypeptide with Ultrahigh Selectivity for Effectively Treating MRSA Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) exhibit mighty antibacterial properties without inducing drug resistance. Achieving a much higher selectivity of AMPs towards bacteria and normal cells has always been a continuous goal to be pursued. Herein, a series of sulfonium&#8208;based polypeptides with different arms and degrees of polymerization were synthesized by mimicking the structure of vitamin U. The polypeptide, G2&#8208;PM&#8208;1H+, shows both potent antibacterial activity and the highest selectivity index of 16000 among the reported AMPs or peptoids (e.g., the known index of 9600 for recorded peptoid in &#8220;Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2020, 59, 6412.&#8221;), which can be attributed to the high positive density of sulfonium and the regulation of hydrophobic chains in the structure. The antibacterial mechanisms of G2&#8208;PM&#8208;1H+ is primarily ascribed to the interaction with the membrane, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and disfunction of ribosomes. Meanwhile, altering the degree of alkylation leads to selective antibacteria against either gram&#8208;positive or gram&#8208;negative bacteria in a mixed&#8208;bacteria model. Additionally, both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that G2&#8208;PM&#8208;1H+ exhibits superior efficacy against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) compared to vancomycin. Together, these results show that G2&#8208;PM&#8208;1H+ possesses high biocompatibility and is a potential pharmaceutical candidate in combating bacteria significantly threatening human health.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) exhibit mighty antibacterial properties without inducing drug resistance. Achieving a much higher selectivity of AMPs towards bacteria and normal cells has always been a continuous goal to be pursued. Herein, a series of sulfonium-based polypeptides with different arms and degrees of polymerization were synthesized by mimicking the structure of vitamin U. The polypeptide, G2-PM-1H+, shows both potent antibacterial activity and the highest selectivity index of 16000 among the reported AMPs or peptoids (e.g., the known index of 9600 for recorded peptoid in &#8220;Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2020, 59, 6412.&#8221;), which can be attributed to the high positive density of sulfonium and the regulation of hydrophobic chains in the structure. The antibacterial mechanisms of G2-PM-1H+ is primarily ascribed to the interaction with the membrane, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and disfunction of ribosomes. Meanwhile, altering the degree of alkylation leads to selective antibacteria against either gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria in a mixed-bacteria model. Additionally, both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that G2-PM-1H+ exhibits superior efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) compared to vancomycin. Together, these results show that G2-PM-1H+ possesses high biocompatibility and is a potential pharmaceutical candidate in combating bacteria significantly threatening human health.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;reporting and Biodegradable Thermosetting Solid Polymer Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To date, significant efforts have been dedicated to improve their ionic conductivity, thermal stability, and mechanical strength of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). However, direct monitoring of physical and chemical changes in SPEs is still lacking. Moreover, existing thermosetting SPEs are hardly degradable. Herein, by overcoming the limitation predicted by Flory theory, self&#8208;reporting and biodegradable thermosetting hyperbranched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)&#8208;based SPEs (HPAE&#8208;SPEs) are reported. HPAE is successfully synthesized through a well&#8208;controlled "A2+B4" Michael addition strategy and then crosslinked it in situ to produce HPAE&#8208;SPEs. The multiple tertiary aliphatic amines at the branching sites confer multicolour luminescence to HPAE&#8208;SPEs, enabling direct observation of its physical and chemical damage. After use, HPAE&#8208;SPEs can be rapidly hydrolysed into non&#8208;hazardous &#946;&#8208;amino acids and polyols via self&#8208;catalysis. Optimized HPAE&#8208;SPE exhibits an ionic conductivity of 1.3&#215;10&#8208;4 S/cm at 60 &#176;C, a Na+ transference number of 0.67, a highly stable sodium plating&#8208;stripping behaviour and a low overpotential of ~190 mV. This study establishes a new paradigm for developing SPEs by engineering multifunctional polymers. The self&#8208;reporting and biodegradable properties would greatly expand the scope of applications for SPEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Dual&#8208;Porous Covalent Triazine Frameworks as a New Platform for Efficient Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) have gained considerable interest in energy and catalysis owing to their well&#8208;defined nitrogen&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;conjugated porosity and superior physicochemical properties, however, suffer from very limited molecular structures. Herein we report a novel solvent&#8208;free FeCl3&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of 2, 6&#8208;pyridinedicarbonitrile (DCP) to achieve the first synthesis of crystalline, dual&#8208;porous, pyridine&#8208;based CTF (Fe&#8208;CTF). The FeCl3 could not only act as a highly active Lewis acid catalyst for promoting the two&#8208;dimensional ordered polymerization of DCP monomers, but also in situ coordinate with the tridentate chelators generated between pyridine and triazine groups to yield unique Fe&#8208;N3 single&#8208;atom active sites in Fe&#8208;CTF. Abundant few&#8208;layer crystalline nanosheets (Fe&#8208;CTF NSs) could be prepared through simple ball&#8208;milling exfoliation of the bulk layered Fe&#8208;CTF and exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half&#8208;wave potential and onset potential up to 0.902 and 1.02 V respectively, and extraordinary Zn&#8208;air battery performance with an ultrahigh specific capacity and power density of 811 mAh g&#8208;1 and 230 mW cm&#8208;2 respectively. By combining operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, we revealed a dynamic and reversible evolution of Fe&#8208;N3 to Fe&#8208;N2 during the electrocatalytic process, which could further accelerate the electrocatalytic reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrophosphination of Terminal Alkenyl aza&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper presents the first Mn(I)&#8208;catalysed methodology for enantioselective hydrophosphination of terminal alkenyl aza&#8208;heteroarenes. The catalyst operates through H&#8208;P bond activation, enabling successful hydrophosphination of a diverse range of alkenyl&#8208;heteroarenes with high enantioselectivity. The presented protocol addresses the inherently low reactivity and the commonly encountered suboptimal enantioselectivities of these challenging substrates. As an important application we show that this method facilitates the synthesis of a non&#8208;symmetric tridentate P,N,P&#8208;containing ligand like structure in just two synthetic steps using a single catalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;free Trifluoromethoxylation of Silyl Enol Ethers and Allyl Silanes with Bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical trifluoromethoxylation is an attractive approach to prepare compounds featuring the important OCF3 group, however most existing methods have focused on aromatic substrates. Here, we report novel methodologies with alkenyl substrates employing bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP) as a practical and comparatively atom economical trifluoromethoxylating reagent. With silyl enol ether substrates, switching reaction solvent allows for the synthesis of either &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethoxy)ketone products or unprecedented alkenyl&#8208;OCF3 species. Furthermore, allyl silanes have been employed as substrates for the first time, affording allyl(trifluoromethyl)ether products in good yields. In each case, the methods operate at room temperature without large excesses of the alkene substrate while, in contrast to previous radical trifluoromethoxylation reactions, no catalyst, light or other activators are required.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;Cleavable Aromatic Polymers for the Fabrication of Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Plastics with High Mechanical Strength and Excellent Chemical Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although closed&#8208;loop recycling of dynamic covalent bond&#8208;based plastics does not require catalysts, their mechanical strength and chemical stability remain a major concern. In this study, closed&#8208;loop recyclable poly(aryl imine) (PAI) plastics with high mechanical strength and excellent chemical resistance are fabricated by copolymerizing aromatic amines and aromatic aldehydes through dynamic imine bonds. The resulting PAI plastic with a tensile strength of 58.2 MPa exhibits excellent chemical resistance and mechanical stability in acidic and basic aqueous solutions and various organic solvents. The PAI plastics can be depolymerized in a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran (THF)/HCl aqueous solution through the dissociation of imine bonds, and the monomers can be facilely recovered with high purity and isolated yields due to the solubility difference between the aromatic amines and aromatic aldehydes in selective solvents. The efficient closed&#8208;loop recycling of the PAI plastic can also be realized through monomer conversion because the hydrolysis of the aromatic aldehydes generates aromatic amines. The recovered monomers can be used to re&#8208;fabricate original PAI plastics. This PAI plastic can be selectively recovered from complicated mixed polymer waste streams due to the mild depolymerization conditions of the PAI plastic and its high stability in most organic solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Uniformly Distributed Mixed Matrix Membranes via a Solution Processable Strategy for Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregation of filler particles during the formation of mixed matrix membranes is difficult to avoid when filler loadings exceed a 10&#8208;15 wt%. Such agglomeration usually leads to poor membrane performance. In this work, using a ZIF&#8208;67 metal organic framework (MOF) as filler along with surface modification of Ag4tz4 to improve processability and selective olefin adsorption, we demonstrate that highly loaded with a very low agglomeration degree membranes can be synthesized displaying unmatched separation selectivity (39) for C3H6/C3H8 mixtures and high permeability rates (99 Barrer), far surpassing previous reports in the literature. Through molecular dynamics simulation, the enhanced compatibility between ZIF&#8208;67 and polymer matrix with adding Ag4tz4 was proven and the tendency in gas permeability and C3H6 selectivity in the mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were well explained. More importantly, the membrane showed a wide range of pressure and temperature resistance, together with remarkable long&#8208;term stability (&gt;900 h). The modification method might help solve interface issues in MMMs and can be extended to the fabrication of other fillers to achieve high performance MMMs for gas separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free activation of molecular oxygen by 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;based porous organic polymers for selective aerobic oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen activation is a critical step in heterogeneous oxidative processes, particularly in catalytic, electrolytic, and pharmaceutical applications. Among the various catalysts available for photocatalytic O2&#160;activation, homogeneous aryl ketones are at the forefront. To avoid the degradation and deactivation of aryl ketones, 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;based porous organic polymers were designed and regulated by doping them with co&#8208;monomers. The obtained heterogeneous photocatalyst showed good performance in O2&#160;activation, and its performance was better than that of homogeneous 9&#8208;fluorenone. The obtained heterogeneous photocatalyst showed good reusability. We believe&#160;that the presented method and findings represent an important step toward designing catalysts tailored for specific tasks.</dc:description>

         <title>Rare Earth Evoked Subsurface Oxygen Species in Platinum Alloy Catalysts Enable Durable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alleviating the degradation issue of Pt based alloy catalysts, thereby simultaneously achieving high mass activity and high durability in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), is highly challenging. Herein, we provide a new paradigm to address this issue via delaying the place exchange between adsorbed oxygen species and surface Pt atoms, thereby inhibiting Pt dissolution, through introducing rare earth bonded subsurface oxygen atoms. We have succeeded in introducing Gd&#8208;O dipoles into Pt3Ni via a high temperature entropy&#8208;driven process, with direct spectral evidence attained from both soft and hard X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies. The higher rated power of 0.93 W cm&#8208;2 and superior current density of 562.2 mA cm&#8208;2 at 0.8 V than DOE target for heavy&#8208;duty vehicles in H2&#8208;air mode suggest the great potential of Gd&#8208;O&#8208;Pt3Ni towards practical application in heavy&#8208;duty transportation. Moreover, the mass activity retention (1.04 A mgPt&#8208;1) after 40k cycles accelerated durability tests is even 2.4 times of the initial mass activity goal for DOE 2025 (0.44 A mgPt&#8208;1), due to the weakened Pt&#8208;Oads bond interaction and the delayed place exchange process, via repulsive forces between surface O atoms and those in the sublayer. This work addresses the critical roadblocks to the widespread adoption of PEMFCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancements and Perspectives toward Lignin Valorization via&#160;O&#8208;Demethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignin represents the largest aromatic carbon resource in plants, holding significant promise as a renewable feedstock for bioaromatics and other cyclic hydrocarbons in the context of the circular bioeconomy. However, the methoxy groups of aryl methyl ethers, abundantly found in technical lignins and lignin&#8208;derived chemicals, limit their pertinent chemical reactivity and broader applicability. Unlocking the phenolic hydroxyl functionality through O&#8208;demethylation (ODM) has emerged as a valuable approach to mitigate this need and enables further applications. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the progress in the valorization of technical lignin and lignin&#8208;derived chemicals via ODM, both catalytic and non&#8208;catalytic reactions. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the properties and potential applications of the O&#8208;demethylated products is presented, accompanied by a systematic overview of available ODM reactions. This review primarily focuses on enhancing the phenolic hydroxyl content in lignin&#8208;derived species through ODM, showcasing its potential in the catalytic funneling of lignin and value&#8208;added applications. A comprehensive synopsis and future outlook are included in the concluding section of this review.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Nature of Thiophene Harnessed in the Design of Near&#8208;Infrared Emitters via Antiaromaticity Relief</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitters are of great interest for applications in bioimaging and modern technology. Yet the design of such materials with decent characteristics is challenging due to intrinsic limitations. In a recent article, Murai and Yamaguchi report the synthesis of NIR emitters with appreciable fluorescence quantum yields reaching 0.02 at 878 nm in CH2Cl2 solution. The low band gaps were achieved by a new design strategy exploiting the antiaromaticity relief. This concept was realized for the compounds consisting of the antiaromatic azepine central ring fused to the thiophene moieties. In these systems, thiophene unfolds its dual nature. On the one hand, it contributes to the high antiaromaticity of azepine, on the other hand it exerts a stabilizing effect on azepine through the formation of the quinoid structure, which reduces its antiaromaticity and shifts the absorption and emission maxima into the NIR region.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Iminophosphorane Catalyzed Amide Enolization for Enantioselective Cyclohexadienone Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enolization of 2&#8208;arylacetamides, followed by an enantioselective intramolecular conjugate addition to tethered 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones, yielding saturated fused N&#8208;heterocycles, is described. The transformation is achieved by employing a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase catalyst and represents the first unactivated carboxamide deprotonation in a metal&#8208;free, catalytic, and enantioselective transformation.







Abstract
The organocatalytic enolization of 2&#8208;arylacetamides, followed by an enantioselective intramolecular conjugate addition to tethered 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones, yielding 3D fused N&#8208;heterocycles, is described. The transformation represents the first strong activating group&#8208;free activation of carboxamides via &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H deprotonation in a metal&#8208;free, catalytic, and enantioselective reaction, and is achieved by employing a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase.

         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical nitrene transfer reaction towards N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides from sulfinamides and dioxazolones with the catalysis of iron(II) chloride is presented. This one&#8208;step solvent&#8208;free procedure shows better conversions rate and chemoselectivity compared to its solution&#8208;phase counterpart, providing a wide range of N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides in up to 87&#8201;% yield. Mechanistically, crucial nitrene iron complex intermediates are suggested by ESI&#8208;MS.







Abstract
A mechanochemical synthesis of sulfonimidamides by iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed exogenous ligand&#8208;free N&#8208;acyl nitrene transfer to sulfinamides is reported. The one&#8208;step method tolerates a wide range of sulfinamides with various substituents under solvent&#8208;free ambient conditions. Compared to its solution&#8208;phase counterpart, this mechanochemical approach shows better conversion and chemoselectivity.

         <title>Integrated Conversion of Lignocellulosic Biomass to Bio&#8208;Based Amphiphiles using a Functionalization&#8208;Defunctionalization Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated &#8220;functionalization&#8208;defunctionalization&#8221; approach efficiently produces bio&#8208;based surfactants directly from the hemicellulose and lignin fractions of lignocellulosic biomass. The performance of the resulting sugar and lignin&#8208;based surfactants are competitive with existing commercial products, highlighting the potential for using these biomass fractions as surfactants with minimal structural modification.







Abstract
Concerns over the sustainability and end&#8208;of&#8208;life properties of fossil&#8208;derived surfactants have driven interest in bio&#8208;based alternatives. Lignocellulosic biomass with its polar functional groups is an obvious feedstock for surfactant production but its use is limited by process complexity and low yield. Here, we present a simple two&#8208;step approach to prepare bio&#8208;based amphiphiles directly from hemicellulose and lignin at high yields (29&#8201;% w/w based on the total raw biomass and &gt;80&#8201;% w/w of these two fractions). Acetal functionalization of xylan and lignin with fatty aldehydes during fractionation introduced hydrophobic segments and subsequent defunctionalization by hydrogenolysis of the xylose derivatives or acidic hydrolysis of the lignin derivatives produced amphiphiles. The resulting biodegradable xylose acetals and/or ethers, and lignin&#8208;based amphiphilic polymers both largely retained their original natural structures, but exhibited competitive or superior surface activity in water/oil systems compared to common bio&#8208;based surfactants.

         <title>Stereoselective Hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;Diketones Catalyzed by Chiral Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical vicinal diketones with PhSiH3 was accomplished under the frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalysis, delivering 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols in high yields with &gt;99/1 dr values and up to 97&#8201;% ee. The chiral FLP catalyst exhibits the ability to control regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities, while silane PhSiH3 facilitates an intramolecular hydrosilylation of the second carbonyl group.







Abstract
The asymmetric reduction of 1,2&#8208;diketones for the synthesis of optically active 1,2&#8208;diols, especially 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols, remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we describe the first highly stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical vicinal diketones with PhSiH3 by using a chiral frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalyst, giving a variety of 1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols in high yields with excellent d.r. values and up to 97&#8201;% ee. The chiral FLP catalyst exhibits the ability to control regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivites concurrently.

         <title>Highly Efficient Spatially&#8211;Temporally Synchronized Construction of Robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich Solid&#8211;Electrolyte Interphases in Aqueous Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of constructing spatially&#8211;temporally synchronized (STS) robust solid&#8211;slectrolyte interphases (SEI) in aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries through synergistic chemical precipitation&#8208;electrochemical reduction was proposed. In this case, a robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI protective layer enables intelligent inherent growth at the active site of the hydrogen by the chemical capture of the OH&#8722; stemmed from the HER to trigger the ionization balance of dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4&#8722;) shift to insoluble solid Li3PO4. It offers a new way to achieve anion/concentration&#8208;independent interfacial chemistry for the aqueous batteries.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) makes the electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes beyond the thermodynamics limitation of water. However, achieving the energetic and robust SEI is more challenging in aqueous electrolytes because the low SEI formation efficiency (SFE) only contributed from anion&#8208;reduced products, and the low SEI formation quality (SFQ) negatively impacted by the hydrogen evolution, resulting in a high Li loss to compensate for SEI formation. Herein, we propose a highly efficient strategy to construct Spatially&#8208;Temporally Synchronized (STS) robust SEI by the involvement of synergistic chemical precipitation&#8208;electrochemical reduction. In this case, a robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI enables intelligent inherent growth at the active site of the hydrogen by the chemical capture of the OH&#8722; stemmed from the HER to trigger the ionization balance of dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4&#8722;) shift to insoluble solid Li3PO4. It is worth highlighting that the Li3PO4 formation does not extra&#8208;consume lithium derived from the cathode but makes good use of the product of HER (OH&#8722;), prompting the SEI to achieve 100&#8201;% SFE and pushing the HER potential into &#8722;1.8&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl. This energetic and robust SEI offers a new way to achieve anion/concentration&#8208;independent interfacial chemistry for the aqueous batteries.

         <title>Iodonium Initiators: Paving the Air&#8208;free Oxidation of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;component iodonium initiators with strong oxidability and different electron delocalization properties were designed to replace lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine in doped 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD), which can oxidize Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD without air assistance. The devices based on this oxidizing Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD showed excellent efficiencies of 25.16&#8201;% (certified: 24.85&#8201;% for 0.062&#8208;cm2) and 20.71&#8201;% for a 15.03&#8208;cm2 module as well as remarkable overall stability.







Abstract
To date, perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) with doped 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) hole transporting layers (HTLs) have shown the highest recorded power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). However, their commercialization is still impeded by poor device stability owing to the hygroscopic lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and volatile 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine dopants as well as time&#8208;consuming oxidation in air. In this study, we explored a series of single&#8208;component iodonium initiators with strong oxidability and different electron delocalization properties to precisely manipulate the oxidation states of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD without air assistance, and the oxidation mechanism was clearly understood. Iodine (III) in the diphenyliodonium cation (IP+) can accept a single electron from Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and forms Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8901;+ owing to its strong oxidability. Moreover, because of the coordination of the strongly delocalized TFSI&#8722; with Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8901;+ in a stable radical complex, the resulting hole mobility was 30&#8197;times higher than that of pristine Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. In addition, the IP&#8208;TFSI initiator facilitated the growth of a homogeneous and pinhole&#8208;free Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD film. The pero&#8208;SCs based on this oxidizing HTL showed excellent efficiencies of 25.16&#8201;% (certified: 24.85&#8201;% for 0.062&#8208;cm2) and 20.71&#8201;% for a 15.03&#8208;cm2 module as well as remarkable overall stability.

         <title>One&#8208;Carbon Ring Expansion of Indoles and Pyrroles: A Straightforward Access to 3&#8208;Fluorinated Quinolines and Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

1,1&#8208;Dibromoalkanes as bromocarbene sources make one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of indoles and pyrroles facile, allowing for direct access to structurally diverse azines, especially the pharmaceutically important 3&#8208;fluorinated quinolines and pyridines. This straightforward protocol features bench&#8208;stable reagents, a broad range of substrates, and good compatibility with various functional groups.







Abstract
3&#8208;Fluorinated quinolines and pyridines are prevalent pharmacophores, yet their synthesis is often challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that dibromofluoromethane as bromofluorocarbene source enables the one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of readily available indoles and pyrroles to structurally diverse 3&#8208;fluorinated quinolines and pyridines. This straightforward protocol requires only a short reaction time of ten minutes and can be performed under air atmosphere. Preliminary investigations reveal that this strategy can also be applied to the synthesis of other valuable azines by using different 1,1&#8208;dibromoalkanes as bromocarbene sources.

         <title>Photocatalytic Production of Ethanolamines and Ethylenediamines from Bio&#8208;Polyols over a Cu/TiO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu/TiO2 catalyst with multiple active sites was developed to produce ethanolamines and ethylenediamines from bio&#8208;polyols via a photocatalytic process in one pot. Oxidation by photogenerated holes over TiO2 was responsible for the C&#8722;C bond cleavage of polyols, and metallic copper was active for reductive amination via self&#8208;hydrogen transfer. It affords a novel strategy for biomass conversion to aminated compounds under mild conditions.







Abstract
Valorization of biomass&#8208;derived polyols into high&#8208;value&#8208;added ethanolamines and ethylenediamines is highly attractive. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step photocatalytic protocol to convert bio&#8208;polyols into a 60&#8201;% yield of ethanolamines and ethylenediamines over a multifunctional Cu/TiO2 catalyst. This catalyst enables a tandem process of photocatalytic polyol C&#8722;C bond cleavage and reductive amination in one pot at room temperature, and also allows the selective conversion of various bio&#8208;polyols and amines. Mechanistic studies revealed that photogenerated holes in TiO2 promote the retro&#8208;aldol C&#8722;C bond cleavage or oxidative dehydrogenation of polyols, and photogenerated electrons accumulate on small&#8208;sized Cu clusters, which facilitate the reductive amination via hydrogen transfer and prevent the H2 generation. This strategy provides new opportunities for the development of non&#8208;noble metal photocatalysts and methods of biomass conversion under mild conditions.

         <title>Enzymatic Peptide and Protein Bromination: The BromoTrp Tag</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered variant of the Trp 6&#8208;halogenase Thal allows post&#8208;translational bromination of a tetrapeptide tag with C&#8208;terminal tryptophan in proteins on a preparative scale using the brominating E. coli coexpression strain Brocoli. The bromoarene can be derivatized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling at 37&#8201;&#176;C. This opens new avenues for bio&#8208;orthogonal modification of proteins by biocatalytic bromination of minimally tagged proteins.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;orthogonal reactions for modification of proteins and unprotected peptides are of high value in chemical biology. The combination of enzymatic halogenation with transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling provides a feasible approach for the modification of proteins and unprotected peptides. By a semirational protein engineering approach, variants of the tryptophan 6&#8208;halogenase Thal were identified that enable efficient bromination of peptides with a C&#8208;terminal tryptophan residue. The substrate scope was explored using di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrapeptide arrays, leading to the identification of an optimized peptide tag we named BromoTrp tag. This tag was introduced into three model proteins. Preparative scale post&#8208;translational bromination was possible with only a single cultivation and purification step using the brominating E. coli coexpression system Brocoli. Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of the bromoarene was achieved with Pd nanoparticle catalysts at 37&#8201;&#176;C, highlighting the rich potential of this strategy for bio&#8208;orthogonal functionalization and conjugation.

         <title>Deconstructive Carboxylation of Activated Alkenes with Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel metal&#8208;free photochemical method for the deconstructive carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 is reported for the first time. The power of this strategy is demonstrated for the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of bioactive molecule derivatives and the synthesis of propionate nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs.







Abstract
Carboxylation with carbon dioxide (CO2) represents one notable methodology to produce carboxylic acids. In contrast to carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds, carbon&#8211;carbon bond cleavage for carboxylation with CO2 is far more challenging due to their inherent and less favorable orbital directionality for interacting with transition metals. Here we report a photocatalytic protocol for the deconstructive carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 to generate carboxylic acids in the absence of transition metals. It is emphasized that our protocol provides carboxylic acids with obviously unchanged carbon numbers when terminal alkenes were used. To show the power of this strategy, a variety of pharmaceutically relevant applications including the modular synthesis of propionate nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs and the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of bioactive molecule derivatives are demonstrated.

         <title>Interphase Regulation by Multifunctional Additive Empowering High Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Enhanced Cycle Life and Thermal Safety</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel multifunctional additive of lithium tetrafluoro (1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) phosphate (LiTFTCP) is designed to effectively suppress the HF generation and facilitate the formation of a robust and heat&#8208;resistant cyano&#8208;enriched CEI layer as well as a stable LiF&#8208;enriched SEI layer, empowering NCM811/S650 full cells with enhanced cycle life and thermal safety.







Abstract
High energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) adopting high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes and silicon&#8208;based composite anodes always suffer from unsatisfied cycle life and poor safety performance, especially at elevated temperatures. Electrode /electrolyte interphase regulation by functional additives is one of the most economic and efficacious strategies to overcome this shortcoming. Herein, cyano&#8208;groups (&#8722;CN) are introduced into lithium fluorinated phosphate to synthesize a novel multifunctional additive of lithium tetrafluoro (1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) phosphate (LiTFTCP), which endows high nickel LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/SiOx&#8208;graphite composite full cell with an ultrahigh cycle life and superior safety characteristics, by adding only 0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% LiTFTCP into a LiPF6&#8208;carbonate baseline electrolyte. It is revealed that LiTFTCP additive effectively suppresses the HF generation and facilitates the formation of a robust and heat&#8208;resistant cyano&#8208;enriched CEI layer as well as a stable LiF&#8208;enriched SEI layer. The favorable SEI/CEI layers greatly lessen the electrode degradation, electrolyte consumption, thermal&#8208;induced gassing and total heat&#8208;releasing. This work illuminates the importance of additive molecular engineering and interphase regulation in simultaneously promoting the cycling and thermal safety of LIBs with high&#8208;nickel NCMxyz cathode and silicon&#8208;based composite anode.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of terminal aryl alkynes with sulfilimines was achieved. It proceeds via an intermolecular gold carbene generation/C&#8722;H annulation followed by a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization or Pictet&#8211;Spengler reactions to selectively form fused indoles. The formation of 2&#8208;substituted indoles and imidazoles derivatives through gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization is also presented.







Abstract
An efficient, highly selective and divergent synthetic method to construct 2&#8208;substituted indoles and aryl&#8208;annulated carbazoles via the intermolecular generation of &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbenes from terminal alkynes or diynes in combination with sulfilimines is disclosed. Importantly, the tandem reaction is proposed to proceed through an intermolecular gold carbene generation/C&#8722;H annulation followed by the activation of a second alkyne leading to 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization, which is significantly different from previous dual activation or 1,6&#8208;carbene shift approaches for diyne systems. In the case of ortho&#8208;alkynylaniline as starting material, an unexpected regioselective formation of the indole moiety via the intermolecular path, instead of intramolecular hydroamination was discovered. This reactivity paved the way for a one&#8208;pot synthesis of the 11H&#8208;indolo [3,2&#8208;c] quinoline scaffold by exploiting the formed amino indole for a subsequent Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction with aldehydes. The photophysical properties of the carbazoles indicated good violet&#8208;blue emission with quantum yields up to 40&#8201;%.

         <title>Implanting Transition Metal into Li2O&#8208;Based Cathode Prelithiation Agent for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Long&#8208;Life Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely implanting Co into specific Li sites within the Li2O framework adjusts band structures, weakens the Li&#8722;O interaction, and accelerates the decomposition kinetics of Li2O. It can serve as a cathode prelithiation agent to compensate for the irreversible lithium loss during the initial cycling, thus enhancing the energy density and cycle life of practical Li&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cells.







Abstract
Compensating the irreversible loss of limited active lithium (Li) is essentially important for improving the energy&#8208;density and cycle&#8208;life of practical Li&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cell, especially after employing high&#8208;capacity but low initial coulombic efficiency anode candidates. Introducing prelithiation agent can provide additional Li source for such compensation. Herein, we precisely implant trace Co (extracted from transition metal oxide) into the Li site of Li2O, obtaining (Li0.66Co0.11&#9633;0.23)2O (CLO) cathode prelithiation agent. The synergistic formation of Li vacancies and Co&#8208;derived catalysis efficiently enhance the inherent conductivity and weaken the Li&#8722;O interaction of Li2O, which facilitates its anionic oxidation to peroxo/superoxo species and gaseous O2, achieving 1642.7&#8197;mAh/g~Li2O prelithiation capacity (&#8776;980&#8197;mAh/g for prelithiation agent). Coupled 6.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% CLO&#8208;based prelithiation agent with LiCoO2 cathode, substantial additional Li source stored within CLO is efficiently released to compensate the Li consumption on the SiO/C anode, achieving 270&#8197;Wh/kg pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cell with 92&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Speciation of Transition Metal Dissolution in Electrolyte from Common Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal ion dissolution from the cathode, migration through the electrolyte, and deposition on the anode is one of the leading causes of cell failure when cycling lithium&#8208;ion batteries to high potentials (&gt;4.2&#8197;V). To better understand what is occurring in the electrolyte, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy was performed to determine the oxidation state(s) of Mn and Ni that has dissolved into the electrolyte from commonly used cathodes.







Abstract
Significant capacity loss has been observed across extended cycling of lithium&#8208;ion batteries cycled to high potential. One of the sources of capacity fade is transition metal dissolution from the cathode active material, ion migration through the electrolyte, and deposition on the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase on the anode. While much research has been conducted on the oxidation state of the transition metal in the cathode active material or deposited on the anode, there have been limited investigations of the oxidation state of the transition metal ions dissolved in the electrolyte. In this work, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy has been performed on electrolytes extracted from cells built with four different cathode active materials (LiMn2O4 (LMO), LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO), LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811), and (x Li2MnO3*(1&#8208;x) LiNiaMnbCocO2, with a+b+c=1) (LMRNMC)) that were cycled at either high or standard potentials to determine the oxidation state of Mn and Ni in solution. Inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry has been performed on the anodes from these cells to determine the concentration of deposited transition metal ions. While transition metal ions were found dissolved in all electrolytes, the oxidation state(s) of Mn and Ni were determined to be dependent on the cathode material and independent of cycling potential.

         <title>Quantitative Construction of Boronic&#8208;Ester Linkages in Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tunable numbers of B atoms in the linkages have first been achieved to construct the catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to catalyze the carbon dioxide reduction. The COFs with high contents of the B atoms showed improved the activity and selectivity, due to more easily formation of the intermediate COOH*.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been utilized for catalyzing the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) due to their atomic metal centers and controllable pore channels, which are facilitated by different covalent bonds. However, the exploration of boron&#8208;based linkages in these catalytic COFs has been limited owing to potential instability. Herein, we present the construction of boronic ester&#8208;linked COFs through nucleophilic substitution reactions in order to catalyze the CO2RR. The inclusion of abundant fluorine atoms within the frameworks enhances their hydrophobicity and subsequently improves water tolerance and chemical stability of COFs. The content of boron atoms in the COF linkages was carefully controlled, with COFs featuring a higher density of boron atoms exhibiting increased electronic conductivity, enhanced reductive ability, and stronger binding affinity towards CO2. Consequently, these COFs demonstrate improved activity and selectivity. The optimized COFs achieve the highest activity, achieving a turnover frequency of 1695.3&#8197;h&#8722;1 and a CO selectivity of 95.0&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V. Operando synchrotron radiation measurements confirm the stability of Co (II) atoms as catalytically active sites. By successfully constructing boronic ester&#8208;linked COFs, we not only address potential instability concerns but also achieve exceptional catalytic performance for CO2RR.

         <dc:description>
Reported here is a radical&#8208;based three&#8208;component defluorinative alkylboration of alkenes with trifluoromethyls and bis(pinacolato)diboron via dual photoredox/copper catalysis. This protocol offers efficient access to synthetically valuable &#947;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl boronates with high efficiency and reversed regioselectivity.







Abstract
A regioselectivity reversed three&#8208;component defluorinative alkylboration of alkenes with trifluoromethyls and bis(pinacolato)diboron via dual photoredox/copper catalysis is reported. The mild conditions are compatible with a wide array of nonactivated trifluoromethyl aromatics bearing electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;neutral substituents, trifluoroacetamides, and various nonactivated terminal and internal alkenes, enabling straightforward access to synthetically valuable &#947;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl boronates with high efficiency. Furthermore, this protocol is applicable to alkene&#8208;tethered trifluoromethyl aromatics to furnish gem&#8208;difluoromethylene&#8208;containing cyclic compounds. Synthetic applications and preliminary mechanistic studies are also presented.

This protocol offers efficient access to synthetically valuable &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkyl boronates with high efficiency and reversed regioselectivity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A regioselectivity reversed three-component defluorinative alkylboration of alkenes with trifluoromethyls and bis(pinacolato)diboron via dual photoredox/copper catalysis is reported. The mild conditions are compatible with a wide array of nonactivated trifluoromethyl aromatics bearing electron-donating or electron-neutral substituents, trifluoroacetamides, and various nonactivated terminal and internal alkenes, enabling straightforward access to synthetically valuable &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkyl boronates with high efficiency. Furthermore, this protocol is applicable to alkene-tethered trifluoromethyl aromatics to furnish &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoromethylene-containing cyclic compounds. Synthetic applications and preliminary mechanistic studies are also presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetra&#8208;Coordinated W2S3 for Efficient Dual&#8208;pH Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallic tetra&#8208;coordinated W2S3 crystal has been reported based on the theoretical structure prediction in combination with experimental results. For application in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) and anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysers, W2S3 as the cathode catalyst yields excellent bifunctionality index (&#627;@1Acm&#8722;2,PEM=1.73&#8197;V, &#627;@1Acm&#8722;2,AEM=1.77&#8197;V) and long&#8208;term stability (471 h@PEM, 360 h@AEM).







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as promising catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that play a crucial role in renewable energy technologies. Breaking the inherent structural paradigm limitations of 2D TMDs is the key to exploring their fascinating physical and chemical properties, which is expected to develop a revolutionary HER catalyst. Herein, we unambiguously present metallic W2S3 instead of energetically favorable WS2 via a unique stoichiometric growth strategy. Benefiting from the excellent conductivity and hydrophilicity of the tetra&#8208;coordinated structure, as well as an appropriate Gibbs free energy value and an enough low energy barrier for water dissociation, the W2S3 as catalyst achieves Pt&#8208;like HER activity and high long&#8208;term stability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. For application in proton exchange membrane (PEM) and anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysers, W2S3 as the cathode catalyst yields excellent bifunctionality index (&#627;
=1.73&#8197;V, &#627;
=1.77&#8197;V) and long&#8208;term stability (471 h@PEM with a decay rate of 85.7&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1, 360 h@AEM with a decay rate of 27.1&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1). Our work provides significant insight into the tetra&#8208;coordinated W2S3 and facilitates the development of advanced electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptide&#8211;Bismuth Bicycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) play a significant role in the delivery of cargos into human cells. We report the first CPPs based on peptide&#8211;bismuth bicycles, which can be readily obtained from commercially available peptide precursors, making them accessible for a wide range of applications. These CPPs enter mammalian cells as demonstrated by live&#8208;cell microscopy using fluorescently labelled peptides. We report efficient sequences that demonstrate increased cellular uptake compared to conventional CPPs like the TAT peptide (derived from the transactivating transcriptional activator of human immunodeficiency virus 1) or octaarginine (R8), despite requiring only three positive charges. Bicyclization triggered by the presence of bismuth(III) increases cellular uptake by more than one order of magnitude. Through the analysis of cell lysates using inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS), we have introduced an alternative approach to examine the cellular uptake of CPPs. This has allowed us to confirm the presence of bismuth in cells after exposure to our CPPs. Mechanistic studies indicated an energy&#8208;dependent endocytic cellular uptake sensitive to inhibition by rottlerin, most likely involving macropinocytosis.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Chiral&#160;Template Approach to Synthesize Homochiral Lead Iodides for Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homochiral halide perovskites have gained increasing attention because of their fascinating optoelectronic properties and prospective applications in laser technologies. However, the limited choice of chiral organic templates severely restricts their structural diversity and second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) effects. Here, we present an in situ chiral template approach for the synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) homochiral lead iodides. A chiral imine (L&#8208;ipp) template was generated in situ by reacting L&#8208;proline (L&#8208;pro) and acetone under ambient conditions. Notably, L&#8208;ipp can cooperate with L&#8208;pro to direct the formation of a homochiral lead iodide with dual chiral templates, which is unprecedented in crystalline metal halides. The homochiral lead iodide containing both L&#8208;ipp and L&#8208;pro shows a strong SHG response of 8.0 times that of KH2PO4 (8.0 &#180; KDP). The SHG efficiency is one of the largest values reported to date for any homochiral lead halides under 1064 nm laser irradiation. A comparative study shows that homochiral 1D lead iodides containing either L&#8208;ipp or L&#8208;pro exhibit relatively weak SHG responses (&#163; 1.0 &#180; KDP). This work demonstrates the advantage of using two different chiral templates over a single chiral template in enhancing the SHG responses of halide materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Ultra&#8208;long Room Temperature Phosphorescence Enabled by Amorphous Molecular "Triplet Exciton Pump" for Encryption with Temporospatial Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials in the amorphous state have attracted widespread attention due to their simple preparation and flexibility to adopt various forms in sensors, bioimaging, and&#160;encryption applications. However, the amorphous molecular host for the host&#8208;guest RTP systems is highly demanded but limited. Here, a universal molecular host (DPOBP&#8208;Br) has been designed by integration of an amorphous moiety of diphenylphosphine oxide (DPO) and an intersystem crossing (ISC) group of 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;benzophenone (BP&#8208;Br). Various commercial fluorescence dyes were doped into the tight and transparent DPOBP&#8208;Br film, respectively, resulting in amorphous host&#8208;guest systems with ultra&#8208;long RTP colors from green to red. It was found that DPOBP&#8208;Br acted as a universal &#8220;triplet exciton pump&#8221; for promoting the generation of triplet excitons in the guest, through energy transfer processes and external heavy&#8208;atom effect based on DPOBP&#8208;Br. Interestingly, dynamic RTP was achieved by controlling residual oxygen concentration in the amorphous matrix by UV irradiation. Therefore, multi&#8208;dimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting coatings were realized even on curved surfaces, simultaneously exhibiting spatial and 2D&#8208;time dependence. This work provides a strategy to design new amorphous molecular hosts for RTP systems and demonstrates the advanced information encryption with tempo&#8208;spatial resolution based on the dynamic ultra&#8208;long RTP of an amorphous system.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free Helical Covalent Inorganic Polymer: Preparation, Crystal Structure and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical morphologies are widely observed in nature, however, it is very challenging to prepare artificial helical polymers. Especially, precisely understanding the structure information of artificial metal&#8208;free helical covalent inorganic polymers via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis is rarely explored. Here, we successfully prepare a novel metal&#8208;free helical covalent inorganic polymer ({[Te(C6H5)2][PO3(OH)]}n, named CityU&#8208;10) by introducing angular anions (HOPO32&#8208;) into traditional tellurium&#8208;oxygen chains. The dynamic reversibility of the reaction is realized through the introduction of organic tellurium precursor and the slow hydrolysis of polyphosphoric acid. High&#8208;quality and large&#8208;size single crystals of CityU&#8208;10 have been successfully characterized via SCXRD, where the same&#8208;handed helical inorganic polymer chains form a pseudo&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional layer via multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The left&#8208;handed layers and right&#8208;handed layers alternatively stack together through weak hydrogen bonds to form a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular structure. The single crystals of CityU&#8208;10 are found to display promising optical properties with a large birefringence. Our results would offer new guidelines for designing and preparing new crystalline covalent polymers through tellurium&#8208;based chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Decarboxylative Radical Sulfilimination via Photoredox, Copper, and Br&#248;nsted Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfilimines, the aza&#8208;variants of sulfoxides, are key structural motifs in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals; and sulfilimine synthesis is therefore important in organic chemistry. However, methods for radical sulfilimination remain elusive, and as a result, the structural diversity of currently available sulfilimines is limited. Herein, we report the first protocol for decarboxylative radical sulfilimination reactions between sulfenamides and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl carboxylic acids, which were achieved via a combination of photoredox, copper, and Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. This novel protocol provided a wide variety of sulfilimines, in addition to serving as an efficient route for the synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl/S&#8208;aryl homocysteine sulfilimines and S&#8208;(4&#8208;methylphenyl) homocysteine sulfoximine. Moreover, it could be used for late&#8208;stage introduction of a sulfilimine group into structurally complex molecules, thereby avoiding the need to preserve labile organosulfur moieties through multistep synthetic sequences. A mechanism involving photocatalytic substrate transformation and copper&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8211;S bond formation is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Optical Information Recording: A Robust Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Photoswitch with the Ring&#8208;Closure Reaction Yield Exceeding 96.3%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diarylethene molecular photoswitches hold great fascination as optical information materials due to their unique bistability and exceptional reversible photoswitching properties. Conventional diarylethenes, however, rely on UV light for ring&#8208;closure reactions, typically with modest yields. For practical application, diarylethenes driven by visible lights are preferred but achieving high ring&#8208;closure reaction yield remains a significant challenge. Herein, we synthesized a novel all&#8208;visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoswitch, TPAP&#8208;DTE, by facilely endcapping the dithienylethene (DTE) core with triphenylamine phenyl (TPAP) groups. Owing to the electron&#8208;donating conjugation effect of TPAP, the open&#8208;form TPAP&#8208;DTE responds strongly to short&#8208;wavelength visible lights with considerable photocyclization quantum yields and molar absorption coefficient. Upon 405 nm visible&#8208;light irradiation, TPAP&#8208;DTE achieves a ring&#8208;closure reaction yield exceeding 96.3% (confirmed by both nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography). Its ring&#8208;opening reaction yield is 100% upon irradiation with long&#8208;wavelength visible light. TPAP&#8208;DTE could be regarded as a bidirectional &#8216;quasi&#8217;&#8208;quantitative conversion molecular switch. Furthermore, TPAP&#8208;DTE exhibits robust fatigue resistance over 100 full photoswitching cycles and great anti&#8208;aging property under 85&#8451; and 85% humidity for at least 1000 h. Consequently, its rewritable QR&#8208;code, multilevel data storage, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting/encryption applications are successfully demonstrated exclusively using visible lights, positioning TPAP&#8208;DTE as a highly promising medium for information recording.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards a Light&#8208;mediated Gene Therapy for the Eye using Caged Ethinylestradiol and the Inducible Cre/lox System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasingly, retinal pathologies are being treated with virus&#8208;mediated gene therapies. To be able to target viral transgene expression specifically to the pathological regions of the retina with light, we established an in vivo photoactivated gene expression paradigm for retinal tissue. Based on the inducible Cre/lox system, we discovered that ethinylestradiol is a suitable alternative to Tamoxifen as ethinylestradiol is more amenable to modification with photosensitive protecting compounds, i.e., &#8216;caging.&#8217; Identification of ethinylestradiol as a ligand for the mutated human estradiol receptor was supported by in silico binding studies showing the reduced binding of caged ethinylestradiol. Caged ethinylestradiol was injected into the eyes of double transgenic GFAP&#8208;CreERT2 mice with a Cre&#8208;dependent tdTomato reporter transgene followed by irradiation with light of 450 nm. Photoactivation significantly increased retinal tdTomato expression compared to controls. We thus demonstrated a first step towards the development of a targeted, light&#8208;mediated gene therapy for the eyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Alkali&#8208; and Alkaline&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Promoters on Silica&#8208;Supported Co&#8208;Fe Alloy for Autocatalytic CO2 Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrothermal vents harbor numerous microbial communities rich in reduced carbon species such as formate, acetate, and hydrocarbons. Such essential chemicals for life are produced by H2&#8208;dependent CO2 reduction, where serpentinization provides continuous H2 and thermal energy. Here, we show that silica&#8208;supported bimetallic Co&#8208;Fe alloys, naturally occurring minerals around serpentinite, can convert CO2 and H2O to key metabolic intermediates of the acetyl coenzyme A pathway such as formate (up to 72 mM), acetate, and pyruvate under mild hydrothermal vent conditions. Long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons up to C6 including propene are also detected, just as in the Lost City hydrothermal field. The effects of promoters on structural properties and catalytic functionalities of the Co&#8208;Fe alloy are systematically investigated by incorporating a series of alkali and alkaline earth metals including Na, Mg, K, and Ca. Alkali&#8208; and alkaline&#8208;earth&#8208;metals resulted in higher formate concentrations when dissolved in water and increased reaction pH, while alkaline earth metals also favored the formation of insoluble hydroxides and carbonates similar to the constituent minerals of the chimneys at the Lost City hydrothermal fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrohydrogenation of Nitriles with Amines by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles represents an efficient and sustainable one&#8208;step synthesis of valuable bulk and fine chemicals. We report herein a molecular cobalt electrocatalyst for selective hydrogenative coupling of nitriles with amines using protons as the hydrogen source. The key to success for this reductive reaction is the use of an electrocatalytic approach for efficient cobalt&#8208;hydride generation through a sequence of cathodic reduction and protonation. As only electrons (e&#8208;) and protons (H+) as the redox equivalent and hydrogen source, this general electrohydrogenation protocol is showcased by highly selective and straightforward synthesis of various functionalized and structurally diverse amines, as well as deuterium isotope labeling applications. Mechanistic studies reveal that the electrogenerated cobalt&#8208;hydride transfer to nitrile process is the rate&#8208;determining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous Electroreduction of Nitric Oxide to Ammonia at Low Concentration via Vacancy Engineered FeOCl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aqueous electroreduction of nitric oxide (NO) to NH3 (NORR) has gained extensive attention for the sake of low carbon emission and air pollutant treatment. Unfortunately, NORR is greatly hindered by its sluggish kinetics on the electrode, especially under low concentrations of NO. Herein, we developed a chlorine (Cl) vacancy strategy to overcome this limitation over FeOCl nanosheets (FeOCl&#8208;VCl). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the Cl vacancy resulted in defective Fe with sharp d&#8208;states characteristics in FeOCl&#8208;VCl to enhance the absorption and activation of NO, enabling the conversion of NO to NH3 at low concentration. In situ XANES and ATR&#8208;IR&#160;were carried out to verify the lower average oxidation state of defective Fe to enhance the electron transfer for NO adsorption/activation and facilitate the generation of key NHO and NHx intermediates. As a result, the FeOCl&#8208;VCl exhibited superior NORR activities with the NH3 Faradaic efficiency up to 91.1% while maintaining a high NH3 yield rate of 455.4 &#956;g cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 under 1.0 vol% low NO concentration, very competitive with those of previously reported catalytic systems under higher NO concentration. Further, the assembled Zn&#8208;NO battery utilizing FeOCl&#8208;VCl as cathode delivered a record peak power density of 6.2 mW cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective 1,2&#8208; Hydroarylation(alkenylation) of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes to Access &#8208;CF2H Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An emerging class of C&#8208;C coupling transformations that furnish drug&#8208;like building blocks involves catalytic hydrocarbonation of alkenes. However, despite notable advances in the field, hydrocarbon addition to gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes without additional electronic activation remains largely unsuccessful. This owes partly to poor reactivity and the propensity of difluoroalkenes to undergo defluorinative side reactions. Here, we report a nickel catalytic system that promotes efficient 1,2&#8208;selective hydroarylation and hydroalkenylation, suppressing defluorination and providing straightforward access to a diverse assortment of prized organofluorides bearing difluoromethyl&#8208;substituted carbon centers. In contrast to radical&#8208;based pathways and reactions triggered by hydrometallation via a nickel&#8208;hydride complex, our experimental and computational studies support a mechanism in which a catalytically active nickel&#8208;bromide species promotes selective carbonickelation with difluoroalkenes followed by alkoxide exchange and hydride transfer, effectively overcoming the difluoroalkene&#8217;s intrinsic electronic bias.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Tandem Mass Spectrometry for Biopolymer Structural Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biopolymer analysis, including proteomics and glycomics, relies heavily on the use of mass spectrometry for structural elucidation, including sequence determination. Novel methods to improve sample workup, instrument performance, and data analysis continue to be developed to address shortcomings associated with sample preparation, analysis time, data quality, and data interpretation. Here, we present a new method that couples in&#8208;source collision&#8208;induced dissociation (IS&#8208;CID) with two&#8208;dimensional tandem mass spectrometry (2D MS/MS) as a way to simplify proteomics and glycomics workflows while also providing additional insight into analyte structures over traditional MS/MS experiments. Specifically, IS&#8208;CID is employed as a gas&#8208;phase digestion method, i.e., to break down intact full&#8208;length polysaccharides or peptides prior to mass analysis. The resulting mixtures of oligomeric ions are analyzed by 2D&#8208;MS/MS, a technique that allows association of product ions with their precursor ions without isolation of the latter. A novel data analysis strategy is introduced to leverage the second dimension of 2D MS/MS spectra, in which stairstep patterns, representing outputs of a molecule&#8217;s MSn scans, are extracted for structural interconnectivity information on the oligomer. The results demonstrate the potential applicability of 2D MS/MS strategies to the modern omics workflow and structural analysis of various classes of biopolymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly and Bioorthogonal Reaction Enable the Enrichment of Photosensitizers and Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors for Pretargeted Cancer Theranostics</title>

         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step tumor&#8208;pretargeted approach for multimodal imaging&#8208;guided cancer theranostics via cascade alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;mediated in situ self&#8208;assembly and bioorthogonal inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction enhances the accumulation of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (SA&#8208;Tz) and photosensitizers (775NP&#8208;Tz) at the tumor site, efficiently alleviating hypoxic tumors and augmenting synergistic PDT efficacy in vivo.







Abstract
We report here a tumor&#8208;pretargted theranostic approach for multimodality imaging&#8208;guided synergistic cancer PDT by cascade alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;mediated in situ self&#8208;assembly and bioorthogonal inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction. Using the enzymatic catalysis of ALP that continuously catalyses the dephosphorylation and self&#8208;assembly of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO)&#8208;bearing P&#8208;FFGd&#8208;TCO, a high density of fluorescent and magnetic TCO&#8208;containing nanoparticles (FMNPs&#8208;TCO) can be synthesized and retained on the membrane of tumor cells. They can act as &#8216;artificial antigens&#8217; amenable to concurrently capture lately administrated tetrazine (Tz)&#8208;decorated PS (775NP&#8208;Tz) and carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor (SA&#8208;Tz) via the fast IEDDA reaction. This two&#8208;step pretargeting process can further induce FMNPs&#8208;TCO regrowth into microparticles (FMNPs&#8208;775/SA) directly on tumor cell membranes, which is analyzed by bio&#8208;SEM and fluorescence imaging. Thus, efficient enrichment of both SA&#8208;Tz and 775NP&#8208;Tz in tumors can be achieved, allowing to alleviate hypoxia by continuously inhibiting CA activity and improving PDT of tumors. Findings show that subcutaneous HeLa tumors could be completely eradicated and no tumor recurred after irradiation with an 808&#8197;nm laser (0.33&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 10&#8197;min). This pretargeted approach may be applied to enrich other therapeutic agents in tumors to improve targeted therapy.

         <title>Quality Control of Mass&#8208;Encoded Nanodevices by Compartmented DNA Origami Frames for Precision Information Coding and Logic Mapping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present mass&#8208;encoded nanodevices in which the arrangement and stoichiometry of mass nanotags are prescribed in compartmented DNA origami frames to generate characteristic mass spectra with multiple well&#8208;defined signal intensities. The exclusivity of mass spectral patterns and orthogonality of multiplexed ion signal responses allow precise information coding and logic mapping.







Abstract
Encoded nanostructures afford an ideal platform carrying multi&#8208;channel signal components for multiplexed assay and information security. However, with the demand on exclusivity and reproducibility of coding signals, precise control on the structure and composition of nanomaterials featuring fully distinguishable signals remains challenging. By using the multiplexing capability of mass spectrometry (MS) and spatial addressability of DNA origami nanostructures, we herein propose a quality control methodology for constructing mass&#8208;encoded nanodevices (namely MNTs&#8208;TDOFs) in the scaffold of compartmented tetrahedral DNA origami frames (TDOFs), in which the arrangement and stoichiometry of four types of mass nanotags (MNTs) can be finely regulated and customized to generate characteristic MS patterns. The programmability of combinatorial MNTs and orthogonality of individual compartments allows further evolution of MNTs&#8208;TDOFs to static tagging agents and dynamic nanoprobes for labeling and sensing of multiple targets. More importantly, structure control at single TDOF level ensures the constancy of prescribed MS outputs, by which a high&#8208;capacity coding system was established for secure information encryption and decryption. In addition to the multiplexed outputs in parallel, the nanodevices could also map logic circuits with interconnected complexity and logic events of c&#8208;Met recognition and dimerization on cell surface for signaling regulation by MS interrogation.

         <title>Discovery of Natural Potent HMG&#8208;CoA Reductase Degraders for Lowering Cholesterol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plant Schisandra macrocarpa was explored for the extraction of novel compounds from its fungal endophyte Penicillium sp. DG23. Of the indole diterpenoids and derivatives identified, biological evaluation highlighted schipenindolene A as a potent HMGCR degrader that further lowered cholesterol with statin (HMGCR inhibitor) by activating the endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;associated degradation pathway and inhibiting the compensatory effects of statin.







Abstract
Exploitation of key protected wild plant resources makes great sense, but their limited populations become the major barrier. A particular strategy for breaking this barrier was inspired by the exploration of a resource&#8208;saving fungal endophyte Penicillium sp. DG23, which inhabits the key protected wild plant Schisandra macrocarpa. Chemical studies on the cultures of this strain afforded eight novel indole diterpenoids, schipenindolenes A&#8722;H (1&#8211;8), belonging to six diverse skeleton types. Importantly, semisyntheses suggested some key nonenzymatic reactions constructing these molecules and provided targeted compounds, in particular schipenindolene A (Spid&#8197;A, 1) with low natural abundance. Remarkably, Spid&#8197;A was the most potent HMG&#8208;CoA reductase (HMGCR) degrader among the indole diterpenoid family. It degraded statin&#8208;induced accumulation of HMGCR protein, decreased cholesterol levels and acted synergistically with statin to further lower cholesterol. Mechanistically, transcriptomic and proteomic profiling suggested that Spid&#8197;A potentially activated the endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;associated degradation (ERAD) pathway to enhance the degradation of HMGCR, while simultaneously inhibiting the statin&#8208;activated expression of many key enzymes in the cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis pathways, thereby strengthening the efficacy of statins and potentially reducing the side effects of statins. Collectively, this study suggests the potential of Spid&#8197;A for treating cardiovascular disease.

         <title>A Highly Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Luminophore for Activatable Ultrasensitive In Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; afterglow probe was designed, exhibiting high 1O2 generation and capture ability with a single molecule. Through intramolecular energy transfer strategy, the afterglow probe showed an extremely bright afterglow luminescence with an emission wavelength located in NIR&#8208;I region (&gt;650&#8197;nm), which allowed deeper tissue penetration, higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, and imaging sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Afterglow luminescence imaging probes, with long&#8208;lived emission after cessation of light excitation, have drawn increasing attention in biomedical imaging field owing to their elimination of autofluorescence. However, current afterglow agents always suffer from an unsatisfactory signal intensity and complex systems consisting of multiple ingredients. To address these issues, this study reports a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) afterglow luminophore (TPP&#8208;DO) by chemical conjugation of an afterglow substrate and a photosensitizer acting as both an afterglow initiator and an energy relay unit into a single molecule, resulting in an intramolecular energy transfer process to improve the afterglow brightness. The constructed TPP&#8208;DO NPs emit a strong NIR afterglow luminescence with a signal intensity of up to 108&#8197;p/s/cm2/sr at a low concentration of 10&#8197;&#956;M and a low irradiation power density of 0.05&#8197;W/cm2, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than most existing organic afterglow probes. The highly bright NIR afterglow luminescence with minimized background from TPP&#8208;DO NPs allows a deep tissue penetration depth ability. Moreover, we develop a GSH&#8208;activatable afterglow probe (Q&#8208;TPP&#8208;DO NPs) for ultrasensitive detection of subcutaneous tumor with the smallest tumor volume of 0.048&#8197;mm3, demonstrating the high potential for early diagnosis and imaging&#8208;guided surgical resection of tumors.

         <title>Dual Nanoparticle Conjugates for Highly Sensitive and Versatile Sensing Using 19F Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel dual nanoparticle conjugate sensor (DNCThr) for visualizing thrombin in live mice by fluorine&#8208;19 magnetic resonance imaging. DNCThr consists of mesoporous silica&#8208;coated perfluorocarbon nanoparticles (19F&#8208;MSNs) linked to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) via an aptamer and a complementary DNA strand. Target&#8208;induced dissociation results in particle separation and robust signal turn&#8208;on.







Abstract
Fluorine magnetic resonance imaging (19F MRI) has emerged as an attractive alternative to conventional 1H MRI due to enhanced specificity deriving from negligible background signal in this modality. We report a dual nanoparticle conjugate (DNC) platform as an aptamer&#8208;based sensor for use in 19F MRI. DNC consists of core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with a liquid perfluorocarbon core and a mesoporous silica shell (19F&#8208;MSNs), which give a robust 19F MR signal, and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as magnetic quenchers. Due to the strong magnetic quenching effects of SPIONs, this platform is uniquely sensitive and functions with a low concentration of SPIONs (4 equivalents) relative to 19F&#8208;MSNs. The probe functions as a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor using target&#8208;induced dissociation of DNA aptamers. The thrombin binding aptamer was incorporated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept (DNCThr), and we demonstrate a significant increase in 19F MR signal intensity when DNCThr is incubated with human &#945;&#8208;thrombin. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept probe is highly versatile and can be adapted to sense ATP and kanamycin as well. Importantly, DNCThr generates a robust 19F MRI &#8220;hot&#8208;spot&#8221; signal in response to thrombin in live mice, establishing this platform as a practical, versatile, and biologically relevant molecular imaging probe.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8211;Organic Hybrid &#8220;Calixarenes&#8221; as Supramolecular Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid calix[n]arenes (n=3, 4) can be rationally constructed from the coordination&#8208;driven assembly of polyoxometalate building blocks and dicarboxylate linkers with bite angles of 95&#176; and 120&#176;, respectively. With bowl&#8208;shaped, hydrophobic cavities similar to those of organic calixarenes, these molecular containers can host nanometer&#8208;sized Keggin and Dawson anions.







Abstract
Calixarenes are among the most useful and versatile macrocycles in supramolecular chemistry. The one thing that has not changed in the 80&#8197;years since their discovery, despite numerous derivatizations, is their fully organic, covalent scaffolds. Here, we report a new type of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid &#8220;calixarenes&#8221; constructed by means of coordination&#8208;driven assembly. Replacing acetate ligands on the {SiW10Cr2(OAc)2} clusters with 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalates allows these 95&#176; inorganic building blocks to be linked into bowl&#8208;shaped, hybrid &#8220;calix[n]arenes&#8221; (n=3, 4). With a large concave cavity, the metal&#8211;organic calix[4]arene can accommodate nanometer&#8208;sized polyoxoanions in an entropically driven process. The development of hybrid variants of calixarenes is expected to expand the scope of their physicochemical properties, guest/substrate binding, and applications on multiple fronts.

         <title>RAFT Polymerisation by the Radical Decarboxylation of Carboxylic Acids
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled grafting of acrylate and acrylamide polymers from small molecule and polymer substrates has been achieved via the radical decarboxylation of carboxylic acids. These reactions proceed with high efficiency and low dispersity, giving highly functionalised polymers in a single step.







Abstract
The controlled grafting of polymers from small&#8208; and macro&#8208;molecular substrates is an essential process for many advanced polymer applications. This usually requires the pre&#8208;functionalisation of substrates with an appropriate functional group, such as a RAFT agent or ATRP initiator, which requires additional synthetic steps. In this paper, we describe the direct grafting of RAFT polymers from carboxylate containing small molecules and polymers via photochemical radical decarboxylation. This method utilises the innate functional groups present in the substrates, and achieves efficient polymer initiation in a single step with excellent control of molecular weight and dispersity.

         <title>Why do Single&#8208;Atom Alloys Catalysts Outperform both Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts and Nanocatalysts on MXene?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RuNi SAAs on MXene combine the multiple advantages of NPs, SAC, and MXene to promote rapid dehydrogenation of AB hydrolysis. RuNiSAA&#8208;3&#8722;Ti3C2Tx with an optimal d&#8208;band center achieves the highest activity (333&#8197;L&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;gRu&#8722;1) toward AB hydrolysis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs), combining the advantages of single&#8208;atom and nanoparticles (NPs), play an extremely significant role in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Nevertheless, understanding the catalytic mechanism of SAAs in catalysis reactions remains a challenge compared with single atoms and NPs. Herein, ruthenium&#8208;nickel SAAs (RuNiSAAs) synthesized by embedding atomically dispersed Ru in Ni NPs are anchored on two&#8208;dimensional Ti3C2Tx MXene. The RuNiSAA&#8208;3&#8722;Ti3C2Tx catalysts exhibit unprecedented activity for hydrogen evolution from ammonia borane (AB, NH3BH3) hydrolysis with a mass&#8208;specific activity (rmass) value of 333&#8197;L&#8201;min&#8722;1&#8201;gRu&#8722;1. Theoretical calculations reveal that the anchoring of SAAs on Ti3C2Tx optimizes the dissociation of AB and H2O as well as the binding ability of H* intermediates during AB hydrolysis due to the d&#8208;band structural modulation caused by the alloying effect and metal&#8208;supports interactions (MSI) compared with single atoms and NPs. This work provides useful design principles for developing and optimizing efficient hydrogen&#8208;related catalysts and demonstrates the advantages of SAAs over NPs and single atoms in energy catalysis.

     alt="Why do Single-Atom Alloys Catalysts Outperform both Single-Atom Catalysts and Nanocatalysts on MXene?"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RuNi SAAs on MXene combine the multiple advantages of NPs, SAC, and MXene to promote rapid dehydrogenation of AB hydrolysis. RuNi&lt;sub&gt;SAA-3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; with an optimal d-band center achieves the highest activity (333&#8197;L&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Ru&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) toward AB hydrolysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom alloys (SAAs), combining the advantages of single-atom and nanoparticles (NPs), play an extremely significant role in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Nevertheless, understanding the catalytic mechanism of SAAs in catalysis reactions remains a challenge compared with single atoms and NPs. Herein, ruthenium-nickel SAAs (RuNi&lt;sub&gt;SAAs&lt;/sub&gt;) synthesized by embedding atomically dispersed Ru in Ni NPs are anchored on two-dimensional Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; MXene. The RuNi&lt;sub&gt;SAA-3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts exhibit unprecedented activity for hydrogen evolution from ammonia borane (AB, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) hydrolysis with a mass-specific activity (r&lt;sub&gt;mass&lt;/sub&gt;) value of 333&#8197;L&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;Ru&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Theoretical calculations reveal that the anchoring of SAAs on Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; optimizes the dissociation of AB and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as well as the binding ability of H* intermediates during AB hydrolysis due to the d-band structural modulation caused by the alloying effect and metal-supports interactions (MSI) compared with single atoms and NPs. This work provides useful design principles for developing and optimizing efficient hydrogen-related catalysts and demonstrates the advantages of SAAs over NPs and single atoms in energy catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Second Coordination Sphere Effect Shifts CO2 to CO Reduction by Iron Porphyrin from Fe0 to FeI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;inspired second coordination sphere inducing a multipoint hydrogen bonding network triggers CO2 activation at an earlier stage of the reaction mechanism in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrocatalytic reduction by an iron porphyrin catalyst. Electrochemical and comprehensive spectroscopic investigations supported by DFT calculations revealed an unprecedented change in the active species&#8217; formal oxidation state from Fe(0) to Fe(I).







Abstract
Iron porphyrins are among the most studied molecular catalysts for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and their reactivity is constantly being enhanced through the implementation of chemical functionalities in the second coordination sphere inspired by the active sites of enzymes. In this study, we were intrigued to observe that a multipoint hydrogen bonding scheme provided by embarked urea groups could also shift the redox activation step of CO2 from the well&#8208;admitted Fe(0) to the Fe(I) state. Using EPR, resonance Raman, IR and UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopies, we underpinned a two&#8208;electron activation step of CO2 starting from the Fe(I) oxidation state to form, after protonation, an Fe(III)&#8722;COOH species. The addition of another electron and a proton to the latter species converged to the cleavage of a C&#8722;O bond with the loss of water molecule resulting in an Fe(II)&#8722;CO species. DFT analyses of these postulated intermediates are in good agreement with our collected spectroscopic data, allowing us to propose an alternative pathway in the catalytic CO2 reduction with iron porphyrin catalyst. Such a remarkable shift opens new lines of research in the design of molecular catalysts to reach low overpotentials in performing multi&#8208;electronic CO2 reduction catalysis.

         <title>In Situ Vaccination with An Injectable Nucleic Acid Hydrogel for Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By crosslinking PD&#8208;L1 siRNA with a SN38&#8208; and CpG&#8208;containing Y&#8208;motif, an injectable three&#8208;in&#8208;one nucleic acid hydrogel was synthesized and performed as an in situ cancer vaccine. Upon injection, the obtained hydrogel strongly induced ICD effects, promoted DC maturation, and increased CTL infiltration in tumors, leading to an enhanced antitumor performance of immunotherapy.







Abstract
Recently, therapeutic cancer vaccines have emerged as promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Nevertheless, their efficacies are frequently impeded by challenges including inadequate antigen encapsulation, insufficient immune activation, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, we report a three&#8208;in&#8208;one hydrogel assembled by nucleic acids (NAs) that can serve as a vaccine to in situ trigger strong immune response against cancer. Through site&#8208;specifically grafting the chemodrug, 7&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (also known as SN38), onto three component phosphorothioate (PS) DNA strands, a Y&#8208;shaped motif (Y&#8208;motif) with sticky ends is self&#8208;assembled, at one terminus of which an unmethylated cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine (CpG) segment is introduced as an immune agonist. Thereafter, programmed cell death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1) siRNA that performs as immune checkpoint inhibitor is designed as a crosslinker to assemble with the CpG&#8208; and SN38&#8208;containing Y&#8208;motif, resulting in the formation of final NA hydrogel vaccine. With three functional agents inside, the hydrogel can remarkably induce the immunogenic cell death to enhance the antigen presentation, promoting the dendritic cell maturation and effector T lymphocyte infiltration, as well as relieving the immunosuppressive tumor environment. When inoculated twice at tumor sites, the vaccine demonstrates a substantial antitumor effect in melanoma mouse model, proving its potential as a general platform for synergistic cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Divergent Chemo&#8208; and Biocatalytic Route to 16&#946;&#8208;Methylcorticoids: Asymmetric Synthesis of Betamethasone Dipropionate, Clobetasol Propionate, and Beclomethasone Dipropionate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 14&#8211;15 step asymmetric synthesis of 16&#946;&#8208;methylcorticoids is described. The synthesis highlights a Mn&#8208;catalyzed oxidation&#8208;reduction hydration and an innovative enzyme&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#916;1&#8208;dehydrogenation for the functionalization of the D&#8197;ring and A&#8197;ring, respectively, establishing a versatile platform for the access to various glucocorticoids and related steroids.







Abstract
16&#946;&#8208;Methylcorticoids are among the most important glucocorticoid steroids for the treatment of various dermatological disorders, respiratory infections, and other allergic reactions elicited during inflammatory responses of the human body. Betamethasone dipropionate, clobetasol propionate, and beclomethasone dipropionate are particularly noteworthy for their synthetic intractability. Despite five decades of research, these 16&#946;&#8208;methylcorticoids have remained challenging synthetic targets owing to insurmountable issues of reactivity, selectivity, and cost efficiency associated with all previously explored strategies. We herein report our practicability&#8208;oriented strategy toward the unified stereoselective synthesis of 16&#946;&#8208;methylcorticoids in 12.6&#8211;14.0&#8201;% overall yield from commercially available 9&#945;&#8208;hydroxyandrost&#8208;4&#8208;ene&#8208;3,17&#8208;dione (9&#945;&#8208;OH&#8208;AD). In this approach, the chiral C16&#946;&#8208;Me and C17&#945;&#8208;OH groups of the corticosteroid D ring were installed via a substrate&#8208;controlled diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective Mn&#8208;catalyzed oxidation&#8208;reduction hydration of &#916;4,9(11),16&#8208;triene&#8208;3,20&#8208;dione. The C1&#8722;C2 double bond of the corticosteroid A ring was constructed using an unprecedented engineered 3&#8208;ketosteroid&#8208;&#916;1&#8208;dehydrogenase (MK4&#8208;KstD)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective &#916;1&#8208;dehydrogenation of &#916;4,9(11)&#8208;diene&#8208;3,21&#8208;dione. This strategy provides a general method and a key precursor for the divergent synthesis of a variety of glucocorticoids and related steroidal drugs.

         <title>A General Method to Access Sterically Encumbered Geminal Bis(boronates) via Formal Umpolung Transformation of Terminal Diboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for accessing sterically encumbered geminal bis(boronates) was developed based on a formal umpolung strategy. The polarity inversion of the readily available 1,1&#8208;diborylalkanes allows their corresponding &#945;&#8208;halogenated derivatives to undergo a formal substitution with a wide variety of nucleophiles to form C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;N bonds, featuring excellent tolerance to steric hindrance and functional groups.







Abstract
General methods for the preparation of geminal bis(boronates) are of great interest due to their widespread applications in organic synthesis. While the terminal gem&#8208;diboron compounds are readily accessible, the construction of the sterically encumbered, internal analogues has remained a prominent challenge. Herein, we report a formal umpolung strategy to access these valuable building blocks. The readily available 1,1&#8208;diborylalkanes were first converted into the corresponding &#945;&#8208;halogenated derivatives, which then serve as electrophilic components, undergoing a formal substitution with a diverse array of nucleophiles to form a series of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;N bonds. This protocol features good tolerance to steric hindrance and a wide variety of functional groups and heterocycles. Notably, this strategy can also be extended to the synthesis of diaryl and terminal gem&#8208;diboron compounds, therefore providing a general approach to various types of geminal bis(boronates).

While the terminal &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-diboron compounds are readily accessible, the construction of the sterically encumbered, internal analogues has remained a prominent challenge. Herein, we report a formal umpolung strategy to access these valuable building blocks. The readily available 1,1-diborylalkanes were first converted into the corresponding &#945;-halogenated derivatives, which then serve as electrophilic components, undergoing a formal substitution with a diverse array of nucleophiles to form a series of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;N bonds. This protocol features good tolerance to steric hindrance and a wide variety of functional groups and heterocycles. Notably, this strategy can also be extended to the synthesis of diaryl and terminal &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-diboron compounds, therefore providing a general approach to various types of geminal bis(boronates).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorescent&#8208;Probe Characterization for Pore&#8208;Space Mapping with Single&#8208;Particle Tracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lithography&#8208;made, two&#8208;dimensional model pore was used to characterize the motion behavior of individual, confined, fluorescent probes under varying pH conditions. The obtained knowledge enabled the pore&#8208;space exploration and mapping of more complex silica materials, such as a real&#8208;life polymerization&#8208;catalyst&#8208;support particle, with sub&#8208;diffraction&#8208;limit resolution.







Abstract
Porous solids often contain complex pore networks with pores of various sizes. Tracking individual fluorescent probes as they diffuse through porous materials can be used to characterize pore networks at tens of nanometers resolution. However, understanding the motion behavior of fluorescent probes in confinement is crucial to reliably derive pore network properties. Here, we introduce well&#8208;defined lithography&#8208;made model pores developed to study probe behavior in confinement. We investigated the influence of probe&#8208;host interactions on diffusion and trapping of confined single&#8208;emitter quantum&#8208;dot probes. Using the pH&#8208;responsiveness of the probes, we were able to largely suppress trapping at the pore walls. This enabled us to define experimental conditions for mapping of the accessible pore space of a one&#8208;dimensional pore array as well as a real&#8208;life polymerization&#8208;catalyst&#8208;support particle.

         <title>Wavelength Selective Photocontrol of Hybrid Azobenzene&#8208;Spiropyran Photoswitches with Overlapping Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report two novel photoswitch azobenzene&#8208;spiropyran dyads which are connected in meta or para position. While in the meta&#8208;analogue the two switching units behaves orthogonally according to the meta&#8208;rule, we exploited the red&#8208;shift in the p&#8208;substituted compound to obtain decoupled switching moieties. These insights provide the basis for the development of new multichromic switches for information and energy storage or other applications.







Abstract
Compounds with multiple photoswitching units are appealing for complex photochemical control of molecular materials and nanostructures. Herein, we synthesized novel meta&#8208; and para&#8208; connected (related to the nitrogen of the indoline) azobenzene&#8208;spiropyran dyads, in which the central benzene unit is shared by both switches. We investigated their photochemistry using static and time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical calculations. In the meta&#8208;compound, the individual components are photochemically decoupled due to the meta&#8208;pattern. In the para&#8208;compound the spiro&#8208;connectivity leads to a bifunctional photoswitchable system with a red&#8208;shifted absorption. The azobenzene and the spiropyran can thus be addressed and switched independently by light of appropriate wavelength. Through the different connectivity patterns two different orthogonally photoswitchable systems have been obtained which are promising candidates for complex applications of light control.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Trapezoids in Honeycomb Self&#8208;Assembly&#8212;Pathways between a Columnar Liquid Quasicrystal and its Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Approximants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
T&#8208;shaped polyphiles self&#8208;assemble into a liquid quasicrystal and a series of liquid&#8208;crystalline periodic approximants, all representing polygonal honeycombs formed by the stacking of p&#8208;terphenyls. Featuring giant octagonal motifs containing non&#8208;regular trapezoidal or pentagonal with regular triangular and square tiles, the phases assume a transition of motif orientation, triggered by the changing conformation and entropy of the alkyl end chains.







Abstract
Quasiperiodic patterns and crystals&#8212;having long range order without translational symmetry&#8212;have fascinated researchers since their discovery. In this study, we report on new p&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;based T&#8208;shaped facial polyphiles with two alkyl end chains and a glycerol&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded side group that self&#8208;assemble into an aperiodic columnar liquid quasicrystal with 12&#8208;fold symmetry and its periodic liquid&#8208;crystalline approximants with complex superstructures. All represent honeycombs formed by the self&#8208;assembly of the p&#8208;terphenyls, dividing space into prismatic cells with polygonal cross&#8208;sections. In the perspective of tiling patterns, the presence of unique trapezoidal tiles, consisting of three rigid sides formed by the p&#8208;terphenyls and one shorter, incommensurate, and adjustable side by the alkyl end chains, plays a crucial role for these phases. A delicate temperature&#8208;dependent balance between conformational, entropic and space&#8208;filling effects determines the role of the alkyl chains, either as network nodes or trapezoid walls, thus resulting in the order&#8208;disorder transitions associated with emergence of quasiperiodicity. In&#8208;depth analysis suggests a change from a quasiperiodic tiling involving trapezoids to a modified one with a contribution of trapezoid pair fusion. This work paves the way for understanding quasiperiodicity emergence and develops fundamental concepts for its generation by chemical design of non&#8208;spherical molecules, aggregates, and frameworks based on dynamic reticular chemistry.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiospecific formal syntheses of 2&#8208;isocyanoallopupukeanane and 9&#8208;isocyanopupukeanane were achieved in 10 and 15 steps, respectively. These short synthetic sequences were enabled by a key palladium&#8208;mediated cyclization cascade and culminated in an unprecedented &#8220;contra&#8208;biosynthetic&#8221; rearrangement, which was investigated computationally and allows access to the related pupukeanane core as a sultone.







Abstract
Herein, we describe our synthetic efforts toward the pupukeanane natural products, in which we have completed the first enantiospecific route to 2&#8208;isocyanoallopupukeanane in 10 steps (formal synthesis), enabled by a key Pd&#8208;mediated cyclization cascade. This subsequently facilitated an unprecedented bio&#8208;inspired &#8220;contra&#8208;biosynthetic&#8221; rearrangement, providing divergent access to 9&#8208;isocyanopupukeanane in 15 steps (formal synthesis). Computational studies provide insight into the nature of this rearrangement.

         <title>Reactivity of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] towards Carbenes, Silylenes and Germylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (Cp*=C5Me5) with carbenes gives unique adducts, while its reaction with CAACs affords a novel CAAC&#8208;stabilized As6 sawhorse compound. With silylenes and germylenes, unprecedented norbornadiene&#8208;like heteroatomic As6EL (E=Si, Ge; L=PhC(NtBu)2) ligands are accessible.







Abstract
The reaction behavior of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (I) (Cp*=C5Me5) towards carbenes and their heavier analogs was investigated. The reaction of I with NHCs (NHCs=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes) results in the first substitution products of polyarsenic ligand complexes by NHCs [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As5NHC)] (1&#8201;a: NHC=IMe=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, 1&#8201;b: NHC=IMes=1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). In contrast, the reaction of I with EtCAAC (EtCAAC=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;4,4&#8208;diethyl&#8208;2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;pyrrolidin&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) leads to a fragmentation and the formation of an unprecedented As6&#8208;sawhorse&#8208;type compound [As2(AsEtCAAC)4] (2). The reaction of (LE)2 (L=PhC(NtBu)2; E=Si, Ge) with I resulted in a rearrangement and an insertion of LE fragments, forming unique silicon&#8208; (4: [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As4SiL)], 5&#8201;a: [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As6SiL)) and germanium&#8208;containing (5&#8201;b: [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;As6GeL)) cyclic polyarsenic ligand complexes.

         <title>Particle Engineering via Supramolecular Assembly of Macroscopic Hydrophobic Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing hydrophobic polymer building blocks enables the engineering of metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN) particle properties (shell thickness, stiffness, permeability), and facilitates incorporation of functional molecules and control of cell association behavior. This study demonstrates the rational design and fabrication of hydrophobic MPNs with expanded utility for diverse applications.







Abstract
Tailoring the hydrophobicity of supramolecular assembly building blocks enables the fabrication of well&#8208;defined functional materials. However, the selection of building blocks used in the assembly of metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs), an emerging supramolecular assembly platform for particle engineering, has been essentially limited to hydrophilic molecules. Herein, we synthesized and applied biscatechol&#8208;functionalized hydrophobic polymers (poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA) and poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA)) as building blocks to engineer MPN particle systems (particles and capsules). Our method allowed control over the shell thickness (e.g., between 10 and 21&#8197;nm), stiffness (e.g., from 10 to 126&#8197;mN&#8201;m&#8722;1), and permeability (e.g., 28&#8211;72&#8201;% capsules were permeable to 500&#8197;kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate&#8208;dextran) of the MPN capsules by selection of the hydrophobic polymer building blocks (PMA or PBA) and by controlling the polymer concentration in the MPN assembly solution (0.25&#8211;2.0&#8197;mM) without additional/engineered assembly processes. Molecular dynamics simulations provided insights into the structural states of the hydrophobic building blocks during assembly and mechanism of film formation. Furthermore, the hydrophobic MPNs facilitated the preparation of fluorescent&#8208;labeled and bioactive capsules through postfunctionalization and also particle&#8211;cell association engineering by controlling the hydrophobicity of the building blocks. Engineering MPN particle systems via building block hydrophobicity is expected to expand their use.

         <title>Iminopyrrole&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembly: A Route to Intrinsically Flexible Molecular Links and Knots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole with diamines in the presence of Zn(II)/Cd(II) resulted in the formation of a [2]catenane, trefoil knot, and Borromean rings. The presence of a diminopyrrole coordination motif rendered all new systems intrinsically flexible, as demonstrated by the combination of NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and computational studies.







Abstract
The use of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole in self&#8208;assembly reactions with diamines and Zn(II)/Cd(II) salts allowed the preparation of [2]catenane, trefoil knot, and Borromean rings. The intrinsically dynamic nature of the diiminopyrrole motif rendered all of the formed assemblies intramolecularly flexible. The presence of diiminopyrrole revealed new coordination motifs and influenced the host&#8211;guest chemistry of the systems, as illustrated by hexafluorophosphate encapsulation by Borromean rings.

         <title>Ba12[BN2]6.67H4: A Disordered Anti&#8208;Skutterudite filled with Nitridoborate Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel barium nitridoborate hydride was obtained by a solid&#8208;state ampoule reaction and its crystal structure was elucidated by X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction data. It crystallizes as a filled anti&#8208;skutterudite, featuring nitridoborate and hydride anions inside a barium host lattice. The structure model was further confirmed by magic angle spinning NMR, vibrational spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
Skutterudites are of high interest in current research due to their diversity of structures comprising empty, partially filled and filled variants, mostly based on metallic compounds. We herein present Ba12[BN2]6.67H4, forming a non&#8208;metallic filled anti&#8208;skutterudite. It is accessed in a solid&#8208;state ampoule reaction from barium subnitride, boron nitride and barium hydride at 750&#8201;&#176;C. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction data allowed to elucidate the structure in the cubic space group Im
 (no. 204). The barium and hydride atoms form a three&#8208;dimensional network consisting of corner&#8208;sharing HBa6 octahedra and Ba12 icosahedra. Slightly bent [BN2]3&#8722; units are located in the icosahedra and the voids in&#8208;between. 1H and 11B magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR experiments and vibrational spectroscopy further support the structure model. Quantum chemical calculations coincide well with experimental results and provide information about the electronic structure of Ba12[BN2]6.67H4.

         <title>Cocrystallization&#8208;driven Formation of fcc&#8208;based Ag110 Nanocluster with Chinese Triple Luban Lock Shape</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luban locks with mortise and tenon structure have structural diversity and architectural stability, and it is extremely challenging to synthesize Luban lock&#8208;like structures at the molecular level. In this work, we report the cocrystallization of two structurally related atom&#8208;precise fcc silver nanoclusters Ag110(SPhF)48(PPh3)12 (Ag110) and Ag14(&#956;6&#8208;S)(SPhF)12(PPh3)8 (Ag14). It is worth noting that the Ag110 cluster is the first compound to simulate the complex Luban lock structure at the molecular level. Meanwhile, Ag110 is the largest known fcc&#8208;based silver nanocluster, so far, there is no precedent example fcc silver nanocluster with more than 100 silver atoms. DFT calculations show that Ag110 is a 58&#8208;electron superatom with an electronically closed shell1S21P61D102S21F142P61G18. Ag110&#8226;Ag14 can rapidly catalyze the reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol within 4 minutes. In addition, Ag110 presents clear structural evidence to reveal the critical size and mechanism of the transformation of metal core from fcc stacking to quasi&#8208;spherical superatoms. This research work provides an important structural model for studying the nucleation mechanism and structural assembly of silver nanoclusters.</dc:description>

         <title>A Systematic Investigation of Proteoforms with N&#8208;Terminal Glycine and Their Dynamics Reveals Its Impacts on Protein Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N&#8208;termini of proteins can regulate their degradation, and the same protein with different N&#8208;termini may have distinct dynamics. Recently, it was found that N&#8208;terminal glycine can serve as a degron recognized by two E3 ligases, but N&#8208;terminal glycine was also reported to stabilize proteins. Here we developed a chemoenzymatic method for selective enrichment of proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine and integrated dual protease cleavage to further improve the enrichment specificity. Over 2000 unique peptides with protein N&#8208;terminal glycine were analyzed from &gt;1000 proteins in human cells, and most of them are previously unknown, indicating the effectiveness of the current method to capture low&#8208;abundance proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine. The degradation rates of proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine were quantified along with those of proteins from the whole proteome. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine with the fastest and slowest degradation rates have different functions and localizations. Membrane proteins with N&#8208;terminal glycine and proteins with N&#8208;terminal glycine from the N&#8208;terminal methionine excision degrade more rapidly. Furthermore, the secondary structures, adjacent amino acid residues, and protease specificities for N&#8208;terminal glycine are also vital for protein degradation. The results advance our understanding of the effects of N&#8208;terminal glycine on protein properties and functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence of Benzils Achieved by Chiral Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In current approaches for circularly polarized phosphorescent materials, the crystallization of chiral phosphors suffers from poor processability, while integrating them into an amorphous polymer matrix results in unsatisfactory chiroptical signals due to the absence of chirality communication. Here, we have developed an innovative strategy through chiral supramolecular polymerization of benzil phosphors facilitated by intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The inherent film&#8208;forming capabilities of non&#8208;covalent supramolecular polymers obviate the need for an external polymer matrix. The pronounced helical asymmetry of benzil phosphors resulting from chiral supramolecular polymerization leads to enhanced circularly polarized phosphorescence compared to their non&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonded counterparts. The circularly polarized phosphorescent signals can be further modulated by varying the location of stereogenic centers or introducing halogen bonding to benzils. Incorporation of platinum(II) phosphor into the benzil supramolecular polymers induces both chirality and triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet energy transfer, leading to a change in circularly polarized phosphorescent color from yellow to red. In summary, chiral supramolecular polymerization of phosphors represents a novel and effective approach to circularly polarized phosphorescent materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;powered nanomotors have demonstrated promising potentials in biomedical applications, especially for catalytic tumor therapy, owing to their ability of self&#8208;propulsion and bio&#8208;catalysis. However, the fragility of natural enzymes limits their environmental adaptability and also therapeutic efficacy in catalysis enabled tumor therapy. Herein, polyoxometalate nanozyme&#8208;based light&#8208;driven nanomotors were designed and synthesized for targeted synergistic photothermal&#8208;catalytic tumor therapy. In this construct, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the P2W18Fe4 polyoxometalates&#8208;based nanomotors can provide self&#8208;propulsion and facilitate their production of reactive oxygen species thus killing tumor cells, even in the weakly acidic tumor microenvironment. Conjugated polydopamine endows the nanomotors with capability of light&#8208;driven self&#8208;propulsion behavior. After 10 min of NIR (808 nm) irradiation, along with the help of epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, the targeted accumulation and penetration of nanomotors in the tumor enabled highly efficient synergistic photothermal&#8208;catalytic therapy. This approach overcomes the disadvantages of the intrinsic fragile nature of enzyme&#8208;powered nanomotors in physiological environments, and more importantly, providing a motility&#8208;behavior promoted synergistic anti&#8208;tumor strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Binary Atomic Sites Enable a Confined Bidirectional Tandem Electrocatalytic Sulfur Conversion for Low&#8208;Temperature All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Na&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The broader implementation of current all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;S batteries is still plagued by high operation temperature and inefficient sulfur utilization. And the uncontrollable sulfur speciation pathway along with the sluggish polysulfide redox kinetics further compromise the theoretical potentials of Na&#8208;S chemistry. Herein, we report a confined bidirectional tandem electrocatalysis effect to tune polysulfide electrochemistry in a novel low&#8208;temperature (80oC) all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;S battery that utilizes Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic membrane as a platform. The bifunctional hollow sulfur matrix consisting binary atomically dispersed MnN4 and CoN4 hotspots was fabricated using a sacrificial template process. Upon discharge, CoN4 sites activate sulfur species and catalyze long&#8208;chain to short&#8208;chain polysulfides reduction, while MnN4 centers substantially accelerate the low&#8208;kinetic Na2S4 to Na2S directly conversion, manipulating the uniform deposition of electroactive Na2S and avoiding the formation of irreversible products (e.g., Na2S2). The intrinsic synergy of two catalytic centers benefits the Na2S decomposition and minimizes its activation barrier during battery recharging and then efficiently mitigate the cathodic passivation. As a result, the stable cycling of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;S cell delivers an attractive reversible capacity of 1060 mAh g&#8208;1 with a high CE of 98.5% and a high energy of 1008&#8201;Wh kgcathode&#8208;1, comparable to the liquid electrolyte cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Polymer Network for Efficient and Stable Perovskite/Si Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of highly efficient and stable wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially for monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem devices, is a key focus in achieving the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics. In this study, we initially designed poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) with varying alkyl chain lengths based on density functional theory calculations. Results pinpoint that PILs with longer alkyl chain lengths tend to exhibit more robust binding energy with the perovskite structure. Then we synthesized the PILs to craft a hydrophobic hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network (HHPN) that passivates the WBG perovskite/electron transport layer interface, inhibits ion migration and serves as a barrier layer against water and oxygen ingression. Accordingly, the HHPN effectively curbs nonradiative recombination losses while facilitating efficient carrier transport, resulting in substantially enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor. As a result, the optimized single&#8208;junction WBG PSC achieves an impressive efficiency of 23.18%, with VOC as high as 1.25 V, which is&#160;the highest reported for WBG (over 1.67 eV) PSCs. These devices also demonstrate outstanding thermostability and humidity resistance. Notably, this versatile strategy can be extended to textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells, reaching a remarkable efficiency of 28.24% while maintaining exceptional operational stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Pyridines via a Nitrene Internalization Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyridines are valuable pharmacophores, and their access via direct and selective transmutation of carbon atom with desired nitrogen could become crucial in drug discovery processes. However, very little has been witnessed in such C&#8208;to&#8208;N&#8208;transmutation reactions of aromatics that could lead to facile synthesis of pyridines or higher azaarenes. In this context, Levin and co&#8208;workers recently disclosed a process for procuring pyridines from the corresponding aryl azides via the regioselective nitrene internalization process without perturbing the rest of the aromatic skeleton. This innovative work enabled access to various pyridine derivatives selectively through direct nitrogen scan operations on benzene derivatives, which otherwise was not feasible.</dc:description>

         <title>Superfast Formation of C(sp2)&#8208;N, C(sp2)&#8208;P, and C(sp2)&#8208;S Vinylic Bonds in Water Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report examples of C(sp2)&#8208;N, C(sp2)&#8208;S, and C(sp2)&#8208;P bond&#8208;forming transformations in water microdroplets at room temperature and atmospheric pressure using N2 as a nebulizing gas. When an aqueous solution of vinylic acid and amine is electrosprayed (+3 kV), the corresponding C(sp2)&#8208;N product is formed in a single step, which was characterized using mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS2). The scope of this reaction was extended to other amines and other unsaturated acids, including acrylic (CH2=CHCOOH) and crotonic (CH3CH=CHCOOH) acids. We also found that thiols and phosphines are viable nucleophiles, and the corresponding C(sp2)&#8208;S and C(sp2)&#8208;P products are observed in positive ion mode using MS and MS2.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Construction of a Polar Material Exhibiting Strong Broad&#8208;Spectrum Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation and Large Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considerable effort has been invested in the development of non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) inorganic solids for ferroelectricity&#8208;, piezoelectricity&#8208; and, particularly, optical nonlinearity&#8208;related applications. While great progress has been made, a persistent problem is the difficulty in constructing NCS materials, which probably stems from non&#8208;directionality and unsaturation of the ionic bonds between metal counter&#8208;cations and covalent anionic modules. We report herein a secondary&#8208;bond&#8208;driven approach that circumvents the cancellation of dipole moments between adjacent anionic modules that has plagued second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) material design, and which thereby affords a polar structure with strong SHG properties. The resultant first NCS counter&#8208;cation&#8208;free iodate, VO2(H2O)(IO3) (VIO), a new class of iodate, crystallizes in a polar lattice with VO2(H2O)(IO3)] zigzag chains connected by weak hydrogen bonds and intermolecular forces. VIO exhibits very large SHG responses (18 &#215; KH2PO4 @ 1200 nm, 1.5 &#215; KTiOPO4 @ 2100 nm) and sufficient birefringence (0.184 @ 546 nm). Calculations and crystal structure analysis attribute the large SHG responses to consistent polarization orientations of the VO2(H2O)(IO3)] chains controlled by secondary bonds. This study highlights the advantages of manipulating the secondary bonds in inorganic solids to control NCS structure and optical nonlinearity, affording a new perspective in the development of high&#8208;performance NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Idiosyncratic Ionic Generator Working in Iso&#8208;Osmotic Solutions Via Ligand Confined Assembled in Gaps Between Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous reported bioinspired osmotic energy conversion systems employing cation&#8208;/ anion&#8208;selective membrane and solutions with different salinity are actually far from the biological counterpart. The iso&#8208;osmotic power generator with the specific ionic permselective channels (e.g., K+&#160;or Na+&#160;channels) which just allow specific ions get across and iso&#8208;osmotic solutions still remain challenges. Inspired by nature, we report a bioinspired K+&#8208;channel by employing a K+&#160;selective ligand, 1,1,1&#8208;tris{[(2&#8217;&#8208;benzylaminoformyl)phenoxy]methyl}ethane (BMP) and graphene oxide membrane. Specifically, the&#160;K+&#160;and Na+selectivity of&#160;the prepared system could reach up to ~17.8, and the molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the excellent permselectivity of K+&#160;is mainly stemmed from the formed suitable channel size. Thus, we assembled the K+&#8208;selective iso&#8208;osmotic power generator (KSIPG) with the power density up to ~15.1 mW/m2&#160;between equal concentration solutions, which is higher than traditional charge&#8208;selective osmotic power generator (CSOPG). The proposed strategy has well shown the realizable approach to construct&#160;single&#8208;ion selective channels&#8208;based highly efficient iso&#8208;osmotic energy conversion systems and would surely inspire new applications in other fields, including self&#8208;powered system and medical materials, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Photosensitizer with High Enrichment in Tumor Cells Based on a Multi&#8208;effect Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) probes and photosensitizers (PSs) have emerged as promising tools for molecular imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, living organisms, especially animals, are highly dynamic systems; selective retention or even enrichment of these reagents after enzymatic activation at or near sites of interest remains a challenging task. Herein, we integrate the non&#8208;covalent and covalent retention approaches to introduce a novel &#8220;1&#8208;to&#8208;3&#8221; multi&#8208;effect strategy &#8212; one enzyme stimulus leads to three types of effects &#8212; for the design of enzyme&#8208;activatable NIR probe or PS. Using this strategy, we have constructed an alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;activatable NIR fluorogenic probe and a NIR PS, both of which proved to be selectively activated by ALP to switch on NIR fluorescence or photosensitizing ability. Additionally, these reagents resulted in significant enrichment (over 2000&#8208;fold) in ALP&#8208;overexpressed tumor cells, accompanied by massive depletion of intracellular thiols, the major antioxidants in cells. The investigation of this ALP&#8208;activatable NIR PS in in vivo PDT resulted in complete suppression of HeLa tumors and full recovery of all tested mice. Encouragingly, even a single PDT with this NIR PS was sufficient to completely suppress tumors in mice, demonstrating the high potential of this strategy in biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Zn Atoms with Acetate&#8208;Anion&#8208;Enabled Asymmetric Coordination for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring unique single&#8208;atom sites capable of efficiently reducing O2 to H2O2 while being inert to H2O2 decomposition under light conditions is significant for H2O2 photosynthesis, but it remains challenging. Herein, we report the facile design and fabrication of polymeric carbon nitride (CN) decorated with single&#8208;Zn sites that have tailorable local coordination environments, which is enabled by utilizing different Zn salt anions. Specifically, the O atom from acetate (OAc) anion participates in the coordination of single&#8208;Zn sites on CN, forming asymmetric Zn&#8208;N3O moiety on CN (denoted as CN/ZnOAc), in contrast to the obtained Zn&#8208;N4 sites when sulfate (SO4) is adopted (CN/Zn&#8208;SO4). Both experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the Zn&#8208;N3O moiety exhibits higher intrinsic activity for O2 reduction to H2O2 than the Zn&#8208;N4 moiety. This is attributed to the asymmetric N/O coordination, which promotes the adsorption of O2 and the formation of the key intermediate *OOH on Zn sites due to their modulated electronic structure. Moreover, it is inactive for H2O2 decomposition under both dark and light conditions. As a result, the optimized CN/Zn&#8208;OAc catalyst exhibits significantly improved photocatalytic H2O2 production activity under visible light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Discrimination of Disaccharide Isomers of Different Glycosidic Linkages Using a Modified MspA Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disaccharides are composed of two monosaccharide subunits joined by a glycosidic linkage in an &#945; or &#946; configuration. Different combinations of isomeric monosaccharide subunits and different glycosidic linkages result in different isomeric disaccharide products. Thus, direct discrimination of these disaccharide isomers from a mixture is extremely difficult. In this paper, a hetero&#8208;octameric Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore conjugated with a phenylboronic acid (PBA) adapter was applied for disaccharide sensing, with which three most widely known disaccharides in nature, including sucrose, lactose and maltose, were clearly discriminated. Besides, all six isomeric &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranosyl&#8208;D&#8208;fructoses, differing only in their glycosidic linkages, were also well resolved. Assisted by a custom machine learning algorithm, a 0.99 discrimination accuracy is achieved. Nanopore discrimination of disaccharide isomers with different glycosidic linkages, which has never been previously demonstrated, is inspiring for nanopore saccharide sequencing. This sensing capacity was also applied in direct identification of isomaltulose additives in a commercial sucrose&#8208;free yogurt, from which isomaltulose, lactose and L&#8208;lactic acid were simultaneously detected.</dc:description>

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly for Controlling over Helical Nanostructures and Topochemical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly, in which a single building block forms two or more types of self&#8208;assembled nanostructures, is an important topic due to its mimic to the complexity in biology and manipulation of diverse supramolecular materials. Here, we report a pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly using chiral glutamide derivatives (L or D&#8208;PAG), which form chiral nanotwist and nanotube through a cooperative slow cooling and an isodesmic fast cooling process, respectively. Furthermore, pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly can be harnessed to control over the supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of PAG with a luminophore &#946;&#8208;DCS or a photopolymerizable PCDA. Fast cooling leads to the co&#8208;assembled PAG/&#946;&#8208;DCS nanotube exhibiting green circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), while slow cooling to nanofiber with blue CPL. &#160;Additionally, fast cooling process promotes the photopolymerization of PCDA into a red chiral polymer, whereas slow cooling inhibits the polymerization. This work not only demonstrates the pathway&#8208;dependent control over structural characteristics but also highlights the diverse functions emerged from the different assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Dominance of the Dissolution&#8208;Deposition Mechanism in Aqueous Zn&#8208;MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries have attracted extensive attention for grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications, however, the energy storage chemistry of MnO2 in mild acidic aqueous electrolytes remains elusive and controversial. Using &#945;&#8208;MnO2 as a case study, we developed a methodology by coupling conventional coin batteries with customized beaker batteries to pinpoint the operating mechanism of Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries. This approach visually simulates the operating state of batteries in different scenarios and allows for a comprehensive study of the operating mechanism of aqueous Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries under mild acidic conditions. It is validated that the electrochemical performance can be modulated by controlling the addition of Mn2+ to the electrolyte. The method is utilized to systematically eliminate the possibility of Zn2+ and/or H+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation reactions, thereby confirming the dominance of the MnO2/Mn2+ dissolution&#8208;deposition mechanism. By combining a series of phase and spectroscopic characterizations, the compositional, morphological and structural evolution of electrodes and electrolytes during battery cycling is probed, elucidating the intrinsic battery chemistry of MnO2 in mild acid electrolytes. Such a methodology developed can be extended to other energy storage systems, providing a universal approach to accurately identify the reaction mechanism of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Weak Solvation Effect Induced Optimal Interfacial Chemistry Enables Highly Durable Zn Anodes for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as one of the most reliable energy storage technologies for scale&#8208;up application, but still suffer from the instability of Zn anode, which is mainly caused by the undesirable dendrite growth and side reactions. To tackle these issues, we formulate a new aqueous electrolyte with weak solvation effect by introducing low&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant acetone to achieve H2O&#8208;poor solvation structure of Zn2+. Experimental and theoretical calculation studies concurrently reveal that such solvation structure can: i) relieve the solvated H2O related side reactions, ii) suppress the dendrite growth by boosting the desolvation kinetics of Zn2+ and iii) in&#8208;situ form solid electrolyte interface (SEI) to synergistically inhibit the side reaction and dendrite growth. The synergy of these three factors prolongs the cycling life of Cu/Zn asymmetric cell from 30 h to more than 800 h at 1 mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2, and can work at more harsh condition of 5 mA cm&#8722;2/5 mAh cm&#8722;2. More encouragingly, Zn/V2O5&#183;nH2O full cell also shows enhanced cycling stability of 95.9% capacity retention after 1000 cycles, much better than that with baseline electrolyte (failing at ~700th cycle).</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulated Fluoro&#8208;Ether derived Nucleophilic Decomposition Products for Mitigating Polarization&#8208;Induced Capacity Loss in Li&#8208;Rich Layered Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte engineering is a fascinating choice to improve the performance of Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes (LRLO) for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, many existing electrolyte designs and adjustment principles tend to overlook the unique challenges posed by LRLO, particularly the nucleophilic attack. Here, we introduce an electrolyte modification by locally replacing carbonate solvents in traditional electrolytes with a fluoro&#8208;ether. By benefit of the decomposition of fluoro&#8208;ether under nucleophilic O&#8208;related attacks, which delivers an excellent passivation layer with LiF and polymers, possessing rigidity and flexibility on the LRLO surface. More importantly, the fluoro&#8208;ether acts as "sutures", ensuring the integrity and stability of both interfacial and bulk structures, which contributed to suppressing severe polarization and enhancing the cycling capacity retention from 39% to 78% after 300 cycles for the 4.8 V&#8208;class LRLO. This key electrolyte strategy with comprehensive analysis, provides new insights into addressing nucleophilic challenge for high&#8208;energy anionic redox related cathode systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysed&#8208;multicomponent reactions between flue gas CO2 and cheap industrial raw stocks into high value&#8208;added fine chemicals is a promising manner for the ideal CO2 utilization route. To achieve this, the key fundamental challenge is the rational development of highly efficient and facile reaction pathway while establishing compatible catalytic system. Herein, through the stepwise solvent&#8208;assisted linker installation, post&#8208;synthetic fluorination and metalation, we report the construction of a series of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;decorated noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) PCN&#8208;(BPY&#8208;CuI)&#8208;(TPDC&#8208;Fx) [BPY = 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate, TPDC&#8208;NH2 = 2'&#8208;amino&#8208;[1,1':4',1''&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4''&#8208;dicarboxylic acid] that can catalyze the one&#8208;pot four&#8208;component reaction between alkyne, aldehyde, amine and flue gas CO2 for the preparation of 2&#8208;oxazolidinones. Such assembly endows the MOFs with superhydrophobic microenvironment, superior water resistance and highly stable catalytic site, leading to 21 times higher turnover numbers than that of homogeneous counterparts. Mechanism investigation implied that the substrates can be efficiently enriched by the MOF wall and then the adsorbed amine species act as an extrinsic binding site towards dilute CO2 through their strong preferential formation to carbamate acid. Moreover, density functional theory calculations suggest the tetrahedral geometry of Cu in MOF offers special resistance towards amine poisoning, thus maintaining its high efficiency during the catalytic process.</dc:description>

         <title>Azide Ionic Liquids for Safe, Green, and Highly&#8208;Efficient Azidation Reactions to Produce Azide Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azide&#8208;containing materials are widely applied in numerous fields, but always require undesired harsh synthetic conditions. This work establishes a safe, green, and highly efficient synthesis route for azide&#8208;containing materials by designing two novel azide ionic liquids, which can function as both reagents and solvents for highly efficient azidation reactions.







Abstract
Azide compounds are widely used and especially, polymers bearing pendant azide groups are highly desired in numerous fields. However, harsh reaction conditions are always mandatory to achieve full azidation, causing severe side reactions and degradation of the polymers. Herein, we report the design and preparation of two azide ionic liquids (AILs) with azide anion and triethylene glycol (E3)&#8208;containing cation, [P444E3][N3] and [MIME3][N3]. Compared with the traditional sodium azide (NaN3) approach, both AILs showed much higher reaction rates and functional&#8208;group tolerance. More importantly, they could act as both reagents and solvents for the quantitative azidation of various polymeric precursors under mild conditions. Theoretical simulations suggested that the outstanding performance of AILs originated from the existence of ion pairs during the reaction, and the E3 moieties played a crucial role. Lastly, after the reaction, the AILs could be easily regenerated, presenting a safer, greener, and highly efficient synthesis route for azide polymers.

         <title>Photoswitchable Enantioselective and Helix&#8208;Sense Controlled Living Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two enantiomeric PdII/LR&#8722;azo and PdII/LS&#8722;azo could be used as reversible photo&#8208;switchable catalysts for living/controlled polymerization of isocyanide monomers. High enantioselectivity and helix&#8208;sense polymerization could be observed during the polymerization process.







Abstract
A pair of enantiomeric photoswitchable PdII catalysts, alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo and alkyne&#8208;PdII/LS&#8722;azo, were prepared via the coordination of alkyne&#8208;PdII and azobenzene&#8208;modified phosphine ligands LR&#8722;azo and LS&#8722;azo. Owing to the cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization of the azobenzene moiety, alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo and alkyne&#8208;PdII/LS&#8722;azo exhibited different polymerization activities, helix&#8208;sense selectivities, and enantioselectivities during the polymerization of isocyanide monomers under irradiation of different wavelength lights. Furthermore, the achiral isocyanide monomer A&#8208;1 could be polymerized efficiently using alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo under dark condition in a living/controlled manner. Further, it generated single right&#8208;handed helical poly&#8208;A&#8208;1m(LR&#8722;azo), confirmed by the circular dichroism spectra and atomic force microscopy images. However, the polymerization of A&#8208;1 almost could not be initiated under 420&#8197;nm light in identical conditions of dark condition. Moreover, the photoswitchable catalyst alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo exhibited high enantioselectivity for the polymerization of the racemates of L&#8208;1 and D&#8208;1, respectively. D&#8208;1 was polymerized preferentially under dark condition with a D&#8208;1/L&#8208;1 rate ratio of 70, yielding single right&#8208;handed polyisocyanides. Additionally, reversible enantioselectivity was observed under 420&#8197;nm light using alkyne&#8208;PdII/LR&#8722;azo, and the calculated polymerization rate ratio of L&#8208;1/D&#8208;1 was 57 because of the isomerization of the azobenzene moiety of the catalyst. Furthermore, alkyne&#8208;PdII/LS&#8722;azo showed opposite enantioselectivity and helix&#8208;sense selectivity during the polymerization of the racemates of L&#8208;1 and D&#8208;1.

         <title>Ultrafluorogenic Monochromophore&#8208;Type BODIPY&#8208;Tetrazine Series for Dual&#8208;Color Bioorthogonal Imaging with a Single Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of ultrafluorogenic BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes, employing a monochromophoric strategy to acheive broad&#8208;spectrum fluorogenicity and effective bioorthogonal cellular imaging. These probes showcase a unique turn&#8208;on pattern with BCN and TCO, pioneering dual&#8208;color live&#8208;cell imaging with a single probe.







Abstract
Various fluorogenic probes utilizing tetrazine (Tz) as a fluorescence quencher and bioorthogonal reaction partner have been extensively studied over the past few decades. Herein, we synthesized a series of boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;Tz probes using monochromophoric design strategy for bioorthogonal cellular imaging. The BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes exhibited excellent bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN)&#8208;selective fluorogenicity with three&#8208; to four&#8208;digit&#8208;fold enhancements in fluorescence over a wide range of emission wavelengths, including the far&#8208;red region. Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes in bioorthogonal fluorescence imaging of cellular organelles without washing steps. We also elucidated the aromatized pyridazine moiety as the origin of BCN&#8208;selective fluorogenic behavior. Additionally, we discovered that the fluorescence of the trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) adducts was quenched in aqueous media via photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) process. Interestingly, we observed a distinctive recovery of the initially quenched fluorescence of BODIPY&#8208;Tz&#8208;TCO upon exposure to hydrophobic media, accompanied by a significant bathochromic shift of its emission wavelength relative to that exhibited by the corresponding BODIPY&#8208;Tz&#8208;BCN. Leveraging this finding, for the first time, we achieved dual&#8208;color bioorthogonal cellular imaging with a single BODIPY&#8208;Tz probe.

         <title>A Phosphine&#8208;Amine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework with Staggered Stacking Structure for Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphine&#8208;amine&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional COF crystallizes via a nucleophilic substitution reaction of phosphazene with amines, featuring an opposite staggered stacking of the interlocked dual layer in a unit cell. Post&#8208;quaternization on phosphazene moieties leads to the exfoliation of the staggered stacking COF into the few&#8208;layer ionized nanosheets, which can decouple lithium salts for rapid solid&#8208;state ion transport.







Abstract
In&#8208;plane ionic conduction over two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials is desirable for flexible electronics. Exfoliating 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) towards a few layers is highly anticipated, whereas most examples remain robust via &#960;&#8208;stacking against the interlayered dislocation. Herein, we synthesize a phosphine&#8208;amine&#8208;linked 2D COF by a nucleophilic substitution reaction of phosphazene with amines. The synthesized COF is crystalline, and stacks in an AB&#8208;staggered fashion, wherein the AB dual layers are interlocked by embedding P&#8722;Cl bonds from one to another layer, and the non&#8208;interlocked layers are readily delaminated. Therefore, in situ post&#8208;quaternization over phosphazene can improve the ionization of backbones, accompanied by layered exfoliation. The ultrathin nanosheets can decouple lithium salts for fast solid&#8208;state ion transport, achieving a high conductivity and low activation energy. Our findings explore the P&#8722;N substitution reaction for COF crystallization and demonstrate that the staggered stacking 2D COFs are readily exfoliated for designing solid electrolytes.

Our findings explore the P&#8722;N substitution reaction for COF crystallization and demonstrate that the staggered stacking 2D COFs are readily exfoliated for designing solid electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous Capture of CO2 Boosting Its Electroreduction in the Micropores of a Metal&#8211;organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction occurs in the pores of a porous catalyst possessing CO2 capture sites, which boosts the catalytic performance virtually independent on the CO2 concentration.







Abstract
Integration of CO2 capture capability from simulated flue gas and electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) active sites into a catalyst is a promising cost&#8208;effective strategy for carbon neutrality, but is of great difficulty. Herein, combining the mixed gas breakthrough experiments and eCO2RR tests, we showed that an Ag12 cluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (1&#8208;NH2, aka Ag12bpy&#8208;NH2), simultaneously possessing CO2 capture sites as &#8220;CO2 relays&#8221; and eCO2RR active sites, can not only utilize its micropores to efficiently capture CO2 from simulated flue gas (CO2&#8201;:&#8201;N2=15&#8201;:&#8201;85, at 298&#8197;K), but also catalyze eCO2RR of the adsorbed CO2 into CO with an ultra&#8208;high CO2 conversion of 60&#8201;%. More importantly, its eCO2RR performance (a Faradaic efficiency (CO) of 96&#8201;% with a commercial current density of 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a very low cell voltage of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V for 300&#8197;hours and the full&#8208;cell energy conversion efficiency of 56&#8201;%) under simulated flue gas atmosphere is close to that under 100&#8201;% CO2 atmosphere, and higher than those of all reported catalysts at higher potentials under 100&#8201;% CO2 atmosphere. This work bridges the gap between CO2 enrichment/capture and eCO2RR.

         <title>Mobility&#8208;Modulated Sequential Dissociation Analysis Enables Structural Lipidomics in Mass Spectrometry Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mobility&#8208;modulated sequential dissociation acquisition method was developed for mass spectrometry imaging to enable spatial lipidomics capable of multiplexed MS/MS imaging of 24 structurally distinct lipids, using a robust spectrum deconvolution algorithm. From a human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue, this method revealed a phosphatidylethanolamine isomer (PE 18&#8201;:&#8201;1_18&#8201;:&#8201;1) as a potential biomarker.







Abstract
Spatial lipidomics based on mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful tool for fundamental biology studies and biomarker discovery. But the structure&#8208;resolving capability of MSI is limited because of the lack of multiplexed tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method, primarily due to the small sample amount available from each pixel and the poor ion usage in MS/MS analysis. Here, we report a mobility&#8208;modulated sequential dissociation (MMSD) strategy for multiplex MS/MS imaging of distinct lipids from biological tissues. With ion mobility&#8208;enabled data&#8208;independent acquisition and automated spectrum deconvolution, MS/MS spectra of a large number of lipid species from each tissue pixel are acquired, at no expense of imaging speed. MMSD imaging is highlighted by MS/MS imaging of 24 structurally distinct lipids in the mouse brain and the revealing of the correlation of a structurally distinct phosphatidylethanolamine isomer (PE 18&#8201;:&#8201;1_18&#8201;:&#8201;1) from a human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue. Mapping of structurally distinct lipid isomers is now enabled and spatial lipidomics becomes feasible for MSI.

         <title>Aptamer&#8208;Assisted Blockade of the Immune Suppressor Sialic Acid&#8208;Binding Immunoglobulin&#8208;Like Lectin&#8208;15 for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the discovered aptamer, we developed an aptamer&#8208;assisted blockade of the immune suppressor Siglec&#8208;15 (sialic acid&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectin&#8208;15) for cancer immunotherapy. Importantly, the developed aptamer&#8208;based immunotherapy amplified anti&#8208;tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment and inhibited tumor growth/metastasis in syngeneic mouse model by augmenting of macrophage and T cell functionality.







Abstract
The percentage of low response and adaptive resistance to current antibody&#8208;based immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy requires the development of novel immunotherapy strategies. Here, we developed an aptamer&#8208;assisted immune checkpoint blockade (Ap&#8208;ICB) against sialic acid&#8208;binding immunoglobulin&#8208;like lectin&#8208;15 (Siglec&#8208;15), a novel immune suppressor broadly upregulated on cancer cells and tumor infiltrating myeloid cells, which is mutually exclusive of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Using protein aptamer selection, we identified WXY3 aptamer with high affinity against Siglec&#8208;15 protein/Siglec&#8208;15 positive cells. We demonstrated that WXY3 aptamer rescued antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the WXY3 Ap&#8208;ICB against Siglec&#8208;15 amplified anti&#8208;tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment and inhibited tumor growth/metastasis in syngeneic mouse model, which may result from enhanced macrophage and T cell functionality. In addition, by using aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids, we developed a synergetic ICB strategy of multivalent binding and steric hindrance, which further improves the in vivo anti&#8208;tumor effect. Taken together, our results support Ap&#8208;ICB targeted Siglec&#8208;15 as a potential strategy for normalization cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Chiral Gold Nanorods with Five&#8208;Fold Rotational Symmetry and Orientation&#8208;Dependent Chiroptical Properties of Their Monomers and Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scattering dissymmetry factor (gs&#8208;factor) peaks of the horizontal chiral Au nanorods are redshifted with higher intensities compared to those of the vertical chiral Au nanorods. The intensity of the chiral response of the side&#8208;by&#8208;side chiral nanorod dimers is reduced because of the coupling between the plasmon resonance modes.







Abstract
Chiral plasmonic nanoparticles have attracted much attention because of their strong chiroptical responses and broad scientific applications. However, the types of chiral plasmonic nanoparticles have remained limited. Herein we report on a new type of chiral nanoparticle, chiral Au nanorod (NR) with five&#8208;fold rotational symmetry, which is synthesized using chiral molecules. Three different types of Au seeds (Au elongated nanodecahedrons, nanodecahedrons, and nanobipyramids) are used to study the growth behaviors. Different synthesis parameters, including the chiral molecules, surfactant, reductant, seeds, and Au precursor, are systematically varied to optimize the chiroptical responses of the chiral Au NRs. The chiral scattering measurements on the individual chiral Au NRs and their dimers are performed. Intriguingly, the chiroptical signals of the individual chiral Au NRs and their end&#8208;to&#8208;end dimers are similar, while those of the side&#8208;by&#8208;side dimers are largely reduced. Theoretical calculations and numerical simulations reveal that the different chiroptical responses of the chiral NR dimers are originated from the coupling effect between the plasmon resonance modes. Our study enriches chiral plasmonic nanoparticles and provides valuable insight for the design of plasmonic nanostructures with desired chiroptical properties.

         <title>Crystallization Regulation by Self&#8208;Assembling Liquid Crystal Template Enables Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

A new ionic liquid crystal (ILC, 1&#8208;Dodecyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) was developed to modify buried interface of perovskite solar cells (PSC). The ILC promotes a preferential growth of perovskite along [001] direction and exhibits strong interaction with perovskite to passivate defects. The ILC&#8208;modified PSC delivers an efficiency of 24.92&#8201;% and maintains 94&#8201;% of the original value after storage in ambient for 3000&#8197;h.







Abstract
It is found that the disordered growth of bottom perovskite film deteriorates the buried interface of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), so developing a new material to modify the buried interface for regulating the crystal growth and defect passivation is an effective approach for improving the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Here, we developed a new ionic liquid crystal (ILC, 1&#8208;Dodecyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) as both crystal regulator and defect passivator to modify the buried interface of PSCs. The high lattice matching between this ILC and perovskite promotes preferential growth of perovskite film along [001] direction, while the oriented ILC with mesomorphic phase has a strong chemical interaction with perovskite to passivate the interface defect, as a result, the modified buried interface exhibits suppressed defects, improved band alignment, reduced nonradiative recombination losses, and enhanced charge extraction. The ILC&#8208;modified PSC delivers a power conversion efficiency of 24.92&#8201;% and maintains 94&#8201;% of the original value after storage in ambient for 3000&#8197;h.

         <title>Promoting Syngas to Olefins with Isolated Internal Silanols&#8208;Enriched Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 Aluminosilicate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional catalyst composed of Zn2Al3O4 and Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with 17&#8208;membered&#8208;ring pores and internal isolated silanols exhibits high propylene and butene selectivity accounting for 88&#8201;% in C2&#8211;4=. The weak acidity prohibited the second reaction of olefins and isolated internal SiOH groups and promoted the desorption of C3&#8211;4= molecules.







Abstract
Selective conversion of syngas to value&#8208;added olefins has attracted considerable research interest. Regulating product distribution remains challenging, such as achieving higher olefin selectivity, propylene/ethylene (P/E) and olefin/paraffin (O/P) ratios. A new pentasil zeolite Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with recently approved &#8722;ION structure, composed of 17&#8208;membered&#8208;ring (MR) extra&#8208;large lobed pores and intersected 10&#8208;MR medium pores, shows a C2&#8211;6= selectivity up to 85&#8201;% and a high O/P value of 14 in the conversion of syngas when being combined with ZnaAlbOx oxide. Moreover, for the high&#8208;silica Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 with Si/Al ratio of 400, the selectivity of propylene and butene accounts for 88&#8201;% in C2&#8211;4=, resulting in high P/E (&gt;4) and butene/ethylene (B/E &gt;3) ratios. The high C3&#8211;4= selectivity is contributed by two main reasons, that is, the relatively weak acidity of Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 zeolite enhances the olefin&#8208;based cycle revealed by the probe reactions of methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene (MTP) and 1&#8208;hexene cracking, and the rich isolated internal SiOH groups in Al&#8208;IDM&#8208;1 promote the desorption of C3&#8211;4=, once they are formed inside zeolite pores.

         <title>Rapid Charge Transfer Enabled by Noncovalent Interaction through Guest Insertion in Supercapacitors based on Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular insertion strategy is used by introducing non&#8208;covalent interactions in COFs to form a continuous charge transfer channel and accelerate the charge transfer rate. Meanwhile, the enhanced conductivity activates the redox sites in the COF skeleton, resulting in excellent energy storage performance. In addition, the energy storage behavior can be accurately regulated by changing the type of insertion guests.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been proposed for electrochemical energy storage, although the poor conductivity resulted from covalent bonds limits their practical performance. Here, we propose to introduce noncovalent bonds in COFs through a molecular insertion strategy for improving the conductivity of the COFs as supercapacitor. The synthesized COFs (MI&#8722;COFs) establish equilibriums between covalent bonds and noncovalent bonds, which construct a continuous charge transfer channel to enhance the conductivity. The rapid charge transfer rate enables the COFs to activate the redox sites, bringing about excellent electrochemical energy storage behavior. The results show that the MI&#8722;COFs exhibit much better performance in specific capacitance and capacity retention rate than those of most COFs&#8208;based supercapacitors. Moreover, through simply altering inserted guests, the mode and strength of noncovalent bond can be adjusted to obtain different energy storage characteristics. The introduction of noncovalent bonds is an effective and flexible way to enhance and regulate the properties of COFs, providing a valuable direction for the development of novel COFs&#8208;based energy storage materials.

         <title>Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;Based Noncovalent Conformational Lock Achieves Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency over 24 %</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;based noncovalently conformational locks for organic HTMs ZS13, which shows good charge transfer properties, thermal stability and passivation function. Perovskite solar cells using ZS13 as doped HTM yield a champion device efficiency of 24.39&#8201;% with good thermal and light stability.







Abstract
Organic semiconductors with noncovalently conformational locks (OSNCs) are promising building blocks for hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs). However, lack of satisfied neighboring building blocks negatively impacts the optoelectronic properties of OSNCs&#8208;based HTMs and imperils the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). To address this limitation, we introduce the benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (BTT) to construct a new OSNC, and the resulting HTM ZS13 shows improved intermolecular charge extraction/transport properties, proper energy level, efficient surface passivation effect. Consequently, the champion devices based on doped ZS13 yield an efficiency of 24.39&#8201;% and 20.95&#8201;% for aperture areas of 0.1 and 1.01&#8197;cm2, respectively. Furthermore, ZS13 shows good thermal stability and the capability of inhibiting I&#8722; ion migration, thus, leading to enhanced device stability. The success in neighboring&#8208;group engineering can triggered a strong interest in developing thienoacene&#8208;based OSNCs toward efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Small Cobalt Nanoparticles Favor Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction Over Methanation Under CO2 Hydrogenation Conditions

Small cobalt nanoparticles readily oxidize under CO2 hydrogenation conditions according to X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, favoring reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction, in contrast to larger particles that remain metallic and catalyze methanation.







Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;based catalysts are well&#8208;known to convert syngas into a variety of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch (FTS) products depending on the various reaction parameters, in particular particle size. In contrast, the reactivity of these particles has been much less investigated in the context of CO2 hydrogenation. In that context, Surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) was employed to synthesize highly dispersed cobalt nanoparticles (Co&#8208;NPs) with particle sizes ranging from 1.6 to 3.0&#8197;nm. These SOMC&#8208;derived Co&#8208;NPs display significantly different catalytic performances under CO2 hydrogenation conditions: while the smallest cobalt nanoparticles (1.6&#8197;nm) catalyze mainly the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (rWGS) reaction, the larger nanoparticles (2.1&#8211;3.0&#8197;nm) favor the expected methanation activity. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy shows that the smaller cobalt particles are fully oxidized under CO2 hydrogenation conditions, while the larger ones remain mostly metallic, paralleling the observed difference of catalytic performances. This fundamental shift of selectivity, away from methanation to reverse water&#8208;gas shift for the smaller nanoparticles is noteworthy and correlates with the formation of CoO under CO2 hydrogenation conditions.

         <title>Tetra&#8208; and Hexavalent Siglec&#8208;8 Ligands Modulate Immune Cell Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siglec&#8208;8 is a potential therapeutic target for eosinophil&#8208; and mast&#8208;cell&#8208;related disorders. With structural modifications and oligo&#8208; to multivalent presentations, the low affinity of the natural ligand was decisively improved. As shown in immune cell assays, a biological effect is not only induced by a multivalent but also by a hexavalent ligand, whereas a monovalent ligand, despite binding with similar affinity, shows only an antagonistic effect.







Abstract
Carbohydrate&#8208;binding proteins are generally characterized by poor affinities for their natural glycan ligands, predominantly due to the shallow and solvent&#8208;exposed binding sites. To overcome this drawback, nature has exploited multivalency to strengthen the binding by establishing multiple interactions simultaneously. The development of oligovalent structures frequently proved to be successful, not only for proteins with multiple binding sites, but also for proteins that possess a single recognition domain. Herein we present the syntheses of a number of oligovalent ligands for Siglec&#8208;8, a monomeric I&#8208;type lectin found on eosinophils and mast cells, alongside the thermodynamic characterization of their binding. While the enthalpic contribution of each binding epitope was within a narrow range to that of the monomeric ligand, the entropy penalty increased steadily with growing valency. Additionally, we observed a successful agonistic binding of the tetra&#8208; and hexavalent and, to an even larger extent, multivalent ligands to Siglec&#8208;8 on immune cells and modulation of immune cell activation. Thus, triggering a biological effect is not restricted to multivalent ligands but could be induced by low oligovalent ligands as well, whereas a monovalent ligand, despite binding with similar affinity, showed an antagonistic effect.

         <title>Improving Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution through Local Field Distortion in Mg/Fe Dual&#8208;site Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regulation of the Fe spin state in a Mg&#8722;Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst is realized by taking advantage of the local crystal field distortion induced by the large ionic radii difference between Fe/Mg. The as&#8208;synthesized catalyst demonstrates a low overpotential of 224&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for oxygen evolution reaction and an electrolysis voltage of only 1.542&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the overall water splitting.







Abstract
Transition metal single atom electrocatalysts (SACs) with metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8722;N&#8722;C) configuration show great potential in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereby the spin&#8208;dependent electrons must be allowed to transfer along reactants (OH&#8722;/H2O, singlet spin state) and products (O2, triplet spin state). Therefore, it is imperative to modulate the spin configuration in M&#8722;N&#8722;C to enhance the spin&#8208;sensitive OER energetics, which however remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a local field distortion induced intermediate to low spin transition by introducing a main&#8208;group element (Mg) into the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C architecture, and decode the underlying origin of the enhanced OER activity. We unveil that, the large ionic radii mismatch between Mg2+ and Fe2+ can cause a FeN4 in&#8208;plane square local field deformation, which triggers a favorable spin transition of Fe2+ from intermediate (dxy2dxz2dyz1dz21, 2.96 &#956;B) to low spin (dxy2dxz2dyz2, 0.95 &#956;B), and consequently regulate the thermodyna&#8208;mics of the elementary step with desired Gibbs free energies. The as&#8208;obtained Mg/Fe dual&#8208;site catalyst demonstrates a superior OER activity with an overpotential of 224&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an electrolysis voltage of only 1.542&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the overall water splitting, which outperforms those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transition metal SACs.

         <title>Generation of Aromatic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Radicals for Functionalization of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is the generation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radicals and their application in hydroamination, amidosulfenylation and bromoamination of unactivated alkenes. The resulting alkylated N&#8208;heterocyclic amines serve as important and versatile scaffolds that can be easily transformed into diverse functionalized molecules. Experimental data on the mechanism are presented.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals (NCRs) have been widely recognized as versatile synthetic intermediates for the construction of nitrogen containing molecules of high value. As such, there has been a long&#8208;standing interest in the field of organic synthesis to develop novel nitrogen&#8208;based radicals and explore their inherent reactivity. In this study, we present the generation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radicals and their application in a novel and diverse functionalization of unactivated alkenes. Bench&#8208;stable aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic pyridinium salts were employed as crucial NCR precursors, which enabled the efficient conversion of various unactivated alkenes into medicinally relevant alkylated N&#8208;heterocyclic amines. This approach offers an unexplored retrosynthetic disconnection for the synthesis of related molecules that commonly possess therapeutic value. Furthermore, this platform can be extended to the synthesis of densely functionalized heterocyclic amines by utilizing disulfides and diethyl bromomalonate as radical quenchers. Mechanistic investigations indicate an energy transfer (EnT) pathway involving the formation of a transient aromatic N&#8208;heterocyclic radical, radical addition to unactivated alkenes, and subsequent generation of the amination product through either hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) or radical addition processes.

         <title>Direct C&#8722;C Double Bond Cleavage of Alkenes Enabled by Highly Dispersed Cobalt Catalyst and Hydroxylamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild oxidative cleavage of alkene to form oxime ether was achieved by using single&#8208;atom cobalt catalyst and hydroxylamine. Diversified substrate patterns, including internal and terminal alkenes, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex alkenes were demonstrated. Detailed mechanistic studies pointed to a radical mechanism with cobalt/acid assisted C&#8722;C bond cleavage as the key step.







Abstract
The utilization of a single&#8208;atom catalyst to break C&#8722;C bonds merges the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis and presents an intriguing pathway for obtaining high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. Herein, a mild, selective, and sustainable oxidative cleavage of alkene to form oxime ether or nitrile was achieved by using atomically dispersed cobalt catalyst and hydroxylamine. Diversified substrate patterns, including symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkenes, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes, and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex alkenes were demonstrated. The reaction was successfully scaled up and demonstrated good performance in recycling experiments. The hot filtration test, catalyst poisoning and radical scavenger experiment, time kinetics, and studies on the reaction intermediate collectively pointed to a radical mechanism with cobalt/acid/O2 promoted C&#8722;C bond cleavage as the key step.

         <title>Tunable Chirality of Self&#8208;Assembled Dipeptides Mediated by Bipyridine Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of an N&#8208;terminal&#8208;protected phenylalanine&#8208;tyrosine dipeptide has been shown to proceed by multistep structural evolution involving spheres, right&#8208;handed helices and microribbons. A bipyridine derivative was introduced at different stoichiometric ratios to obtain thermodynamically stable chiral nanostructures (right&#8208; or left&#8208;handed helices). Ultrasound and enzyme catalysis are also effective strategies to regulate the chirality.







Abstract
Supramolecular peptide assemblies have been widely used for the development of biomedical, catalytical, and optical materials with chiral nanostructures in view of the intrinsic chirality of peptides. However, the assembly pathway and chiral transformation behavior of various peptides remain largely elusive especially for the transient assemblies under out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions. Herein, the N&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;protected phenylalanine&#8208;tyrosine dipeptide (Fmoc&#8208;FY) was used as a peptide assembly platform, which showed that the assembly proceeds multistep evolution. The original spheres caused by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) can nucleate and elongate into the formation of right&#8208;handed helices which were metastable and easily converted into microribbons. Interestingly, a bipyridine derivative can be introduced to effectively control the assembly pathway and induce the formation of thermodynamically stable right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helices at different stoichiometric ratios. In addition, the chiral assembly can also be regulated by ultrasound or enzyme catalysis. This minimalistic system not only broadens the nucleation&#8208;elongation mechanisms of protein aggregates but also promotes the controllable design and development of chiral biomaterials.

         <title>Disulfide Click Reaction for Stapling of S&#8208;terminal Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of disulfide linkers was established for Cys&#8722;Cys&#8722;(Cys) double/triple click stapling in only 1&#8197;min, bridging from 3 to 18 amino acid residues to deliver 18&#8208; to 48&#8208;membered locked peptides. The opposite unstapling process proceeded smoothly, making the reversible cross&#8208;linking reagents potentially suitable for peptide delivery.







Abstract
A disulfide click strategy is disclosed for stapling to enhance the metabolic stability and cellular permeability of therapeutic peptides. A 17&#8208;membered library of stapling reagents with adjustable lengths and angles was established for rapid double/triple click reactions, bridging S&#8208;terminal peptides from 3 to 18 amino acid residues to provide 18&#8208; to 48&#8208;membered macrocyclic peptides under biocompatible conditions. The constrained peptides exhibited enhanced anti&#8208;HCT&#8208;116 activity with a locked &#945;&#8208;helical conformation (IC50=6.81&#8197;&#956;M vs. biological incompetence for acyclic linear peptides), which could be unstapled for rehabilitation of the native peptides under the assistance of tris(2&#8208;carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). This protocol assembles linear peptides into cyclic peptides controllably to retain the diverse three&#8208;dimensional conformations, enabling their cellular uptake followed by release of the disulfides for peptide delivery.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Iron Regulating Electronic Structure of Iron Atom Clusters for Electrocatalytic H2O2 Production and Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalyst, comprised of oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe single atoms and atom clusters anchored onto bacterial cellulose&#8208;derived carbon, was successfully fabricated. This material exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity toward H2O2 production and allowed for coupling by an electro&#8208;Fenton process, primarily owing to the active sites of Fe atom clusters with optimized electronic structure regulated by Fe single atoms, resulting in the suitable binding strength of the *OOH intermediate.







Abstract
The integration of highly active single atoms (SAs) and atom clusters (ACs) into an electrocatalyst is critically important for high&#8208;efficiency two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here we report a tandem impregnation&#8208;pyrolysis&#8208;etching strategy to fabricate the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe SAs and ACs anchored on bacterial cellulose&#8208;derived carbon (BCC) (FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC). As the electrocatalyst, FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and selectivity toward 2e&#8722; ORR, affording an onset potential of 0.78&#8197;V (vs. RHE) and a high H2O2 selectivity of 96.5&#8201;% in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. In a flow cell reactor, the FeSAs/ACs&#8208;BCC also achieves high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 production with a yield rate of 12.51&#177;0.18&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a faradaic efficiency of 89.4&#8201;%&#177;1.3&#8201;% at 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the feasibility of coupling the produced H2O2 and electro&#8208;Fenton process for the valorization of ethylene glycol was explored in detail. The theoretical calculations uncover that the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Fe SAs effectively regulate the electronic structure of Fe ACs which are the 2e&#8722; ORR active sites, resulting in the optimal binding strength of *OOH intermediate for high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 production.

         <title>Intergranular Shielding for Ultrafine&#8208;Grained Mo&#8208;Doped Ni&#8208;Rich Li[Ni0.96Co0.04]O2 Cathode for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries with High Energy Density and Long Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;stage engineering strategy, i.e., the construction of strain&#8208;resistant ultrafine&#8208;grains and subsequent intergranular fluorination of the refined grains synergistically improved the structural and chemical durability of the Ni&#8208;enriched (Ni&#8805;95&#8201;%) cathode, effectively alleviating the structural degradation and gas generation, thereby enabling a long battery life.







Abstract
Deploying Ni&#8208;enriched (Ni&#8805;95&#8201;%) layered cathodes for high energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) requires resolving a series of technical challenges. Among them, the structural weaknesses of the cathode, vigorous reactivity of the labile Ni4+ ion species, gas evolution and associated cell swelling, and thermal instability issues are critical obstacles that must be solved. Herein, we propose an intuitive strategy that can effectively ameliorate the degradation of an extremely high&#8208;Ni&#8208;layered cathode, the construction of ultrafine&#8208;scale microstructure and subsequent intergranular shielding of grains. The formation of ultrafine grains in the Ni&#8208;enriched Li[Ni0.96Co0.04]O2 (NC96) cathode, achieved by impeding particle coarsening during cathode calcination, noticeably improved the mechanical durability and electrochemical performance of the cathode.

&lt;p&gt;A multi-stage engineering strategy, i.e., the construction of strain-resistant ultrafine-grains and subsequent intergranular fluorination of the refined grains synergistically improved the structural and chemical durability of the Ni-enriched (Ni&#8805;95&#8201;%) cathode, effectively alleviating the structural degradation and gas generation, thereby enabling a long battery life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploying Ni-enriched (Ni&#8805;95&#8201;%) layered cathodes for high energy-density lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) requires resolving a series of technical challenges. Among them, the structural weaknesses of the cathode, vigorous reactivity of the labile Ni&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ion species, gas evolution and associated cell swelling, and thermal instability issues are critical obstacles that must be solved. Herein, we propose an intuitive strategy that can effectively ameliorate the degradation of an extremely high-Ni-layered cathode, the construction of ultrafine-scale microstructure and subsequent intergranular shielding of grains. The formation of ultrafine grains in the Ni-enriched Li[Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.96&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NC96) cathode, achieved by impeding particle coarsening during cathode calcination, noticeably improved the mechanical durability and electrochemical performance of the cathode. However, the buildup of the strain-resistant microstructure in Mo-doped NC96 concurrently increased the cathode-electrolyte contact area at the secondary particle surface, which adversely accelerated parasitic reactions with the electrolyte. The intergranular protection of the refined microstructure resolved the remaining chemical instability of the Mo-doped NC96 cathode by forming an F-induced coating layer, effectively alleviating structural degradation and gas generation, thereby extending the battery's lifespan. The proposed strategies synergistically improved the structural and chemical durability of the NC96 cathode, satisfying the energy density, life cycle performance, and safety requirements for next-generation LIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Angstrom&#8208;Scale Electrochemistry at Electrodes with Dimensions Commensurable and Smaller than Individual Reacting Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical electrodes made with atomic&#8208;scale precision enable the exploration of angstroms&#8208;scale electrochemistry. Unique features including size effects of reacting species and surface blockade behavior due to the strong species&#8208;electrodes interactions are found dominating electrochemistry at the smallest possible scale.







Abstract
In nature and technologies, many chemical reactions occur at interfaces with dimensions approaching that of a single reacting species in nano&#8208; and angstrom&#8208;scale. Mechanisms governing reactions at this ultimately small spatial regime remain poorly explored because of challenges to controllably fabricate required devices and assess their performance in experiment. Here we report how efficiency of electrochemical reactions evolves for electrodes that range from just one atom in thickness to sizes comparable with and exceeding hydration diameters of reactant species. The electrodes are made by encapsulating graphene and its multilayers within insulating crystals so that only graphene edges remain exposed and partake in reactions. We find that limiting current densities characterizing electrochemical reactions exhibit a pronounced size effect if reactant's hydration diameter becomes commensurable with electrodes&#8217; thickness. An unexpected blockade effect is further revealed from electrodes smaller than reactants, where incoming reactants are blocked by those adsorbed temporarily at the atomically narrow interfaces. The demonstrated angstrom&#8208;scale electrochemistry offers a venue for studies of interfacial behaviors at the true molecular scale.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Component Dual Donor Enables Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered Co&#8208;release of Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>

Sulfur&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone was successfully developed as a single&#8208;component ultrasound&#8208;responsive dual donor of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The co&#8208;release of CO/H2S gasotransmitters under mild ultrasound irradiation shows synergistic antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities, exhibiting unique therapeutic potential and outperforming conventional antibiotic treatment in a murine septic arthritis model.







Abstract
The development of dual gasotransmitter donors can not only provide robust tools to investigate their subtle interplay under pathophysiological conditions but also optimize therapeutic efficacy. While conventional strategies are heavily dependent on multicomponent donors, we herein report an ultrasound&#8208;responsive water&#8208;soluble copolymer (PSHF) capable of releasing carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) based on single&#8208;component sulfur&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyflavone (SHF) derivatives. Interestingly, sulfur substitution can not only greatly improve the ultrasound sensitivity but also enable the co&#8208;release of CO/H2S under mild ultrasound irradiation. The co&#8208;release of CO/H2S gasotransmitters exerts a bactericidal effect against Staphylococcus aureus and demonstrates anti&#8208;inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide&#8208;challenged macrophages. Moreover, the excellent tissue penetration of ultrasound irradiation enables the local release of CO/H2S in the joints of septic arthritis rats, exhibiting superior therapeutic efficacy without the need for any antibiotics.

         <title>Importing Antibonding&#8208;Orbital Occupancy through Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd Bridge Promotes Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>

This work constructs a series of carbon&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth oxides via an RE metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;mediated strategy to tune the ORR performance of the Pd sites. Taking Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C as a representative, it is identified that the coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 promotes electron transfer through the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which induces the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy of Pd&#8722;*OH for the optimization of *OH adsorption in the rate&#8208;determining step of ORR.







Abstract
The active&#8208;site density, intrinsic activity, and durability of Pd&#8722;based materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are critical to their application in industrial energy devices. This work constructs a series of carbon&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth (RE) oxides (Gd2O3, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, and CeO2) by using RE metal&#8211;organic frameworks to tune the ORR performance of the Pd sites through the Pd&#8722;RExOy interface interaction. Taking Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C as a representative, it is identified that the strong coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 induces the formation of the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which triggers charge redistribution of Pd and Gd2O3. The screened Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C exhibits impressive ORR performance with high onset potential (0.986 VRHE), half&#8208;wave potential (0.877&#8197;VRHE), and excellent stability. Similar ORR results are also found for Pd&#8722;Sm2O3/C, Pd&#8722;Eu2O3/C, and Pd&#8722;CeO2/C catalysts. Theoretical analyses reveal that the coupling between Pd and Gd2O3 promotes electron transfer through the Pd&#8722;O&#8722;Gd bridge, which induces the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy of Pd&#8722;*OH for the optimization of *OH adsorption in the rate&#8208;determining step of ORR. The pH&#8208;dependent microkinetic modeling shows that Pd&#8722;Gd2O3 is close to the theoretical optimal activity for ORR, outperforming Pt under the same conditions. By its ascendancy in ORR, the Pd&#8722;Gd2O3/C exhibits superior performance in Zn&#8208;air battery as an air cathode, implying its excellent practicability.

A series of noble metal nanoparticles are constructed by ambient in situ &#947;&#8208;ray irradiation reduction and form strong interfacial coupling with defect&#8208;rich carriers through M&#8722;O&#8722;Mn bonds, accelerating electron transfer. The activated catalytic sites combined with oxygen vacancies lower the energy barrier and optimize the intermediates adsorption energy, resulting in an outstanding performance for GOR and HER.

Herein, we report an ambient and controllable &#947;&#8208;ray radiation reduction to synthesize a series of noble metal nanoparticles anchored on defect&#8208;rich manganese oxides (M@MnO2&#8208;x, M=Ru, Pt, Pd, Ir) for glycerol&#8208;assisted H2 evolution. Benefiting from the strong penetrability of &#947;&#8208;rays, nanoparticles and defect supports are formed simultaneously and bridged by metal&#8208;oxygen bonds, guaranteeing structural stability and active site exposure. The special Ru&#8722;O&#8722;Mn bonds activate the Ru and Mn sites in Ru@MnO2&#8208;x through strong interfacial coordination, driving glycerol electrolysis at low overpotential. Furthermore, only a low cell voltage of 1.68&#8197;V is required to achieve 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a continuous&#8208;flow electrolyzer system along with excellent stability. In situ spectroscopic analysis reveals that the strong interfacial coordination in Ru@MnO2&#8208;x balances the competitive adsorption of glycerol and OH* on the catalyst surface. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the defect&#8208;rich MnO2 support promotes the dissociation of H2O, while the defect&#8208;regulated Ru sites promote deprotonation and hydrogen desorption, synergistically enhancing glycerol&#8208;assisted hydrogen production.

&lt;p&gt;A series of noble metal nanoparticles are constructed by ambient in situ &#947;-ray irradiation reduction and form strong interfacial coupling with defect-rich carriers through M&#8722;O&#8722;Mn bonds, accelerating electron transfer. The activated catalytic sites combined with oxygen vacancies lower the energy barrier and optimize the intermediates adsorption energy, resulting in an outstanding performance for GOR and HER.

         <title>Slowly Removing Surface Ligand by Aging Enhances the Stability of Pd Nanosheets toward Electron Beam Irradiation and Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an effective method to remove the surface ligand from Pd nanosheets by simply aging the sample in ethanol at room temperature. This slow process allows for atomic reconstruction without altering the sheet morphology. When exposed to e&#8208;beam irradiation or working as an electrocatalyst toward ethanol oxidation, the aged Pd nanosheets show enhanced stability.







Abstract
Surface ligands play an important role in shape&#8208;controlled growth and stabilization of colloidal nanocrystals. Their quick removal tends to cause structural deformation and/or aggregation to the nanocrystals. Herein, we demonstrate that the surface ligand based on poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) can be slowly removed from Pd nanosheets (NSs, 0.93&#177;0.17&#8197;nm in thickness) by simply aging the colloidal suspension. The aged Pd NSs show well&#8208;preserved morphology, together with significantly enhanced stability toward both e&#8208;beam irradiation and electrocatalysis (e.g., ethanol oxidation). It is revealed that the slow desorption of PVP during aging forces the re&#8208;exposed Pd atoms to reorganize, facilitating the surface to transform from being nearly perfect to defect&#8208;rich. The resultant Pd NSs with abundant defects no longer rely on surface ligand to stabilize the atomic arrangement and thus show excellent structural and electrochemical stability. This work provides a facile and effective method to maintain the integrity of colloidal nanocrystals by slowly removing the surface ligand.

         <title>Photoredox Nickel&#8208;Catalysed Stille Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalysed stereoconvergent Stille reaction is designed for the first time, allowing for the construction of a rich range of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3), C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2), and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bonds in good to high yields with excellent stereoselectivity under exceptionally mild conditions. The innovative use of synergistic photoredox/nickel catalysis enables a novel single&#8208;electron transmetalation process of stannane reagents, providing a new research paradigm in the realm of Stille reactions.







Abstract
The Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction is one of the most common strategies for the construction of C&#8722;C bonds. Despite notable strides in the advancement of the Stille reaction, persistent challenges persist in hindering its greener evolution. These challenges encompass multiple facets, such as the high cost of precious metals and ligands, the demand for various additives, and the slow reaction rate. In comparison to the dominant palladium&#8208;catalysed Stille reactions, cost&#8208;effective nickel&#8208;catalysed systems lag behind, and enantioconvergent Stille reactions of racemic stannanes remain undeveloped. Herein, we present a pioneering instance of nickel&#8208;catalysed enantioconvergent Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions of racemic stannane reagents, resulting in the formation of C&#8722;C bonds in good to high yields with excellent stereoselectivity. This strategy provides a practical, scalable, and operationally straightforward method for the synthesis of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3), C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2), and C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bonds under exceptionally mild conditions (without additives and bases, ambient temperature). The innovative use of synergistic photoredox/nickel catalysis enables a novel single&#8208;electron transmetalation process of stannane reagents, providing a new research paradigm of Stille reactions.

         <title>Potential Dominates Structural Recombination of Single Atom Mn Sites for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structural and valence state evolutions ranging from the initial Mn3.0&#8208;N4 to Mn3.8&#8208;N3C, followed by Mn3.2&#8208;N2C2, and ultimately returning to Mn3.0&#8208;N4 have been detected for Mn SAS during ORR by operando synchrotron radiation. The evolved configurations can regulate O2 adsorption and reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step to promote ORR activity.







Abstract
Single atom sites (SAS) often undergo structural recombination in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the effect of valence state and reconstruction on active centers needs to be investigated thoroughly. Herein, the Mn&#8208;SAS catalyst with uniform and precise Mn&#8208;N4 configuration is rationally designed. We utilize operando synchrotron radiation to track the dynamic evolution of active centers during ORR. Under the applied potential, the structural evolution of Mn&#8208;N4 into Mn&#8208;N3C and further into Mn&#8208;N2C2 configurations is clarified. Simultaneously, the valence states of Mn are increased from +3.0 to +3.8 and then decreased to +3.2. When the potential is removed, the catalyst returned to its initial Mn+3.0&#8208;N4 configuration. Such successive evolutions optimize the electronic and geometric structures of active centers as evidenced by theory calculations. The evolved Mn+3.8&#8208;N3C and Mn+3.2&#8208;N2C2 configurations respectively adjust the O2 adsorption and reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step. Thus, it can achieve an onset potential of 0.99&#8197;V, superior stability over 10,000 cycles, and a high turnover frequency of 1.59&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 0.85 VRHE. Our present work provides new insights into the construction of well&#8208;defined SAS catalysts by regulating the valence states and configurations of active centers.

         <title>0D Pyramid&#8208;intercalated 2D Bimetallic Halides with Tunable Electronic Structures and Enhanced Emission under Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report a new unique family of hybrid layered bimetallic halides with Cd/Cu as the MII site and Sb as the MIII site within the layered structure, with intercalated SbCl5 pyramids. These materials exhibit tunable electronic properties and optical band gaps from 2 to 3&#8197;eV. Using pressure as an external stimulus, the photoluminescence of the Cd analog is largely enhanced by 11&#8197;times.







Abstract
Hybrid metal halides are emerging semiconductors as promising candidates for optoelectronics. The pursuit of hybridizing various dimensions of metal halides remains a desirable yet highly complex endeavor. By utilizing dimension engineering, a diverse array of new materials with intrinsically different electronic and optical properties has been developed. Here, we report a new family of 2D&#8208;0D hybrid bimetallic halides, (C6N2H14)2SbCdCl9&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (SbCd) and (C6N2H14)2SbCuCl9&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (SbCu). These compounds adopt a new layered structure, consisting of alternating 0D square pyramidal [SbCl5] and 2D inorganic layers sandwiched by organic layers. SbCd and SbCu have optical band gaps of 3.3 and 2.3&#8197;eV, respectively. These compounds exhibit weak photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature, and the PL gradually enhances with decreasing temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that SbCd and SbCu are direct gap semiconductors, where first&#8208;principles band gaps follow the experimental trend. Moreover, given the different pressure responses of 0D and 2D components, these materials exhibit highly tunable electronic structures during compression, where a remarkable 11&#8197;times enhancement in PL emission is observed for SbCd at 19&#8197;GPa. This work opens new avenues for designing new layered bimetallic halides and further manipulating their structures and optoelectronic properties via pressure.

These materials exhibit tunable electronic properties and optical band gaps from 2 to 3&#8197;eV. Using pressure as an external stimulus, the photoluminescence of the Cd analog is largely enhanced by 11&#8197;times.

         <title>Fast and Selective Luminescent Sensing by Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer Films Based on Controlled Assembly of Perylene Bisimide Modified with A Cyclometalated AuIII Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perylene bisimide modified by cyclometalated AuIII complex with unprecedented T&#8208;type packing model in crystalline state was synthesized and employed for controlled fabrication of monolayer films via the Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer technique. Based on the film, a conceptual luminescent sensor was further developed, which allowed high&#8208;performance sensing of a new psychoactive substance, phenylethylamine.







Abstract
Condensed films of functional luminophores dominated by the magnitude and dimensionality of the intermolecular interactions play important roles in sensing performance. However, controlling the molecular assembly and regulating photophysical properties remain challenging. In this study, a new luminophore, ortho&#8208;PBI&#8208;Au, was synthesized by anchoring a cyclometalated alkynyl&#8208;gold(III) unit at the ortho&#8208;position of perylene bisimide. An unprecedented T&#8208;type packing model driven by weak Au&#8208;&#960; interaction and Au&#8722;H bonds was observed, laying foundation for striking properties of the luminophore. Controlled assembly of ortho&#8208;PBI&#8208;Au at the air&#8208;water interface, realized using the classical Langmuir&#8211;Schaeffer technique, afforded the obtained luminescent films with different packing structures. With an optimized film, sensitive, selective, and rapid detection of a hazardous new psychoactive substance, phenylethylamine (PEA), was achieved. The detection limit, response time, and recovery time were &lt;4&#8197;ppb, &lt;1&#8197;s, and &lt;5&#8197;s, respectively, surpassing the performance of the PEA sensors known thus far. The relationship between the characters of films and the sensing performance was systematically examined by grey relational analysis (GRA). The present study suggests that designing novel molecular aggregation with definite adlayer structure is a crucial strategy to enhance the sensing performance, which could be favorable for the film&#8208;based fluorescent sensors.

         <title>Rational Atom Substitution to Obtain Efficient, Lead&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Perovskites Assisted by Machine Learning and DFT Calculations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple machine learning model combined with theoretical calculations was employed to streamline optimisation and accurately identify substituents, highlighting the importance of d10 configuration in modulating Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite electronic structure. This approach seamlessly integrates with experimental validation, affirming d10&#8208;configured Zn2+ enhances Cs2AgBiBr6 photoactivity for toluene oxidation.







Abstract
Inorganic lead&#8208;free halide perovskites, devoid of toxic or rare elements, have garnered considerable attention as photocatalysts for pollution control, CO2 reduction and hydrogen production. In the extensive perovskite design space, factors like substitution or doping level profoundly impact their performance. To address this complexity, a synergistic combination of machine learning models and theoretical calculations were used to efficiently screen substitution elements that enhanced the photoactivity of substituted Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskites. Machine learning models determined the importance of d10 orbitals, highlighting how substituent electron configuration affects electronic structure of Cs2AgBiBr6. Conspicuously, d10&#8208;configured Zn2+ boosted the photoactivity of Cs2AgBiBr6. Experimental verification validated these model results, revealing a 13&#8208;fold increase in photocatalytic toluene conversion compared to the unsubstituted counterpart. This enhancement resulted from the small charge carrier effective mass, as well as the creation of shallow trap states, shifting the conduction band minimum, introducing electron&#8208;deficient Br, and altering the distance between the B&#8208;site cations d band centre and the halide anions p band centre, a parameter tuneable through d10 configuration substituents. This study exemplifies the application of computational modelling in photocatalyst design and elucidating structure&#8211;property relationships. It underscores the potential of synergistic integration of calculations, modelling, and experimental analysis across various applications.

         <title>A Fast Na&#8208;Ion Conduction Polymer Electrolyte via Triangular Synergy Strategy for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast Na&#8208;ion conduction polymer electrolyte was designed through a triangular synergy strategy, which limits the migration of ionic liquid and facilitates the dissociation of salt, resulting in a faster Na+ conduction in the polymer electrolyte. The modified polymer electrolyte led to a salt&#8208;decomposition dominated interphase, which effectively suppressed gas evolution from ionic liquid decomposition, ensuring battery safety.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes provide a visible pathway for the construction of high&#8208;safety quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries due to their high interface compatibility and processability. Nevertheless, sluggish ion transfer at room temperature seriously limits their applications. Herein, a triangular synergy strategy is proposed to accelerate Na&#8208;ion conduction via the cooperation of polymer&#8208;salt, ionic liquid, and electron&#8208;rich additive. Especially, PVDF&#8208;HFP and NaTFSI salt acted as the framework to stably accommodate all the ingredients. An ionic liquid (Emim+&#8208;FSI&#8722;) softened the polymer chains through a weakening molecule force and offered additional liquid pathways for ion transport. Physicochemical characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that electron&#8208;rich Nerolin with &#960;&#8208;cation interaction facilitated the dissociation of NaTFSI and effectively restrained the competitive migration of large cations from EmimFSI, thus lowering the energy barrier for ion transport. The strategy resulted in a thin F&#8208;rich interphase dominated by NaTFSI salt's decomposition, enabling rapid Na+ transmission across the interface. These combined effects resulted in a polymer electrolyte with high ionic conductivity (1.37&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and tNa+ (0.79) at 25&#8201;&#176;C. The assembled cells delivered reliable rate capability and stability (200 cycles, 99.2&#8201;%, 0.5&#8197;C) with a good safety performance.

Click chemistry is usually employed for joining components at microscopic level, but is not suitable for connecting macroscopic building blocks. Materials consisting of macroscopic building blocks realize flexible manufacturing of three&#8208;dimensional structures at macroscopic level, of significance on parallel manufacturing. Herein, macroscopic click chemistry is achieved using hydrogels as macroscopic building blocks.







Abstract
The click reaction has found good utility across various fields due to the characteristics of high efficiency, atom economy, simple and mild reaction conditions. Click chemistry is usually utilized for connecting components of microscopic level, while it is still unable for joining macroscopic building blocks. Materials consisting of macroscopic building blocks realize the flexible fabrication of three&#8208;dimensional structures at macroscopic level, exerting significance on parallel manufactures. In this work, we reported macroscopic click chemistry utilizing hydrogel as macroscopic building blocks. Hydrogels G1 and G2 were prepared by incorporating M1 (N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediamine) and P1 (alkyne functionalized polyethylene glycol) respectively, where polymer chains formed through diffusion&#8208;induced amino&#8208;yne click reaction entangled different hydrogel networks together. Additionally, chain&#8208;like aggregates and complicated 3D structures such as tetrahedron and quadrangular pyramid were constructed based on the adhesion of the hydrogel blocks. The approach enables us to find more possibilities in the delicate designation of 3D aggregations as well as large&#8208;scale manufacturing.

         <title>Ultrashort Phase&#8208;Matching Wavelength and Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Deep&#8208;UV&#8208;Transparent Oxyfluorides by Covalency Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first tantalum&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV NLO crystals A5Ta3OF18 (A = K, Rb) were designed and synthesized by a newly developed de&#8208;covalency band gap engineering strategy. With the optimized combination of two types of 5d0&#8208;Ta&#8208;centered polyhedra, they simultaneously realized strong SHG efficiencies and record&#8208;short phase&#8208;matching wavelength.







Abstract
The development of urgently&#8208;needed ultraviolet (UV)/deep&#8208;UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials has been hindered by contradictory requirements of the microstructure, in particular the need for a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response as well as a short phase&#8208;matching (PM) wavelength. We herein employ a &#8220;de&#8208;covalency&#8221; band gap engineering strategy to adjust the optical linearity and nonlinearity. This has been achieved by assembling two types of transition&#8208;metal (TM) polyhedra ([TaO2F4] and [TaF7]), affording the first tantalum&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV&#8208;transparent NLO materials, A5Ta3OF18 (A = K (KTOF), Rb (RTOF)). Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the highly ionic bonds and strong electropositivity of tantalum in the two oxyfluorides induce record short PM wavelengths (238 (KTOF) and 240 (RTOF) nm) for d0&#8208;TM&#8208;centered oxides, in addition to strong SHG responses (2.8 &#215; KH2PO4 (KTOF) and 2.6 &#215; KH2PO4 (RTOF)), and sufficient birefringences (0.092 (KTOF) and 0.085 (RTOF) at 546&#8197;nm). These results not only broaden the available strategies for achieving deep&#8208;UV NLO materials by exploiting the currently neglected d0&#8208;TMs, but also push the shortest PM wavelength into the short&#8208;wavelength UV region.

         <title>Length&#8208;Dependent Magnetic Evolution of Anthenes on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully fabricated atomically precise anthenes with varying lengths ranging from 2 to 6&#8197;anthryls. With increasing lengths, the ground states switch from S=0 (closed&#8208;shell bisanthene) to S=0 (open&#8208;shell teranthene). In longer anthenes, the charge transfer can switch magnetism from S=0 to S=1/2.







Abstract
Nanographenes with zigzag edges, for example, anthenes, exhibit a unique nonbonding &#960;&#8208;electron state, which can be described as a spin&#8208;polarized edge state that yields specific magnetic ground state. However, prior researches on the magnetism of anthenes with varying lengths on a surface is lacking. This study systematically fabricated anthenes with inherent zigzag carbon atoms of different lengths ranging from bisanthene to hexanthene. Their magnetic evolution on the Au(111) surface was analyzed through bond&#8208;resolved scanning probe techniques and density functional theory calculations. The analyses revealed a transition in magnetic properties associated with the length of the anthenes, arising from the imbalance between hybridization energy and the Coulomb repulsion between valence electrons. With the increasing length of the anthenes, the ground state transforms gradually from a closed&#8208;shell to an antiferromagnetic open&#8208;shell singlet, exhibiting a weak exchange coupling of 4&#8197;meV and a charge transfer&#8208;induced doublet. Therefore, this study formulated a chemically tunable platform to explore size&#8208;dependent &#960; magnetism at the atomic scale, providing a framework for research in organic spintronics.

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks (HOFs) with Brilliant Fluorescence</title>

         <dc:description>
Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with optimized two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) performance were constructed by building block modification and crystal engineering, showing good performance in two&#8208;photon cellular imaging applications.







Abstract
By synergistically employing four key strategies: (I)&#8197;introducing tetraphenylethylene groups as the central core unit with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, (II)&#8197;optimizing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated length by extending the building block branches, (III)&#8197;incorporating flexible groups containing ethylenic bonds, and (IV)&#8197;applying crystal engineering to attain dense stacking mode and highly twisty conformation, we successfully synthesized a series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) exhibiting exceptional one/two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence. Notably, when utilizing the fluorescently superior building block L2, HOF&#8208;LIFM&#8208;7 and HOF&#8208;LIFM&#8208;8 exhibiting high quantum yields (QY) of 82.1&#8201;% and 77.1&#8201;%, and ultrahigh two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) cross&#8208;sections of 148959.5&#8197;GM and 123901.1&#8197;GM were achieved. These materials were successfully employed in one and two&#8208;photon excited lysosome&#8208;targeting cellular imaging. It is believed that this strategy, combining building block optimization and crystal engineering, holds significant potential for guiding the development of outstanding fluorescent HOF materials.

         <title>Amphiphilic Heterografted Molecular Bottlebrushes with Tertiary Amine&#8208;Containing Side Chains as Efficient and Robust pH&#8208;Responsive Emulsifiers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular bottlebrushes with randomly grafted hydrophobic and pH&#8208;responsive polymer side chains are efficient and robust responsive emulsifiers for generation of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions, which exhibit both high stability, derived from large molecular sizes and interfacial Janus structures, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior. The formation and disruption of emulsions were repeated 10 times, and the bottlebrushes remained intact.







Abstract
By combining the unique characteristics of molecular bottlebrushes (MBBs) and the properties of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers, we show that MBBs with randomly grafted poly(n&#8208;butyl acrylate) and pH&#8208;responsive poly(2&#8208;(N,N&#8208;diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDEAEMA) side chains are efficient and robust pH&#8208;responsive emulsifiers. Water&#8208;in&#8208;toluene emulsions were formed at pH&#8197;4.0 and disrupted by increasing the pH to 10.0. The emulsion generation and disruption was reversible over the ten cycles investigated, and the bottlebrushes remained intact. The exceptional emulsion stability stemmed from the high interfacial binding energy of MBBs, imparted by their large molecular size and Janus architecture at the interface, as evidenced by the interfacial jamming and wrinkling of the assemblies upon reducing the interfacial area. At pH&#8197;10.0, PDEAEMA became water&#8208;insoluble, and the MBBs desorbed from the interface, causing de&#8208;emulsification. Consequently, we have shown that the judicious design of MBBs can generate properties of particle emulsifiers from their large size, while the responsiveness of the MBBs enables more potential applications.

&lt;p&gt;Molecular bottlebrushes with randomly grafted hydrophobic and pH-responsive polymer side chains are efficient and robust responsive emulsifiers for generation of water-in-oil emulsions, which exhibit both high stability, derived from large molecular sizes and interfacial Janus structures, and stimuli-responsive behavior. The formation and disruption of emulsions were repeated 10 times, and the bottlebrushes remained intact.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining the unique characteristics of molecular bottlebrushes (MBBs) and the properties of stimuli-responsive polymers, we show that MBBs with randomly grafted poly(&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butyl acrylate) and pH-responsive poly(2-(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDEAEMA) side chains are efficient and robust pH-responsive emulsifiers. Water-in-toluene emulsions were formed at pH&#8197;4.0 and disrupted by increasing the pH to 10.0. The emulsion generation and disruption was reversible over the ten cycles investigated, and the bottlebrushes remained intact. The exceptional emulsion stability stemmed from the high interfacial binding energy of MBBs, imparted by their large molecular size and Janus architecture at the interface, as evidenced by the interfacial jamming and wrinkling of the assemblies upon reducing the interfacial area. At pH&#8197;10.0, PDEAEMA became water-insoluble, and the MBBs desorbed from the interface, causing de-emulsification. Consequently, we have shown that the judicious design of MBBs can generate properties of particle emulsifiers from their large size, while the responsiveness of the MBBs enables more potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailored Zwitterionic Hemicyanine Reporters for Early Diagnosis and Prognostic Assessment of Acute Renal Failure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>

An activatable reporter ZCRR is developed by masking zwitterionic unimolecular hemicyanine with a tetrapeptide specifically cleavable by caspase&#8208;8. Systematic administration of ZCRR enables sensitive detection of intrarenal apoptosis 60&#8197;h earlier than clinical methods, and precise prediction of renoprotective therapeutic effects through in vitro optical urinalysis.







Abstract
Drug&#8208;induced renal failure (DIRF) poses a serious medical complication with high mortality risk. However, early diagnosis or prognosis of DIRF remain challenging, as current methods rely on detecting late&#8208;stage biomarkers. Herein we present a library of zwitterionic unimolecular hemicyanines (ZCs) available for constructing activatable reporters to detect DIRF since its initial stage. Zwitterionic properties of these probes are achieved through interspersedly integrating alkyl sulfonates and quaternary ammonium cations onto hemicyanine skeleton, which result in record low plasma protein binding (&lt;5&#8201;%) and remarkable renal clearance efficiencies (&#8776;96&#8201;%). An activatable reporter ZCRR is further developed by masking the optimal candidate ZC6 with a tetrapeptide specifically cleavable by caspase&#8208;8, an initiating indicator of apoptosis. In living mice with cisplatin&#8208;induced DIRF, systematically administered ZCRR efficiently accumulates in kidneys and responds to elevated caspase&#8208;8 for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence signals &#8216;turn&#8208;on&#8217;, enabling sensitive detection of intrarenal apoptosis 60&#8197;h earlier than clinical methods, and precise evaluation of apoptosis remediation effects by different medications on DIRF mice. As it's urinary excretable, ZCRR also allows for remote detection of DIRF and predicting renoprotective efficacy through in vitro optical urinalysis. This study thus presents unimolecular renal clearable scaffolds that are applicable to developing versatile activatable reporters for renal diseases management.

         <title>Al2O3&#8208;coated BiVO4 Photoanodes for Photoelectrocatalytic Regioselective C&#8722;H Activation of Aromatic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach for the regioselective activation of aromatic amines C&#8722;H bonds is reported using a BiVO4 photoanode coated with an ultrathin Al2O3 protective layer, overcoming the problems of low reactivity and poor stability in photoelectrocatalytic organic synthesis. The deposition of Al2O3 enables maintaining stable photocurrent and the yield of the target product dramatically increases from 48&#8201;% to 84&#8201;%. Beyond high efficiency and excellent repeatability, this photoelectrocatalytic strategy exhibits good functional group tolerance and environmental friendliness, making it promising for sustainable organic transformations.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemistry is becoming an innovative approach to organic synthesis. Generally, the current photoelectrocatalytic organic transformations suffer from limited reaction type, low conversion efficiency and poor stability. Herein, we develop efficient and stable photoelectrode materials using metal oxide protective layer, with a focus on achieving regioselective activation of amine compounds. Notably, our photoelectrochemistry process is implemented under mild reaction conditions and does not involve any directing groups, transition metals or oxidants. The results demonstrate that beyond photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis exhibits high efficiency, remarkable repeatability and good functional group tolerance, highlighting its great potential for applications.

A bicyclo[1.1.0]diphosphadisilabutane radical anion salt, namely [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+{[(HCNDipp)2Si]2P2}.&#8722; (18&#8208;C&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), has been isolated and characterized. This unique species showcases a perfectly planar Si2P2 four&#8208;membered ring. What makes it particularly intriguing is the presence of an extremely rare 2&#8208;center&#8208;3&#8208;electron P&#8722;P &#960; bond, which exists in the absence of a supporting P&#8722;P &#963; bond.







Abstract
Featuring an extra electron in the &#960;* antibonding orbital, species with a 2&#8208;center&#8208;3&#8208;electron (2c3e) &#960; bond without an underlying &#963; bond are scarcely known. Herein, we report the synthesis, isolation and characterization of a radical anion salt [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+{[(HCNDipp)2Si]2P2}&#8901;&#8722; (i.e. [K(18&#8208;C&#8208;6)]+3&#8901;&#8722;) (18&#8208;C&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl), in which 3&#8901;&#8722; features a perfectly planar Si2P2 four&#8208;membered ring. This species represents the first example of a Si&#8208; and P&#8208;containing analog of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion. The unusual bonding motif of 3&#8901;&#8722; was thoroughly investigated via X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), and calculations by density functional theory (DFT), which collectively unveiled the existence of a 2c3e &#960; bond between the bridgehead P atoms and no clearly defined supporting P&#8722;P &#963; bond.

         <title>Breaking Mass Transport Limitations by Iodized Polyacrylonitrile Anodes for Extremely Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodized polyacrylonitrile anodes (I&#8208;PAN) can regulate the bulk/interphase metal&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and metal&#8208;ion desolvation chemistry of the electrolyte, and simultaneously reutilize the dead/plated metal. Benefiting from these features, the unprecedented extremely fast&#8208;charging performance can be achieved for a series of metal (Li, Na)&#8208;ion batteries using I&#8208;PAN as anodes.







Abstract
The fast&#8208;charging capability of rechargeable batteries is greatly limited by the sluggish ion transport kinetics in anode materials. Here we develop an iodized polyacrylonitrile (I&#8208;PAN) anode that can boost the bulk/interphase lithium (Li)&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and accelerate Li&#8208;ion desolvation process to realize high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries. The iodine immobilized in I&#8208;PAN framework expands ion transport channels, compresses the electric double layer, and changes the inner Helmholtz plane to form LiF/LiI&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase layer. The dissolved iodine ions in the electrolyte self&#8208;induced by the interfacial nucleophilic substitution of PF6&#8722; not only promote the Li&#8208;ion desolvation process, but also reuse the plated/dead Li formed on the anode under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Consequently, the I&#8208;PAN anode exhibits a high capacity of 228.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (39&#8201;% of capacity at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 delivered in 18 seconds) and negligible capacity decay for 10000&#8197;cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The I&#8208;PAN||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell shows excellent fast&#8208;charging performance with attractive capacities and negligible capacity decay for 1000&#8197;cycles at extremely high rates of 5&#8197;C and 10&#8197;C (1&#8197;C=180&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1).

     alt="Breaking Mass Transport Limitations by Iodized Polyacrylonitrile Anodes for Extremely Fast-Charging Lithium-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iodized polyacrylonitrile anodes (I-PAN) can regulate the bulk/interphase metal-ion diffusion kinetics and metal-ion desolvation chemistry of the electrolyte, and simultaneously reutilize the dead/plated metal. Benefiting from these features, the unprecedented extremely fast-charging performance can be achieved for a series of metal (Li, Na)-ion batteries using I-PAN as anodes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fast-charging capability of rechargeable batteries is greatly limited by the sluggish ion transport kinetics in anode materials. Here we develop an iodized polyacrylonitrile (I-PAN) anode that can boost the bulk/interphase lithium (Li)-ion diffusion kinetics and accelerate Li-ion desolvation process to realize high-performance fast-charging Li-ion batteries. The iodine immobilized in I-PAN framework expands ion transport channels, compresses the electric double layer, and changes the inner Helmholtz plane to form LiF/LiI-rich solid electrolyte interphase layer. The dissolved iodine ions in the electrolyte self-induced by the interfacial nucleophilic substitution of PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; not only promote the Li-ion desolvation process, but also reuse the plated/dead Li formed on the anode under fast-charging conditions. Consequently, the I-PAN anode exhibits a high capacity of 228.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (39&#8201;% of capacity at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; delivered in 18 seconds) and negligible capacity decay for 10000&#8197;cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The I-PAN||LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full cell shows excellent fast-charging performance with attractive capacities and negligible capacity decay for 1000&#8197;cycles at extremely high rates of 5&#8197;C and 10&#8197;C (1&#8197;C=180&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). We also demonstrate high-performance fast-charging sodium-ion batteries using I-PAN anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spiroluchuene A Synthase: A Cyclase from Aspergillus luchuensis Forming a Spirotetracyclic Diterpene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diterpene synthase for spiroluchuene A exhibiting a novel skeleton was discovered from Aspergillus luchuensis. Enzyme engineering through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis allowed for the isolation of spiroluchuene B and the intermediate spiroluchuene. The enzyme mechanism was deeply studied through isotopic labelling experiments, DFT calculations and metadynamic simulations. The thermal reactions of luchudiene were studied.







Abstract
The diterpene synthase AlTS was identified from Aspergillus luchuensis. AlTS catalyses the formation of the diterpene hydrocarbon spiroluchuene A, which exhibits a novel skeleton characterised by a spirocyclic ring system. The cyclisation mechanism towards this compound was elucidated through isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations and metadynamic simulations. The biosynthetic intermediate luchudiene, besides the derivative spiroluchuene B, was captured from an enzyme variant obtained through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. With its 10&#8208;membered ring luchudiene is structurally related to germacrenes and can undergo a Cope rearrangement to luchuelemene.

         <title>Direct Quantification of Nanoplastics Neurotoxicity by Single&#8208;Vesicle Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PS nanoplastics&#8208;induced reductions in exocytotic activity have been quantified by single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry. Mechanistic investigations suggested that PS nanoplastics can cause disruption of F&#8208;actin assemblies. This research provides key hints for deciphering how nanoplastics affect neurotransmitter secretion and neural functions.







Abstract
Nanoplastics are recently recognized as neurotoxic factors for the nervous systems. However, whether and how they affect vesicle chemistry (i.e., vesicular catecholamine content and exocytosis) remains unclear. This study offers the first direct evidence for the nanoplastics&#8208;induced neurotoxicity by single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry. We observe the cellular uptake of polystyrene (PS) nanoplastics into model neuronal cells and mouse primary neurons, leading to cell viability loss depending on nanoplastics exposure time and concentration. By using single&#8208;vesicle electrochemistry, we find the reductions in the vesicular catecholamine content, the frequency of stimulated exocytotic spikes, the neurotransmitter release amount of single exocytotic event, and the membrane&#8208;vesicle fusion pore opening&#8208;closing speed. Mechanistic investigations suggest that PS nanoplastics can cause disruption of filamentous actin (F&#8208;actin) assemblies at cytomembrane zones and change the kinetic patterns of vesicle exocytosis. Our finding shapes the first quantitative picture of neurotoxicity induced by high&#8208;concentration nanoplastics exposure at a single&#8208;cell level.

         <title>Breaking Surface Atomic Monogeneity of Rh2P Nanocatalysts by Defect&#8208;Derived Phosphorus Vacancies for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;derived surface phosphorus vacancies on ultrathin Rh2P nanowires break the monogeneity and atomic regularity of thermodynamically stable P&#8208;terminated surfaces, which can create additional Rh sites to act as exclusive H adsorption sites and diminish the inhibition effect of the interfacial water network to achieve drastically improved alkaline HOR electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Breaking atomic monogeneity of catalyst surfaces is promising for constructing synergistic active centers to cope with complex multi&#8208;step catalytic reactions. Here, we report a defect&#8208;derived strategy for creating surface phosphorous vacancies (P&#8208;vacancies) on nanometric Rh2P electrocatalysts toward drastically boosted electrocatalysis for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). This strategy disrupts the monogeneity and atomic regularity of the thermodynamically stable P&#8208;terminated surfaces. Density functional theory calculations initially verify that the competitive adsorption behavior of Had and OHad on perfect P&#8208;terminated Rh2P{200} facets (p&#8208;Rh2P) can be bypassed on defective Rh2P{200} surfaces (d&#8208;Rh2P). The P&#8208;vacancies enable the exposure of sub&#8208;surface Rh atoms to act as exclusive H adsorption sites. Therein, the Had cooperates with the OHad on the peripheral P&#8208;sites to effectively accelerate the alkaline HOR. Defective Rh2P nanowires (d&#8208;Rh2P NWs) and perfect Rh2P nanocubes (p&#8208;Rh2P NCs) are then elaborately synthesized to experimentally represent the d&#8208;Rh2P and p&#8208;Rh2P catalytic surfaces. As expected, the P&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched d&#8208;Rh2P NWs catalyst exhibits extremely high catalytic activity and outstanding CO tolerance for alkaline HOR electrocatalysis, attaining 5.7 and 14.3&#8197;times mass activity that of p&#8208;Rh2P NCs and commercial Pt/C, respectively. This work sheds light on breaking the surface atomic monogeneity for the development of efficient heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Tracking Ion Transport in Nanochannels via Transient Single&#8208;Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ tracking of ion transport kinetics under nanoconfinement was achieved by transient single&#8208;particle imaging method. The results implied that the ion transport kinetics in long nanochannels is dominated by the in&#8208;pore diffusion, while in short nanopores/nanochannels is governed by electrical double layer (EDL) formation. The local ion accumulation within EDL changes the ion mobility and then affects the apparent ion transport kinetics.







Abstract
The transport behavior of ions in the nanopores has an important impact on the performance of the electrochemical devices. Although the classical Transmission&#8208;Line (TL) model has long been used to describe ion transport in pores, the boundary conditions for the applicability of the TL model remain controversial. Here, we investigated the transport kinetics of different ions, within nanochannels of different lengths, by using transient single&#8208;particle imaging with temporal resolution up to microseconds. We found that the ion transport kinetics within short nanochannels may deviate significantly from the TL model. The reason is that the ion transport under nanoconfinement is composed of multi basic stages, and the kinetics differ much under different stage domination. With the shortening of nanochannels, the electrical double layer (EDL) formation would become the &#8220;rate&#8208;determining step&#8221; and dominate the apparent ion kinetics. Our results imply that using the TL model directly and treating the in&#8208;pore mobility as an unchanged parameter to estimate the ion transport kinetics in short nanopores/nanochannels may lead to orders of magnitude bias. These findings may advance the understanding of the nanoconfined ion transport and promote the related applications.

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Based on Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Tetramers for Efficient Xe/Kr Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46, based on hydrogen&#8208; bonding tetramers that is self&#8208;assembled from tetrahedral building block tetrakis(4&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl) phenyl) silane was reported. The activated HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46 shows highly efficient separation of Xe/Kr mixture with the highest Xe uptake and IAST selectivity among the reported HOFs up to date.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have been emerging as a new type of very promising microporous materials for gas separation and purification, but few HOFs structures constructed through hydrogen&#8208;bonding tetramers have been explored in this field. Herein, we report the first microporous HOF (termed as HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46) afforded by hydrogen&#8208;bonding tetramers with 4&#8208;fold interpenetrated diamond networks, which shows excellent chemical and thermal stability. What's more, activated HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46 exhibits the highest xenon (Xe) uptake of 2.51&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and xenon/krypton (Kr) selectivity of 19.9 at the ambient condition among the reported HOFs up to date. Dynamic breakthrough tests confirmed the excellent Xe/Kr separation of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46a, showing high Kr productivity (110&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1) and Xe uptake (1.29&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), as well as good recyclability. The single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the molecular simulations revealed that the abundant accessible aromatic and pyrazole rings in the pore channels of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;46a can provide the multiple strong C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Xe interactions with Xe atoms.

         <title>Excitation Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Fluorescence of a Lanthanide Organic Metal Halide Cluster for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide clusters based on trivalent lanthanide ions have been successfully synthesized, exhibiting a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Furthermore, the introduction of trivalent antimony (Sb3+) doping results in the emergence of new energy&#8208;level structures for electronic transitions, which enables precise control over the emission color by varying the excitation wavelength.







Abstract
The achievement of significant photoluminescence (PL) in lanthanide ions (Ln3+) has primarily relied on host sensitization, where energy is transferred from the excited host material to the Ln3+ ions. However, this luminous mechanism involves only one optical antenna, namely the host material, which limits the accessibility of excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent (Ex&#8208;De) PL. Consequently, the wider application of Ln3+ ions in light&#8208;emitting devices is hindered. In this study, we present an organic&#8211;inorganic compound, (DMA)4LnCl7 (DMA+=[CH3NH2CH3]+, Ln3+=Ce3+, Tb3+), which serves as an independent host lattice material for efficient Ex&#8208;De emission by doping it with trivalent antimony (Sb3+). The pristine (DMA)4LnCl7 compounds exhibit high luminescence, maintaining the characteristic sharp emission bands of Ln3+ and demonstrating a high PL quantum yield of 90&#8211;100&#8201;%. Upon Sb3+ doping, the compound exhibits noticeable Ex&#8208;De emission with switchable colors. Through a detailed spectral study, we observe that the prominent energy transfer process observed in traditional host&#8208;sensitized systems is absent in these materials. Instead, they exhibit two independent emission centers from Ln3+ and Sb3+, each displaying distinct features in luminous color and radiative lifetime. These findings open up new possibilities for designing Ex&#8208;De emitters based on Ln3+ ions.

         <title>Macrocyclic Encapsulation in a Non&#8208;fused Tetrathiophene Acceptor for Efficient Organic Solar Cells with High Short&#8208;Circuit Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully non&#8208;fused acceptor R4T&#8208;1 was designed via macrocyclic encapsulation on the simple tetrathiophene, which achieves conformational unicity, eliminates intermolecular electronic cross&#8208;communication at the center and guarantees the formation of efficient charge transport channels. Thus, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.10&#8201;% with a significantly enhanced short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.48&#8197;mA/cm2 was accomplished.







Abstract
Non&#8208;fullerene acceptors have shown great promise for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, challenges in achieving high efficiency molecular system with conformational unicity and effective molecular stacking remain. In this study, we present a new design of non&#8208;fused tetrathiophene acceptor R4T&#8208;1 via employing the encapsulation of tetrathiophene with macrocyclic ring. The single crystal structure analysis reveals that cyclic alkyl side chains can perfectly encapsulate the central part of molecule and generate a conformational stable and planar molecular backbone. Whereas, the control 4T&#8208;5 without the encapsulation restriction displays cis&#8208; and twisted conformation. As a result, R4T&#8208;1 based OSCs achieved an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 15.10&#8201;% with a high short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.48&#8197;mA/cm2, which is significantly improved by &#8776;30&#8201;% in relative to that of the control. Our findings demonstrate that the macrocyclic encapsulation strategy could assist fully non&#8208;fused electron acceptors (FNEAs) to achieve a high photovoltaic performance and pave a new way for FNEAs design.

         <title>Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated Ultra&#8208;Long Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Triggered by Multi&#8208;Esterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and rational molecular&#8208;design strategy has been developed to enable visible&#8208;light excited ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (UL&#8208;RTP). The multi&#8208;esterification strategy boosts transition dipole moments, leading to the most efficient UL&#8208;RTP in flexible films upon excitation with blue light, which allows high&#8208;tech applications in time&#8208;delayed white LEDs and flashlight&#8208;activated afterglow encryption.







Abstract
The development of ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (UL&#8208;RTP) in processable amorphous organic materials is highly desirable for applications in flexible displays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and bio&#8208;imaging. However, achieving efficient UL&#8208;RTP from amorphous materials remains a challenging task, especially with activation by visible light and a bright afterglow. Here we report a general and rational molecular&#8208;design strategy to enable efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;excited UL&#8208;RTP by multi&#8208;esterification of a rigid large&#8208;plane phosphorescence core. Notably, multi&#8208;esterification minimizes the aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and accomplishes a &#8242;four birds with one stone&#8242; possibility in the generation and radiation process of UL&#8208;RTP: i) shifting the excitation from ultraviolet light to blue&#8208;light through enhancing the transition dipole moment of low&#8208;lying singlet&#8208;states, ii) facilitating the intersystem crossing process through the incorporation of lone&#8208;pair electrons, iii) boosting the decay process of long&#8208;lived triplet excitons resulting from a significantly increased transition dipole moment, and iv) reducing the intrinsic triplet nonradiative decay by substitution of high&#8208;frequency vibrating hydrogen atoms. All these factors synergistically contribute to the most efficient and stable visible&#8208;light&#8208;stimulated UL&#8208;RTP (lifetime up to 2.01&#8197;s and efficiency up to 35.4&#8201;% upon excitation at 450&#8197;nm) in flexible films using multi&#8208;esterified coronene, which allows high&#8208;tech applications in single&#8208;component time&#8208;delayed white light&#8208;emitting diodes and information technology based on flashlight&#8208;activated afterglow encryption.

All these factors synergistically contribute to the most efficient and stable visible-light-stimulated UL-RTP (lifetime up to 2.01&#8197;s and efficiency up to 35.4&#8201;% upon excitation at 450&#8197;nm) in flexible films using multi-esterified coronene, which allows high-tech applications in single-component time-delayed white light-emitting diodes and information technology based on flashlight-activated afterglow encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Sieving of Propyne/Propylene by a Scalable Nanoporous Crystal with Confined Rotational Shutters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft nanoporous crystal has been developed that can separate propyne/propylene mixtures by sieving. This occurs by the rotational movement of pyridyl rings within this framework creating a pore with a maximum size of 4.4&#8197;&#197;, thereby facilitating the adsorption of propyne while completely excluding propylene.







Abstract
Soft porous coordination polymers (PCPs) have the remarkable ability to recognize similar molecules as a result of their structural dynamics. However, their guest&#8208;induced gate&#8208;opening behaviors often lead to issues with selectivity and separation efficiency, as co&#8208;adsorption is nearly unavoidable. Herein, we report a strategy of a confined&#8208;rotational shutter, in which the rotation of pyridyl rings within the confined nanospace of a halogen&#8208;bonded coordination framework (NTU&#8208;88) creates a maximum aperture of 4.4&#8197;&#197;, which is very close to the molecular size of propyne (C3H4: 4.4&#8197;&#197;), but smaller than that of propylene (C3H6: 5.4&#8197;&#197;). This has been evidenced by crystallographic analyses and modelling calculations. The NTU&#8208;88o (open phase of activated NTU&#8208;88) demonstrates dedicated C3H4 adsorption, and thereby leads to a sieving separation of C3H4/C3H6 under ambient conditions. The integrated nature of high uptake ratio, considerable capacity, scalable synthesis, and good stability make NTU&#8208;88 a promising candidate for the feasible removal of C3H4 from C3H4/C3H6 mixtures. In principle, this strategy holds high potential for extension to soft families, making it a powerful tool for optimizing materials that can tackle challenging separations with no co&#8208;adsorption, while retaining the crucial aspect of high capacity.

Capturing CO2&#160;from flue gas and using renewable or excess electricity to convert CO2&#160;into high value&#8208;added products can help solve environmental and energy problems. A silver clusters&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework simultaneously possessing CO2&#160;capture sites as "CO2&#160;relays" and eCO2RR active sites, which can not only utilize its micropores to efficiently capture CO2&#160;from simulated flue gas but also catalyze eCO2RR of the adsorbed CO2&#160;into CO with an ultra&#8208;high CO2&#160;conversion, was revealed by Pei&#8208;Qin Liao and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202311265).

The monochromophoric design of fluorogenic probes opens exciting possibilities for dual&#8208;color bioorthogonal imaging with a single probe. In their Research Article (e202310665), Seung Bum Park et&#8197;al. synthesized a series of fluorogenic BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes and demonstrated excellent BCN&#8208;selective fluorescence enhancement in various wavelengths, including the far&#8208;red region. The discovery of the BCN&#8208;selective behavior&#8242;s origin and a unique fluorescence recovery in hydrophobic media enabled dual&#8208;color bioorthogonal cellular imaging using a single probe.

Photonic crystals can display vivid structural colors via a selective reflection of visible light, and designing their spectra remains a challenge. In their Communication (e202311451), Koki Sano, Yasuhiro Ishida et&#8197;al. report a reconfigurable photonic crystal consisting of an aqueous dispersion of inorganic nanosheets that reversibly exhibits single&#8208;peak and double&#8208;peak structural colors when annealed under homogeneous and gradient temperature conditions, respectively.

The peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) photoswitch pushes the limit of red&#8208; and NIR&#8208;light responsiveness, as reported by Henry Dube et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202312955). It possesses strongly red&#8208;shifted absorptions up to 850&#8197;nm, very large photochromism, high thermal stability of the metastable state, and can reversibly be photoisomerized with 780&#8197;nm and 625&#8197;nm (or 590&#8197;nm) light. The picture presents a photograph of a transparent polystyrene polymer with embedded PAT photoswitch. After application of a photomask the structural changes of PAT and wavelengths usable for photoswitching are inscribed with red light.

         <title>Engineering Enzymes for Environmental Sustainability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights how engineered enzymes have been developed and implemented to help address environmental challenges. Topics include the use of engineered enzymes for improving carbon capture and utilisation, bioremediation, plastic deconstruction, and renewable feedstock generation. Successes, challenges, and opportunities for future enzyme engineering campaigns to improve environmental sustainability are discussed.







Abstract
The development and implementation of sustainable catalytic technologies is key to delivering our net&#8208;zero targets. Here we review how engineered enzymes, with a focus on those developed using directed evolution, can be deployed to improve the sustainability of numerous processes and help to conserve our environment. Efficient and robust biocatalysts have been engineered to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) and have been embedded into new efficient metabolic CO2 fixation pathways. Enzymes have been refined for bioremediation, enhancing their ability to degrade toxic and harmful pollutants. Biocatalytic recycling is gaining momentum, with engineered cutinases and PETases developed for the depolymerization of the abundant plastic, polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Finally, biocatalytic approaches for accessing petroleum&#8208;based feedstocks and chemicals are expanding, using optimized enzymes to convert plant biomass into biofuels or other high value products. Through these examples, we hope to illustrate how enzyme engineering and biocatalysis can contribute to the development of cleaner and more efficient chemical industry.

         <title>MXene&#8208;based Membranes for Drinking Water Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes have attracted enormous interest in water purification due to their extraordinary properties such as adjustable hydrophilicity, easy processibility, antifouling resistance, etc. This review focuses on the progress and advancement of MXene&#8208;based membranes for drinking water production, including preparations, separation mechanisms, and applications.







Abstract
The soaring development of industry exacerbates the shortage of fresh water, making drinking water production an urgent demand. Membrane techniques feature the merits of high efficiency, low energy consumption, and easy operation, deemed as the most potential technology to purify water. Recently, a new type of two&#8208;dimensional materials, MXenes as the transition metal carbides or nitrides in the shape of nanosheets, have attracted enormous interest in water purification due to their extraordinary properties such as adjustable hydrophilicity, easy processibility, antifouling resistance, mechanical strength, and light&#8208;to&#8208;heat transformation capability. In pioneering studies, MXene&#8208;based membranes have been evaluated in the past decade for drinking water production including the separation of bacteria, dyes, salts, and heavy metals. This review focuses on the recent advancement of MXene&#8208;based membranes for drinking water production. A brief introduction of MXenes is given first, followed by descriptions of their unique properties. Then, the preparation methods of MXene membranes are summarized. The various applications of MXene membranes in water treatment and the corresponding separation mechanisms are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and prospects of MXene membranes are presented with the hope to provide insightful guidance on the future design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance MXene membranes.

This Minireview summarizes the research endeavors of narrowband organic electroluminescent materials, highlighting the tremendous contribution of frontier molecular orbital engineering strategy.







Abstract
It is of great strategic significance to develop highly efficient narrowband organic electroluminescent materials that can be utilized to manufacture ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) displays and meet or approach the requirements of Broadcast Television 2020 (B.T.2020) color gamut standards. This motif poses challenges for molecular design and synthesis, especially for developing generality, diversity, scalability, and robustness of molecular structures. The emergence of multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters has ingeniously solved the problems and demonstrated bright application prospects in the field of UHD displays, sparking a research boom. This Minireview summarizes the research endeavors of narrowband organic electroluminescent materials, with emphasis on the tremendous contribution of frontier molecular orbital engineering (FMOE) strategy. It combines the outstanding advantages of MR framework and donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structure, and can achieve red&#8208;shift and narrowband emission simultaneously, which is of great significance in the development of long&#8208;wavelength narrowband emitters with emission maxima especially exceeding 500&#8197;nm. We hope that this Minireview would provide some inspiration for what could transpire in the future.

         <title>Synthesis and Prospects of Holey Two&#8208;dimensional Platinum&#8208;group Metals in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recently explored porous and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Pt&#8208;group metals (PGMs) with few&#8208;atomic thicknesses via various synthetic techniques. It also highlights their unique structural benefits, particularly for manipulating the intrinsic electronic structure in high&#8208;performance electrochemical water splitting, CO2 reduction, and fuel cell applications.







Abstract
Advanced electrocatalysts can enable the widespread implementation of clean energy technologies. This paper reviews an emerging class of electrocatalytic materials comprising holey two&#8208;dimensional free&#8208;standing Pt&#8208;group metal (h&#8208;2D&#8208;PGM) nanosheets, which are categorically challenging to synthesize but inherently rich in all the qualities necessary to counter the kinetic and thermodynamic challenges of an electrochemical conversion process with high catalytic efficiency and stability. Although the 2D anisotropic growth of typical nonlayered metal crystals has succeeded and partly improved their atom&#8208;utilization efficiency, regularly distributed in&#8208;planar porosity can further optimize three critical factors that govern efficient electrocatalysis process: mass diffusion, electron transfer, and surface reactivity. However, producing such advanced morphological features within h&#8208;2D&#8208;PGMs is difficult unless they are specially engineered using approaches such as templating or kinetic ramification during 2D growth or controlled etching of preformed 2D&#8208;PGM solids. Therefore, this review highlighting the successful fabrication of various porous PGM nanosheets and their electrocatalytic benefits involving smart nanoscale features could inspire next&#8208;generation scientific and technological innovations toward securing a sustainable energy future.

         <title>A Photochemical Strategy for ortho&#8208;Aminophenol Synthesis via Dearomative&#8208;Rearomative Coupling Between Aryl Azides and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photolysis of aryl azides with purple light in the presence of alcohols enables the direct preparation of challenging ortho&#8208;aminophenols. The process goes via a singlet nitrene&#8208;mediated dearomative&#8208;rearomative cascade that enables introduction of the alcohol in place of the azide and shifts the amino group to its ortho&#8208;position.







Abstract
ortho&#8208;Aminophenols are aromatic derivatives featuring vicinal N&#8208; and O&#8208;based functionalities commonly found in the structures of many high&#8208;value materials. These molecules are generally prepared using multistep strategies that follow the rules of electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) chemistry. Despite their high fidelity, such approaches cannot target substrates featuring a &#8220;contra&#8208;SEAr&#8221; arrangement of N&#8208; and O&#8208;groups. Here we report an alternative strategy for the preparation of such ortho&#8208;aminophenols using aryl azides as the precursors. The process utilizes low&#8208;energy photoexcitation to trigger the decomposition of aryl azides into singlet nitrenes that undergo a dearomative&#8208;rearomative sequence. This allows the incorporation of alcoholic nucleophiles into a seven&#8208;membered ring azepine intermediate via temporary disruption of aromaticity, followed by electrophile&#8208;induced re&#8208;aromatization. The net retrosynthetic logic is that the alcohol displaces the azide, which, in turn, moves to its ortho position and furthermore is converted into an amide. The synthetic value and complementarity of this strategy has been demonstrated by the coupling of aryl azides with complex, drug&#8208;like alcohols and phenols as well as amines, thiols and thiophenols, which provides a general platform for the fast and selective heterofunctionalization of aromatics.

         <title>AIEgens Cross&#8208;linked Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Synchronously Amplify Bimodal Imaging Signals in Situ by Tumor Acidity&#8208;Mediated Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the aggregation&#8208;enhanced r2 relaxivity of iron oxide nanoparticles and the aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties of AIEgens, a non&#8208;conjugated/coupled dual&#8208;mode probe design strategy is developed to synergistically enhance both near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) intensity and magnetic resonance contrast.







Abstract
Activatable dual&#8208;modal molecular imaging probes present a promising tool for the diagnosis of malignant tumors. However, synchronously enhancing dual&#8208;modal imaging signals under a single stimulus is challenging. Herein, we propose an activatable bimodal probe that integrates aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) and iron oxide nanoparticles (IOs) to synergistically enhance near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) intensity and magnetic resonance (MR) contrast through a tumor acidity&#8208;mediated click reaction. Tumor acidity&#8208;responsive IOs containing dibenzocyclooctyne groups (termed cDIOs) and AIEgens containing azide groups (termed AATs) can be covalently cross&#8208;linked in response to tumor acidity, which leads to a simultaneous enhancement in NIRF intensity (&#8776;12.4&#8208;fold) and r2 relaxivity (&#8776;2.8&#8208;fold). cDIOs and AATs were effectively activated in mice orthotropic breast tumor, and the cross&#8208;linking prolonged their retention in tumor, further augmenting the bimodal signals and expanding imaging time frame. This facile strategy leverages the inherent properties of probes themselves and demonstrates promise in future translational studies.

         <title>Reconfigurable Photonic Crystal Reversibly Exhibiting Single and Double Structural Colors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reconfigurable photonic crystal composed of a colloidal nanosheet dispersed in water reversibly exhibits the single structural color and the double structural color when annealed under homogeneous&#8208;temperature and gradient&#8208;temperature conditions, respectively. This finding will expand the design freedom of structural colors, leading to the next&#8208;generation color materials.







Abstract
Unlike absorption&#8208;based colors of dyes and pigments, reflection&#8208;based colors of photonic crystals, so called &#8220;structural colors&#8221;, are responsive to external stimuli, but can remain unfaded for over ten million years, and therefore regarded as a next&#8208;generation coloring mechanism. However, it is a challenge to rationally design the spectra of structural colors, where one structure gives only one reflection peak defined by Bragg's law, unlike those of absorption&#8208;based colors. Here, we report a reconfigurable photonic crystal that exhibits single&#8208;peak and double&#8208;peak structural colors. This photonic crystal is composed of a colloidal nanosheet in water, which spontaneously adopts a layered structure with single periodicity (407&#8197;nm). After a temperature&#8208;gradient treatment, the photonic crystal segregates into two regions with shrunken (385&#8197;nm) and expanded (448&#8197;nm) periodicities, and thus exhibits double reflection peaks that are blue&#8208; and red&#8208;shifted from the original one, respectively. Notably, the transition between the single&#8208;peak and double&#8208;peak states is reversible.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of C&#8722;O Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers by NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Desymmetrization

         <dc:description>
The atroposelective synthesis of C&#8722;O axially chiral diaryl ethers is demonstrated by the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective esterification of dialdehyde containing diaryl ethers. The reaction proceeds via a desymmetrization of isophthalaldehyde derivatives bearing prochiral dual C&#8722;O axis affording atropoisomeric diaryl ethers with broad scope under mild conditions.







Abstract
Axially chiral diaryl ethers, a distinguished class of atropisomers possessing unique dual C&#8722;O axis, hold immense potential for diverse research domains. In contrast to the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of conventional single axis bearing atropisomers, the atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral ethers containing flexible C&#8722;O axis remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate the first N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers via atroposelective esterification of dialdehyde&#8208;containing diaryl ethers. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds via NHC&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization strategy to afford the corresponding axially chiral diaryl ether atropisomers in good yields and high enantioselectivities under mild conditions. The derivatization of the synthesized product expands the utility of present strategy via access to a library of C&#8722;O axially chiral compounds. The temperature dependency and preliminary investigations on the racemization barrier of C&#8722;O bonds are also presented.

         <title>Organic Excitonic State Management by Surface Metallic Coupling of Inorganic Lanthanide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy to manipulate the electronic energy states of organic phosphors by coupling with inorganic lanthanide nanocrystals NaGdF4 is reported. The metallic atoms introduce strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects to organic chromophores. The result demonstrates the ability of charge transfer mechanism to broaden the utility of organic phosphors.







Abstract
The ability to harness charges and spins for control of organic excitonic states is critical in developing high&#8208;performance organic luminophores and optoelectronic devices. Here we report a facile strategy to efficiently manipulate the electronic energy states of various organic phosphors by coupling them with inorganic lanthanide nanocrystals. We show that the metallic atoms exposed on the nanocrystal surface can introduce strong coupling effects to 9&#8208;(4&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole (OCzT) and some organic chromophores with carbazole functional groups when the organics are approaching the nanocrystals. This unconventional organic&#8211;inorganic hybridization enables a nearly 100&#8201;% conversion of the singlet excitation to fast charge transfer luminescence that does not exist in pristine organics, which broadens the utility of organic phosphors in hybrid systems.

         <title>Simultaneous Chiral Fixation and Chiral Regulation Endowed by Dynamic Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible fixation of supramolecular chirality has been achieved by introducing dynamic covalent crosslinking into the chiral self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain polymers. After chiral induction, reversible [2+2] cycloaddition of the cinnamate group in the polymer chains allows inter&#8208;chain crosslinking and de&#8208;crosslinking to be controlled by light. This approach offers a pattern&#8208;embedded storage and retrieval mechanism for photo&#8208;editing chiral polymers.







Abstract
The construction of chiral superstructures through the self&#8208;assembly of non&#8208;chiral polymers usually relies on the interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonds, which is significantly limited by the memory ability of induced chirality. Although the introduction of covalent crosslinking can undoubtedly enhance the stability of chiral superstructures, the concurrent strong constraining effect hinders the application of chirality&#8208;smart materials. To address this issue, we have made a first attempt at the reversible fixation of supramolecular chirality by introducing dynamic covalent crosslinking into the chiral self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain polymers. After chiral induction, the reversible [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the cinnamate group in the polymer chains can be further controlled by light to manipulate inter&#8208;chain crosslinking and decrosslinking. Based on this photo&#8208;programmable and dynamic chiral fixation strategy, a novel pattern&#8208;embedded storage mechanism of chiral polymeric materials was established for the first time.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Polymer&#8208;Conjugate&#8208;Based Pickering Emulsions for Cell&#8208;Free Expression and Cascade Biotransformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely conjugated enzyme&#8208;polymer conjugates serve as stabilizers to form Pickering emulsions. In the aqueous phase, enzymes can be expressed in vitro and directly used to construct multiple&#8208;step reactions with the biocatalysts prepositioned on the emulsion droplet surface. This approach integrates the strengths of advanced biochemical engineering techniques, offering an efficient solution for chemical synthesis by cascade biotransformations.







Abstract
In this study, we addressed the limitations of conventional enzyme&#8208;polymer&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based Pickering emulsions for interfacial biocatalysis, which traditionally suffer from nonspecific and uncontrollable conjugation positions that can impede catalytic performance. By introducing a non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA) at a specific site on target enzymes, we enabled precise polymer&#8208;enzyme conjugation. These engineered conjugates then acted as biocatalytically active emulsifiers to stabilize Pickering emulsions, while encapsulating a cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) system in the aqueous phase for targeted enzyme expression. The resulting cascade reaction system leveraged enzymes expressed in the aqueous phase and on the emulsion interface for optimized chemical biosynthesis. The use of the cell&#8208;free system eliminated the need for intact whole cells or purified enzymes, representing a significant advancement in biocatalysis. Remarkably, the integration of Pickering emulsion, precise enzyme&#8208;polymer conjugation, and CFPS resulted in a fivefold enhancement in catalytic performance as compared to traditional single&#8208;phase reactions. Therefore, our approach harnesses the combined strengths of advanced biochemical engineering techniques, offering an efficient and practical solution for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals in various biocatalysis and biotransformation applications.

         <title>Peri&#8208;Anthracenethioindigo: A Scaffold for Efficient All&#8208;Red&#8208;Light and Near&#8208;Infrared Molecular Photoswitching
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular scaffold for highly efficient all&#8208;red&#8208;light photoswitching with an outstanding performance and property profile has been developed, i.e. peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT). The PAT photoswitch possesses absorptions up to 850&#8197;nm, extremely large negative photochromism, and high thermal stability of the metastable state. Photochromic polymers showing intense color changes from green to blue demonstrate spatially resolved photoswitching.







Abstract
Molecular photoswitching with red light is greatly desired to evade photodamage and achieve specific photoresponses. In virtually all reported cases however, only one switching direction uses red light while for the reverse switching, UV or visible light is needed. All&#8208;red&#8208;light photoswitching brings with it the clear advantage of pushing photoswitching to the limit of the low&#8208;energy spectrum, but no viable system is available currently. Here we report on peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) as molecular scaffold for highly efficient all&#8208;red&#8208;light photoswitching with an outstanding performance and property profile. The PAT photoswitch provides near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption up to 850&#8197;nm, large negative photochromism with more than 140&#8197;nm maxima shifts and changes color from green to blue upon irradiation with two shades of red light. Thermal stability of the metastable Z isomer is high with a corresponding half&#8208;life of days at 20&#8201;&#176;C. Application in red&#8208;light responsive polymers undergoing pronounced and reversible green to blue color changes demonstrate spatially resolved photoswitching. The PAT photoswitch thus offers unique responsiveness to very low energy light together with predictable and large geometrical changes within a rigid molecular scaffold. We expect a plethora of applications for PAT in the near future, e.g. in materials, molecular machines or biological context.

The PAT photoswitch possesses absorptions up to 850&#8197;nm, extremely large negative photochromism, and high thermal stability of the metastable state. Photochromic polymers showing intense color changes from green to blue demonstrate spatially resolved photoswitching.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular photoswitching with red light is greatly desired to evade photodamage and achieve specific photoresponses. In virtually all reported cases however, only one switching direction uses red light while for the reverse switching, UV or visible light is needed. All-red-light photoswitching brings with it the clear advantage of pushing photoswitching to the limit of the low-energy spectrum, but no viable system is available currently. Here we report on &lt;i&gt;peri&lt;/i&gt;-anthracenethioindigo (PAT) as molecular scaffold for highly efficient all-red-light photoswitching with an outstanding performance and property profile. The PAT photoswitch provides near-infrared (NIR) absorption up to 850&#8197;nm, large negative photochromism with more than 140&#8197;nm maxima shifts and changes color from green to blue upon irradiation with two shades of red light. Thermal stability of the metastable &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomer is high with a corresponding half-life of days at 20&#8201;&#176;C. Application in red-light responsive polymers undergoing pronounced and reversible green to blue color changes demonstrate spatially resolved photoswitching. The PAT photoswitch thus offers unique responsiveness to very low energy light together with predictable and large geometrical changes within a rigid molecular scaffold. We expect a plethora of applications for PAT in the near future, e.g. in materials, molecular machines or biological context.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of a Vinyl Thianthrenium Salt and Secondary Alkyl Iodides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report an unprecedented reductive vinylation of alkyl iodides, which expands on the currently possible reductive Csp2&#8208;Csp3 cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
We report the first reductive vinylation of alkyl iodides. The reaction uses a vinyl thianthrenium salt, a palladium catalyst, and an alkyl zinc intermediate formed in situ to trap the LnPdII(vinyl) complex formed after oxidative addition before it undergoes undesired homocoupling to form butadiene.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Enantioselective Sulfonylation of Yne&#8208;Allylic Esters with Sodium Sulfinates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction was developed for the sulfonylation of yne&#8208;allylic esters with sodium sulfinates. Salient features of this practical method include readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, excellent regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, as well as broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Impressive progress has been made in the copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric propargylic substitution (APS) reaction, but its use in remote asymmetric yne&#8208;allylic substitution remains a challenging topic. Herein, we report the first remote enantioselective copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of yne&#8208;allylic esters with sodium sulfinates. The reaction is assumed to occur via a copper&#8208;vinylvinylidene species as the key reactive intermediate. The use of readily available starting materials, the mild reaction conditions, and the excellent regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, as well as broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples), show the practicality and attractiveness of this method.

         <title>Increasing Reduction Potentials of Type 1 Copper Center and Catalytic Efficiency of Small Laccase from Streptomyces coelicolor through Secondary Coordination Sphere Mutations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction potential of type&#8197;1 copper (E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu) in small laccase (SLAC) has been tuned through mutations of residues in the secondary coordination sphere, with the aim to mimic those in high E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu fungal laccases. With three such mutations, we have increased E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu from wild&#8208;type SLAC by +189&#8197;mV to 556&#8197;mV vs. SHE, which is the highest reported to date. We have demonstrated additive E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu tuning of the three mutations and improved catalytic efficiency of the mutants relative to wild&#8208;type SLAC.







Abstract
The key to type 1 copper (T1Cu) function lies in the fine tuning of the CuII/I reduction potential (E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu) to match those of its redox partners, enabling efficient electron transfer in a wide range of biological systems. While the secondary coordination sphere (SCS) effects have been used to tune E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu in azurin over a wide range, these principles are yet to be generalized to other T1Cu&#8208;containing proteins to tune catalytic properties. To this end, we have examined the effects of Y229F, V290N and S292F mutations around the T1Cu of small laccase (SLAC) from Streptomyces coelicolor to match the high E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu of fungal laccases. Using ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, together with X&#8208;ray crystallography and redox titrations, we have probed the influence of SCS mutations on the T1Cu and corresponding E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu. While minimal and small E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu increases are observed in Y229F&#8208; and S292F&#8208;SLAC, the V290N mutant exhibits a major E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu increase. Moreover, the influence of these mutations on E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu is additive, culminating in a triple mutant Y229F/V290N/S292F&#8208;SLAC with the highest E&#176;&#8242;T1Cu of 556&#8197;mV vs. SHE reported to date. Further activity assays indicate that all mutants retain oxygen reduction reaction activity, and display improved catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM) relative to WT&#8208;SLAC.

         <title>Dual Photo&#8208;Responsive Diphenylacetylene Enables PET In&#8208;Situ Upcycling with Reverse Enhanced UV&#8208;Resistance and Strength</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from the oligomer&#8208;scale, this work implements a novel in situ chemical upcycling strategy for PET plastic wastes through tailored diphenylacetylene monomer. Uniquely, the dual photo&#8208;responses of diphenylacetylene enable upcycled PET plastics with reverse enhanced UV&#8208;resistance and strength.







Abstract
A novel in situ chemical upcycling strategy for plastic waste is proposed by the customized diphenylacetylene monomer with dual photo&#8208;response. That is, diphenylacetylene reactive monomers are in situ inserted into the macromolecular chain of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics/fibers through one&#8208;pot transesterification of slight&#8208;depolymerization and re&#8208;polymerization. On the one hand, the diphenylacetylene group absorbs short&#8208;wave high&#8208;energy UV rays and then releases long&#8208;wave low&#8208;energy harmless fluorescence. On the other hand, the UV&#8208;induced photo&#8208;crosslinking reaction among diphenylacetylene groups produces extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, resulting in a red&#8208;shift (due to decreased HOMO&#8211;LUMO separation) in the UV absorption band and locked crosslink points between PET chains. Therefore, with increasing UV exposure time, the upcycled PET plastics exhibit reverse enhanced UV resistance and mechanical strength (superior to original performance), instead of serious UV&#8208;photodegradation and damaged performance. This upcycling strategy at oligomer&#8208;scale not only provides a new idea for traditional plastic recycling, but also solves the common problem of gradual degradation of polymer performance during use.

         <title>Growth of Merocyanine Dye J&#8208;Aggregate Nanosheets by Living Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of a new amphiphilic merocyanine dye has been investigated in an aqueous solvent mixture. Two supramolecular polymorphs were observed: The first polymorph is an off&#8208;pathway H&#8208;type nanoparticle (Agg1) and the second is a thermodynamic J&#8208;aggregate nanosheet (Agg2). A seeded living supramolecular polymerization was utilized to accelerate the transformation from metastable nanoparticles into two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets.







Abstract
J&#8208;aggregates are highly desired dye aggregates but so far there has been no general concept how to accomplish the required slip&#8208;stacked packing arrangement for dipolar merocyanine (MC) dyes whose aggregation commonly affords one&#8208;dimensional aggregates composed of antiparallel, co&#8208;facially stacked MCs with H&#8208;type coupling. Herein we describe a strategy for MC J&#8208;aggregates based on our results for an amphiphilic MC dye bearing alkyl and oligo(ethylene glycol) side chains. In an aqueous solvent mixture, we observe the formation of two supramolecular polymorphs for this MC dye, a metastable off&#8208;pathway nanoparticle showing H&#8208;type coupling and a thermodynamically favored nanosheet showing J&#8208;type coupling. Detailed studies concerning the self&#8208;assembly mechanism by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and the packing structure by atomic force microscopy and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering show how the packing arrangement of such amphiphilic MC dyes can afford slip&#8208;stacked two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets whose macrodipole is compensated by the formation of a bilayer structure. As an additional feature we demonstrate how the size of the nanosheets can be controlled by seeded living supramolecular polymerization.

         <title>Mechanochemistry in Block Copolymers: New Scission Site due to Dynamic Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpected mechanochemistry kinetics and selective off&#8208;center scission behavior is shown in linear block copolymers (BCPs) stressed in solution. Molecular dynamics modeling suggests a dynamic phase separation of the blocks inducing the unusual distribution of applied forces, and promoting force focusing at the interface.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry can lead to the degradation of the properties of covalent macromolecules. In recent years, numerous functional materials have been developed based on block copolymers (BCPs), however, like homopolymers, their chains could undergo mechanochemical damage during processing, which could have crucial impact on their performance. To investigate the mechanochemical response of BCPs, multiple polymers comprising different ratios of butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate were prepared with similar degree of polymerization and stressed in solution via ultrasonication. Interestingly, all BCPs, regardless of the amount of the methacrylate monomer, presented a mechanochemistry rate constant similar to that of the methacrylate homopolymer, while a random copolymer reacted like the acrylate homopolymer. Size&#8208;exclusion chromatography showed that, in addition to the typical main peak shift towards higher retention times, a different daughter fragment was produced indicating a secondary selective scission site, situated around the covalent connection between the two blocks. Molecular dynamics modeling using acrylate and methacrylate oligomers were carried out and indicated that dynamic phase separation occurs even in a good solvent. Such non&#8208;random conformations can explain the faster polymer mechanochemistry. Moreover, the dynamic model for end&#8208;to&#8208;end chain overstretching supports bond scission which is not necessarily chain&#8208;centered.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Near&#8208;Infrared Chlorinated Rylenecarboximide Fluorophores via Consecutive C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>

         <dc:description>
A new class of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores is obtained by consecutive C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C bond formation between diphenylamines and 9,10&#8208;dibromoperylenecarboximide. These fluorophores show high fluorescence quantum yields, together with large Stokes shifts and high photostability, qualifying them as useful NIR emitters for applications as biomarkers and security inks.







Abstract
A new class of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores, PAI, is obtained by consecutive C&#8722;N/C&#8722;C bond formation between diphenylamines and 9,10&#8208;dibromoperylenecarboximide. Owing to the rigid structure, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and pronounced push&#8208;pull substitution, these fluorophores show emission maxima up to 804&#8197;nm and large Stokes shifts. The extraordinarily high fluorescence quantum yields from 47&#8201;% to 70&#8201;% are attributed to chloro substitution in the bay positions of the perylene core. These characteristics, together with high photostability, qualify them as useful NIR emitters for applications as biomarkers and security inks.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Reversible Multicolor Supramolecular Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confinment of a spiropyran&#8208;modified cyanostilbene guest (BCNMC) in a cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) host has led to a light&#8208;driven multicolor luminescent supramolecular shuttle, which exhibits reversible conversion of the topological morphology. Alternating irradiation with visible light and the absence of light results in different fluorescence colors for information encryption.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven multicolor supramolecular systems mainly rely on the doping of dyes or a photo&#8208;reaction to produce unidirectional luminescence. Herein, we use visible light to drive the bidirectional reversible multicolor supramolecular shuttle from blue to green, white, yellow, up to orange by simple encapsulation of spiropyran&#8208;modified cyanostilbene (BCNMC) by the macrocyclic cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) monomer. The resultant host&#8211;guest complex displayed enhanced fluorescence properties, i.e. the multicolor fluorescence shuttle changed from blue to orange in the dark within 2&#8197;hours and reverted to the original state upon visible light irradiation for 30&#8197;s. Benefiting from the sensitivity of the spiropyran moiety to light, it can spontaneously isomerize from the ring&#8208;opened state to a ring&#8208;closed isomer in aqueous solution, and this photo&#8208;isomerization reaction is a reversible process under visible light irradiation, leading to the multicolor luminescence supramolecular shuttle as a result of intramolecular energy transfer. In addition, the light also drove the reversible conversion of the topological morphology of the host&#8211;guest complex from two&#8208;dimensional nanoplatelets to nanospheres. Different from the widely reported molecular rotaxane &#8220;shuttle&#8221;, the spiropyran supramolecular shuttle confined in the macrocyclic host CB[8] not only modulated a reversible topological morphology by light but also exhibited multicolor luminescence, which was successfully applied in programmed and rewritable information encryption.

         <title>Accelerated Electrophotocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H Heteroarylation Enabled by an Efficient Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 52, December 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and scalable flow reactor for electrophotocatalysis is presented. The reactor can simultaneously exploit photons and electrons. The efficacy of this reactor was demonstrated in a novel electrophotocatalytic heteroarylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Electrophotocatalytic transformations are garnering attention in organic synthesis, particularly for accessing reactive intermediates under mild conditions. Moving these methodologies to continuous&#8208;flow systems, or flow ElectroPhotoCatalysis (f&#8208;EPC), showcases potential for scalable processes due to enhanced irradiation, increased electrode surface, and improved mixing of the reaction mixture. Traditional methods sequentially link photochemical and electrochemical reactions, using flow reactors connected in series, yet struggle to accommodate reactive transient species. In this study, we introduce a new flow reactor concept for electrophotocatalysis (EPC) that simultaneously utilizes photons and electrons. The reactor is designed with a transparent electrode and employs cost&#8208;effective materials. We used this technology to develop an efficient process for electrophotocatalytic heteroarylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. Importantly, the same setup can also facilitate purely electrochemical and photochemical transformations. This reactor represents a significant advancement in electrophotocatalysis, providing a framework for its application in flow for complex synthetic transformations.

We used this technology to develop an efficient process for electrophotocatalytic heteroarylation of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds. Importantly, the same setup can also facilitate purely electrochemical and photochemical transformations. This reactor represents a significant advancement in electrophotocatalysis, providing a framework for its application in flow for complex synthetic transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by Michelle Arkin and Adam Renslo from the University of California, San Francisco in the USA and Luc Brunsveld and Christian Ottmann from the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands. They recently published an article on designing molecular glues for the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/estrogen receptor (ER) protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI). Molecular glues increase the binding between two proteins by binding at the PPI interface. While they hold exciting promise to induce new biology and treat disease, systematic approaches to discover glues are just becoming available. Fragment&#8208;based drug discovery has been used to discover inhibitors of PPI; here, the team demonstrated a fragment discovery and linking strategy to create a new molecular glue for 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ER, an anticancer target. &#8220;From Tethered to Freestanding Stabilizers of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions though Fragment Linking&#8221;, E.&#8197;J.
