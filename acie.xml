         <title>Delocalized Orbitals Over Metal Clusters and Organic Linkers Enable Boosted Charge Transfer in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Overall CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conversion of CO2 to C2 through photocatalysis poses significant challenges, and one of the biggest hurdles stems from the sluggishness of the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. Herein, taking metal&#8208;organic framework (PFC&#8208;98) as a model photocatalyst, we report a new strategy to facilitate charge separation. This strategy involves matching the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied node and linker orbitals of the MOF, thereby creating the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO) delocalized over both the node and linker. This feature enables the direct excitation of electrons from photosensitive linker to the catalytic centers, achieving a direct charge transfer (DCT) pathway. For comparison, an isoreticular MOF (PFC&#8208;6) based on analogue components but with far apart frontier energy level was synthesized. The delocalized LUCO caused the presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated state (ICS), prolonging the excited state lifetime and further inhibiting the electron&#8208;hole recombination. The presence of an internal charge&#8208;separated state (ICS) prolongs the excited state lifetime and further inhibits the electron&#8208;hole recombination. Moreover, it also induced abundant electrons accumulating at the catalytic sites, enabling the multi&#8208;electron transfer process. As a result, the material featuring delocalized LUCO exhibits superior overall CO2 photocatalytic performance with high C2 production yield and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiplexed Shortwave Infrared Imaging Highlights Anatomical Structures in Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiplexed fluorescence in vivo imaging remains challenging due to the attenuation and scattering of visible and traditional near infrared (NIR&#8208;I, 650 &#8211; 950 nm) wavelengths. Fluorescence imaging using short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR, 1000 &#8211; 1700 nm, a.k.a. NIR&#8208;II) light enables deeper tissue penetration due to reduced tissue scattering as well as minimal background autofluorescence. SWIR&#8208;emitting semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with tunable emission peaks and optical stability are powerful contrast agents, yet few imaging demonstrations exclusively use SWIR emission beyond two&#8208;color imaging schemes. In this study, we engineered&#160;three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) core/shell QDs with distinct SWIR emission ranging from 1100 &#8211; 1550 nm for simultaneous three&#8208;color imaging in mice. We first use the exceptional photostability of QDs to non&#8208;invasively track lymphatic drainage with longitudinal imaging, highlighting the detailed networks of lymphatic vessels with widefield imaging over a 2 hr period. We then perform multiplexed imaging with all three QDs to distinctly visualize the lymphatic system and spatially overlapping vasculature networks, including clearly distinguishing the liver and spleen. This work establishes optimized SWIR QDs for next&#8208;generation multiplexed and longitudinal preclinical imaging, unlocking numerous opportunities for preclinical studies of disease progression, drug biodistribution, and cell trafficking dynamics in living organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;activated Nanocatalyst for Precise In&#8208;situ Antimicrobial Synthesis via Photoredox&#8208;Catalytic Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excessive and prolonged use of antibiotics contributes to the emergence of drug&#8208;resistant S. aureus strains and potential dysbacteriosis&#8208;related diseases, necessitating the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches. Herein, we present a light&#8208;activated nanocatalyst for synthesizing in&#8208;situ antimicrobials through photoredox&#8208;catalytic click reaction, achieving precise, site&#8208;directed elimination of S. aureus skin infections. Methylene blue (MB), a commercially available photosensitizer, was encapsulated within the CuII&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework, MOF&#8208;199, and further enveloped with Pluronic F&#8208;127 to create the light&#8208;responsive nanocatalyst MB@PMOF. Upon exposure to red light, MB participates in a photoredox&#8208;catalytic cycle, driven by the 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic carboxylate salts (BTC&#8722;) ligand presented in the structure of MOF&#8208;199. This light&#8208;activated MB then catalyzes the reduction of CuII to CuI through a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process, efficiently initiating the click reaction to form active antimicrobial agents under physiological conditions. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated the effectiveness of MB@PMOF&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis in inhibiting S. aureus, including their methicillin&#8208;resistant strains, thereby accelerating skin healing in severe bacterial infections. This study introduces a novel design paradigm for controlled, on&#8208;site drug synthesis, offering a promising alternative to realize precise treatment of bacterial infections without undesirable side effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Controlled Lewis Acid&#8211;Base Interaction Toward para&#8208;Selective Borylation of Aromatic Aldimines and Benzylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H bond functionalization of arenes at the para position remains extremely challenging primarily due to its relative inaccessibility from the catalytic site. As a consequence, it is significantly restricted to the limited molecular scaffolds. Herein, we report a method for the para&#8208;C&#8211;H borylation of aromatic aldimines and benzylamines using commercially available ligands under iridium catalysis. The established method displayed excellent para&#8208;selectivity for variously substituted aromatic aldimines, benzylamines and bioactive molecules. Based on the several control experiments, it has been realized that a Lewis acid&#8211;base interaction between the nitrogen and boron functionality guides the para selectivity via a steric shield for the aromatic aldimines, where Bpin acts as a transient directing group. However, the steric shield of the in situ generated N&#8211;Bpin moiety controlled the overall selectivity for the para borylation of benzylamines.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Record C2H2 Packing Density for Highly Efficient C2H2/C2H4 Separation with a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Prepared by a Scalable Synthesis in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorptive C2H2/C2H4 separation using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has emerged as a promising technology for the removal of C2H2 (acetylene) impurity (1%) from C2H4 (ethylene). The practical application of these materials involves the optimization of separation performance as well as development of scalable and green production protocols.Herein, we report the efficient C2H2/C2H4 separation in a MOF, Cu(OH)INA (INA: isonicotinate) which achieves a record C2H2 packing density of 351 mg cm&#8208;3 at 0.01 bar through high affinity towards C2H2. DFT (density functional theory) calculations reveal the synergistic binding mechanism through pore confinement and the oxygen sites in pore wall.The weakly basic nature of binding sites leads to a relatively low heat of adsorption (Qst) of approximately 36 kJ/mol, which is beneficial for material regeneration and thermal management. Furthermore, a scalable and environmentally friendly synthesis protocol with a high space&#8208;time yield of 544 kg m&#8208;3 day&#8208;1 has been developed without using any modulating agents. This material also demonstrates enduring separation performance for multiple cycles, maintaining its efficacy after exposure to water or air for three months.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting Mitochondrial Guanine Quadruplexes for Photoactivatable Chemotherapy in Normoxic and Hypoxic Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A first example of a mitochondrial G&#8208;quadruplex (mitoG4s) targeted Ru(II) photooxidant complex is reported. The complex, Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 induces photodamage toward guanine quadruplexes (G4s) located in the mitochondrial genome under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 shows high affinity for mitoG4s and localises within mitochondria of live HeLa cells. Immunolabelling with anti&#8208;G4 antibody, BG4, confirms Ru&#8208;TAP&#8208;PDC3 associates with G4s within the mitochondria of fixed cells. The complex induces depletion of mtDNA in live cells under irradiation at 405 nm, confirmed by loss of PicoGreen signal from mitochondria. Biochemical studies confirm this process induces apoptosis. The complex shows low dark toxicity and an impressive phototoxicity index (PI) of &gt;89 was determined in Hela under very low intensity irradiation, 5 J/cm2. The phototoxicity is thought to operate through both Type II singlet oxygen and Type III pathways depending on normoxic or hypoxic conditions from live cell imaging and plasmid DNA cleavage. Overall, we demonstrate targeting mitoG4s and mtDNA with a photooxidant is a potent route to achieving apoptosis under hypoxic conditions that can be extended to phototherapy.</dc:description>

The complex induces depletion of mtDNA in live cells under irradiation at 405 nm, confirmed by loss of PicoGreen signal from mitochondria. Biochemical studies confirm this process induces apoptosis. The complex shows low dark toxicity and an impressive phototoxicity index (PI) of &amp;gt;89 was determined in Hela under very low intensity irradiation, 5 J/cm2. The phototoxicity is thought to operate through both Type II singlet oxygen and Type III pathways depending on normoxic or hypoxic conditions from live cell imaging and plasmid DNA cleavage. Overall, we demonstrate targeting mitoG4s and mtDNA with a photooxidant is a potent route to achieving apoptosis under hypoxic conditions that can be extended to phototherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxide&#8208;Encapsulated Silver Electrocatalysts for Selective and Stable Syngas Production from Reactive Carbon Capture Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a simple yet effect strategy to enhance CO selectivity and electrode stability using a titanium dioxide (TiO2) overlayer and a chelating agent ethylene diamine tetra&#8208;acetic acid (EDTA). This strategy is ideally suited for the direct electrolysis of reactive CO2 capture solution towards carbon&#8208;neutral chemicals production.







Abstract
Electrolysis of bicarbonate&#8208;containing CO2 capture solutions is a promising approach towards achieving low&#8208;cost carbon&#8208;neutral chemicals production. However, the parasitic bicarbonate&#8208;mediated hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and electrode instability in the presence of trace impurities remain major obstacles to overcome. This work demonstrates that the combined use of titanium dioxide (TiO2) overlayers with the chelating agent ethylene diamine tetra&#8208;acetic acid (EDTA) significantly enhances the selectivity and stability of Ag&#8208;based electrocatalysts for bicarbonate electrolysis. The amorphous TiO2 overlayers suppress the HER by over 50&#8201;% at potentials more negative than &#8722;0.7&#8197;V vs. RHE, increasing the CO faradaic efficiency (FE) by 33&#8201;% (relative). In situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) measurements reveal the absence of near&#8208;surface bicarbonate species and an abundance of CO2 reduction intermediates at the Ag|TiO2 buried interface, suggesting that the overlayers suppress HER by blocking bicarbonate ions from reaching the buried active sites. In accelerated degradation tests with 5&#8197;ppm of Fe(III) impurity, the addition of EDTA allows stable CO production with &gt;47&#8201;% FE, while the electrodes rapidly deactivate in the absence of EDTA. This work highlights the use of TiO2 overlayers for enhancing the CO&#8201;:&#8201;H2 ratio while simultaneously protecting electrocatalysts from impurities likely to be present in &#8220;open&#8221; carbon capture systems.

         <title>Fluorinated Dialkyl Chloronium Salts: Synthesis and Reactivity for Fluoroalkylation and Hydride Abstraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new concept for the synthesis of dialkyl chloronium cations [R&#8210;Cl&#8210;R]+ is described (R = CH3, CH2CF3), that allows the formation of fluorinated derivatives. By utilizing the xenonium salt [XeOTeF5][M(OTeF5)n] (M = Sb, n = 6; M = Al, n = 4) chlorine atoms of chloroalkanes or the deactivated chlorofluoroalkane CH2ClCF3 are oxidized and removed as ClOTeF5 leading to the isolation of the corresponding chloronium salt. Since the resulting highly electrophilic cation [Cl(CH2CF3)2]+ is able to alkylate weak nucleophiles, this compound can be utilized for the introduction of a fluorinated alkyl group to those. In addition, the fluorinated alkyl chloronium cation displays a high hydride ion affinity, enabling the activation of linear hydrocarbons by hydride abstraction even at low temperatures ultimately leading to the formation of branched carbocations.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Chiral Polymers Exhibiting Amplified Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is highly promising in realm of 3D display and optical data storage. However, designing a groundbreaking chiral material with high comprehensive CPEL performance remains a formidable challenge. In this work, a pair of chiral polymers with self&#8208;assembled behavior is designed by integrating a chiral BN&#8208;moiety into polyfluorene backbone, named R&#8208;PBN and S&#8208;PBN, respectively. The chiral polymers show narrowband emission centered at 490 nm with full&#8208;width half maximum (FWHM) of 29 nm and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 79%. After thermal annealing treatment, the chiral polymers undergo self&#8208;assembly, exhibiting amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with asymmetry factor (|glum|) of up to 0.11. Moreover, the solution&#8208;processed nondoped CP&#8208;OLEDs based on the chiral polymers as emitting layers exhibit maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 9.8%, intense CPEL activities with |gEL| of up to 0.07, and small FWHM of 36 nm, simultaneously. This represents the first case of self&#8208;assembled chiral polymers that combines high EQE, large gEL value and narrowband emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Regio&#8208; and Chemoselectivity in Oxidation of Pyrroles and Indoles Enabled by a Thianthrenium Salt Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TTSO (thianthrene&#8208;S&#8208;oxide) in conjunction with TFAA (trifluoroacetic anhydride) and Br&#248;nsted acid is able to oxidize pyrroles to &#916;3&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ones and indoles to indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones via a thianthrenium salt intermediate. In the case of 3&#8208;substituted pyrroles, the product isomer formed is that in which oxygenation has been introduced at the more sterically hindered position.







Abstract
A dearomative oxidation of pyrroles to &#916;3&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ones is described, which employs a sulfoxide as oxidant, in conjunction with a carboxylic acid anhydride and a Br&#248;nsted acid additive. 3&#8208;substituted pyrroles undergo regioselective oxidation to give the product isomer in which oxygen has been introduced at the more hindered position. Regioselectivity is rationalized by a proposed mechanism that proceeds by initial thianthrenium introduction at the less&#8208;hindered pyrrole &#945;&#8208;position, followed by distal attack of an oxygen nucleophile and subsequent elimination of thianthrene. The same reaction conditions are also able to effect a chemoselective oxidation of indoles to indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones and additionally of indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones to 2&#8208;hydroxyindolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones. Here again, the regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities are rationalized through the intermediacy of a thianthrenium salt.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Alkenylation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for highly efficient and enantioselective alkenylation of aldehydes promoted by an easily accessible cobalt&#8208;based complex was developed. This protocol represents the first example of incorporating a wide range of alkenyl groups with diversified substitution patterns as well as axial stereogenicity into enantioenriched allylic alcohols.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective alkenylation of aldehydes with easily accessible alkenyl halides promoted by a chiral cobalt complex derived from a newly developed tridentate bisoxazolinephosphine is presented. Such processes represent an unprecedented reaction pathway for cobalt catalysis and a general approach that enable rapid construction of highly diversified enantioenriched allylic alcohols containing a 1,1&#8208;, 1,2&#8208;disubstituted and trisubstituted alkene as well as axial stereogenicity in up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er without the need of preformation of alkenyl&#8211;metal reagents. DFT calculations revealed the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented Cr&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Reformatsky reaction of aldehydes with &#945;&#8208;chlorinated esters and amides has been developed, providing modular access to valuable chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
This study describes an unprecedented chromium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Reformatsky reaction, enabling the synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carbonyl compounds from &#945;&#8208;chlorinated or &#945;&#8208;brominated esters and amides. By employing a chiral chromium/diarylamine bis(oxazoline) catalyst, we achieved relatively broad functional group tolerance. Distinct from known reports, the protocol operates under both classical and photoredox conditions, facilitated by the in situ formation of a nucleophilic chiral chromium intermediate through a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism. Preliminary mechanistic insights, supported by DFT calculations, identify the nucleophilic aldehyde addition as the key stereo&#8208;determining step. This approach not only overcomes the limitations of existing Reformatsky reactions but also provides a versatile strategy for accessing complex chiral molecules.

         <title>Complex Pathways Drive Pluripotent Fmoc&#8208;Leucine Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of hierarchical assemblies of Fmoc&#8208;Leu are accessed using non&#8208;classical and classical nucleation following complex pathways. Chemical and thermal inputs lead to phase separated sub&#8208;micron liquid and solid droplets which can transform to fibrous stable hydrogel, transient metastable hydrogels, and milli&#8208;metric polycrystal spherulites or single crystals.







Abstract
Nature uses complex self&#8208;assembly pathways to access distinct functional non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assemblies. This remarkable ability to steer same set of biomolecules into different self&#8208;assembly states is done by avoiding thermodynamic pit. In synthetic systems, on demand control over &#8216;Pathway Complexity&#8217; to access self&#8208;assemblies different from equilibrium structures remains challenging. Here we show versatile non&#8208;equilibrium assemblies of the same monomer via alternate assembly pathways. The assemblies nucleate using non&#8208;classical or classical nucleation routes into distinct metastable (transient hydrogels), kinetic (stable hydrogels) and thermodynamic structures [(poly)&#8208;crystals and 2D sheets]. Initial chemical and thermal inputs force the monomers to follow different assembly pathways and form soft&#8208;materials with distinct molecular arrangements than at equilibrium. In many cases, equilibrium structures act as thermodynamic sink which consume monomers from metastable structures giving transiently formed materials. This dynamics can be tuned chemically or thermally to slow down the dissolution of transient hydrogel, or skip the intermediate hydrogel altogether to reach final equilibrium assemblies. If required this metastable state can be kinetically trapped to give strong hydrogel stable over days. This method to control different self&#8208;assembly states can find potential use in similar biomimetic systems to access new materials for various applications.

         <title>Variant&#8208;Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte without Phase Separation for Low&#8208;Temperature Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal low&#8208;temperature electrolyte with variant&#8208;localized high&#8208;concentration solvation (&#957;&#8208;LHCE) structure was designed to avoid the phase separation, which endowed DIBs with long&#8208;term cycling stability, excellent discharge characteristic, and outstanding low&#8208;temperature performance.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) present great application potential in low&#8208;temperature energy storage scenarios due to their unique dual&#8208;ion working mechanism. However, at low temperatures, the insufficient electrochemical oxidation stability of electrolytes and depressed interfacial compatibility impair the DIB performance. Here, we design a variant&#8208;localized high&#8208;concentration solvation structure for universal low&#8208;temperature electrolytes (&#957;&#8208;LHCE) without the phase separation via introducing an extremely weak&#8208;solvating solvent with low energy levels. The unique solvation structure gives the &#957;&#8208;LHCE enhanced electrochemical oxidation stability. Meanwhile, the extremely weak&#8208;solvating solvent can competitively participate in the Li+&#8208;solvated coordination, which improves the Li+ transfer kinetics and boosts the formation of robust interphases. Thus, the &#957;&#8208;LHCE electrolyte not only has a good high&#8208;voltage stability of &gt;5.5&#8197;V and proper Li+ transference number of 0.51 but also shows high ionic conductivities of 1 mS/cm at low temperatures. Consequently, the &#957;&#8208;LHCE electrolyte enables different types of batteries to achieve excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability and good rate capability at both room and low temperatures. Especially, the capacity retentions of the DIB are 77.7&#8201;% and 51.6&#8201;%, at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, indicating great potential for low&#8208;temperature energy storage applications, such as polar exploration, emergency communication equipment, and energy storage station in cold regions.

         <title>Role of Cu Oxide and Cu Adatoms in the Reactivity of CO2 on Cu(110)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With in situ near&#8208;ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (NAP&#8208;STM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that the CuO/Cu(110) interface reacts with CO2 at room temperature, yielding the formation of Cu adatom&#8208;CO3 complexes. The reaction&#8208;induced surface structure resulting from CO2 exposes Cu adatoms and CuO segments as potential active sites on Cu(110), whose presence favor CO2 hydrogenation into methanol over sites on the bare Cu surface.







Abstract
We investigate the interaction of CO2 with metallic and oxidized Cu(110) surfaces using a combination of near&#8208;ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (NAP&#8208;STM) and theoretical calculations. While the Cu(110) and full CuO films are inert, the interface between bare Cu(110) and the CuO film is observed to react instantly with CO2 at a 10&#8197;mbar pressure. The reaction is observed to proceed from the interfacial sites of CuO/Cu(110). During reaction with CO2, the CuO/Cu(110) interface releases Cu adatoms which combine with CO3 to produce a variety of added Cu&#8722;CO3 structures, whose stability depends on the gas pressure of CO2. A main implication for the reactivity of Cu(110) is that Cu adatoms and highly undercoordinated CuO segments are created on the Cu(110) surface through the interaction with CO2, which may act as reaction&#8208;induced active sites. In the case of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, our theoretical assessment of such sites indicates that their presence may significantly promote CH3OH formation. Our study thus implies that the CuO/Cu(110) interfacial system is highly dynamic in the presence of CO2, and it suggests a possible strong importance of reaction&#8208;induced Cu and CuO sites for the surface chemistry of Cu(110) in CO2&#8208;related catalysis.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Dynamic Covalent C=C/C=N Metathesis Reaction for Associative Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing the C=C/C=N metathesis reaction, we have successfully incorporated tunable plasticity into thermosetting polyurethanes, creating catalyst&#8208;free and associative covalent adaptable networks with superior thermal and mechanical properties. The rapid exchange of C=C/C=N bonds significantly accelerates stress relaxation, enhancing malleability and enabling recovery under mild conditions. This plasticity also led to advanced shape memory properties with complex 3D permanent shapes.







Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs), leveraging the dynamic exchange of covalent bonds, emerge as a promising material to address the challenge of irreversible cross&#8208;linking in thermosetting polymers. In this work, we explore the introduction of a catalyst&#8208;free and associative C=C/C=N metathesis reaction into thermosetting polyurethanes, creating CANs with superior stability, solvent resistance, and thermal/mechanical properties. By incorporating this dynamic exchange reaction, stress&#8208;relaxation is significantly accelerated compared to imine&#8208;bond&#8208;only networks, with the rate adjustable by modifying substituents in the ortho position of the dynamic double bonds. The obtained plasticity enables recycle without altering the chemical structure or mechanical properties, and is also found to be vital for achieving shape memory functions with complex spatial structures. This metathesis reaction as a new dynamic crosslinker of polymer networks has the potential to accelerate the ongoing exploration of malleable and functional thermoset polymers.

         <title>A Double Twisted Nanographene with a Contorted Pyrene Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The implementation of four [6]helical edges around a pyrene core gave a double twisted nanographene with red emission. Despite containing four helical motifs, the actual chiral origin was found to be the contorted pyrene core, achieving absorption/emission dissymmetry factors of up to an order of 10&#8722;3. The corresponding radical cation exhibits intense near&#8208;infrared absorption and circular dichroism tailing to 1600&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The mature synthetic methodologies enable us to rationally design and produce chiral nanographenes (NGs), most of which consist of multiple helical motifs. However, inherent chirality originating from twisted geometry has just emerged to be employed in chiral NGs. Herein, we report a red&#8208;emissive chiral NG constituted of orthogonally arranged two&#8208;fold twisted &#960;&#8208;skeletons at a contorted pyrene core which contributes to optical transitions of S0&#8594;S1 and vice versa. The thus&#8208;obtained NG exhibited a robustness on its redox properties through 2e&#8722; uptake/release. The chemical oxidation generated stable radical cation whose absorption covers near&#8208;infrared I and II regions. Overall, the contorted pyrene core governs electronic nature of the chiral NG. The twist operation on NGs would be, therefore, a design strategy to alter conventional chirality induction on NGs.

         <title>Dearomative Intramolecular (4+3) Cycloadditions of Thiophenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative intramolecular (4+3) cycloadditions of thiophenes with epoxy and aziridinyl enolsilanes occur under silyl catalysis to generate sulfur&#8208;bridged cycloadducts. Conservation of enantiomeric purity was observed when optically&#8208;enriched epoxide was used. A desulfurizing transformation provides functionalized 6,7&#8208;fused bicyclic frameworks. DFT calculations reveal the origins of the facile dearomatization of thiophenes in these cycloadditions.







Abstract
Unexpectedly facile dearomative intramolecular (4+3) cycloadditions of thiophenes with epoxy enolsilanes, providing sulfur&#8208;bridged cycloadducts, are reported. A total of fifteen thiophene substrates have been found to undergo (4+3) cycloaddition smoothly to produce endo and exo (4+3) adducts in yields of up to 83&#8201;% with moderate to good diastereoselectivity. Complete conservation of enantiomeric purity was observed when the optically enriched epoxide was used. The desulfurizing transformations of the sulfur&#8208;bridged skeleton of the cycloadducts provide functionalized 6,7&#8208;fused bicyclic frameworks consisting of 1,3&#8208;cycloheptadiene subunits. Density functional theory calculations reveal the origins of the facile dearomatization of thiophenes in these (4+3) cycloadditions.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative 1,2&#8208;Hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing an arenophile&#8208;mediated photocycloaddition and copper hydride catalysis, we report a formal dearomative hydroamination of nonactivated feedstock arenes, including benzene and naphthalene. A unique selectivity paradigm is rationalized using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and a scalable desymmetrization is developed. This transformation enables efficient access to densely&#8208;functionalized small molecules with multiple stereocenters.







Abstract
Catalytic olefin hydroamination reactions are some of the most atom&#8208;economical transformations that bridge readily available starting materials&#8211;olefins and high&#8208;value&#8208;added amines. Despite significant advances in this field over the last two decades, the formal hydroamination of nonactivated aromatic compounds remains an unsolved challenge. Herein, we report the extension of olefin hydroamination to aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems by using arenophile&#8208;mediated dearomatization and Cu&#8208;catalysis to perform 1,2&#8208;hydroamination on nonactivated arenes. This strategy was applied to a variety of substituted arenes and heteroarenes to provide general access to structurally complex amines. We conducted DFT calculations to inform mechanistic understanding and rationalize unexpected selectivity trends. Furthermore, we developed a practical, scalable desymmetrization to deliver enantioenriched dearomatized products and enable downstream synthetic applications. We ultimately used this dearomative strategy to efficiently synthesize a collection of densely functionalized small molecules.

         <title>Polycatenanes Formed of Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reviews the most relevant examples of polycatenanes in which the catenating subcomponents forming the mechanical bonds are interlocked three&#8208;dimensional metal organic cages (MOCs). We emphasize the beneficial aspects of mechanical bond formation among MOCs, synthetic approaches, supramolecular topologies, and structure&#8211;function correlations. The experimental and theoretical aspects of polycatenanes made of MOCs have also been investigated.







Abstract
Poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenanes (PCs) self&#8208;assembled of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal organic cages (MOCs) (hereafter referred to as PCs&#8208;MOCs) are a relatively new class of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) that combine the properties of MOCs and polymers. The synthesis of PCs&#8208;MOCs is challenging because of the difficulties associated with interlocking MOCs, the occurrence of multiple weak supramolecular electrostatic interactions between cages, and the importance of solvent templating effects. The high density of mechanical bonds interlocking the MOCs endows the MOCs with mechanical and physical properties such as enhanced stability, responsive dynamic behavior and low solubility, which can unlock new functional properties. In this Minireview, we highlight the benefit of interlocking MOCs in the formation of PCs&#8208;MOCs structures as well as the synthetic approaches exploited in their preparation, from thermodynamic to kinetic methods, both in the solution and solid&#8208;states. Examples of PCs&#8208;MOCs self&#8208;assembled from various types of nanosized cages (i.e., tetrahedral, trigonal prismatic, octahedral and icosahedral) are described in this article, providing an overview of the research carried out in this area. The focus is on the structure&#8211;property relationship with examples of functional applications such as electron conductivity, X&#8208;ray attenuation, gas adsorption and molecular sensing. We believe that the structural and functional aspects of the reviewed PCs&#8208;MOCs will attract chemists in this research field with great potential as new functional materials in nanotechnological disciplines such as gas adsorption, sensing and photophysical properties such as X&#8208;ray attenuation or electron conductivity.

         <title>Flexible Aqueous Cr&#8208;Ion Hybrid Supercapacitors with Remarkable Electrochemical Properties in all Climates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hybrid supercapacitor assembled from a chromium metal anode based on an electroplating/stripping mechanism and a porous graphitized carbon fabric cathode is proposed. This research made an advance in developing a reversible chromium metal deposition/dissolution process, and the device obtained an efficient and stable energy storage capability under all climate circumstances.







Abstract
The integration of hostless battery&#8208;like metal anodes for hybrid supercapacitors is a realistic design method for energy storage devices with promising future applications. With significant Cr element deposits on Earth, exceptionally high theoretical capacity (1546&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and accessible redox potential (&#8722;0.74&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) of Cr metals, the design of Cr anodes has rightly come into our focus.

     alt="Flexible Aqueous Cr-Ion Hybrid Supercapacitors with Remarkable Electrochemical Properties in all Climates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel hybrid supercapacitor assembled from a chromium metal anode based on an electroplating/stripping mechanism and a porous graphitized carbon fabric cathode is proposed. This research made an advance in developing a reversible chromium metal deposition/dissolution process, and the device obtained an efficient and stable energy storage capability under all climate circumstances.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of hostless battery-like metal anodes for hybrid supercapacitors is a realistic design method for energy storage devices with promising future applications. With significant Cr element deposits on Earth, exceptionally high theoretical capacity (1546&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and accessible redox potential (&#8722;0.74&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) of Cr metals, the design of Cr anodes has rightly come into our focus. This work presents a breakthrough design of a flexible Cr-ion hybrid supercapacitor (CHSC) based on a porous graphitized carbon fabric (PGCF) substrate prepared by K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; activation. In the CHSC device, PGCF acts as both a current collector and cathode material due to its high specific surface area and superior conductivity. The use of a highly concentrated LiCl&#8722;CrCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte with high Cr plating/stripping efficiency and excellent antifreeze properties enables the entire PGCF-based CHSC to achieve well-balanced performance in terms of energy density (up to 1.47&#8197;mWh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), power characteristics (reaching 9.95&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and durability (95.4&#8201;% capacity retention after 30,000&#8197;cycles), while realizing it to work well under harsh conditions of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Anisotropic Dual S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions Mimic Natural Photosynthetic System for Boosting Photoelectric Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an innovative biomimetic artificial photosynthetic system for the first time. The anisotropic migration of BiOBr carriers demonstrates exceptional charge pre&#8208;separation properties, effectively mimicking the role of electron transport chain observed in natural photosynthesis. The incorporation of a stepped dual S&#8208;Scheme band structure ensures the optimal simulation of the photosystem (PSII/PSI).







Abstract
The design of heterojunctions that mimic natural photosynthetic systems holds great promise for enhancing photoelectric response. However, the limited interfacial space charge layer (SCL) often fails to provide sufficient driving force for the directional migration of inner charge carriers. Drawing inspiration from the electron transport chain (ETC) in natural photosynthesis system, we developed a novel anisotropic dual S&#8208;scheme heterojunction artificial photosynthetic system composed of Bi2O3&#8722;BiOBr&#8722;AgI for the first time, with Bi2O3 and AgI selectively distributed along the bicrystal facets of BiOBr. Compared to traditional semiconductors, the anisotropic carrier migration in BiOBr overcomes the recombination resulting from thermodynamic diffusion, thereby establishing a potential ETC for the directional migration of inner charge carriers. Importantly, this pioneering bioinspired design overcomes the limitations imposed by the limited distribution of SCL in heterojunctions, resulting in a remarkable 55&#8208;fold enhancement in photoelectric performance. Leveraging the etching of thiols on Ag&#8208;based materials, this dual S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is further employed in the construction of photoelectrochemical sensors for the detection of acetylcholinesterase and organophosphorus pesticides.

         <title>Accelerating Anhydrous Proton Transport in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Pore Chemistry and its Impacts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of trigonal, tetragonal, hexagonal, and Kagome topologies was explored to design porous frameworks, which led to the creation of 1D nanochannels of different shapes and sizes. The pore shape and size play a vital role in developing proton carrier networks and determines proton conduction functions, unveiling a full picture of pore chemistry and offering a general yet transformative guidance for designing porous framework materials.







Abstract
Proton conduction is important in both fundamental research and technological development. Here we report designed synthesis of crystalline porous covalent organic frameworks as a new platform for high&#8208;rate anhydrous proton conduction. By developing nanochannels with different topologies as proton pathways and loading neat phosphoric acid to construct robust proton carrier networks in the pores, we found that pore topology is crucial for proton conduction. Its effect on increasing proton conductivity is in an exponential mode other than linear fashion, endowing the materials with exceptional proton conductivities exceeding 10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 over a broad range of temperature and a low activation energy barrier down to 0.24&#8197;eV. Remarkably, the pore size controls conduction mechanism, where mesopores promote proton conduction via a fast&#8208;hopping mechanism, while micropores follow a sluggish vehicle process. Notably, decreasing phosphoric acid loading content drastically reduces proton conductivity and greatly increases activation energy barrier, emphasizing the pivotal role of well&#8208;developed proton carrier network in proton transport. These findings and insights unveil a new general and transformative guidance for designing porous framework materials and systems for high&#8208;rate ion conduction, energy storage, and energy conversion.

Strong magnetic interactions with the magnetic parameter J=&#8722;37.9&#8197;cm&#8722;1, despite the long distance of 13&#8197;&#197; between the Ni(+2) atoms, was realized in heterometallic one&#8208;dimensional chain aligned as &#8722;Rh&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pt&#8722;Ni&#8722;Pt&#8722;. This magnitude was not realized with other molecules, clearly demonstrating the utility of bridging metal&#8211;metal bonds.







Abstract
A heterometallic and paramagnetic one&#8208;dimensional aligned chain in &#8722;Rh(+2)&#8722;Rh(+2)&#8722; Pt(+2)&#8722;Ni(+2)&#8722;Pt(+2)&#8722; with direct metal&#8722;metal bonds was obtained via HOMO&#8211;LUMO interactions at the &#963;* (dz2) orbital between [Rh2(O2CCH3)4] and [Pt2Ni(piam)4(NH3)4] (piam=pivalamidate). The one&#8208;dimensional chains had straight backbones attributed to face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking of each complex, and the Ni atoms were separated by approximately 13&#8197;&#197; from four different metals. Each Ni atom had two unpaired electrons in the d&#8208;orbitals, which strongly exchanged with J=&#8722;37.9&#8197;cm&#8722;1 through the diamagnetic &#8722;Pt&#8722;Rh&#8722;Rh&#8722;Pt&#8722; bonds.

         <title>Unraveling the Origin of Multichannel Circularly Polarized Luminescence in a Pyrene&#8208;Functionalized Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;resolved circularly polarized luminescence (TRCPL) spectroscopy combined with transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy has been used to elucidate the origins of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emission in pyrene&#8208;functionalized topologically chiral [2]catenane. This approach enabled elucidation of the chiroptical signals originating from either the topological or Euclidean chirality in these chiral molecules.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) are promising platforms for developing functionalized artificial molecular machines. The construction of chiral MIMs with appealing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties has boosted their potential application in biomedicine and the optical industry. However, there is currently little knowledge about the CPL emission mechanism or the emission dynamics of these related MIMs. Herein, we demonstrate that time&#8208;resolved circularly polarized luminescence (TRCPL) spectroscopy combined with transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy offers a feasible approach to elucidate the origins of CPL emission in pyrene&#8208;functionalized topologically chiral [2]catenane as well as in a series of pyrene&#8208;functionalized chiral molecules. For the first time, direct evidence differentiating the chiroptical signals originating from either topological (local state emission) or Euclidean chirality (excimer state emission) in these pyrene&#8208;functionalized chiral molecules has been discovered. Our work not only establishes a novel and ideal approach to study CPL mechanism, but also provides a theoretical foundation for the rational design of novel chiral materials in the future.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Like Diffusion of Fast Ions in Framework Energy Materials for Li&#8208; and Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assisted by density functional theory calculations, we found in this study that the origin of the ultra&#8208;low migration energy barrier of intercalated ions in framework energy materials (e.g. Prussian blue analogs) is a unique surface&#8208;like diffusion mechanism. The mobile ion will move along the channel wall via a low coordination number and low migration barrier experiencing minimal steric hindrance similar to surface diffusion.







Abstract
The rate performance, power density, and energy efficiency of electrochemical devices are often limited by ionic conductivities in electrolyte and electrode materials. Framework Prussian blue analogs and dense niobium oxides have been identified as high&#8208;rate electrodes for sodium&#8208; and lithium&#8208;ion batteries, respectively, yet the origin of the extremely high solid&#8208;state Na+/Li+ transport is not fully understood. Of critical importance is the fact that their ultra&#8208;low activation energy and anomalous pre&#8208;exponent factor cannot be satisfactorily rationalized from conventional theory of solid&#8208;state diffusion in the crystal lattice. Here, assisted by density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations, we argued that the true origin is a unique surface&#8208;like diffusion mechanism of the intercalation ions. In a surface&#8208;like migration event, a mobile ion moves along the channel wall via a low coordination number and low migration barrier experiencing minimal steric hindrance. It is similar to surface diffusion in the conventional picture and contrasts with lattice diffusion from one interstitial/vacancy site to another one with high coordination number, crowded saddle&#8208;point geometry and high migration barrier. We found that the shifting from solid&#8208;state lattice diffusion to surface&#8208;like diffusion is determined by the size difference between the mobile ion and the diffusion channel, and a lowest migration energy barrier can be reached by mediating the channel size. The analogy to gas diffusion in molecular sieves shall be discussed. Additionally, the effects of defects and crystal water in Prussian blue analogs were also discussed for better understanding their rate performances in experimental scenarios.

&lt;p&gt;The rate performance, power density, and energy efficiency of electrochemical devices are often limited by ionic conductivities in electrolyte and electrode materials. Framework Prussian blue analogs and dense niobium oxides have been identified as high-rate electrodes for sodium- and lithium-ion batteries, respectively, yet the origin of the extremely high solid-state Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport is not fully understood. Of critical importance is the fact that their ultra-low activation energy and anomalous pre-exponent factor cannot be satisfactorily rationalized from conventional theory of solid-state diffusion in the crystal lattice. Here, assisted by density-functional-theory calculations, we argued that the true origin is a unique surface-like diffusion mechanism of the intercalation ions. In a surface-like migration event, a mobile ion moves along the channel wall via a low coordination number and low migration barrier experiencing minimal steric hindrance. It is similar to surface diffusion in the conventional picture and contrasts with lattice diffusion from one interstitial/vacancy site to another one with high coordination number, crowded saddle-point geometry and high migration barrier.

         <title>Near&#8208;Full&#8208;Spectrum Emission Realized in a Single Lead Halide Perovskite across the Visible&#8208;Light Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The engineering of tunable photoluminescence (PL) in single materials with a full&#8208;spectrum emission represents a highly coveted objective but poses a formidable challenge. In this context, the realization of near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum PL emission, spanning the visible light range from 424 to 620 nm, in a single&#8208;component two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskite, (ETA)2PbBr4 (ETA+ = (HO)(CH2)2NH3+), is reported, achieved through high&#8208;pressure treatment. A pressure&#8208;induced phase transition occurs upon compression, transforming the crystal structure from an orthorhombic phase under ambient conditions to a monoclinic structure at high pressure. This phase transition driven by the adaptive and dynamic configuration changes of organic amine cations enables an effective and continuous narrowing of the bandgap in this halide crystal. The hydrogen bonding interactions between inorganic layers and organic amine cations (N&#8208;H&#8230;Br and O&#8208;H&#8230;Br hydrogen bonds) efficiently modulate the organic amine cations penetration and the octahedral distortion. Consequently, this phenomenon induces a phase transition and results in red&#8208;shifted PL emissions, leading to the near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum emission. This work opens a possibility for achieving wide PL emissions with coverage across the visible light spectrum by employing high pressure in single halide perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>A chemo&#8208;selective enrichment strategy to achieve in&#8208;depth coverage of methyllysine proteome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteomics is a powerful method to comprehensively understand cellular posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Due to low abundance, tryptic peptides with PTMs are usually enriched for enhanced coverage by LC&#8208;MS/MS. Affinity chromatography for phosphoproteomes by metal&#8208;oxide and pan&#8208;specific antibodies for lysine acetylome allow identification of tens of thousands of modification sites. Lysine methylation is a significant PTM, however, only hundreds of methylation sites were identified from available approaches. Here we report an aryl diazonium&#8208;based chemoselective strategy that enables enrichment of monomethyllysine (Kme1) peptides via covalent bond with extraordinary sensitivity. We identified more than ten thousand Kme1 peptides from diverse cell lines and mouse tissues, that implied wide lysine methylation impact on cellular processes. In addition, we found a significant amount of methyl marks that were not S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent by isotope labeling experiments. And therefore, this method paves a way to broad application in lysine methylation research and new biology discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Kinetics of Anionic Redox in O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 through Controlled P2 Intergrowth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anionic redox chemistry can surpass theoretical limits of conventional layered oxide cathodes in energy density. A recent model system of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2, demonstrated full anionic redox capacity but is limited in reversibility and kinetics due to irreversible structural rearrangement and oxygen loss. Solutions to these issues are missing due to the challenging synthesis. Here, we harness the unique structural richness of sodium layered oxides and realize a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in this model compound with the overall composition maintained. The resulted O3 with 27% P2 intergrowth structure delivers an excellent initial Coulombic efficiency of 87%, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;rich NMCs. This improvement is attributed to the effective suppression of irreversible oxygen release and structural changes, evidenced by operando Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray Diffraction. The as&#8208;prepared intergrowth material, based on the environmentally benign Mn, exhibits a reversible capacity of 226 mAh g&#8722;1 at C/20 rate with excellent cycling stability stemming from the redox reactions of oxygen and manganese. Our work isolates the role of P2 structural intergrowth and thereby introduces a novel strategy to enhance the reversibility and kinetics of anionic redox reactions in sodium layered cathodes without compromising capacity.</dc:description>

         <title>Dyotropic Rearrangement of an Iron&#8211;Aluminium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligand exchange processes at metal complexes underpin their reactivity and catalytic applications. While mechanisms of ligand exchange at single site complexes are well established, occurring through textbook associative, dissociative and interchange mechanisms, those involving heterometallic complexes are less well developed. Here we report the reactions of a well&#8208;defined Fe&#8211;Al hydride complex with exogeneous ligands (CO and CNR, R = Me, tBu, Xyl = 2,6&#8208;Me2C6H3). Based on DFT calculations we suggest that these reactions occur through a dyotropic rearrangement, this involves initial coordination of the exogenous ligand at Al followed by migration to Fe, with simultaneous migration of a hydride ligand from Fe to Al. Such processes are rare for heterometallic complexes. We study the bonding and mechanism of the dyotropic rearrangement through in&#8208;depth computational analysis (NBO, IBOs, CLMO analysis, QTAIM, NCIplot, IMGH), shedding new light on how the electronic structure of the heterometallic core responds to the migration of ligands between metal sites. The dyotropic rearrangement fundamentally changes the nature of the hydride ligands, exposing new nucleophilic reactivity as evidenced by insertion reactions with CO2, isocyanates, as well as isocyanides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The imidophosphorane ligand, [NPtBu3]&#8211; (tBu = tert&#8208;butyl), enables isolation of a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral, tetravalent praseodymium complex, [Pr4+(NPtBu3)4] (1&#8208;Pr), which is characterized by a suite of physical characterization methods including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance, and L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray near&#8208;edge spectroscopies. Variable&#8208;temperature direct&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility data, supported by multiconfigurational quantum chemical calculations, demonstrate that the electronic structure diverges from the isoelectronic Ce3+ analogue, driven by increased crystal field. The four&#8208;coordinate environment around Pr4+ in 1&#8208;Pr, which is unparalleled in reported extended solid systems, provides a unique opportunity to study the interplay between crystal field splitting and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in a molecular tetravalent lanthanide within a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination geometry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A process for the catalytic reduction of nitrous oxide using NHC&#8208;ligated copper(I) tert&#8208;butoxide precatalysts and B2pin2 as the reductant is reported. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions via copper(I)&#8208;boryl intermediates which react with N2O by facile O&#8208;atom insertion into the Cu&#8211;B bond and liberate N2. Turnover numbers &gt; 800 can be achieved at 80 &#176;C under 1 bar N2O.</dc:description>

         <title>Outstanding Superoxide Dismutase Catalytic Activity Of Simple Peptide&#8208;Based Nickel(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present here the most active synthetic Ni superoxide dismutase (NiSOD) mimic reported to date. Reactive oxygen species are aggressive compounds, which concentrations are tightly regulated in vivo. Among them, the superoxide anion, O2&#11825;&#8208;, is controlled by superoxide dismutases. Capitalizing on the versatility of the Amino&#8208;Terminal CuII&#8208; and NiII&#8208;binding (ATCUN) peptide motif, we introduced positive charges around the NiII center to favor the interaction with the superoxide radical anion. At physiological pH, the pentapeptide H&#8208;Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Cys&#8208;Arg&#8208;Arg&#8208;NH2 coordinates NiII after the deprotonation of one thiol, two amides, and either the second thiol or the N&#8208;terminal ammonium, leading to an equilibrium between the two N3S1 and N2S2 coordination modes. Under catalytic conditions, a kcat value of 8.6(4) x 106 L.mol&#8208;1.s&#8208;1 was measured. Within the first second, the catalyst remained undegraded with quantitative consumption of O2&#11825;&#8208; (completed up to 37 catalytic cycles). An extra arginine (Arg) was introduced at the peptide C&#8208;terminus to increase the global charge of the NiII complex from +1 to + 2. This had no effect on the catalytic performance, highlighting the critical role of charge distribution in space as a determining factor influencing the reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Cu(II)&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylative Thianthrenation of Aryl and Heteroaryl Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given that (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids are inexpensive materials available in a great variety from commercial and natural resources or synthesis, the strategies enabling their use as starting materials for preparing fine chemicals are highly sought after. Here we report a photoinduced Cu(II)&#8208;mediated protocol converting (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into (hetero)aryl thianthrenium salts, high value&#8208;added building blocks that can undergo various subsequent transformations, creating an attractive two&#8208;step pathway for the divergent functionalization of these ubiquitous starting materials. The excellent compatibility of the method is shown by preparing a broad range of sterically and electronically varied (hetero)aryl thianthrenium salts, including derivatives of pharmaceuticals, such as ataluren, celecoxib, flavoxate, probenecid, repaglinide, and tamibarotene. The syntheses of 13C&#8208;labeled probenecid and bioisosteres of ataluren as well as the unconventional modifications of celecoxib and flavoxate, illustrate the synthetic potential of the strategy. Mechanistic studies are in line with a reaction occurring through a photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) of Cu(II)&#8208;arylcarboxylates, enabling radical decarboxylative carbometallation to form arylcopper(II) intermediates that in turn react with thianthrene to form the product. Noteworthy, the susceptibility of aryl thianthrenium salts to photodegradation is overcome by a Cu(I)&#8208;driven salvage loop, which continuously intercepts the transiently formed radicals and regenerates the products.</dc:description>

         <title>Benign and Selective Amination of Lignins towards Aromatic Biobased Building Blocks with Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lignin is a widely available second&#8208;generation biopolymer and the main potential source of renewable aromatic building blocks. Lignin&#8208;based polyamines offer great potential in applications based on chemical and materials sciences. However, common aminations techniques for lignin usually involve toxic chemicals and generate hindered and low reactivity amines.
In this study, we developed two new, simple, and benign 2&#8208;step methodologies for the elaboration of lignin&#8208;based polyamines from different technical lignins (kraft, soda and organosolv) with a selectivity towards reactive primary amines. These methods involve grafting amide groups onto lignin followed by a hydrolysis step. Non&#8208;toxic heterocyclic compounds N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinone and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline were used as amidation agents. Hydrolysis was performed in acetone&#8208;water mixtures. Reactions were studied on model compounds and optimized on lignins. Aminated lignins were fully characterized and primary amines were quantified using quantitative 19F NMR.
Our methods generated aminated lignins with low apparent molar masses and high solubility in water and solvents. Nitrogen contents of the products ranged between 2.0 and 3.5 mmol/g with reactive primary amines counts up to 1.7 mmol/g. These soluble and reactive lignin&#8208;based polyamines offer great potential as a replacement for fossil&#8208;based polyamines in e.g., the synthesis of aromatic polymer materials or as potential chelating, antibacterial agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Se&#8208;dopant Modulated Selective Co&#8208;Insertion of H+ and Zn2+ in MnO2 for High&#8208;Capacity and Durable Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MnO2 is commonly used as the cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). The strong Coulombic interaction between Zn ions and the MnO2 lattice causes significant lattice distortion and, combined with the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect, results in Mn2+ dissolution and structural collapse. While proton intercalation can reduce lattice distortion, it changes the electrolyte pH, producing chemically inert byproducts. These issues greatly affect the reversibility of Zn2+ intercalation/extraction, leading to significant capacity degradation of MnO2. Herein, we propose a novel method to enhance the cycling stability of &#948;&#8208;MnO2 through selenium doping (Se&#8208;MnO2). Our work indicates that varying the selenium doping content can regulate the intercalation ratio of H+ in MnO2, thereby suppressing the formation of ZnMn2O4 by&#8208;products. Se doping mitigates the lattice strain of MnO2 during Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation by reducing Mn&#8208;O octahedral distortion, modifying Mn&#8208;O bond length upon Zn2+ insertion, and alleviating Mn dissolution caused by the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. The optimized Se&#8208;MnO2 (Se concentration of 0.8 at.%) deposited on carbon nanotube demonstrates a notable capacity of 386 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1, with exceptional long&#8208;term cycle stability, retaining 102 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity after 5000 cycles at 3.0 A g&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Production of 2D Non&#8208;Layered Metal Oxides through Metal&#8211;Organic Gel Rapid Redox Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nonlayered metal compounds with porous structure show broad application prospects in electrochemistry&#8208;related fields due to their abundant active sites, open ions/electrons diffusion channels, and faradaic reactions. However, scalable and universal synthesis of 2D porous compounds still remains challenging. Here, inspired by blowing gum, a metal&#8208;organic gel (MOG) rapid redox transformation (MRRT) strategy is proposed for the mass production of a wide variety of 2D porous metal oxides. Adequate crosslinking degree of MOG precursor and its rapid redox with NO3&#8208; are critical for generating gas pressure from interior to exterior, thus blowing the MOG into 2D carbon nanosheets, which further act as self&#8208;sacrifice template for formation of oxides with porous and ultrathin structure. The versatility of this strategy is demonstrated by the fabrication of 39 metal oxides, including 10 transition metal oxides, one II&#8208;main group oxide, two III&#8208;main group oxides, 22 perovskite oxides, four high&#8208;entropy oxides. As an illustrative verification, the 2D transition metal oxides exhibit excellent capacitive deionization (CDI) performance. Moreover, the assembled CDI cell could act as desalting battery to supply electrical energy during electrode regeneration. This MRRT strategy offers opportunities for achieving universal synthesis of 2D porous oxides with nonlayered structures and studying their electrochemistry&#8208;related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Shear&#8208;strained Pd Single&#8208;atom Electrocatalysts for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical nitrate reduction method (NitRR) is a low&#8208;carbon, environmentally friendly, and efficient method for synthesizing ammonia, which has received widespread attention in recent years. Copper&#8208;based catalysts have a leading edge in nitrate reduction due to their good adsorption of *NO3. However, the formation of active hydrogen (*H) on Cu surfaces is difficult and insufficient, resulting in a large amount of the by&#8208;product NO2&#8208;. In this work, Pd single atoms suspended on the interlayer unsaturated bonds of CuO atoms formed due to dislocations (Pd&#8208;CuO) were prepared by low temperature treatment, and the Pd single atoms located on the dislocations were subjected to shear stress and the dynamic effect of support formation to promote the conversion of nitrate into ammonia. The catalysis had an ammonia yield&#160;of 4.2 mol.gcat&#8208;1. h&#8208;1, and a Faraday efficiency of 90% for ammonia production at &#8722;0.5 V vs. RHE. Electrochemical in&#8208;situ characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the dynamic effects of Pd single atoms and carriers under shear stress obviously promote the production of active hydrogen, reduce the reaction energy barrier of the decision&#8208;making step for nitrate conversion to ammonia, further promote ammonia generation.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Responsive Formation Cycling Enabling LiF&#8208;Rich Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase is highly desirable for wide&#8208;temperature battery, but its application is hindered by the unwanted side reactions associated with conventional method of introducing fluorinated additives. Here, we developed an additive&#8208;free strategy to produce LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) by low&#8208;temperature formation cycling. Using LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 as a model cathode, the atomic ratio of LiF in the CEI formed at &#8208;5 &#176;C is about 17.7%, enhanced by ~550% compared to CEI formed at 25 &#176;C (2.7%). The underlying mechanism is uncovered by both experiments and theoretic simulation, indicating that the decomposition of LiPF6 to LiF is transformed into spontaneous and exothermic on positively charged cathode surface and lowering the temperature shift chemical equilibrium towards the formation of LiF&#8208;rich CEI. Superior to conventional fluorinated additives, this approach is free from unwanted side reactions, imparting batteries with both high&#8208;temperature (60 oC) cyclability and low&#8208;temperature rate performance (capacity enhanced by 100% at 3 C at &#8208;20 oC). This low&#8208;temperature formation cycling to construct LiF&#8208;rich CEI is extended to various cathode systems, such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2, LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, demonstrating the versatility and potential impact of our strategy in advancing the performance and stability of wide&#8208;temperature batteries and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Basis of Cucurbituril&#8208;Containing Self&#8208;Assembled Supramolecular Chiral Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexation offers an intriguing protocol in producing chiroptical materials, while the bulky size and dynamic exchange between hosts and guests hinders the ordered aggregation to afford the long&#8208;range chiral arrangement. It remains great challenges in assembling cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s) included complexes to induce supramolecular chirality ascribed to the excellent water solubility and flexible packing. Herein, we unveiled the structural basis on the formation of chiroptical coassemblies from CB[n] (n = 6, 7) complexes. Perylene diimides (PDIs) with cationic chiral pendants formed complexes in the aqueous media, which selectively showed chiroptical properties. Chlorination at the bay position, increasing alkyl length of cationic chiral pendants or reducing the number of polyaromatic rings would hinder the chiral aggregation. In a comprehensive manner, CB[6] favors ordered aggregation into one&#8208;dimensional fibrous nanoarchitectures that greatly facilitates the supramolecular chirality. In contrast, CB[7] with larger cavity and water solubility shrinks the ordered arrangement of complexes, reducing the formation possibility of supramolecular chiral nanoarchitectures. This work suggests the great potential of CB[6] in the preparation and manipulation of supramolecular chiral assemblies, shedding light on the macrocycle&#8208;based functional chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Unbiased photoelectrochemical H2O2 coupled to H2 production via dual Sb2S3&#8208;based photoelectrodes with ultralow onset potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The productions of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydrogen (H2) in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting cell suffer from an onset potential that limits solar conversion efficiencies. The formation of H2O2 through two&#8208;electron PEC water oxidation reaction competes with four&#8208;electron oxidation evolution reaction. Herein, we developed the surface selenium doped antimony trisulfide photoelectrode with the integrated ruthenium cocatalyst (Ru/Sb2(S,Se)3) to achieve the low onset potential and high Faraday efficiency (FE) for selective H2O2 production. The photoanode exhibits an average FE of 85% in the potential range of 0.4&#8208;1.6 VRHE and the H2O2 yield of 1.01 &#956;mol cm&#8208;2 min&#8208;1 at 1.6 VRHE, especially at low potentials of 0.1&#8208;0.55 VRHE with 80.4% FE. Impressively, an unassisted PEC system that employs light and electrolyte was constructed to simultaneously produce H2O2 and H2 production on both&#160;Ru/Sb2(S,Se)3&#160;photoanode and the Pt/TiO2/Sb2S3&#160;photocathode. The integrated system enables the average PEC H2O2 production rate of 0.637 &#956;mol cm&#8208;2 min&#8208;1 without applying any addition bias. This is the first demonstration that Sb2S3&#8208;based photoelectrodes exhibit H2O2/H2 two&#8208;side production with a strict key factor of the system, which represents its powerful platform to achieve high efficiency and productivity and the feasibility to facilitate value&#8208;added products in neutral conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Merged Molecular Switches Excel as Optoacoustic Dyes: Azobenzene&#8211;Cyanines Are Loud and Photostable NIR Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic dyes used in photoacoustic imaging are often photobleachable and hard to quantify as they respond nonlinearly to excitation intensity. However, a systematic method that uses molecular switches to shorten their nonradiative decay times to 4&#8197;ps converts them into reliably quantifiable linear absorbers that are up to &gt;1000&#8208;fold more photostable and several times better signal generators in photoacoustic imaging.







Abstract
Optoacoustic (or photoacoustic) imaging promises micron&#8208;resolution noninvasive bioimaging with much deeper penetration (&gt;cm) than fluorescence. However, optoacoustic imaging of enzyme activity would require loud, photostable, NIR&#8208;absorbing molecular contrast agents, which remain unknown. Most organic molecular contrast agents are repurposed fluorophores, with severe shortcomings of photoinstability or phototoxicity under optoacoustic imaging, as consequences of their slow S1&#8594;S0 electronic relaxation. We now report that known fluorophores can be rationally modified to reach ultrafast S1&#8594;S0 rates, without much extra molecular complexity, simply by merging them with molecular switches. Here, we merge azobenzene switches with cyanine dyes to give ultrafast relaxation (&lt;10&#8197;ps, &gt;100&#8208;fold faster). Without even adapting instrument settings, these azohemicyanines display outstanding improvements in signal longevity (&gt;1000&#8208;fold increase of photostability) and signal loudness (&gt;3&#8208;fold even at time zero). We show why this simple but unexplored design strategy can still offer stronger performance in the future, and can also increase the spatial resolution and the quantitative linearity of photoacoustic response over extended longitudinal imaging. By bringing the world of molecular switches and rotors to bear on problems facing optoacoustic agents, this practical strategy will help to unleash the full potential of optoacoustic imaging in fundamental studies and translational uses.

         <title>Construction of Benzoxazine&#8208;linked One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks Using the Mannich Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two crystalline 1D benzoxazine&#8208;linked covalent organic polymers have been successfully synthesized in a one&#8208;pot Mannich reaction. The validity of their crystal structures has been directly visualized through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cryogenic low&#8208;dose electron microscopy techniques.







Abstract
Covalent polymerization of organic molecules into crystalline one&#8208;dimensional (1D) polymers is effective for achieving desired thermal, optical, and electrical properties, yet it remains a persistent synthetic challenge for their inherent tendency to adopt amorphous or semicrystalline phases. Here we report a strategy to synthesize crystalline 1D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) composing quasi&#8208;conjugated chains with benzoxazine linkages via the one&#8208;pot Mannich reaction. Through [4+2] and [2+2] type Mannich condensation reactions, we fabricated stoichiometric and sub&#8208;stoichiometric 1D covalent polymeric chains, respectively, using doubly and singly linked benzoxazine rings. The validity of their crystal structures has been directly visualized through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cryogenic low&#8208;dose electron microscopy techniques. Post&#8208;synthetic functionalizations of them with a chiral MacMillan catalyst produce crystalline organic photocatalysts that demonstrated excellent catalytic and recyclable performance in light&#8208;driven asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes, affording up to 94&#8201;% enantiomeric excess

         <title>Ir(triNHC)&#8208;Catalyzed Upcycling of Waste PET for Lactic Acid Production with Sustainable Isolation via Bipolar Membrane Electrodialysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ground&#8208;breaking method upcycles various waste PET plastics (colorless, colored, and fabric&#8208;containing) into valuable lactic acid via Ir(triNHC)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling with methanol and sustainable BMED separation, offering a dual environmental benefit by transforming waste into a useful chemical and eliminating non&#8208;sustainable isolating processes.







Abstract
For the upcycling of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET), encompassing both colored and fabric PET materials, we investigated the Ir(triNHC)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative coupling of PET and methanol, leading to the production of sodium lactate with good yields. We proposed a sustainable method for isolating lactic acid from the catalytic reaction mixture of sodium lactate and regenerating the base using bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED). This isolation method demonstrated high effectiveness, achieving isolation of lactic acid while maintaining economic feasibility at $&#8201;0.10&#8197;per&#8197;kg of lactic acid, and enabling sustainable NaOH regeneration with complete resource circulation. We assessed the recyclability of the catalyst and elucidated the mechanism involving base&#8208;mediated depolymerization and catalyst&#8208;promoted dehydrogenation, highlighting the importance of triNHC ligands in enhancing catalytic activity.

         <title>Rigid Phase Formation and Sb3+ Doping of Tin (IV) Halide Hybrids toward Photoluminescence Enhancement and Tuning for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATPP2SnCl6&#8201;:&#8201;Sb3+ (ATPP=acetonyltriphenylphosphonium) was derived from the rational construction of emissive organic reagent of ATPPCl and Sn4+ to form rigid structure, and the subsequent doping of Sb3+. Multi&#8208;excitonic emissions with one from organic cation and the other from the extrinsic self&#8208;trapped excitons were investitated, and the tunable photoluminescence could be realized by varing the excitaton wavelengths. Leveraging the multi&#8208;excitonic centers for the doped samples, information encryption and decryption could be achieved, showing the potential anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;excitonic emitting materials in luminescent metal halides are emerging candidates for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption applications. Herein, ATPP2SnCl6 (ATPP=acetonyltriphenylphosphonium) phase was designed and synthesized by rationally choosing emissive organic reagent of ATPPCl and non&#8208;toxic stable metal ions of Sn4+, and Sb3+ was further doped into ATPP2SnCl6 to tune the photoluminescence with external self&#8208;trapped excitons emission. The derived non&#8208;toxic ATPP2SnCl6 shows multi&#8208;excitonic luminescent centers verified by optical study and differential charge&#8208;density from density functional theory calculations. Incorporation of Sb3+ dopants and the increasing concentrations induce the efficient energy transfer therein, thus enhancing photoluminescence quantum yield from 5.1&#8201;% to 73.8&#8201;%. The multi&#8208;excitonic emission inspires the creation of information encryption and decryption by leveraging the photoluminescence from ATPPCl to ATPP2SnCl6 host and ATPP2SnCl6&#8201;:&#8201;Sb3+. This study facilitates the anti&#8208;counterfeiting application by employing solution&#8208;processable luminescent metal halides materials with excitation&#8208;dependent PL properties.

         <title>Chiral Teropyrenes: Synthesis, Structure, and Spectroscopic Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a chiral teropyrene was achieved through a four&#8208;fold alkyne benzannulation, leveraging InCl3 catalysis. This compound exhibits both circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, underscoring its significance in advancing chiral optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
We present the inaugural synthesis of a chiral teropyrene achieved through a four&#8208;fold alkyne benzannulation catalyzed by InCl3, resulting in good yields. The product underwent thorough characterization using FT&#8208;Raman and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopies, demonstrating a close agreement with calculated spectra. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis unveiled a notable twist in the molecule&#8216;s backbone, with an end&#8208;to&#8208;end twist angle of 51&#176;, consistent with computational predictions. Experimentally determined enantiomeric inversion barriers revealed a significant energy barrier of 23&#8197;kcal/mol, facilitating the isolation of enantiomers for analysis by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopies. These findings mark significant strides in the synthesis and characterization of chiral teropyrenes, offering insights into their structural and spectroscopic properties.

         <title>Transpiration&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Growth of Texture Hydrogel Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PIC hydrogels contained isolated liquid&#8208;filled voids. Like trees, transpiration would induce voids reversibly collapse to generate negative pressures within the matrices to extract polymerizable compounds from external sources for growing. The hydrogel mimics the function of trees, which can grow user&#8208;defined complex structures on surfaces from different external sources.







Abstract
Trees grow by coupling the transpiration&#8208;induced nutrient absorption from external sources and photosynthesis&#8208;based nutrient integration. Inspired by this manner, we designed a class of polyion complex (PIC) hydrogels containing isolated liquid&#8208;filled voids for growing texture surfaces. The isolated liquid&#8208;filled voids were created via irreversible matrix reconfiguration in a deswelling&#8208;swelling process. During transpiration, these voids reversibly collapse to generate negative pressures within the matrices to extract polymerizable compounds from external sources and deliver them to the surface of the samples for photopolymerization. This growth process is spatial&#8208;controllable and can be applied to fabricate complex patterns consisting of different compositions, suggesting a new strategy for making texture surfaces.

         <title>Fused Aromatic and Antiaromatic Smaragdyrin Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singly linked and fused dimers were synthesized for aromatic [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex and antiaromatic [20]smaragdyrin free base. The fused dimers show larger electronic interactions but the respective antiaromatic and aromatic characters are well preserved.







Abstract
Singly&#8208;linked aromatic [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex dimer was synthesized by the reductive coupling of 16&#8208;brominated [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex, which was oxidized to a stable diradical with PbO2. As the first example of fused smaragdyrin dimer, a fused [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex dimer was synthesized by the oxidation of a CuCl&#8208;BF2 complex dimer with FeCl3 and subsequent reduction with NaBH4. After removal of the BF2 group, the singly&#8208;linked and fused aromatic dimers were oxidized to the corresponding antiaromatic [20]smaragdyrin free base dimers. The first oxidation and reduction potentials of these dimers are split depending upon the intramolecular electronic interactions, which are larger for the fused dimers. Despite the large electronic interactions, the aromatic and antiaromatic characters are well preserved in the fused dimers.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Azo Cathodes Enabled by N&#8208;Heteroatomic Substitution for Zinc Batteries with a Self&#8208;Charging Capability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroatomic substitution strategy is used to optimize the chemical and electronic properties of azo compounds. The developed 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine cathode exhibits significantly improved operating voltage, thermal stability, and reaction kinetics. Remarkably, the depleted batteries exhibit a distinctive self&#8208;charging feature upon air exposure.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active azo compounds are emerging as promising cathode materials due to their multi&#8208;electron redox capacity and fast redox response. However, their practical application is often limited by low output voltage and poor thermal stability. Herein, we use a heteroatomic substitution strategy to develop 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine. This modification results in a 350&#8197;mV increase in reduction potential compared to traditional azobenzene, increasing the energy density at the material level from 187 to 291&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. The introduced heteroatoms not only raise the melting point of azo compounds from 68&#8201;&#176;C to 112&#8201;&#176;C by forming an intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond network but also improves electrode kinetics by reducing energy band gaps. Moreover, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azopyridine forms metal&#8208;ligand complexes with Zn2+ ions, which further self&#8208;assemble into a robust superstructure, acting as a molecular conductor to facilitate charge transfer. Consequently, the batteries display a good rate performance (192&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;C) and an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 60,000&#8197;cycles. Notably, we disclose that the depleted batteries spontaneously self&#8208;charge when exposed to air, marking a significant advancement in the development of self&#8208;powered aqueous systems.

         <title>An Organic Molecular Mimetic Metal&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Catalyst for Electrocatalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct construction of metal&#8208;free catalysts on conductive substrates for electrocatalytic organic hydrogenation reactions is significant but still unexplored. Here, learning from the homogeneous molecular catalysts, an organic molecular mimetic metal&#8208;free heterogeneous catalyst is designed and constructed in situ on a graphite flake electrode via a mild electrochemical oxidation&#8210;reduction relay strategy. The as&#8208;prepared &#8211;COOH&#8208; and &#8211;OH&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;free catalyst exhibits an electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation performance with a 72% Faradaic efficiency, 99% selectivity and 96% yield of the alkene product, which is comparable to that of noble metal catalysts. The removal of these oxygen&#8208;containing groups leads to negligible activity. The experimental and calculation results reveal that the origin of the high activity can be assigned to the &#8211;COOH and &#8211;OH groups on graphite. A flow electrolytic cell delivers ten grams of hydrogenated products with 81% Faradaic efficiency. This metal&#8208;free catalyst is also suitable for gas&#8208;phase acetylene semihydrogenation and other electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Editing of Pyrroles to Benzenes/Naphthalenes by N2O Deletion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular editing promises to facilitate the rapid diversification of complex molecular architectures by rapidly and conveniently altering core frameworks. This approach has the potential to accelerate both drug discovery and total synthesis. In this study, we present a novel protocol for the molecular editing of pyrroles. Initially,&#160;N&#8208;Boc pyrroles and alkynes are converted into&#160;N&#8208;bridged compounds through a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. These compounds then undergo deprotection of the Boc group, nitrosylation, and cheletropic N2O extrusion to yield benzene or naphthalene products. By using benzyne as a substrate, this method can be conceptually viewed as a fusion of skeletal editing of the pyrrole ring and site&#8208;selective peripheral editing of the benzene ring. Furthermore, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept protocol has demonstrated its potential to transform the (hetero)arene motif from commercially available drugs, offering the possibility of generating new biologically active compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Cuprous&#8208;Based Metal Halides with Unique Two&#8208;Dimensional Crystal Structure for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ternary cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halides,&#160;represented by&#160;cesium copper iodide (e.g., CsCu2I3&#160;and Cs3Cu2I5),&#160;are garnering increasing interest for light&#8208;emitting applications owing to their intrinsically high photoluminescence quantum yield and direct bandgap. Toward electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), it is highly desirable for the light emitters to have a high structural dimensionality as it may favor efficient electrical injection. However, unlike lead&#8208;based halide perovskites whose light&#8208;emitting units can be facilely arranged in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ways, to date, nearly all&#160;ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides crystallize into 0D or 1D networks of Cu&#8208;X (X =&#160;Cl, Br, I) polyhedra, whereas 3D and even 2D structures remain mostly uncharted. Here, by employing a fluorinated organic cation, we report a new kind of ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides, (DFPD)CuX2&#160;(DFPD+&#160;= 4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium), which exhibits&#160;unique 2D layered crystal structure.&#160;Theoretical calculations reveal a highly dispersive conduction band of (DFPD)CuBr2, which is beneficial for charge carrier injection. It is also of particular significance to find that the 2D (DFPD)CuBr2&#160;crystals show appealing properties, including improved ambient stability and an efficient warm white&#8208;light emission, making it a promising candidate for single&#8208;component lighting and display applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Spirobipyridine Ligand Enabled Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective C&#8208;H Activation via Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective borylation of specific C&#8208;H bonds in organic synthesis remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we present a novel spirobipyridine ligand that features a binaphthyl backbone.&#160;This ligand facilitates the iridium&#8208;catalyzed selective C&#8208;H borylation of benzene derivatives. The ligand is designed with "side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall" substituents that allow vicinal di&#8208; or multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives to approach metal center and effectively block other reactive sites by non&#8208;covalent interactions with substrates.

         <title>Electrolyte Design Enables Rechargeable LiFePO4/Graphite Batteries from &#8722;80&#176;C to 80&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium iron phosphate (LFP)/graphite batteries have long dominated the energy storage battery market and are anticipated to become the dominant technology in the global power battery market. However, the poor fast&#8208;charging capability and low&#8208;temperature performance of LFP/graphite batteries seriously hinder their further spread. These limitations are strongly associated with the interfacial Li&#8208;ion transport. Here we report a wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range ester&#8208;based electrolyte that exhibits high ionic conductivity, fast interfacial kinetics and excellent film&#8208;forming ability by regulating the anion chemistry of Li salt. The interfacial barrier of the battery is quantitatively unraveled by employing three&#8208;electrode system and distribution of relaxation time technique. The superior role of the proposed electrolyte in preventing Li0 plating and sustaining homogeneous and stable interphases are also systematically investigated. The LFP/graphite cells exhibit rechargeability in an ultrawide temperature range of &#8722;80&#176;C to 80&#176;C and outstanding fast&#8208;charging capability without compromising lifespan. Specially, the practical LFP/graphite pouch cells achieve 80.2% capacity retention after 1200 cycles (2 C) and 10&#8208;min charge to 89% (5 C) at 25&#176;C and provides reliable power even at &#8722;80&#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed Crystalline Covalent Heptazine Frameworks with Built&#8208;in Heterojunction Structures towards Efficient Photocatalytic Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) are widely utilized in the recent years as potential photocatalysts. However, their limited conjugated structures, low crystallinity and small surface areas have limited the practical photocatalysis performance. Along this line, we report herein the synthesis of a kind of mixed crystalline CHF (m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1) with built&#8208;in heterojunction structure, which can efficiently catalyze the formic acid dehydrogenation by visible light driven photocatalysis. The m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 is synthesized from 2,5,8&#8208;triamino&#8208;heptazine and dicyanobenzene (DCB) in the molten salts, in which DCB plays as organic molten co&#8208;solvent to promote the rapid and ordered polymerization of 2,5,8&#8208;triamino&#8208;heptazine. The m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 is formed by embedding phenyl&#8208;linked heptazine (CHF&#8208;Ph) units in the poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) network similar to doping. The CHF&#8208;Ph combined with PHI form an effective type II heterojunction structure, which promote the directional transfer of charge carriers. And the integration of CHF&#8208;Ph makes m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 have smaller exciton binding energy than pure PHI, the charge carriers are more easily dissociated to form free electrons, resulting in higher utilization efficiency of the carriers. The largest hydrogen evolution rate reaches a value of 42.86 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 with a high apparent quantum yield of 24.6% at 420 nm, which surpasses the majority of other organic photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Efficiency and Durability of Perovskite Solar Cells with Chlorine&#8208;Functionalized Fully Conjugated Porous Aromatic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;radiative recombination, caused by trap states, significantly hampers the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The emerging porous organic polymers (POPs) show promise as a platform for designing novel defect passivation agents due to their rigid and porous structure. However, the POPs reported so far lack either sufficient stability or clear sites of interactions with the defects. Herein, two chlorine&#8208;functionalized, fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) were constructed via a decarbonylation reaction. The chlorinated PAFs feature unique long&#8208;range conjugated networks bearing multiple chlorine atoms, significantly improving the photovoltaic performance and stability of doped solar cells. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses confirmed the strong passivation effects of conjugated structure to the defect through Cl sites. Specifically, PAF&#8208;159, bearing a triphenylamine moiety, demonstrated stronger Cl&#8208;Pb bonding and higher passivation efficiency due to the presence of &#960;* anti&#8208;bonding orbitals, which elevate the HOMO energy level and facilitate Cl&#8208;Pb charge transfer. Consequently, we obtained high&#8208;performance PAF&#8208;159&#8208;doped devices with advanced PCE (24.3%), good storage stability (retaining 86% after 3000 hours), and good long&#8208;term operational stability (retaining 92% after 350 hours)</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemically Promoted Functionalization of Postconsumer Poly(Methyl Methacrylate) and Poly(&#945;&#8208;Methylstyrene) for Bulk Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a methodology of post&#8208;polymerization functionalization to enable subsequent bulk depolymerization to monomer by utilizing mechanochemical macro&#8208;radical generation. By harnessing ultrasonic chain&#8208;scission in the presence of N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide methacrylate (PhthMA), we successfully chain&#8208;end functionalize polymers to promote subsequent depolymerization in bulk, achieving up to 81% depolymerization of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(&#945;&#8208;methylstyrene) (PAMS) within 30 min. This method of depolymerization yields a high&#8208;purity monomer that can be repolymerized. Moreover, as compared to the most common methods of depolymerization, this work is most efficient with ultra&#8208;high molecular weight (UHMW) polymers, establishing a method with the potential to address highly persistent, non&#8208;degradable all&#8208;carbon backbone plastic materials. Lastly, we demonstrate the expansion of this depolymerization method to commercial cell cast PMMA, achieving high degrees of depolymerization from post&#8208;consumer waste. This work is the first demonstration of applying PhthMA&#8208;promoted depolymerization strategies in homopolymer PMMA and PAMS prepared by conventional polymerization methods.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Phosphorus on Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis for Ruthenium Phosphides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal/p&#8208;block compounds are regarded as the most essential materials for electrochemical energy converting systems involving various electrocatalysis. Understanding the role of p&#8208;block element on the interaction of key intermediates and interfacial water molecule orientation at the polarized catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface during the electrocatalysis is important for rational designing advanced p&#8208;block modified metal electrocatalysts. Herein, taking a sequence of ruthenium phosphides (including Ru2P, RuP and RuP2) as model catalysts, we establish a volcanic&#8208;relation between P&#8208;proportion and alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity. The dominant role of P for regulating hydroxyl binding energy is validated by active sites poisoning experiments, pH&#8208;dependent infection&#8208;point behavior, in situ surface enhanced absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, in which P could tailor the d&#8208;band structure of Ru, optimize the hydroxyl adsorption sites across the Ru&#8208;P moieties, thereby leading to improved proportion of strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water and facilitated proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process, which are responsible for the enhanced alkaline HOR performance.</dc:description>

The dominant role of P for regulating hydroxyl binding energy is validated by active sites poisoning experiments, pH-dependent infection-point behavior, in situ surface enhanced absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, in which P could tailor the d-band structure of Ru, optimize the hydroxyl adsorption sites across the Ru-P moieties, thereby leading to improved proportion of strongly hydrogen-bonded water and facilitated proton-coupled electron transfer process, which are responsible for the enhanced alkaline HOR performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesoporous Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Heteroatom&#8208;Tuned Crystallinity and Photocatalytic Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to its prominent &#960;&#8208;delocalization and stability, vinylene linkage holds great merits in the construction of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with promising semiconducting properties. However, carbon&#8208;carbon double bond formation reaction always exhibits relatively low reversibility, unfavorable for the formation of high crystalline frameworks through self&#8208;error correction and assembling processes. In this work, we report a heteroatom&#8208;tuned strategy to build up a series of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) vinylene&#8208;linked COFs by Knoevenagel condensation of an electron&#8208;deficient methylthiazolyl&#8208;based monomer with different triformyl substituted (hetero&#8208;)aromatic derivatives. The resulting COFs show high&#8208;quality periodic mesoporous structures with high surface areas. Embedding heteroatoms into the backbones enables significantly improving their crystallinity, and finely tailoring their semiconducting structures. Upon visible light stimulation, one of the as&#8208;prepared COFs with donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor structure could deliver a nearly seven&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic activity of hydrogen generation as compared with the other two. Meanwhile, in combination with high crystallinity and the matched conduction band energy level, such kind of COFs can be able to selectively generate singlet oxygen and superoxide radicals in a high ratio of up to 30:1, allowing for catalyzing aerobic thioanisole oxidation in distinctly tunable activities through the substituent electronic effect of the substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Assisted Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvation Structure for Fast&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure favors the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich robust electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which endows fast ion transport and high strength modulus to enable improved electrochemical performance. However, such a unique solvation structure inevitably injures the ionic conductivity of electrolytes and limits the fast&#8208;charging performance. Herein, a trade&#8208;off in tuning anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure and high ionic conductivity is realized by the entropy&#8208;assisted hybrid ester&#8208;ether electrolyte. Anion&#8208;reinforced solvation sheath with more anions occupying the inner Na+ shell is constructed by introducing the weakly coordinated ether tetrahydrofuran into the commonly used ester&#8208;based electrolyte, which merits the accelerated desolvation energy and gradient inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The improved ionic conductivity is attributed to the weakly diverse solvation structures induced by entropy effect. These enable the enhanced rate performance and cycling stability of Prussian blue||hard carbon full cells with high electrode mass loading. More importantly, the practical application of the designed electrolyte was further demonstrated by industry&#8208;level 18650 cylindrical cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Dihydropyridopyrazine Functionalized Xanthene: Generating Stable NIR Dyes with Small&#8208;Molecular Weight by Enhanced Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared region (NIR; 650&#8211;1700 nm) dyes offer many advantages over traditional dyes with absorption and emission in the visible region. However, developing new NIR dyes, especially organic dyes with long wavelengths, small molecular weight, and excellent stability and biocompatibility, is still quite challenging. Herein, we present a general method to enhance the absorption and emission wavelengths of traditional fluorophores by simply appending a charge separation structure, dihydropyridopyrazine. These novel NIR dyes not only exhibited greatly redshifted wavelengths compared to their parent dyes, but also displayed a small molecular weight increase together with retained stability and biocompatibility. Specifically, dye NIR&#8208;OX, a dihydropyridopyra&#8208;zine derivative of oxazine with a molecular mass of 386.2 Da, exhibited an absorption at 822 nm and an emission extending to 1200 nm, making it one of the smallest molecular&#8208;weight NIR&#8208;II emitting dyes. Thanks to its rapid metabolism and long wave&#8208;length, NIR&#8208;OX enabled high&#8208;contrast bioimaging and assessment of cholestatic liver injury in vivo and also facilitated the evalua&#8208;tion of the efficacy of liver protection medicines against cholestatic liver injury.</dc:description>

         <title>Tensile&#8208;Strained Cu Penetration Electrode Boosts Asymmetric C&#8211;C Coupling for Ampere&#8208;Level CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ Reduction in Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of multicarbon (C2+) products remains a substantial challenge in sustainable CO2 electroreduction owing to the need for sufficient current density and faradaic efficiency alongside carbon efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate ampere&#8208;level high&#8208;efficiency CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products in both neutral and strongly acidic (pH = 1) electrolytes using a hierarchical Cu hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE). High concentration of K+ could concurrently suppress hydrogen evolution reaction and facilitate C&#8211;C coupling, thereby promoting C2+ production in strong acid. By optimizing the K+ and H+ concentration and CO2 flow rate, a faradaic efficiency of 84.5% and a partial current density as high as 3.1 A&#8201;cm&#8211;2 for C2+ products, alongside a single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of 81.5% and stable electrolysis for 240 h were demonstrated in a strong acidic solution of H2SO4 and KCl (pH = 1). Experimental measurements and density functional theory simulations suggested that tensile&#8208;strained Cu HPE enhances the asymmetric C&#8211;C coupling to steer the selectivity and activity of C2+ products.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Production of Hydroxyl Radicals via Three&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction: Opportunities for Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electro&#8208;Fenton (EF) process is an advanced oxidation technology with significant potential; however, it is limited by two steps: generation and activation of H2O2. In contrast to the production of H2O2 via the electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the electrochemical three&#8208;electron (3e&#8208;) ORR can directly activate molecular oxygen to yield the hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH), thus breaking through the conceptual and operational limitations of the traditional EF reaction. Therefore, the 3e&#8208; ORR is a vital process for efficiently producing &#183;OH in situ, thus charting a new path toward the development of green water&#8208;treatment technologies. This review summarizes the characteristics and mechanisms of the 3e&#8208; ORR, focusing on the basic principles and latest progress in the in situ generation and efficient utilization of &#183;OH through the modulation of the reaction pathway, shedding light on the rational design of 3e&#8208; ORR catalysts, mechanistic exploration, and practical applications for water treatment. Finally, the future developments and challenges of efficient, stable, and large&#8208;scale utilization of &#183;OH are discussed based on achieving optimal 3e&#8208; ORR regulation and the potential to combine it with other technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum Dot&#8208;Based FRET Nanosensors for Talin&#8208;Membrane Assembly and Mechanosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the mechanisms of assembly and disassembly of macromolecular structures in cells relies on solving biomolecular interactions. However, those interactions often remain unclear because tools to track molecular dynamics are not sufficiently resolved in time or space. In this study, we present a straightforward method for resolving inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;molecular interactions in cell adhesive machinery, using quantum dot (QD) based F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanosensors. Using a mechanosensitive protein, talin, one of the major components of focal adhesions, we are investigating the mechanosensing ability of proteins to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. First, we quantified the distances separating talin and a giant unilamellar vesicle membrane for three talin variants. These variants differ in molecular length. Second, we investigated the mechanosensing capabilities of talin, i.e., its conformational changes due to mechanical stretching initiated by cytoskeleton contraction. Our results suggest that in early focal adhesion, talin undergoes stretching, corresponding to a decrease in the talin&#8208;membrane distance of 2.5 nm. We demonstrate that QD&#8208;FRET nanosensors can be applied for the sensitive quantification of mechanosensing with a sub&#8208;nanometer accuracy.</dc:description>

         <title>Butadiene Sulfone Based Binary Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) have attracted significant interest due to the unique physiochemical properties, yet challenges persist in achieving satisfactory Li anode compatibility through a binary DEE formula. In this study, we introduce a nonflammable binary DEE electrolyte comprising of lithium bis(trifluoro&#8208;methane&#8208;sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and solid butadiene sulfone (BdS), which demonstrates enhanced Li metal compatibility while exhibiting high Li+ ion migration number (0.52), ionic conductivity (1.48 mS&#183;cm&#8208;1), wide electrochemical window (~4.5 V vs. Li/Li+) at room temperature. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the Li compatibility derives from the formation of a LiF&#8208;rich SEI, attributed to the undesirable adsorption and deformation of BdS on Li surface that facilitates the preferential reactions between LiTFSI and Li metal. This stable SEI effectively suppresses dendrites growth and gas evolution reactions, ensuring a long lifespan and high coulombic efficiency in both the Li||Li symmetric cells, Li||LiCoO2 and Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cells. Moreover, the BdS eutectic strategy exhibit universal applicability to other metal such as Na and Zn by pairing with the corresponding TFSI&#8208;based salts.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing the Microenvironment in Solid Polymer Electrolytes by Anion Vacancy Coupled with Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of solid polymer electrolyte is hindered by the small transference number of Li+, low ionic conductivity and poor interfacial stability, which are seriously determined by the microenvironment in polymer electrolyte. The introduction of functional fillers is an effective solution to these problems. In this work, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is demonstrated that the anion vacancy of filler can anchor anions of lithium salt, thereby significantly increasing the transference number of Li+ in the electrolyte. Therefore, flower&#8208;like SnS2&#8208;based filler with abundant sulfur vacancies is prepared under the regulation of functionalized carbon dots (CDs). It is worth mentioning that the CDs dotted on the surface of SnS2 have rich organic functional groups, which can serve as the bridging agent to enhance the compatibility of filler and polymer, leading to superior mechanical performance and fast ion transport pathway. Additionally, the in&#8208;situ formed Li2S/Li3N at the interface of Li metal and electrolyte facilitate the fast Li+ diffusion and uniform Li deposition, effectively mitigating the growth of lithium dendrites. As a result, the assembled lithium metal batteries exhibit excellent cycling stability, reflecting the superiority of the carbon dots derived vacancy&#8208;rich inorganic filler modification strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition in Mechanochemistry: Insights from Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular&#8208;recognition events are highly relevant in biology and chemistry. In the present study, we investigated such processes in the solid state under mechanochemical conditions using the formation of racemic phases upon reacting enantiopure entities as example. As test systems, &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA) and the amino acids serine and alanine were used. The effects of ball&#8208;milling and resonant acoustic mixing (RAM) on the formation of racemic phases were probed by using solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In a mixer mill, a highly efficient and fast racemic phase formation occurred for both TFLA and the two amino acids. RAM led to the racemic phase for TFLA also, and this process was facilitated upon employing pre&#8208;milled enantiopure entities. In contrast, under comparable conditions RAM did not result in the formation of racemic phases for serine and alanine.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular, Scalable Total Synthesis of Lapparbin with a Noncanonical Biaryl Linkage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reports the development of a novel synthetic approach for the highly strained atrop&#8208;Tyr C&#8208;6&#8208;to&#8208;Trp N&#8208;1' linkage, which can be executed on a decagram scale using a modular strategy involving Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H arylation followed by Larock macrocyclization. Moreover, the first total synthesis of lapparbin (1) was achieved by applying this synthetic strategy. Furthermore, the modular synthesis utilizing C&#8208;H arylation and Larock macrocyclization, discovered in the total synthesis of lapparbin (1), was demonstrated to be applicable to various arbitrary biaryl linkages, including non&#8208;natural types.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective (3+2) Annulation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes with Aldehydes and Ketones Catalyzed by Br&#248;nsted Bases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The substituted tetrahydrofuran core is a structural motif in many biologically active and natural compounds. However, the scarcity of enantioselective methods developed towards its synthesis makes this field challenging and attractive to explore. Herein, the first Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalyzed enantioselective (3+2) annulation of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with aldehydes and ketones affording enantioenriched 2,3,5&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofurans is reported. The reaction concept is based on activation of racemic &#946;&#8208;cyclopropyl ketones by a chiral bifunctional Br&#248;nsted base which catalyzes the (3+2) annulation for a range of aldehydes and ketones. For aldehydes, the annulation furnished tetrahydrofurans in excellent yield, good diastereoselectivity and with excellent enantioselectivity up to &gt;99% ee. Surprisingly, aromatic aldehydes afforded the cis&#8208;2,5&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofurans as the major diastereoisomer, while for aliphatic aldehydes the trans&#8208;cycloadduct was favored. The reaction also proceeds well for ketones affording spiro tetrahydrofurans in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Hammett studies have been conducted to elucidate the influence of the electronic nature of benzaldehydes on the stereoselectivity. Based on the diastereochemical outcome for the aldehydes, two reaction paths for aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes are proposed. Finally, two diastereoselective synthetic transformations have been conducted to demonstrate the synthetic potential of the obtained products.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;triggered assembly of glycan nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comprehensive molecular understanding of carbohydrate aggregation is key to optimize carbohydrate utilization and to engineer bioinspired analogues with tailored shape1s and properties. However, the lack of well&#8208;defined synthetic standards has substantially hampered advances in this field. Herein, we employ a phosphorylation&#8208;assisted strategy to synthesize previously inaccessible long oligomers of cellulose, chitin, and xylan. These oligomers were subjected to enzyme&#8208;triggered assembly (ETA) for the on&#8208;demand formation of well&#8208;defined carbohydrate nanomaterials, including elongated platelets, helical bundles, and hexagonal particles. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy and electron diffraction analysis provided molecular insights into the aggregation behavior of these oligosaccharides, establishing a direct connection between the resulting morphologies and the oligosaccharide primary sequence. Our findings demonstrate that ETA is a powerful approach to elucidate the intrinsic aggregation behavior of carbohydrates in nature. Moreover, the ability to access a diverse array of morphologies, expanded with a non&#8208;natural sequence, underscores the potential of ETA, coupled with sequence design, as a robust tool for accessing programmable glycan architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Enhancement in Cobalt(II) TPMA Aqueous Hydrogen Photosynthesis through Intramolecular Proton Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosynthetic hydrogen generation by cobalt(II) tris(2&#8208;pyridilmethyl)amine (TPMA) complexes is mainly limited by protonation kinetics and decomposition routes involving demetallation. In the present work we have explored the effects of both proton shuttles and improved rigidity on the catalytic ability of cobalt(II) TPMA complexes.

         <title>Enabling Efficient Anchoring&#8208;Conversion Interface by Fabricating Double&#8208;Layer Functionalized Separator for Suppressing Shuttle Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LiSBs) with high energy density still face challenges on sluggish conversion kinetics, severe shuttle effects of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and low blocking feature of ordinary separators to LiPSs. To tackle these, a novel double&#8208;layer strategy to functionalize separators is proposed, which consists of Co with atomically dispersed CoN4 decorated on Ketjen black (Co/CoN4@KB) layer and an ultrathin 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene layer. The theoretical calculations and experimental results jointly demonstrate metallic Co sites provide efficient adsorption and catalytic capability for long&#8208;chain LiPSs, while CoN4 active sites facilitate the absorption of short&#8208;chain LiPSs and promote the conversion to Li2S. The stacking MXene layer serves as a microscopic barrier to further physically block and chemically anchor leaked LiPSs from the pores and gaps of the Co/CoN4@KB layer, thus preserving LiPSs within efficient anchoring&#8208;conversion reaction interfaces to balance the accumulation of &#8220;dead S&#8221; and Li2S. Consequently, with an ultralight loading of Co/CoN4@KB&#8208;MXene, the LiSBs exhibit amazing electrochemical performance even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte, and the outperforming performance for lithium&#8208;selenium batteries (LiSeBs) can also be achieved. This work exploits a universal and effective strategy of a double&#8208;layer functionalized separator to regulate the equilibrium adsorption&#8208;catalytic interface, enabling high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;cycle LiSBs/LiSeBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Transforming Red Phosphorus Photocatalysis: Dual Roles of Pre&#8208;Anchored Ru Single Atoms in Defect and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline red phosphorus(CRP), known for its promising photocatalytic properties, faces challenges in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution(PHE) due to undesired inherent charge deep trapping and recombination effects induced by defects. This study overcomes these limitations through an innovative strategy in integrating ruthenium single atoms(Ru1) within CRP to simultaneously repair the intrinsic undesired vacancy defects and serve as the uniformly distributed anchoring sites for a controllable growth into ruthenium nanoparticles(RuNP). Hence, a highly functionalized CRP with Ru1 and RuNP(Ru1&#8208;NP/CRP) with concerted effects in regulating electronic structures and promoting interfacial charge transfer has been achieved. Advanced characterizations unveil the pioneering dual role of pre&#8208;anchored Ru1&#160;in transforming CRP photocatalysis. The regulations of vacancy defects on the surface of CRP minimize the detrimental deep charge trapping, resulting in the prolonged lifetime of charges. With the well&#8208;distributed in&#8208;situ growth of RuNP on Ru1 sites, the constructed robust &#8220;bridge&#8221; that connects CRP and RuNP facilitates constructive interfacial charge transfer. Ultimately, the synergistic effect induced by the pre&#8208;anchored Ru1 endows Ru1&#8208;NP/CRP with an exceptional PHE rate of 3175&#956;molh&#8208;1g&#8208;1, positioning it as one of the most efficient elemental&#8208;based photocatalysts. This breakthrough underscores the crucial role of pre&#8208;anchoring metal single atoms at defect sites of catalysts in enhancing hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium Nanoclusters and Single Atoms on &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Achieves Low&#8208;Input/Input&#8208;Free Hydrogen Evolution via Decoupled/Coupled Hydrazine Oxidation</title>

         <dc:description>
The synergistic activation of the bifunctional reaction kinetics of cubic &#945;&#8208;MoC nanoparticles decorated&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon by the concomitant Ru nanoclusters and single atom enables the efficient coupling or decoupling of hydrazine oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction for the multifold H2 production via the zinc hydrazine battery&#8208;driven overall hydrazine splitting system.







Abstract
The hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted H2 evolution method promises low&#8208;input and input&#8208;free hydrogen production. However, developing high&#8208;performance catalysts for hydrazine oxidation (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution (HER) is challenging. Here, we introduce a bifunctional electrocatalyst &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C/RuNSA, merging ruthenium (Ru) nanoclusters (NCs) and single atoms (SA) into cubic &#945;&#8208;MoC nanoparticles&#8208;decorated N&#8208;doped carbon (&#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C) nanowires, through electrodeposition. The composite showcases exceptional activity for both HzOR and HER, requiring &#8722;80&#8197;mV and &#8722;9&#8197;mV respectively to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical and experimental insights confirm the importance of two Ru species for bifunctionality: NCs enhance the conductivity, and its coexistence with SA balances the H ad/desorption for HER and facilitates the initial dehydrogenation during the HzOR. In the overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) system, &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C/RuNSA excels as both anode and cathode materials, achieving 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at just 64&#8197;mV. The zinc hydrazine (Zn&#8722;Hz) battery assembled with &#945;&#8208;MoC/N&#8722;C/RuNSA cathode and Zn foil anode can exhibit 97.3&#8201;% energy efficiency, as well as temporary separation of hydrogen gas during the discharge process. Therefore, integrating Zn&#8722;Hz with OHzS system enables self&#8208;powered H2 evolution, even in hydrazine sewage. Overall, the amalgamation of NCs with SA achieves diverse catalytic activities for yielding multifold hydrogen gas through advanced cell&#8208;integrated&#8208;electrolyzer system.

         <title>Paper&#8208;in&#8208;Tip Bipolar Electrospray Mass Spectrometry for Real&#8208;Time Chemical Reaction Monitoring</title>

We present the first combination of a paper&#8208;based bipolar electrode with mass spectrometry to address the need not only to capture ultrafast dynamics in chemistry, but also to access complementary structural information from diverse reaction scenarios and to explore electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
Capturing short&#8208;lived intermediates at the molecular level is key to understanding the mechanism and dynamics of chemical reactions. Here, we have developed a paper&#8208;in&#8208;tip bipolar electrolytic electrospray mass spectrometry platform, in which a piece of triangular conductive paper incorporated into a plastic pipette tip serves not only as an electrospray emitter but also as a bipolar electrode (BPE), thus triggering both electrospray and electrolysis simultaneously upon application of a high voltage. The bipolar electrolysis induces a pair of redox reactions on both sides of BPE, enabling both electro&#8208;oxidation and electro&#8208;reduction processes regardless of the positive or negative ion mode, thus facilitating access to complementary structural information for mechanism elucidation. Our method enables real&#8208;time monitoring of transient intermediates (such as N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline radical cation, dopamine o&#8208;quinone (DAQ) and sulfenic acid with half&#8208;lives ranging from microseconds to minutes) and transient processes (such as DAQ cyclization with a rate constant of 0.15&#8197;s&#8722;1). This platform also provides key insights into electrocatalytic reactions such as Fe (III)&#8208;catalyzed dopamine oxidation to quinone species at physiological pH for neuromelanin formation.

Automated synthesis of a wide range of unique multicompositional multiblock copolymers via emulsion polymerization is described. These include a heptablock comprising seven different methacrylates, a high molecular weight (&gt;150,000&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) tridecablock, and a library of multiblock copolymers with randomized degrees of polymerization, composition, and monomer order. Notably, this library includes a multiblock copolymer containing polymers from four different families (methacrylate, styreme, acrylate, and acrylamide).







Abstract
Synthetic polymers are of paramount importance in modern life &#8208; an incredibly wide range of polymeric materials possessing an impressive variety of properties have been developed to date. The recent emergence of artificial intelligence and automation presents a great opportunity to significantly speed up discovery and development of the next generation of advanced polymeric materials. We have focused on the high&#8208;throughput automated synthesis of multiblock copolymers that comprise three or more distinct polymer segments of different monomer composition bonded in linear sequence. The present work has exploited automation to prepare high molar mass multiblock copolymers (typically&gt;100,000&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) using reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in aqueous emulsion. A variety of original multiblock copolymers have been synthesised via a Chemspeed robot, exemplified by a multiblock copolymer comprising thirteen constituent blocks. Moreover, libraries of copolymers of randomized monomer compositions (acrylates, acrylamides, methacrylates, and styrenes), block orders, and block lengths were also generated, thereby demonstrating the robustness of our synthetic approach. One multiblock copolymer contained all four monomer families listed in the pool, which is unprecedented in the literature. The present work demonstrates that automation has the power to render complex and laborious syntheses of such unprecedented materials not just possible, but facile and straightforward, thus representing the way forward to the next generation of complex macromolecular architectures.

         <title>Zwitterionic Cellulose&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolyte Enabled by Aqueous Solution Casting for High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

A new PEO&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte (PL&#8208;ZCNF) is synthesized by integrating zwitterionic cellulose nanofiber (ZCNF) into PEO matrix mixed with LiTFSI, using a straightforward and eco&#8208;friendly aqueous solution casting method. Due to the unique zwitterionic properties, PL&#8208;ZCNF enables an optimized balance between Li ionic conductivity and mechanical strength, as well as the resultant extraordinary long&#8208;term cyclability in full and punch cells.







Abstract
Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries hold great promise as the next&#8208;generation batteries with high energy density and high safety. However, PEO&#8208;based electrolytes encounter certain limitations, including inferior ionic conductivity, low Li+ transference number, and poor mechanical strength. Herein, we aim to simultaneously address these issues by utilizing one&#8208;dimensional zwitterionic cellulose nanofiber (ZCNF) as fillers for PEO&#8208;based electrolytes using a simple aqueous solution casting method. Multiple characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the unique zwitterionic structure imparts ZCNF with various functions, such as disrupting PEO crystallization, dissociating lithium salts, anchoring anions through cationic groups, accelerating Li+ migration by anionic groups, as well as its inherent reinforcement effect. As a result, the prepared PL&#8208;ZCNF electrolyte exhibits remarkable ionic conductivity (5.37&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.62) at 60&#8201;&#176;C without sacrificing mechanical strength (9.2&#8197;MPa), together with high critical current density of 1.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Attributed to these merits of PL&#8208;ZCNF, the LiFePO4|PL&#8208;ZCNF|Li solid&#8208;state full&#8208;cell delivers exceptional rate capability and cycling performance (900&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;C). Notably, the assembled pouch&#8208;cell can maintain steady operation over 1000&#8197;cycles with an impressive 93.7&#8201;% capacity retention at 0.5&#8197;C and 60&#8201;&#176;C, highlighting the great potential of PL&#8208;ZCNF for practical applications.

         <title>Reverse Separation of Carbon Dioxide and Acetylene in Two Isostructural Copper Pyridine&#8208;Carboxylate Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

Different pore structures can adjust binding configurations of CO2 and C2H2 molecules in two isoreticular ultramicroporous MOFs to show selective adsorption of CO2 over C2H2 for efficient purification of C2H2.







Abstract
Separating acetylene from carbon dioxide is important but highly challenging due to their similar molecular shapes and physical properties. Adsorptive separation of carbon dioxide from acetylene can directly produce pure acetylene but is hardly realized because of relatively polarizable acetylene binds more strongly. Here, we reverse the CO2 and C2H2 separation by adjusting the pore structures in two isoreticular ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Under ambient conditions, copper isonicotinate (Cu(ina)2), with relatively large pore channels shows C2H2&#8208;selective adsorption with a C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 3.4, whereas its smaller&#8208;pore analogue, copper quinoline&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylate (Cu(Qc)2) shows an inverse CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 5.6. Cu(Qc)2 shows compact pore space that well matches the optimal orientation of CO2 but is not compatible for C2H2. Neutron powder diffraction experiments confirmed that CO2 molecules adopt preferential orientation along the pore channels during adsorption binding, whereas C2H2 molecules bind in an opposite fashion with distorted configurations due to their opposite quadrupole moments. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have validated the separation performance of Cu(Qc)2 for CO2/C2H2 separation.

         <title>Design, Preparation, and Implementation of Axially Chiral Benzotetramisoles as Lewis Base Catalysts for Asymmetric Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of benzotetramisole Lewis base catalysts (AxBTMs) that have both central and axial chirality were developed. This unique feature of these catalysts results in a three&#8208;dimensional microenvironment with multi&#8208;layers of chirality. The performance of the developed catalysts were tested in a series of cycloaddition reactions, giving cycloaddition products with high stereoselectivities that are otherwise difficult to achieve with conventional BTM catalysts. Control experiments indicated that the axial and central chirality played a synergistic role in controlling the stereochemistry.







Abstract
Developing novel catalysts with potent activity is of great importance in organocatalysis. In this study, we designed and prepared a new class of benzotetramisole Lewis base catalysts (AxBTM) that have both central and axial chirality. This unique feature of these catalysts results in a three&#8208;dimensional microenvironment with multi&#8208;layers of chirality. The performance of the developed catalysts was tested in a series of cycloaddition reactions. These included the AxBTM&#8208;catalyzed (2+2) cycloaddition between &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aryl anhydride with imines or oxindoles, and the sequential gold/AxBTM&#8208;catalyzed (4+2) cycloaddition of enynamides with pentafluorophenyl esters. The interplay between axial and central chirality had a collaborative effect in regulating the stereochemistry in these cycloadditions, leading to high levels of stereoselectivity that would otherwise be challenging to achieve using conventional BTM catalysts. However, the (2+2) and (4+2) cycloadditions have different predilections for axial and central chirality combinations.

         <title>2D Exfoliation Chemistry Towards Covalent Pseudo&#8208;Layered Phosphate Framework Derived by Radical/Strain&#8208;Synergistical Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong ionic/covalent bonding usually requires more aggressive pathways for effective exfoliation purposes. Here, we propose for the first time a radical/strain synergistic strategy for exfoliation of non&#8208;van der Waals interacting pseudolamellar phosphate frameworks. Innovative 2D layered NASICON&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)2O2F crystals exfoliated via &#8208;OH/H2O synergism exhibit significantly improved Na&#8208;storage properties compared to bulk frameworks.







Abstract
2D compounds exfoliated from weakly bonded bulk materials with van der Waals (vdW) interaction are easily accessible. However, the strong internal ionic/covalent bonding of most inorganic crystal frameworks greatly hinders 2D material exfoliation. Herein, we first proposed a radical/strain&#8208;synergistic strategy to exfoliate non&#8208;vdW interacting pseudo&#8208;layered phosphate framework. Specifically, hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) distort the covalent bond irreversibly, meanwhile, H2O molecules as solvents, further accelerating interlayered ionic bond breakage but mechanical expansion. The innovative 2D laminar NASICON&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)2O2F crystal, exfoliated by &#8901;OH/H2O synergistic strategy, exhibits enhanced sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity, high&#8208;rate performance (85.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;C), cyclic life (2300 cycles), and ion migration rates, compared with the bulk framework. Importantly, this chemical/physical dual driving technique realized the effective exfoliation for strongly coupled pseudo&#8208;layered frameworks, which accelerates 2D functional material development.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvation Structure Enables Stable Operation of Ether&#8208;Based Electrolyte in High&#8208;Voltage Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure is realized in the co&#8208;solvent ether&#8208;based electrolyte at a medium concentration of 1.5&#8197;M. The introduction of weakly solvated DBE cosolvent greatly weakens the K+&#8208;solvent coordination, reducing the K+ desolvation energy. Furthermore, more anions occupy the inner solvation sheath, which enhances the oxidative stability and facilitates the formation of robust and stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface with inorganic&#8208;rich interphase. These assure the ultrahigh compatibility with K metal anode and excellent electrochemical performance at high voltage.







Abstract
Electrolytes with anion&#8208;dominated solvation are promising candidates to achieve dendrite&#8208;free and high&#8208;voltage potassium metal batteries. However, it's challenging to form anion&#8208;reinforced solvates at low salt concentrations. Herein, we construct an anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure at a moderate concentration of 1.5&#8197;M with weakly coordinated cosolvent ethylene glycol dibutyl ether. The unique solvation structure accelerates the desolvation of K+, strengthens the oxidative stability to 4.94&#8197;V and facilitates the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich and stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. These enable stable plating/stripping of K metal anode over 2200&#8197;h, high capacity retention of 83.0&#8201;% after 150 cycles with a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#8197;V in K0.67MnO2//K cells, and even 91.5&#8201;% after 30 cycles under 4.7&#8197;V. This work provides insight into weakly coordinated cosolvent and opens new avenues for designing ether&#8208;based high&#8208;voltage electrolytes.

         <title>Translocation and Confinement of Tetraamines in Adaptable Microporous Cavities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce an alternative to the use of open metal vacancies in the design of amine&#8208;appended adsorbents based on the use of secondary building units combining of hard and soft metal sites. This endows MUV&#8208;10 with a flexible response to the uptake of tetraamines that facilitates their translocation into the microporous cavities of the framework to form stable bis&#8208;coordinate adducts that can remain stable in water.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks can be grafted with amines by coordination to metal vacancies to create amine&#8208;appended solid adsorbents, which are being considered as an alternative to using aqueous amine solutions for CO2 capture. In this study, we propose an alternative mechanism that does not rely on the use of neutral metal vacancies as binding sites but is enabled by the structural adaptability of heterobimetallic Ti2Ca2 clusters. The combination of hard (Ti4+) and soft (Ca2+) metal centers in the inorganic nodes of the framework enables MUV&#8208;10 to adapt its pore windows to the presence of triethylenetetramine molecules. This dynamic cluster response facilitates the translocation and binding of tetraamine inside the microporous cavities to enable the formation of bis&#8208;coordinate adducts that are stable in water. The extension of this grafting concept from MUV&#8208;10 to larger cavities not restrictive to CO2 diffusion will complement other strategies available for the design of molecular sorbents for decarbonization applications.

         <title>Probing Particle&#8208;Carbon/Binder Degradation Behavior in Fatigued Layered Cathode Materials through Machine Learning Aided Diffraction Tomography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique combination of machine learning and &#956;&#8208;XRD CT has been used to unveil the spatial distribution of structure and microstrain in the fatigued layered materials. Smaller NCM622 particles and the surface of larger NCM622 particles in contact with the carbon/binder matrix experience intensified structural fatigue after long&#8208;term cycling. Serious structural fatigue occurs in both the surface and bulk of LLNMO particles during extended cycling.







Abstract
Understanding how reaction heterogeneity impacts cathode materials during Li&#8208;ion battery (LIB) electrochemical cycling is pivotal for unraveling their electrochemical performance. Yet, experimentally verifying these reactions has proven to be a challenge. To address this, we employed scanning &#956;&#8208;XRD computed tomography to scrutinize Ni&#8208;rich layered LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) and Li&#8208;rich layered Li[Li0.2Ni0.2Mn0.6]O2 (LLNMO). By harnessing machine learning (ML) techniques, we scrutinized an extensive dataset of &#956;&#8208;XRD patterns, about 100,000&#8197;patterns per slice, to unveil the spatial distribution of crystalline structure and microstrain. Our experimental findings unequivocally reveal the distinct behavior of these materials. NCM622 exhibits structural degradation and lattice strain intricately linked to the size of secondary particles. Smaller particles and the surface of larger particles in contact with the carbon/binder matrix experience intensified structural fatigue after long&#8208;term cycling. Conversely, both the surface and bulk of LLNMO particles endure severe strain&#8208;induced structural degradation during high&#8208;voltage cycling, resulting in significant voltage decay and capacity fade. This work holds the potential to fine&#8208;tune the microstructure of advanced layered materials and manipulate composite electrode construction in order to enhance the performance of LIBs and beyond.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has reported the fabrication of stretchable microelectrodes and achieved real&#8208;time quantifying of strain&#8208;induced catecholamine release from single vesicles. The results proved that mechanical strain could trigger the exocytotic events by activating Piezo1 channel and increase catecholamine release by accelerating the opening and prolonging the closure of fusion pores.







Abstract
Exocytosis involving the fusion of intracellular vesicles with cell membrane, is thought to be modulated by the mechanical cues in the microenvironment. Single&#8208;cell electrochemistry can offer unique information about the quantification and kinetics of exocytotic events; however, the effects of mechanical force on vesicular release have been poorly explored. Herein, we developed a stretchable microelectrode with excellent electrochemical stability under mechanical deformation by microfabrication of functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) conductive ink, which achieved real&#8208;time quantitation of strain&#8208;induced vesicular exocytosis from a single cell for the first time. We found that mechanical strain could cause calcium influx via the activation of Piezo1 channels in chromaffin cell, initiating the vesicular exocytosis process. Interestingly, mechanical strain increases the amount of catecholamines released by accelerating the opening and prolonging the closing of fusion pore during exocytosis. This work is expected to provide revealing insights into the regulatory effects of mechanical stimuli on vesicular exocytosis.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct ortho&#8208;Arylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadly applicable rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct ortho&#8208;arylation of anilines with (hetero)aryl halides based on readily available aminophosphines as traceless directing groups is reported. The ortho&#8208;arylated anilines could be obtained in high yields, without any competing diarylation and with full regioselectivity. The catalytic cycle was elucidated by DFT and supporting experiments.







Abstract
An efficient and broadly applicable rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct ortho&#8208;arylation of anilines with aryl iodides relying on readily available aminophosphines as traceless directing groups is reported. Its scope and functional group compatibility were both found to be quite broad as a large variety of both aminophosphines and (hetero)aryl iodides, including complex ones, could be utilized. The ortho&#8208;arylated anilines could be obtained in high average yields, without any competing diarylation and with full regioselectivity, which constitutes a major step forward compared to other processes. The reaction is moreover not limited to aryl iodides, as an aryl bromide and a triflate could be successfully used, and could be extended to diarylation. Mechanistic studies revealed the key and unique role of the aminophosphine, acting not only as a substrate but also as a ligand for the rhodium catalyst.

         <title>Studies on the Biomimetic Synthesis of Marine Ladder Polyethers via Endo&#8208;Selective Epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;Epoxonium Ring&#8208;Opening Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By reducing the nucleophilicity of the terminal hydroxy group of a polyepoxy alcohol precursor and adding a Lewis acid, we can effectively construct polyethers with hydrogen atoms at ring junctions, consecutively fused six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring, and fused seven&#8208;, eight&#8208;, and nine&#8208;membered&#8208;ring polyethers through epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclization. We suggest that marine ladder polyethers may also be biosynthesized via this mode of cyclization.







Abstract
Marine ladder polyethers have attracted the attention of chemists and biologists because of their potent biological activities. Synthetic chemists have attempted to construct their polyether frameworks by epoxide ring&#8208;opening cascades, as Nakanishi hypothesis describes. However, Baldwin's rules of ring closure state that exo&#8208;selective intramolecular cyclization of epoxy alcohols is preferred over endo&#8208;selective cyclization. Herein, we investigated epoxide ring&#8208;opening cascades of polyepoxy alcohols in [EMIM]BF4/PFTB (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate /perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl alcohol) and found that all&#8208;endo products were formed via epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclizations (not restricted by Baldwin's rules, which only apply to intramolecular hydroxyl&#8208;to&#8208;epoxide cyclizations). We determined that the key factor enabling polyepoxy alcohols to undergo a high proportion of all&#8208;endo&#8208;selective cyclization was inhibition of exo&#8208;selective hydroxyl&#8208;to&#8208;epoxide cyclization starting from the terminal hydroxyl group of a polyepoxy alcohol. By introducing a slow&#8208;release protecting group to the terminal hydroxyl group, we could markedly increase the cyclization yields of polyether fragments with hydrogen atoms at the ring junctions. For the first time, we constructed consecutively fused six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring and fused seven&#8208;, eight&#8208;, and nine&#8208;membered&#8208;ring polyether fragments by epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclizations through the addition of a suitable Lewis acid. We also suggest that the biosynthesis of marine ladder polyethers may proceed via epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclization of polyepoxide.

         <title>Alkyl Chains Tune Molecular Orientations to Enable Dual Passivation in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminothiol hydrochlorides with different alkyl chains were employed to investigate the interplay between molecular structure, orientation, and interaction on perovskite surface. The 2&#8208;Aminoethane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol hydrochloride with shorter alkyl chains exhibited a preference of parallel orientation, enhancing its interaction with surface defects. Consequently, this led to the successful fabrication of a stable inverted device with an impressive PCE of 25&#8201;%.







Abstract
Nonradiative recombination losses occurring at the interface pose a significant obstacle to achieve high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs), particularly in inverted PSCs. Passivating surface defects using molecules with different functional groups represents one of the key strategies for enhancing PSCs efficiency. However, a lack of insight into the passivation orientation of molecules on the surface is a challenge for rational molecular design. In this study, aminothiol hydrochlorides with different alkyl chains but identical electron&#8208;donating (&#8722;SH) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (&#8722;NH3+) groups were employed to investigate the interplay between molecular structure, orientation, and interaction on perovskite surface. The 2&#8208;Aminoethane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol hydrochloride with shorter alkyl chains exhibited a preference of parallel orientations, which facilitating stronger interactions with the surface defects through strong coordination and hydrogen bonding. The resultant perovskite films following defect passivation demonstrate reduced ion migration, inhibition of nonradiative recombination, and more n&#8208;type characteristics for efficient electron transfer. Consequently, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25&#8201;% was achieved, maintaining 95&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 500&#8197;hours of continuous maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Mechanochemical Cyclotrimerization: A Versatile Tool to Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Stacking Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

This work presents, for the first time, the mechanochemical cyclotrimerization of nitriles. Utilizing Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and a ball mill, both small molecules and large organic frameworks could be obtained. Screening the reaction of 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene by various parameters, such as reaction time, frequency, or temperature, significant impacts on the porosity of the polymer and its crystallinity were revealed.







Abstract
We introduce the first mechanochemical cyclotrimerization of nitriles, a facile strategy for synthesizing triazine&#8208;containing molecules and materials, overcoming challenges related to carbonization and solubility. Conducting this solid&#8208;state approach in a mixer ball mill with 4&#8208;Methylbenzonitrile, we synthesize Tris(4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine quantitatively in as little as 90&#8197;minutes. Just as fast, this mechanochemical method facilitates the synthesis of the covalent triazine framework CTF&#8208;1 using 1,4&#8197;Dicyanobenzene. Material characterization confirms its porous (650&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) and crystalline nature. Adjusting the induced mechanical energy allows control over the obtained stacking conformation of the resulting CTFs &#8208; from a staggered AB arrangement to an eclipsed AA stacking conformation. Finally, a substrate scope demonstrates the versatility of this approach, successfully yielding various CTFs.

&lt;p&gt;We introduce the first mechanochemical cyclotrimerization of nitriles, a facile strategy for synthesizing triazine-containing molecules and materials, overcoming challenges related to carbonization and solubility. Conducting this solid-state approach in a mixer ball mill with 4-Methylbenzonitrile, we synthesize Tris(4-methylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine quantitatively in as little as 90&#8197;minutes. Just as fast, this mechanochemical method facilitates the synthesis of the covalent triazine framework CTF-1 using 1,4&#8197;Dicyanobenzene. Material characterization confirms its porous (650&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and crystalline nature. Adjusting the induced mechanical energy allows control over the obtained stacking conformation of the resulting CTFs - from a staggered AB arrangement to an eclipsed AA stacking conformation. Finally, a substrate scope demonstrates the versatility of this approach, successfully yielding various CTFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Indium Tin Oxide Induced Internal Positive Feedback and Indium Ion Transport in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

The interaction between perovskite decomposition products and indium tin oxide substrate triggers positive feedback cycle and deteriorates the stability of perovskite solar cell.







Abstract
Stability is the most pressing challenge hindering the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and previous efforts focused more on enhancing the resistance of PSCs to external stimulus. Here, we found that the indium tin oxide (ITO) will deteriorate the photovoltaic performance of PSCs through positive feedback cycles. Specifically, the perovskite degradation products will cross the electron transport layer to chemically etch the electrode ITO to generate In3+, which will migrate upwards into the perovskite film. Then, the reaction that corrodes ITO consumes the decomposition products of perovskite and shifts the balance of the perovskite decomposition reaction, further promoting the degradation and thus falling into a positive feedback cycle. Moreover, the In3+ in the perovskite film was found to accumulate at the upper surface, which would lead to n&#8208;type doping of perovskite film to form the energy barrier for interface carrier extraction. Subsequently, the chelating molecule ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA&#8208;2Na) was introduced onto ITO to firmly chelate the In3+ and prevent it from migrating upward, thus breaking this internal positive feedback cycle and significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of PSCs. This work provides new perspectives for understanding the mechanism of photovoltaic performance loss and ionic transport in PSCs.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Ortho/Ipso C&#8722;H Difunctionalizations of Arenes using Thianthrene as a Leaving Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the development of a &#8220;C&#8722;H thianthrenation/Catellani&#8221; strategy, the regioselective C&#8722;H difunctionalization of various non&#8208;prefunctionalized arenes was successfully achieved. Starting from thianthrenium salts and using a commercially available norbornene, this approach will further open the chemical space of late&#8208;stage functionalization.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective ortho/ipso C&#8722;H difunctionalizations of aromatic compounds were designed to afford polyfunctionalized arenes including challenging 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted ones (62&#8197;examples, up to 97&#8201;% yields). To ensure the excellent regioselectivity of the process while keeping high efficiency, an original strategy based on a &#8220;C&#8722;H thianthenation/Catellani&#8208;type reaction&#8221; sequence was developed starting from simple arenes. Non&#8208;prefunctionalized arenes were first regioselectively converted into the corresponding thianthrenium salts. Then, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, norbornene (NBE)&#8208;mediated process allowed the synthesis of ipso&#8208;olefinated/ortho&#8208;alkylated polyfunctionalized arenes using a thianthrene as a leaving group (revisited Catellani reaction). Pleasingly, using a commercially available norbornene (NBE) and a unique catalytic system, synthetic challenges known for the Catellani reaction with aryl iodides were smoothly and successfully tackled with the &#8220;thianthrenium&#8221; approach. The protocol was robust (gram&#8208;scale reaction) and was widely applied to the two&#8208;fold functionalization of various arenes including bio&#8208;active compounds. Moreover, a panel of olefins and alkyl halides as coupling partners was suitable. Pleasingly, the &#8220;thianthrenium&#8221; strategy was successfully further applied to the incorporation of other groups at the ipso (CN/alkyl/H, aryl) and ortho (alkyl, aryl, amine, thiol) positions, showcasing the generality of the process.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Switchable Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Photodetector with High Operational Stability Using Self&#8208;Trapped Cs3Cu2I5 Interfacial Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystals transport layer has been embedded in photodiode structures to simultaneously realize bias&#8208;switchable organic photodetectors exhibiting photovoltaic (0&#8197;V) and photomultiplication operating modes (1&#8197;V) with fast response speed, remarkable stability and broad to different organic systems, indicating a versatile strategy for future integrated organic optoelectronic scenarios.







Abstract
Conventional photovoltaic (PV)&#8208;photodetectors are hard to detect fainted signals, while photomultiplication (PM)&#8208;capable devices indispensable for detecting weak light and are prone to degrade under strong light illumination and large bias, and it is urgent to realize highly efficient integrated detecting system with both PM and PV operation modes. In this work, one lead&#8208;free Cs3Cu2I5 nanocrystals with self&#8208;trapping exciton nature was introduced as interfacial layer adjacent to bulk and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer heterojunction structure, and corresponding organic photodetectors with bias&#8208;switchable dual modes are demonstrated. The fabricated device exhibits low operating bias (0&#8197;V for PV mode and 0.8&#8197;V for PM mode), high specific detectivity (~1013&#8197;Jones), fast response speed as low as 1.59&#8197;&#956;s, large bandwidth over 0.2&#8197;MHz and long&#8208;term operational stability last for 4&#8197;months in ambient condition. This synergy strategy also validated in different materials and device architectures, providing a convenient and scalable production process to develop highly efficient bias&#8208;switchable multi&#8208;functional organic optoelectrical applications.

         <title>Cyclic Azahelicene Dimers Showing Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Selective Fluoride Recognition</title>

         <dc:description>
Aza[7]helicenes or closed&#8208;aza[7]helicenes with (1R)&#8208;menthyl substituents were selectively synthesized, and the diastereomeric pairs were successively separated by silica gel column chromatography. The optically pure helicenes were further transformed into the corresponding cyclic dimers which showed bright circularly polarized luminescence and selective recognition of a fluoride anion.







Abstract
Although helicenes are promising molecules, the synthetic difficulty and tediousness have often been problems, and only small amounts of optically pure helicenes have been obtained by using chiral HPLC in most cases. Herein, aza[7]helicenes or closed&#8208;aza[7]helicenes with (1R)&#8208;menthyl substituents were selectively synthesized via the intramolecular Scholl reaction, and the diastereomeric pairs were separated by silica gel column chromatography. The optically pure helicenes were further transformed into the corresponding cyclic dimers, and the chiroptical properties were investigated. The rigid &#960;&#8208;frameworks of the dimers led to the high molar extinction coefficients and fluorescence quantum yields, while the twisted helicene moieties induced clear Cotton effects and CPL in the visible region, and the high CPL brightness (BCPL) was achieved. Furthermore, the cyclic dimers were found to have the macrocyclic cavity with the two NH groups suitable for the selective binding of a fluoride anion, which induced significantly redshifted fluorescence and CPL in the red region.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of quinoline&#8208;based benzophosphole oxides from ortho&#8208;alkynylated aromatic phosphine oxides and aryl isonitriles is presented. These &#960;&#8208;extended benzophosphole oxides exhibit interesting photophysical and electrochemical properties.







Abstract
Herein, we present a radical cascade addition cyclization sequence to access quinoline&#8208;based benzophosphole oxides from ortho&#8208;alkynylated aromatic phosphine oxides using various aryl isonitriles as radical acceptors and inexpensive tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;hydroperoxide (TBHP) as a terminal oxidant in the presence of a catalytic amount of silver acetate. Alternatively, the same cascade can be realized through a sustainable photochemical approach utilizing 1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as an organic photocatalyst at room temperature. The introduced modular approach shows broad functional group tolerance and offers straightforward access to complex P,N&#8208;containing polyheterocyclic arenes. These novel &#960;&#8208;extended benzophosphole oxides exhibit interesting photophysical and electrochemical properties such as absorption in the visible region, emission and reversible reduction at low potentials, which makes them promising for potential materials science applications. The photophysical properties can further be tuned by the addition of external Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids.

Three new donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type interfacial dipole molecules are designed by incorporating hole transporting and different anchoring groups, which contributing to energy&#8208;level alignment, improved charge extraction and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination at the perovskite interface. TPA&#8208;BAM&#8208;treated PSCs achieve a champion efficiency of 25.29&#8201;% with the enhanced voltage of 1.174&#8197;V and fill factor of 84.34&#8201;%, while also demonstrating improved stability.







Abstract
Interfacial engineering of perovskite films has been the main strategies in improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, three new donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A)&#8208;type interfacial dipole (DAID) molecules with hole&#8208;transporting and different anchoring units are designed and employed in PSCs. The formation of interface dipoles by the DAID molecules on the perovskite film can efficiently modulate the energy level alignment, improve charge extraction, and reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination. Among the three DAID molecules, TPA&#8208;BAM with amide group exhibits the best chemical and optoelectrical properties, achieving a champion PCE of 25.29&#8201;% with the enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.174&#8197;V and fill factor of 84.34&#8201;%, due to the reduced defect density and improved interfacial hole extraction. Meanwhile, the operational stability of the unencapsulated device has been significantly improved. Our study provides a prospect for rationalized screening of interfacial dipole materials for efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Using Metastable Zirconium Suboxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The suboxide zirconium (Zr3O) formed at the Zr&#8722;ZrO2 interface serves as an exceptional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), demonstrating remarkable durability lasting up to 50&#8197;days in Zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) devices, highlighting the potential of metastable phases in advancing the development of advanced electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Strategies for discovery of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts are important to advance clean energy technologies. Metastable phases such as low temperature or interfacial structures that are difficult to access in bulk may offer such catalytically active surfaces. We report here that the suboxide Zr3O, which is formed at Zr&#8722;ZrO2 interfaces but does not appear in the experimental Zr&#8722;O phase diagram exhibits outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance surpassing that of benchmark Pt/C and most transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Addition of Fe3C nanoparticles to give a Zr&#8722;Zr3O&#8722;Fe3C/NC catalyst (NC=nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon) gives a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.914&#8197;V, outperforming Pt/C and showing only a 3&#8197;mV decrease after 20,000 electrochemical cycles. A zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) using this cathode material has a high power density of 241.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remains stable for over 50&#8197;days of continuous cycling, demonstrating potential for practical applications. Zr3O demonstrates that interfacial or other phases that are difficult to stabilize may offer new directions for the discovery of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Grafted Single&#8208;Atomic Pt&#8722;Nx Complex with a Precisely Regulating Coordination Sphere for Efficient Electron Acceptor&#8208;Inducing Interfacial Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely regulating over the first coordination sphere of Pt SAs through the strategy of external ligand grafting on MOFs, the electron density and steric factor of Pt(II) centers thereby were achieved accurate modulation. In addition, the incorporation of Pt(bpy)Cl2 as an electron acceptor induced the efficient interface migration of photoinduced electrons, relizing a 225&#8208;times improvement of photocatalytic HER activity.







Abstract
Based on the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the Pt(bpy)Cl2 molecule, a simple post&#8208;modification amide reaction was firstly used to graft it onto the surface of NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, which performed as a highly efficient electron acceptor that induced the conversion of the photoinduced charge migration pathway from internal BDC&#8594;TiOx migration to external BDC&#8594;PtNx migration, significantly improving the efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer and separation. Furthermore, precisely regulating over the first coordination sphere of Pt single atoms was achieved using further post&#8208;modification with additional bipyridine to investigate the effect of Pt&#8722;Nx coordination numbers on reaction activity. The as&#8208;synthesized NML&#8208;PtN2 exhibited superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of 7.608&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, a remarkable improvement of 225 and 2.26&#8197;times compared to pristine NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and NML&#8208;PtN4, respectively. In addition, the superior apparent quantum yield of 4.01&#8201;% (390&#8197;nm) and turnover frequency of 190.3&#8197;h&#8722;1 (0.78&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt SA; 129&#8197;times compared to Pt nanoparticles/NML) revealed the high solar utilization efficiency and hydrogen evolution activity of the material. And macroscopic color changes caused by the transition of carrier migration paths was first observed. It holds profound significance for the design of MOF&#8208;Molecule catalysts with efficient charge carrier separation and precise regulation of single&#8208;atom coordination sphere.

By introducing DFA additive into perovskite solution and interacting with DMSO, DTE and DA products were obtained. The strong bonding DTE&#8901;PbI2 and DA&#8901;PbI2 retard perovskite crystallization process for high&#8208;quality and low defects perovskite film. Finally, a champion PCE of 25.28&#8201;% was achieved with excellent environmental stability, which retained 95.75&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 1152&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C under 25&#8201;% RH.







Abstract
It is a crucial role for enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite films, which can be achieved by delaying the crystallization of perovskite film. Hence, we designed difluoroacetic anhydride (DFA) as an additive to regulating crystallization process thus reducing defect formation during perovskite film formation. It was found DFA reacts with DMSO by forming two molecules, difluoroacetate thioether ester (DTE) and difluoroacetic acid (DA). The strong bonding DTE&#8901;PbI2 and DA&#8901;PbI2 retard perovskite crystallization process for high&#8208;quality film formation, which was monitored through in situ UV/Vis and PL tests. By using DFA additives, we prepared perovskite films with high&#8208;quality and low defects. Finally, a champion PCE of 25.28&#8201;% was achieved with excellent environmental stability, which retained 95.75&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 1152&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C under 25&#8201;% RH.

         <title>Local Self&#8208;Assembly of Dissipative Structures Sustained by Substrate Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injection of surfactant molecules in a substrate&#8208;containing hydrogel results in the local substrate&#8208;templated formation of assemblies, which are catalysts for the conversion of substrate into waste. We show that the system develops into a macroscopic non&#8208;equilibrium steady state (NESS) characterized by the local presence of energy&#8208;dissipating assemblies and persistent substrate and waste concentration gradients.







Abstract
The coupling between energy&#8208;consuming molecular processes and the macroscopic dimension plays an important role in nature and in the development of active matter. Here, we study the temporal evolution of a macroscopic system upon the local activation of a dissipative self&#8208;assembly process. Injection of surfactant molecules in a substrate&#8208;containing hydrogel results in the local substrate&#8208;templated formation of assemblies, which are catalysts for the conversion of substrate into waste. We show that the system develops into a macroscopic (pseudo&#8208;)non&#8208;equilibrium steady state (NESS) characterized by the local presence of energy&#8208;dissipating assemblies and persistent substrate and waste concentration gradients. For elevated substrate concentrations, this state can be maintained for more than 4&#8197;days. The studies reveal an interdependence between the dissipative assemblies and the concentration gradients: catalytic activity by the assemblies results in sustained concentration gradients and, vice versa, continuous diffusion of substrate to the assemblies stabilizes their size. The possibility to activate dissipative processes with spatial control and create long lasting non&#8208;equilibrium steady states enables dissipative structures to be studied in the space&#8208;time domain, which is of relevance for understanding biological systems and for the development of active matter.

         <title>Bridging Nickel&#8208;MOF and Copper Single Atoms/Clusters with H&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne for the Tandem Catalysis of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Few&#8208;layered H&#8208;substituted graphdiyne bridges ultrathin Ni&#8208;MOF nanosheets and Cu single atoms/clusters to construct a tandem electrocatalyst for enhanced nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia transformation. The synergistic effect between Ni2+ and Cu is revealed to optimize the reaction path, resulting in a high efficiency over a wide potential window.







Abstract
Interfacial engineering of synergistic catalysts is one of the keys to achieving multiple proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes in nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. Herein, by joining ultrathin nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (denoted Ni&#8208;MOF) nanosheets with few&#8208;layered hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne&#8208;supported copper single atoms and clusters (denoted HsGDY@Cu), a tandem catalyst of Ni&#8208;MOFs@HsGDY@Cu with dual&#8208;active interfaces was developed for the concerted catalysis of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia. In such a system, the sandwiched HsGDY layer could serve as a bridge to connect the coordinated unsaturated Ni2+ sites with Cu single atoms/clusters in a limited range of 0 to 3.6&#8197;nm. From Ni2+ to Cu, via the hydrogen spillover process, the hydrogen radicals (H&#8901;) generated at the unsaturated Ni2+ sites could migrate across HsGDY to the Cu sites to participate in the transformation of *HNO3 to NH3. From Cu to Ni2+, bypassing the higher reaction energy for *HNO3 formation on the Ni2+ sites, the NO2&#8722; detached from the Cu sites could diffuse onto the unsaturated Ni2+ sites to form NH3 as well. The combined results make this hybrid a tandem catalyst with dual active sites for the catalysis of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion with improved Faradaic efficiency at lower overpotentials.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembled Active and Stable Ir@MnOx/La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.9Ir0.1O3&#8722;&#948; Interfaces for CO2 Electrolysis</title>

         <dc:description>
The internal B&#8208;site supplement of Mn ions via topotactic exchange and external protective barrier of MnOx shell via redispersion in reduction atmosphere facilitate the formation of Ir@MnOx/La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.9Ir0.1O3&#8722;&#948; interfaces and enhance their structural stability, achieving improved activity and durability for CO2 electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells.







Abstract
Solid oxide electrolysis cells are prospective approaches for CO2 utilization but face significant challenges due to the sluggish reaction kinetics and poor stability of the fuel electrodes. Herein, we strategically addressed the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off phenomenon between enhanced exsolution and improved structural stability via topotactic ion exchange. The surface dynamic reconstruction of the MnOx/La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.9Ir0.1O3&#8722;&#948; (LSCIr) catalyst was visualized at the atomic scale. Compared with the Ir@LSCIr interface, the in situ self&#8208;assembled Ir@MnOx/LSCIr interface exhibited greater CO2 activation and easily removable carbonate intermediates, thus reached a 42&#8201;% improvement in CO2 electrolysis performance at 1.6&#8197;V. Furthermore, an improved CO2 electrolysis stability was achieved due to the uniformly wrapped MnOx shell of the Ir@MnOx/LSCIr cathode. Our approach enables a detailed understanding of the dynamic microstructure evolution at active interfaces and provides a roadmap for the rational design and evaluation of efficient metal/oxide catalysts for CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Tuning Ion Mobility in Lithium Argyrodite Solid Electrolytes via Entropy Engineering</title>

Configurational entropy in the cation sublattice, induced by complex substitution, shows a direct correlation with Li+ mobility in superionic lithium argyrodite solid electrolytes.







Abstract
The development of improved solid electrolytes (SEs) plays a crucial role in the advancement of bulk&#8208;type solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) technologies. In recent years, multicomponent or high&#8208;entropy SEs are gaining increased attention for their advantageous charge&#8208;transport and (electro)chemical properties.

&lt;p&gt;Configurational entropy in the cation sublattice, induced by complex substitution, shows a direct correlation with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mobility in superionic lithium argyrodite solid electrolytes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of improved solid electrolytes (SEs) plays a crucial role in the advancement of bulk-type solid-state battery (SSB) technologies. In recent years, multicomponent or high-entropy SEs are gaining increased attention for their advantageous charge-transport and (electro)chemical properties. However, a comprehensive understanding of how configurational entropy affects ionic conductivity is largely lacking. Herein we investigate a series of multication-substituted lithium argyrodites with the general formula Li&lt;sub&gt;6+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;[M1&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;/sub&gt;M3&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;M4&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Surface Coordination Modulated Morphological Anisotropic Engineering of Iron&#8208;Benzoquinone Frameworks for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

Modulation of the surface coordination of carbon for morphological engineering of Fe&#8208;THBQ is realized, the morphology of which evolves from thermodynamically favored truncated cube to cuboctahedron depending on the content of O&#8208;containing functional groups on carbon substrate. It exhibits facet&#8208;dependent performance for lithium storage.







Abstract
Morphological anisotropic engineering is powerful to synthesize metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with versatile physicochemical properties for diverse applications ranging from gas storage/separation to electrocatalysis and batteries, etc. Herein, we developed a carbon substrate guided strategy to manipulate the facet&#8208;dependent coordination for morphology engineering of Fe&#8208;THBQ (tetrahydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone) frameworks, which is built with cubic Fe octamer bridged by two parallel THBQ ligands along three orthogonal axes, extending to a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) framework with pcu&#8208;e network topology. The electronegative O&#8208;containing functional groups on carbon surfaces compete with THBQ linkers to selectively interact with the unsaturated coordinated Fe cations on the {111} facets and inhibit crystal growth along the &lt;111&gt; direction. The morphology of Fe&#8208;THBQ evolves from thermodynamically favored truncated cube to cuboctahedron depending on the content of O&#8208;containing functional groups on the carbon substrate. The Fe&#8208;THBQ with varied morphologies exhibits facet&#8208;dependent performances for electrochemical lithium storage. This work will shed light on the morphology modulation of MOFs for promising applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Formation of Charge Transfer Trions at Molecular&#8208;Functionalized 2D MoS2 Interfaces</title>

         <dc:description>
Trion dynamics at an organometallic molecule/monolayer molybdenum disulfide (ML&#8722;MoS2) is investigated via transient electronic sum frequency generation (tr&#8208;ESFG) spectroscopy. We observed an ultrafast hole transfer, followed by the formation of charge&#8208;transfer trions.







Abstract
In this work, we investigate trion dynamics occurring at the heterojunction between organometallic molecules and a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) with transient electronic sum frequency generation (tr&#8208;ESFG) spectroscopy. By pumping at 2.4&#8197;eV with laser pulses, we have observed an ultrafast hole transfer, succeeded by the emergence of charge&#8208;transfer trions. This observation is facilitated by the cancellation of ground state bleach and stimulated emission signals due to their opposite phases, making tr&#8208;ESFG especially sensitive to the trion formation dynamics. The presence of charge&#8208;transfer trion at molecular functionalized TMD monolayers suggests the potential for engineering the local electronic structures and dynamics of specific locations on TMDs and offers a potential for transferring unique electronic attributes of TMD to the molecular layers.

         <title>Direct &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acid Loading onto a Bacterial Thiotemplate Assembly Line via a Multienzyme Gateway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular warhead for the virulence factor malleicyprol derives from trigonic acid, a cyclopropanol&#8208;substituted hydroxy acid. Its incorporation involves an incomplete nonribosomal peptide synthetase module and two trans&#8208;acting enzymes, an adenylation&#8208;thiolation didomain enzyme and an FkbH&#8208;like enzyme for translocation. The mechanism for the direct loading of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids may inspire synthetic biology and antivirulence approaches.







Abstract
Various nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) create structural and functional diversity by incorporating &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids into peptide backbones. Trigonic acid, an unusual cyclopropanol&#8208;substituted hydroxy acid, is the source of the molecular warhead of malleicyprol, a critical virulence factor of human and animal pathogens of the Burkholderia pseudomallei (BP) group. The process of selecting and loading this building block remained enigmatic as the NRPS module designated for this task is incomplete. Using a combination of bioinformatics, mutational analyses, targeted metabolomics, and in vitro biochemical assays, we show that two trans&#8208;acting enzymes are required to load this central building block onto the modular assembly line. An adenylation&#8208;thiolation didomain enzyme (BurJ) activates trigonic acid, followed by the translocation of the enzyme&#8208;bound &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid thioester by an FkbH&#8208;like protein with a mutated phosphatase domain (BurH). This specialized gateway is the first reported direct loading of an &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid onto a bona fide NRPS module in bacteria and expands the synthetic biology toolbox for the site&#8208;specific incorporation of non&#8208;canonical building blocks. Moreover, insight into the biochemical basis of virulence factor biosynthesis can provide a foundation for developing enzyme inhibitors as anti&#8208;virulence therapeutics against BP pathogen infections.

         <title>Electric Double Layer Regulator Design through a Functional Group Assembly Strategy towards Long&#8208;Lasting Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric double layer regulator, N, N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonamide (IS), is rationally designed by a functional group assembly strategy. The high adsorption ability of the imidazole group in IS with zinc anode facilitates the formation of an IS molecular layer to suppress side reactions. Meanwhile, the high binding capability of sulfone group in IS with Zn2+ promotes the de&#8208;solvation of Zn2+ to achieve uniform zinc deposition.







Abstract
Regulating the electric double layer (EDL) structure of the zinc metal anode by using electrolyte additives is an efficient way to suppress interface side reactions and facilitate uniform zinc deposition. Nevertheless, there are no reports investigating the proactive design of EDL&#8208;regulating additives before the start of experiments. Herein, a functional group assembly strategy is proposed to design electrolyte additives for modulating the EDL, thereby realizing a long&#8208;lasting zinc metal anode. Specifically, by screening ten common functional groups, N, N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonamide (IS) is designed by assembling an imidazole group, characterized by its high adsorption capability on the zinc anode, and a sulfone group, which exhibits strong binding with Zn2+ ions. Benefiting from the adsorption functionalization of the imidazole group, the IS molecules occupy the position of H2O in the inner Helmholtz layer of the EDL, forming a molecular protective layer to inhibit H2O&#8208;induced side reactions. Meanwhile, the sulfone group in IS, acting as a binding site to Zn2+, promotes the de&#8208;solvation of Zn2+ ions, facilitating compact zinc deposition. Consequently, the utilization of IS significantly extending the cycling stability of Zn||Zn and Zn||NaV3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O full cell. This study offers an innovative approach to the design of EDL regulators for high&#8208;performance zinc metal batteries.

Consequently, the utilization of IS significantly extending the cycling stability of Zn||Zn and Zn||NaV&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O full cell. This study offers an innovative approach to the design of EDL regulators for high-performance zinc metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric 1,2&#8208;Migration at Vicinal Tetrasubstituted Stereocenters Constructed from &#945;&#8208;Keto Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselective allylation of &#945;&#8208;keto imines generated enantiopure &#945;&#8208;hydroxy imines possessing synthetically challenging vicinal tetrasubstituted stereocenters. The electrophilicity of the imine and steric effects promoted a face&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;allyl migration in the presence of Lewis acidic boronic acids, yielding chiral &#945;&#8208;amino ketones with excellent diastereoselectivity. This method was applied to the total synthesis of hapalindole alkaloids.







Abstract
A carbonyl&#8208;assisted asymmetric 1,2&#8208;migratory allylation through in situ generation of vicinal tetrasubstituted stereocenters is reported to access enantiopure &#945;&#8208;amino ketones and amino alcohols with excellent yields and diastereoselectivities. In a remarkable divergence, despite higher steric hindrance, the allylation exclusively occurs on ketones over imines in the first step, followed by a face&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;allyl transfer, thus highlighting an exciting interplay between two distinct electrophiles. The methodology distinguishes itself through its adaptability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, showcasing broad functional&#8208;group tolerance and stereodivergence. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis led to a deeper understanding of its selectivity and mechanistic framework. Highlighting its transformative potential, the method was applied to the total synthesis of hapalindole alkaloids.

         <title>Strong and Tough MXene Bridging&#8208;induced Conductive Nacre</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the need to reduce global carbon emissions, it remains a great challenge to prepare nacre&#8208;inspired composites using more economical and environmentally friendly building blocks. We fabricated tough and conductive nacre composites through reassembling aragonite platelets with bridging by MXene nanosheets and hydrogen bonding, not only providing high mechanical properties but also excellent electrical conductivity. The resultant conductive nacre also provides a self&#8208;monitoring function for structural damage and offers exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding performance.







Abstract
Nacre is a classic model, providing an inspiration for fabricating high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites with the two&#8208;dimensional platelets. However, the &#8220;brick&#8221; of nacre, aragonite platelet, is an ideal building block for making high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites. Herein, we demonstrated a strong and tough conductive nacre through reassembling aragonite platelets with bridged by MXene nanosheets and hydrogen bonding, not only providing high mechanical properties but also excellent electrical conductivity. The flexural strength and fracture toughness of the obtained conductive nacre reach ~282&#8197;MPa and ~6.3&#8197;MPa&#8201;m1/2, which is 1.6 and 1.6&#8197;times higher than that of natural nacre, respectively. These properties are attributed to densification and high orientation degree of the conductive nacre, which is effectively induced by the combined interactions of hydrogen bonding and MXene nanosheets bridging. The crack propagations in conductive nacre are effectively inhibited through crack deflection with hydrogen bonding, and MXene nanosheets bridging between aragonite platelets. In addition, our conductive nacre also provides a self&#8208;monitoring function for structural damage and offers exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding performance. Our strategy of reassembling the aragonite platelets exfoliated from waste nacre into high&#8208;performance artificial nacre, provides an avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites through the sustainable reutilization of shell resources.

         <title>ON&#8211;OFF Control of Marangoni Self&#8208;propulsion via A Supra&#8208;amphiphile Fuel and Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a concept of &#8216;supra&#8208;amphiphile fuel and switch&#8217; to realize ON&#8211;OFF control of Marangoni self&#8208;propulsion of miniaturized devices. The supra&#8208;amphiphile shows two competitive processes on water surface: adsorption and hydrolysis, whose competence is pH&#8208;responsive. They have comparable rates under neutral conditions to prolong the motion by 50&#8208;fold; when changing to acid, motion stop is realized owing to faster hydrolysis than adsorption.







Abstract
Marangoni self&#8208;propulsion refers to motion of liquid or solid driven by a surface tension gradient, and has applications in soft robots/devices, cargo delivery, self&#8208;assembly etc. However, two problems remain to be addressed for motion control (e.g., ON&#8211;OFF) with conventional surfactants as Marangoni fuel: (1)&#8197;limited motion lifetime due to saturated interfacial adsorption of surfactants; (2)&#8197;in&#8208; situ motion stop is difficult once Marangoni flows are triggered. Instead of covalent surfactants, supra&#8208;amphiphiles with hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts linked noncovalently, hold promise to solve these problems owing to its dynamic and reversible surface activity responsively. Here, we propose a new concept of &#8216;supra&#8208;amphiphile fuel and switch&#8217; based on the facile synthesis of disodium&#8208;4&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedisulfonate (DABS) linked by a Schiff base, which has amphiphilicity for self&#8208;propulsion, hydrolyzes timely to avoid saturated adsorption, and provides pH&#8208;responsive control over ON&#8208;OFF motion. The self&#8208;propulsion lifetime is extended by 50&#8208;fold with DABS and motion control is achieved. The mechanism is revealed with coupled interface chemistry involving two competitive processes of interfacial adsorption and hydrolysis of DABS based on both experiments and simulation. The concept of &#8216;supra&#8208;amphiphile fuel and switch&#8217; provides an active solution to prolong and control Marangoni self&#8208;propulsive devices for the advance of intelligent material systems.

         <title>Stepwise Protonation of Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhancing Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of imine&#8208;linked 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs were constructed and modified through a stepwise protonation of imine and porphyrin sites. Both benzo&#8208;selenadiazole functional groups and dual protonation increase the visible light absorption and charge separation, synergistically promoting the photocatalytic H2O2 production.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs), recognized for their tailorable structures and accessible active sites, offer a promising platform for developing advanced photocatalysts. However, the difficulty in the synthesis and functionalization of 3D COFs hinders their further development. In this study, we present a series of 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs with 8 connected porphyrin units linked by linear linkers through imine bonds as a versatile platform for photocatalyst design. The photoresponse of 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs was initially modulated by functionalizing linear linkers with benzo&#8208;thiadiazole or benzo&#8208;selenadiazole groups. Furthermore, taking advantage of the well&#8208;exposed porphyrin and imine sites in 3D&#8208;bcu&#8208;COFs, their photocatalytic activity was optimized by stepwise protonation of imine bonds and porphyrin centers. The dual protonated COF with benzo&#8208;selenadiazole groups exhibited enhanced charge separation, leading to an increased photocatalytic H2O2 production under visible light. This enhancement demonstrates the combined benefits of linker functionalization and stepwise protonation on photocatalytic efficiency.

         <title>Eosinophil&#8208;Activating Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles for Cancer Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eosinophil&#8208;activating semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNe) synergized with immune checkpoint inhibitors are developed to reinvigorate eosinophil&#8208; and T&#8197;cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, providing a new avenue for cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy.







Abstract
Eosinophils are important immune effector cells that affect T&#8197;cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity. However, the low frequency and restrained activity of eosinophils restricted the outcome of cancer immunotherapies. We herein report an eosinophil&#8208;activating semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPNe) to improve photodynamic tumor immunogenicity, modulate eosinophil chemotaxis, and reinvigorate T&#8208;cell immunity for activated cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy. SPNe comprises an amphiphilic semiconducting polymer and a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor sitagliptin via a 1O2&#8208;cleavable thioketal linker. Upon localized NIR photoirradiation, SPNe generates 1O2 to elicit immunogenic cell death of tumors and induce specific activation of sitagliptin. The subsequent inhibition of DPP4 increases intratumoral CCL11 levels to promote eosinophil chemotaxis and activation. SPNe&#8208;mediated photo&#8208;immunotherapy synergized with immune checkpoint blockade greatly promotes tumor infiltration and activation of both eosinophils and T&#8197;cells, effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, this study presents a generic polymeric nanoplatform to modulate specific immune cells for precision cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Leveraging Electron Push&#8208;Pull Effect for Catalytic Polymerization and Degradation of a Cyclobutane Monomer System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations guide to unveil the electron push&#8208;pull effect in reshaping the polymerizability of non&#8208;polymerizable cyclobutane to afford densely functionalized all&#8208;carbon main&#8208;chain polymers, as well as their degradation to afford alkene derivatives. Successful polymerization conditions consist of Lewis acid, Br&#248;nsted base, and a C(sp3)&#8208;H initiator, while degradation proceeds with catalytic amount of an acid.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) offers a striking solution to solve problems encountered in step&#8208;growth condensation polymerization, including precise control over molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and topology. This has inspired our interest in ROP of cycloalkanes with an ultimate goal to rethink polyolefins, which clearly poses a number of challenges. Practicality of ROP of cycloalkanes is actually limited by their low polymerizability and elusive mechanisms which arise from significantly varied ring size and non&#8208;polar C&#8722;C bonds in monomers. In this work, by using Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted base/C(sp3)&#8208;H initiator system previously developed in our laboratory, we focus on cyclobutanes and explore the positional and electronic effects of substituents on the ring, namely electron push&#8208;pull effect, in promoting controlled polymerization to afford densely functionalized poly(cyclobutanes), as well as catalytic degradation of obtained polymers for upcycling. More importantly, experiments and DFT calculations unveil considerable population of Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;induced thermostabilized 1,4&#8208;zwitterions, which distinguish cyclobutanes from cyclopropanes and others. All these findings would shed light on catalytic synthesis and degradation of saturated all&#8208;carbon main&#8208;chain polymers, as well as small molecule transformations of cyclobutanes.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Ortho&#8208;Donor&#8208;Modification of Boracyclic &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems beyond Steric Protection to Produce Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of a boracyclic &#960;&#8208;skeleton with only sp2 carbons and electron&#8208;donating phenothiazinyl groups resulted in a short ortho B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N distance. Owing to their donor&#8211;acceptor structures, these compounds exhibited thermally activated delayed orange&#8208;red fluorescence when doped into thin films. In organic light emitting diodes, a bis&#8208;ortho&#8208;donor&#8208;substituted derivative exhibited better performance than the corresponding mono&#8208;substituted congener.







Abstract
Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds that contain tricoordinate boron atoms at their periphery represent an attractive class of materials with electron&#8208;accepting character. Their molecular design generally requires the introduction of a bulky aryl group onto the boron atom, where it provides predominantly kinetic stabilization. The addition of extra functionality to the aryl group on the boron atom can be expected to further expand the potential utility of this class of materials. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of boracyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules with firm ortho B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N nonbonding interactions by introducing N&#8208;containing electron&#8208;donors at the ortho&#8208;positions of the aryl group on the boron atom. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the combination of a planar boracyclic &#960;&#8208;skeleton with only sp2 carbons and a strong electron&#8208;donating phenothiazine moiety results in a particularly short B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N distance. Theoretical study provided insights into the inherent nature of the B&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N interaction. Owing to their donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structures, these molecules exhibit substantially red&#8208;shifted fluorescence in solution, albeit that the fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) are low. In contrast, when incorporated into films, these compounds exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with improved &#934;F values. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) fabricated using the ortho&#8208;donor&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibit orange&#8208;red electroluminescence.

Developing synthetic polymer&#8208;DNA molecular chimeras provides new opportunities for material development. Herein, we demonstrate that the micellar nanostructures self&#8208;assembled from polymer&#8208;DNA chimeras can efficiently, straightforwardly, and bio&#8208;compatibly co&#8208;deliver siRNA and organic photosensitizers, resulting in significantly enhanced gene/photodynamic synergistic anti&#8208;tumor efficacy.







Abstract
Photochemical internalization is an efficient strategy relying on photodynamic reactions to promote siRNA endosomal escape for the success of RNA&#8208;interference gene regulation, which makes gene&#8208;photodynamic combined therapy highly synergistic and efficient. However, it is still desired to explore capable carriers to improve the delivery efficiency of the immiscible siRNA and organic photosensitizers simultaneously. Herein, we employ a micellar nanostructure (PSNA) self&#8208;assembled from polymer&#8208;DNA molecular chimeras to fulfill this task. PSNA can plentifully load photosensitizers in its hydrophobic core simply by the nanoprecipitation method. Moreover, it can organize siRNA self&#8208;assembly by the densely packed DNA shell, which leads to a higher loading capacity than the typical electrostatic condensation method. The experimental results prove that this PSNA carrier can greatly facilitate siRNA escape from the endosome/lysosome and enhance transfection. Accordingly, the PSNA&#8208;administrated therapy exhibits a significantly improved anti&#8208;tumor efficacy owing to the highly efficient co&#8208;delivery capability.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Carbon Nanoneedle Electrodes for Dopamine Detection in Drosophila</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoelectrodes were generated by a new 3D printing process that utilize pulling force of a bridge between two blocks. We optimized the block size, bridge length, and bridge diameter to maximize shrinkage and make smaller electrodes. These nanoneedle electrodes have long, straight, and thin tips, which enable dopamine detection in Drosophila larvae ventral nerve cord (VNC).

In vivo electrochemistry in small brain regions or synapses requires nanoelectrodes with long straight tips for submicron scale measurements. Nanoelectrodes can be fabricated using a Nanoscribe two&#8208;photon printer, but annealed tips curl if they are long and thin. We propose a new pulling&#8208;force strategy to fabricate a straight carbon nanoneedle structure. A micron&#8208;width bridge is printed between two blocks. The annealed structure shrinks during pyrolysis, and the blocks create a pulling force to form a long, thin, and straight carbon bridge. Parameterization study and COMSOL modeling indicate changes in the block size, bridge size and length affect the pulling force and bridge shrinkage. Electrodes were printed on niobium wires, insulated with aluminum oxide, and the bridge cut with focused ion beam (FIB) to expose the nanoneedle tip. Annealed needle diameters ranged from 400&#8197;nm to 5.25&#8197;&#956;m and length varied from 50.5&#8197;&#956;m to 146&#8197;&#956;m. The electrochemical properties are similar to glassy carbon, with good performance for dopamine detection with fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry. Nanoelectrodes enable biological applications, such as dopamine detection in a specific Drosophila brain region. Long and thin nanoneedles are generally useful for other applications such as cellular sensing, drug delivery, or gas sensing.

&lt;p&gt;Nanoelectrodes were generated by a new 3D printing process that utilize pulling force of a bridge between two blocks. We optimized the block size, bridge length, and bridge diameter to maximize shrinkage and make smaller electrodes. These nanoneedle electrodes have long, straight, and thin tips, which enable dopamine detection in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae ventral nerve cord (VNC).

         <title>Sono&#8208;Triggered Cascade Lactate Depletion by Semiconducting Polymer Nanoreactors for Cuproptosis&#8208;Immunotherapy of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymer nanoreactor is developed to achieve sono&#8208;triggered cascade lactate depletion for cuproptosis&#8208;immunotherapy. Upon ultrasound irradiation, this nanoreactor generates singlet oxygen to allow lactate oxidase release, leading to lactate depletion and hydrogen peroxide generation for promoting cuproptosis. This therapeutic strategy can observably restrict the growth of subcutaneous and deep&#8208;tissue orthotopic pancreatic cancer.







Abstract
The high level of lactate in tumor microenvironment not only promotes tumor development and metastasis, but also induces immune escape, which often leads to failures of various tumor therapy strategies. We here report a sono&#8208;triggered cascade lactate depletion strategy by using semiconducting polymer nanoreactors (SPNLCu) for cancer cuproptosis&#8208;immunotherapy. The SPNLCu mainly contain a semiconducting polymer as sonosensitizer, lactate oxidase (LOx) conjugated via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;cleavable linker and chelated Cu2+. Upon ultrasound (US) irradiation, the semiconducting polymer generates singlet oxygen (1O2) to cut ROS&#8208;cleavable linker to allow the release of LOx that catalyzes lactate depletion to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The Cu2+ will be reduced to Cu+ in tumor microenvironment, which reacts with the produced H2O2 to obtain hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) that further improves LOx release via destroying ROS&#8208;cleavable linkers. As such, sono&#8208;triggered cascade release of LOx achieves effective lactate depletion, thus relieving immunosuppressive roles of lactate. Moreover, the toxic Cu+ induces cuproptosis to cause immunogenic cell death (ICD) for activating antitumor immunological effect. SPNLCu are used to treat both subcutaneous and deep&#8208;tissue orthotopic pancreatic cancer with observably enhanced efficacy in restricting the tumor growths. This study thus provides a precise and effective lactate depletion tactic for cancer therapy.

         <title>Ligand Isomerization Driven Electrocatalytic Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand geometry can direct the reactivity and selectivity of dioxygen cleavage in molecular electrocatalysis. It is shown that even on exclusively peroxide&#8208;producing catalytic sites, the dioxygen binding modes can be precisely controlled via a seemingly minor change in ligand isomerization, with their activity almost equaling that of Pt in an actual H2&#8722;O2 fuel cell.







Abstract
The prevailing view about molecular catalysts is that the central metal ion is responsible for the reaction mechanism and selectivity, whereas the ligands mainly affect the reaction kinetics. Here, we question this paradigm and show that ligands have a dramatic influence on the selectivity of the product. We show how even a seemingly small change in ligand isomerization sharply alters the selectivity of the well&#8208;researched oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) Co phthalocyanine catalyst from an indirect 2e&#8722; to a direct 4e&#8722; pathway. Detailed analysis reveals that intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions in the ligand activate the catalytic Co, directing the oxygen binding and thus deciding the final product. The resulting catalyst is the first example of a Co&#8208;based molecular catalyst catalyzing a direct 4e&#8722; ORR via ligand isomerization, for which it shows an activity close to the benchmark Pt in an actual H2&#8722;O2 fuel cell. The effect of the ligand isomerism is demonstrated with different central metal ions, thus highlighting the generalizability of the findings and their potential to open new possibilities in the design of molecular catalysts.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Effect&#8208;Enabled Photocatalytic 4&#8208;Exo&#8208;Trig Cyclization Cascade to Access Fluoroalkylated Cyclobutanes</title>

         <dc:description>
A regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing fluoroalkylcyclobutanes is realized by photocatalytic 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade of thioalkynes or trifluoromethylalkenes. DFT calculations suggest that a fluorine effect, resulting from hyperconjugative &#960;&#8594;&#963;*C&#8208;F interactions, accounts for the &#945;&#8208;selective radical addition at the sterically hindered alkene carbon, which facilitates the uncommon 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closure.







Abstract
Cyclobutanes are popular structural units in bioactive compounds and versatile intermediates in synthetic chemistry, but their synthesis is challenging owing to high ring strain. In this study, a novel method for highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective synthesis of fluoroalkylcyclobutanes bearing vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters is realized by a photocatalytic 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization cascade of thioalkynes or trifluoromethylalkenes. Density functional theory calculations reveal that a unique fluorine effect, arising from hyperconjugative &#960;&#8594;&#963;*C&#8208;F interactions, accounts for the regio&#8208;reversed radical addition at the sterically hindered alkene carbon, which facilitates an unprecedented 4&#8208;exo&#8208;trig ring closure. This chemistry enables the direct and controllable construction of medicinally valuable quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing cyclobutanes from readily available raw materials, nicely complementing the existing methods.

         <title>Synthesis of n&#8208;Propanol from CO2 Electroreduction on Bicontinuous Cu2O/Cu Nanodomains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
n&#8208;Propanol can be efficiently produced by ampere&#8208;level CO2 electroreduction by a Cu2O/Cu catalyst with bicontinuous structure. The catalyst is assembled by nanodomains (&lt;10&#8197;nm) of Cu2O and Cu and possesses numerous grain boundaries between the Cu and Cu2O phases.







Abstract
n&#8208;propanol is an important pharmaceutical and pesticide intermediate. To produce n&#8208;propanol by electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising way, but is largely restricted by the very low selectivity and activity. How to promote the coupling of *C1 and *C2 intermediates to form the *C3 intermediate for n&#8208;propanol formation is challenging. Here, we propose the construction of bicontinuous structure of Cu2O/Cu electrocatalyst, which consists of ultra&#8208;small Cu2O nanodomains, Cu nanodomains and large amounts of grain boundaries between Cu2O and Cu nanodomains. The n&#8208;propanol current density is as high as 101.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the applied potential of &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in flow cell, with the Faradaic efficiency up to 12.1&#8201;%. Moreover, the catalyst keeps relatively stable during electrochemical CO2 reduction process. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the bicontinuous structure of Cu2O/Cu can facilitate the *CO formation, *CO&#8208;*CO coupling and *CO&#8208;*OCCO coupling for the final generation of n&#8208;propanol.

To produce n-propanol by electrochemical reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a promising way, but is largely restricted by the very low selectivity and activity. How to promote the coupling of *C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and *C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates to form the *C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate for n-propanol formation is challenging. Here, we propose the construction of bicontinuous structure of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Cu electrocatalyst, which consists of ultra-small Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O nanodomains, Cu nanodomains and large amounts of grain boundaries between Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and Cu nanodomains. The n-propanol current density is as high as 101.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at the applied potential of &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in flow cell, with the Faradaic efficiency up to 12.1&#8201;%. Moreover, the catalyst keeps relatively stable during electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction process. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the bicontinuous structure of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/Cu can facilitate the *CO formation, *CO-*CO coupling and *CO-*OCCO coupling for the final generation of n-propanol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Responsive Peptide&#8208;Based Ultrathin Nanosheets Prepared by a Horizontal Monolayer Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;based ultrathin nanosheets with a thickness of ~1&#8197;nm were prepared via a hierarchical covalent physical approach and enabled by two&#8208;dimensional horizontal monolayer self&#8208;assembly. The ultrathin nanosheets can respond to various external stimuli and transform into diverse morphologies, with morphological changes in response to pH, allowing them to selectively inhibit cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
In this study, peptide&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled nanosheets with a thickness of approximately 1&#8197;nm were prepared using a hierarchical covalent physical fabrication strategy. The covalent alternating polymerization of helical peptide E3 with an azobenzene (AZO) structure yielded copolymers CoP(E3&#8208;AZO), which physically self&#8208;assembled into ultrathin nanosheets in an unanticipated two&#8208;dimensional horizontal monolayer arrangement. This special monolayer arrangement enabled the thickness of the nanosheets to be equal to the cross&#8208;sectional diameter of a single linear copolymer, which is a rare phenomenon. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the synergistic effect of multiple molecular interactions drives the self&#8208;assembly of CoP(E3&#8208;AZO) into nanosheets and that various methods, including phototreatment, pH adjustment, the addition of additives, and introduction of cosolvents, can alter the molecular interactions and modulate the self&#8208;assembly of CoP(E3&#8208;AZO), yielding diverse nanostructures. Remarkably, the ultrathin nanosheets selectively inhibited cancer cells at certain concentrations.

         <title>Ordering Bimetallic Cu&#8208;Pd Catalysts onto Orderly Mesoporous SrTiO3&#8208;Crystal Nanotubular Networks for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work resolved the inherent contradiction between the superior pore structure and crystallinity of metal oxides by developing an updated synthesis method using the electrospinning technique, effectively facilitating charge carrier transfer, photon utilization, and mass transfer in photocatalytic heterogeneous reactions. With the assistance of ordered Cu&#8722;Pd alloy, the catalysts exhibit a remarkable enhancement in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis of fuels has garnered significant attention, with SrTiO3 emerging as a potential candidate for photocatalysis due to its exceptional physicochemical properties. However, selectively converting CO2 into fuels with desired reaction products remains a grand challenge. Herein, we design an updated method via an aging strategy based on the electrospinning technique to synthesize a single&#8208;crystalline Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3 nanotubular networks with self&#8208;assembled orderly mesopores, further modified by Cu&#8722;Pd alloy. It exhibits both high crystallinity and superior cross&#8208;linked mesoporous structures, effectively facilitating charge carrier transfer, photon utilization, and mass transfer, with a remarkable enhancement from 0.025&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 to 1.090&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 in the CO production rate. Meanwhile, the ordered arrangement of Cu and Pd atoms on the (111) surface can promote the rate&#8208;determining step (*CO2 to *COOH), which is also responsible for its good activity. The presence of CuO in the reaction confers a significant advantage for CO desorption, leading to a remarkable CO selectivity of 95.54&#8201;%. This work highlights new insights into developing advanced heterogeneous photocatalysts.

Molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems offer a promising solution for solar energy storage. We present silver salts as a distinctive catalyst class capable of releasing stored energy from the promising dihydroazaborinine&#8208;based MOST system. Through mechanistic investigations and computational analysis, we gained insights into the silver&#8208;catalyzed thermal back reaction, while revealing the first crystal structure of a Dewar dihydroazaborinine.







Abstract
Molecular solar thermal systems (MOST) represent an auspicious solution for the storage of solar energy. We report silver salts as a unique class of catalysts, capable of releasing the stored energy from the promising 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine based MOST system. Mechanistic investigations provided insights into the silver catalyzed thermal backreaction, concurrently unveiling the first crystal structure of a 2&#8208;aza&#8208;3&#8208;borabicyclo[2.2.0]hex&#8208;5&#8208;ene, the Dewar isomer of 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine. Quantification of activation energies by kinetic experiments has elucidated the advantageous energy change associated with Lewis acid catalysts, a phenomenon corroborated through computational analysis. By means of low temperature NMR spectroscopy, mechanistic insights into the coordination of Ag+ to the 1,2&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine were gained.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aryl Thiazolines from 4&#8208;Hydroxybenzaldehydes Using Vanillyl Alcohol Oxidases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines from 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes and aminothiols in the presence of vanillyl alcohol oxidases (VAOs) occurred through a spontaneous condensation reaction followed by preferential enzymatic oxidation of the in situ generated C&#8722;N bond over other competing functional groups. The biocatalysts showed good substrate tolerance, and the enzymatic products could be chemically modified to expand the structural diversity.







Abstract
Nitrogen heterocycles are commonly found in bioactive natural products and drugs. However, the biocatalytic tools for nitrogen heterocycle synthesis are limited. Herein, we report the discovery of vanillyl alcohol oxidases (VAOs) as efficient biocatalysts for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines from various 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes and aminothiols. The wild&#8208;type biocatalyst features a broad scope of 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes. Though the scope of aminothiols is limited, it could be improved via semi&#8208;rational protein engineering, generating a variant to produce previously inaccessible cysteine&#8208;derived bioactive 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines using the wild&#8208;type VAO. Benefiting from the derivatizable functional groups in the enzymatic products, we further chemically modified these products to expand the chemical space, offering a new chemoenzymatic strategy for the green and efficient synthesis of structurally diverse 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;thiazoline derivatives to prompt their use in drug discovery and catalysis.

         <title>Reaction, Recognition, Relay: Anhydride Hydrolysis Reported by Conformationally Responsive Fluorinated Foldamers in Micelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ hydrolysis of an insoluble anhydride produces chiral carboxylate in the aqueous phase, a signal that is recognized by artificial zinc(II)&#8208;capped membrane receptors embedded in micelles. These receptors relay the effect of this binding event along their length to produce a distinct 19F&#8197;NMR output, &#916;&#948;, from inside the hydrophobic region of the micelles.







Abstract
Natural membrane receptors are proteins that can report on changes in the concentration of external chemical messengers. Messenger binding to a receptor produces conformational changes that are relayed through the membrane into the cell; this information allows cells to adapt to changes in their environment. Artificial membrane receptors (R)&#8208;1 and (S)&#8208;1 are helical &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) foldamers that replicate key parts of this information relay. Solution&#8208;phase 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy of zinc(II)&#8208;capped receptor 1, either in organic solvent or in membrane&#8208;mimetic micelles, showed messenger binding produced an enrichment of either left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed screw&#8208;sense; the chirality of the bound messenger was relayed to the other receptor terminus. Furthermore, in situ production of a chemical messenger in the external aqueous environment could be detected in real&#8208;time by a racemic mixture of receptor 1 in micelles. The hydrolysis of insoluble anhydrides produced carboxylate in the aqueous phase, which bound to the receptors and gave a distinct 19F&#8197;NMR output from inside the hydrophobic region of the micelles.

         <title>Influence of Ti&#8208;incorporated Zeolite Topology and Pore Condensation on Vapor Phase Propylene Epoxidation Kinetics with Gaseous H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Propylene epoxidation and sequential reaction kinetics reflect the physical properties of catalysts and pore filling with gaseous solvents even without bulk liquid phase. Interactions between zeolite pores, reactant, and solvent molecules respond to changes in zeolite topology, pore polarity, and solvent pressure, resulting in significant changes in propylene epoxidation rates and propylene oxide product selectivities.







Abstract
Vapor&#8208;phase propylene (C3H6) epoxidation kinetics with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) strongly reflects the physical properties of Ti&#8208;incorporated zeolite catalysts and the presence of spectating molecules (&#8220;solvent&#8221;) near active sites even without a bulk liquid phase. Steady&#8208;state turnover rates of C3H6 epoxidation and product selectivities vary by orders of magnitudes, depending on the zeolite silanol ((SiOH)x) density, pore topology (MFI, *BEA, FAU), and the quantity of condensed acetonitrile (CH3CN) molecules nearby active sites, under identical reaction mechanisms sharing activated H2O2 intermediates on Ti surfaces. Individual kinetic analyses for propylene oxide (PO) ring&#8208;opening, homogeneous diol oxidative cleavage, and homogeneous aldehyde oxidation reveal that secondary reaction kinetics following C3H6 epoxidation responds more sensitively to the changes in zeolite physical properties and pore condensation with CH3CN. Thus, higher PO selectivities achieved in hydrophilic Ti&#8208;MFI at steady&#8208;state reflect the preferential stabilization of transition states for C3H6 epoxidation (a primary reaction) relative to PO ring&#8208;opening and oxidative cleavage (secondary reactions) that solvation effects that reflect interactions among condensed CH3CN within pores and the extended pore structure.

         <title>Controlling On&#8208;Surface Photoactivity: The Impact of &#960;&#8208;Conjugation in Anhydride&#8208;Functionalized Molecules on a Semiconductor Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the on&#8208;surface reaction of anhydride&#8208;functionalized molecules as precursors on a SnSe surface investigated by SPM and XPS techniques. Quantum chemical calculations demonstrate how their photoactivity can be controlled by modulating the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the molecular core.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis has become a prominent method for growing low&#8208;dimensional carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials on metal surfaces. However, the necessity of decoupling organic nanostructures from metal substrates to exploit their properties requires either transfer methods or new strategies to perform reactions directly on inert surfaces. The use of on&#8208;surface light&#8208;induced reactions directly on semiconductor/insulating surfaces represents an alternative approach to address these challenges. Here, exploring the photochemical activity of different organic molecules on a SnSe semiconductor surface under ultra&#8208;high vacuum, we present a novel on&#8208;surface light&#8208;induced reaction. The selective photodissociation of the anhydride group is observed, releasing CO and CO2. Moreover, we rationalize the relationship between the photochemical activity and the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the molecular core. The different experimental behaviour of two model anhydrides was elucidated by theoretical calculations, showing how the molecular structure influences the distribution of the excited states. Our findings open new pathways for on&#8208;surface synthesis directly on technologically relevant substrates.

         <title>Acyl Phosphates as Chemically Fueled Building Blocks for Self&#8208;Sustaining Protocells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium compartments regulated by an acyl phosphate chemical reaction network via chemical activation of carboxylic acids and alkyl phosphates. The compartments exist in the presence of chemical energy and decay without it. The chemical reaction network produces compartments even with prebiotically relevant activating agents, thus making it an attractive tool for studying Darwinian evolution in prebiotically plausible chemical systems incorporated with genotype&#8208;possessing structures.







Abstract
Lipids spontaneously assemble into vesicle&#8208;forming membranes. Such vesicles serve as compartments for even the simplest living systems. Vesicles have been extensively studied for constructing synthetic cells or as models for protocells&#8212;the cells hypothesized to have existed before life. These compartments exist almost always close to equilibrium. Life, however, exists out of equilibrium. In this work, we studied vesicle&#8208;based compartments regulated by a non&#8208;equilibrium chemical reaction network that converts activating agents. In this way, the compartments require a constant or periodic supply of activating agents to sustain themselves. Specifically, we use activating agents to condense carboxylates and phosphate esters into acyl phosphate&#8208;based lipids that form vesicles. These vesicles can only be sustained when condensing agents are present; without them, they decay. We demonstrate that the chemical reaction network can operate on prebiotic activating agents, opening the door to prebiotically plausible, self&#8208;sustainable protocells that compete for resources. In future work, such protocells should be endowed with a genotype, e.g., self&#8208;replicating RNA structures, to alter the protocell's behavior. Such protocells could enable Darwinian evolution in a prebiotically plausible chemical system.

         <title>Optimizing Molecular Packing via Steric Hindrance for Reducing Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the study, three new acceptors BTP&#8208;Biso, BTP&#8208;Bme and BTP&#8208;B, with sterically structured triisopropylbenzene, trimethylbenzene and benzene as side chains, are reported. Due to the intense spatial hindrance effect, the intramolecular rotation is obviously restricted, and the intermolecular packing is substantially altered. Consequently, PB2&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB&#8208;TF&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;Bme&#8208;based ternary device achieves a remarkable PCE of 19.3&#8201;% with a notably low &#916;Enr of 0.19&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Innovative molecule design strategy holds promise for the development of next&#8208;generation acceptor materials for efficient organic solar cells with low non&#8208;radiative energy loss (&#916;Enr). In this study, we designed and prepared three novel acceptors, namely BTP&#8208;Biso, BTP&#8208;Bme and BTP&#8208;B, with sterically structured triisopropylbenzene, trimethylbenzene and benzene as side chains inserted into the shoulder of the central core.

     alt="Optimizing Molecular Packing via Steric Hindrance for Reducing Non-Radiative Recombination in Organic Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, three new acceptors BTP-Biso, BTP-Bme and BTP-B, with sterically structured triisopropylbenzene, trimethylbenzene and benzene as side chains, are reported. Due to the intense spatial hindrance effect, the intramolecular rotation is obviously restricted, and the intermolecular packing is substantially altered. Consequently, PB2&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB-TF&#8201;:&#8201;BTP-Bme-based ternary device achieves a remarkable PCE of 19.3&#8201;% with a notably low &lt;i&gt;&#916;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.19&#8197;eV.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovative molecule design strategy holds promise for the development of next-generation acceptor materials for efficient organic solar cells with low non-radiative energy loss (&lt;i&gt;&#916;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt;). In this study, we designed and prepared three novel acceptors, namely BTP-Biso, BTP-Bme and BTP-B, with sterically structured triisopropylbenzene, trimethylbenzene and benzene as side chains inserted into the shoulder of the central core. The progressively enlarged steric hindrance from BTP-B to BTP-Bme and BTP-Biso induces suppressed intramolecular rotation and altered the molecule packing mode in their aggregation states, leading to significant changes in absorption spectra and energy levels. By regulating the intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, BTP-Bme possesses relatively reduced non-radiative recombination rate and extended exciton diffusion lengths. The binary device based on PB2&#8201;:&#8201;BTP-Bme exhibits an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.5&#8201;% with a low &lt;i&gt;&#916;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;nr&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.19&#8197;eV. Furthermore, the ternary device comprising PB2&#8201;:&#8201;PBDB-TF&#8201;:&#8201;BTP-Bme achieves an outstanding PCE of 19.3&#8201;%.

         <title>Leveraging DNA&#8208;Encoded Cell&#8208;Mimics for Environment&#8208;Adaptive Transmembrane Channel Release&#8208;Induced Cell Death</title>

In this study, a pioneering DNA&#8208;encoded artificial T cell mimics model (ARTC) that effectively mimics the behavior of natural T cells and establishes physicochemical interactions with biological cells. ARTC induce cellular apoptosis by releasing transmembrane channels that respond to the mildly acidic microenvironment, leading to selective outflow of intracellular potassium ions and consequent potent cytotoxic effects.







Abstract
The advancement of cell&#8208;mimic materials, which can forge sophisticated physicochemical dialogues with living cells, has unlocked a realm of intriguing prospects within the fields of synthetic biology and biomedical engineering. Inspired by the evolutionarily acquired ability of T lymphocytes to release perforin and generate transmembrane channels on targeted cells for killing, herein we present a pioneering DNA&#8208;encoded artificial T cell mimic model (ARTC) that accurately mimics T&#8208;cell&#8208;like behavior. ARTC responds to acidic conditions similar to those found in the tumor microenvironment and then selectively releases a G&#8208;rich DNA strand (LG4) embedded with C12 lipid and cholesterol molecules. Once released, LG4 effectively integrates into the membranes of neighboring live cells, behaving as an artificial transmembrane channel that selectively transports K+ ions and disrupts cellular homeostasis, ultimately inducing apoptosis. We hope that the emergence of ARTC will usher in new perspectives for revolutionizing future disease treatment and catalyzing the development of advanced biomedical technologies.

         <title>Assembly of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated [B3O6] Units by Mer&#8208;Isomer [YO3F3] Octahedra to Design a UV Nonlinear Optical Material, Cs2YB3O6F2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new UV NLO material, Cs2YB3O6F2 with optimal arrangement of [B3O6] groups has been synthesized with the aid of structure&#8208;directing property of mer&#8208;isomer [YO3F3] octahedra. It exhibits the rare coexistence of the largest SHG response of 5.6&#215;KDP, the largest birefringence of 0.091 at 532&#8197;nm, the shortest Type I phase&#8208;matching down to 200.5&#8197;nm and DUV transparency among reported acentric rare&#8208;earth borates with [B3O6] groups.







Abstract
Achieving the extreme balance of the key performance requirements is the crucial to breakthrough the application bottleneck for nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Herein, by assembly of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated [B3O6] functional species with the aid of structure&#8208;directing property of mer&#8208;isomer [YO3F3] octahedra, a new ultraviolet (UV) NLO material, Cs2YB3O6F2 with aligned arrangement of coplanar [B3O6] groups has been synthesized. The polar material exhibits the rare coexistence of the largest second harmonic generation response of 5.6&#215;KDP, the largest birefringence of 0.091 at 532&#8197;nm, the shortest Type I phase&#8208;matching down to 200.5&#8197;nm and deep&#8208;ultraviolet transparency among reported acentric rare&#8208;earth borates with [B3O6] groups. Remarkably, benefiting from the enhanced bonding force among functional units [B3O6], a firm three&#8208;dimensional framework is constructed, which facilitates the growth of large crystals. This can be proved by a block shape crystal with dimensional of 6&#215;5&#215;4&#8197;mm3, indicating that it was a promising UV NLO crystal. This work provides a powerful strategy to design UV NLO materials with good performances.

         <title>A Processible and Ultrahigh&#8208;temperature Organic Photothermal Material through Spontaneous and Quantitative [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8211;Cycloreversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>

A processible and stable organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal material ATT was facilely prepare by a spontaneous and quantitative [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8208;Cycloreversion. ATT powder can reach an unprecedently temperature as high as 450&#8201;&#176;C while maintaining excellent photostability upon photo&#8208;irradiation, enabling its applications in the high&#8208;temperature processes, such as photo&#8208;ignition, photo&#8208;fusion, photo&#8208;stamp, photo&#8208;weld and photo&#8208;controlled shaper memory.







Abstract
Energy conversion, particularly light to heat conversion, has garnered significant attention owing to its prospect in renewable energy exploitation and utilization. Most previous efforts have focused on developing organic photothermal materials for low&#8208;temperature applications, whereas the importance of simplifying the preparation methods of photothermal materials and enhancing their maximum photothermal temperature have been less taken. Herein, we prepare an organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal material namely ATT by a spontaneous [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;cycloreversion reaction. In addition to the solution&#8208;based method, ATT could also be readily preapred by ball milling in a high yield of 90&#8201;% in just 15&#8197;min. ATT powder exhibits a broad absorption extending beyond 2000&#8197;nm, excellent processability, and thermal stability. Remarkably, ATT powder can reach an unprecedently temperature as high as 450&#8201;&#176;C while maintaining excellent photostability upon photoirradiation. Leveraging its extraordinary photothermal and processable properties, ATT was used in the high&#8208;temperature applications, such as photo&#8208;ignition, photo&#8208;controlled metal processing and high&#8208;temperature shape memory, all of which offer spatiotemporal control capabilities. This work provides a new approach to prepare organic photothermal materials with high temperatures, and pave the way for their applications in extreme environments.

         <title>Highly Efficient Acidic Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide at Industrial&#8208;Level Current Densities Promoted by Alkali Metal Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali metal cations, acting as competing ions with H+, promote selective electrocatalytic reduction of O2 to H2O2 instead of H2O in a highly concentrated acidic electrolyte at high currents. The electrocatalytic environments involving water and alkali metal cations are pivotal in boosting H2O2 generation by stabilizing the crucial *OOH intermediate.







Abstract
Acidic H2O2 synthesis through electrocatalytic 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction presents a sustainable alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone oxidation technology. Nevertheless, acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis suffers from low H2O2 Faradaic efficiencies primarily due to the competing reactions of 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction to H2O and hydrogen evolution in environments with high H+ concentrations. Here, we demonstrate the significant effect of alkali metal cations, acting as competing ions with H+, in promoting acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis at industrial&#8208;level currents, resulting in an effective current densities of 50&#8211;421&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 84&#8211;100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and a production rate of 856&#8211;7842&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 that far exceeds the performance observed in pure acidic electrolytes or low&#8208;current electrolysis. Finite&#8208;element simulations indicate that high interfacial pH near the electrode surface formed at high currents is crucial for activating the promotional effect of K+. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the central role of alkali metal cations in stabilizing the key *OOH intermediate to suppress 4e&#8722; oxygen reduction through interacting with coordinated H2O.

         <title>Selective Photoreforming of Waste Plastics into Diesel Olefins via Single Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;TCPP facilitates the generation of triplet excitons, yielding 1O2, enabling the selective photoreformation of PVC into diesel olefins. Conversely, Zn&#8208;TCPP promotes exciton dissociation due to its built&#8208;in electric field, generating &#8901;O2&#8722;, leading to the selective photoreformation of PE into diesel olefins. This highlights a universal approach for selective photoreforming of waste plastics via single ROS.







Abstract
The accumulation of plastic waste poses a pressing environmental challenge. Catalytic conversion stands out as an ideal approach for plastics upcycling, particularly through solar&#8208;driven plastics photoreforming. However, due to the common effects of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS), selectively generating high&#8208;value chemicals becomes challenging. In this study, we developed a universal strategy to achieve &gt;85&#8201;% selective production of diesel olefins (C15&#8211;C28) from polyolefin waste plastics via single ROS. Using tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin supramolecular (TCPP) with different central metals as an example to regulate single ROS generation, results show Ni&#8208;TCPP facilitates triplet exciton production, yielding 1O2, while Zn&#8208;TCPP generates &#8901;O2&#8722; due to its strong built&#8208;in electric field (IEF). 1O2 directly dechlorinates polyvinyl chloride (PVC) due to the electro&#8208;negativity of chlorine atoms and the low dissociation energy of C&#8722;Cl bonds, while &#8901;O2&#8722; promotes direct dehydrogenation of polyethylene (PE) due to the electro&#8208;positivity of hydrogen atoms and the high dissociation energy of C&#8722;H bonds. This method is universally applicable to various single ROS systems. Installation experiments further affirm the application potential, achieving the highest diesel olefin production of 76.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1. Such a universally adaptive approach holds promise for addressing the global plastic pollution problem.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Redox&#8208;Neutral [3+2] Photocycloadditions of Cyclopropyl Ketones with Vinylazaarenes Enabled by Consecutive Photoinduced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ConPET as a powerful and novel technique for photoredox catalysis has been first employed in asymmetric synthesis. In collaboration with chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis, an unprecedented redox&#8208;neutral [3+2] photocycloaddition has been developed, facilitating the synthesis of a wide range of valuable azaarene&#8208;functionalized cyclopentyl ketones with high yields, ees and dr.







Abstract
Consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPET) is a powerful and atom&#8208;economical protocol to overcome the limitations of the intrinsic redox potential of visible light&#8208;absorbing photosensitizers, thereby considerably improving the substrate and reaction types. Likely because such an exothermic single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process usually does not require the aid of chiral catalysts, resulting in an inevitable racemic background reaction, notably, no enantioselective manifolds have been reported. Herein, we report on the viability of cooperative ConPET and chiral hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysis for the [3+2] photocycloaddition of cyclopropyl ketones with vinylazaarenes. In addition to enabling the first use of olefins that preferentially interact with chiral catalysts, this catalysis platform paves the way for the efficient synthesis of pharmaceutically and synthetically important cyclopentyl ketones functionalized by azaarenes with high yields, ees and dr. The robust capacity of the method can be further highlighted by the low loading of the chiral catalyst (1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%), the good compatibility of both 2&#8208;azaarene and 3&#8208;pyridine&#8208;based olefins, and the successful concurrent construction of three stereocenters on cyclopentane rings involving an elusive but important all&#8208;carbon quaternary.

         <title>Dimensional Regulation in Metal&#8208;Free Perovskites by Compositional Engineering to Achieve Record Low X&#8208;Ray Detection Limits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work innovatively utilizes compositional engineering to tailor octahedra, achieving a dimensional evolution in metal&#8208;free perovskites, and reports on metal&#8208;free perovskites with a two&#8208;dimensional structure for the first time. With the evolution in dimensions, there is a significant variation in their fluorescence and X&#8208;ray detection capabilities. Importantly, the 2D SC&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector achieved an ultra&#8208;low LOD of 12.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Utilizing the manipulation of perovskite dimensions has been proven as an effective approach in regulating perovskite properties. Nevertheless, achieving precise control over the dimensions of perovskites within the same system poses a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a sophisticated method to attain precise dimensional control in metal&#8208;free perovskites (MFPs), specifically through the process of octahedron tailoring by compositional engineering. Accordingly, we successfully instigated a transition from HPIP&#8722;NH4I3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O (3D), HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 (2D) and HPIP3&#8722;NH4I7 (1D) structures. Notably, HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 is the first 2D MFP. As anticipated, these perovskites exhibited completely distinct fluorescence and X&#8208;ray detection capabilities due to their differing dimensions. Remarkably, the 2D HPIP2&#8722;NH4I5 device effectively hindered ion migration perpendicular to the 2D layers, achieving the lowest detection limit of 12.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 among metal&#8208;free single crystals&#8208;based detectors. This study expands the dimensionality control strategies for MFPs and introduces, for the first time, the potential of 2D MFPs as high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detectors, thereby enriching the diversity of the MFPs family.

     alt="Dimensional Regulation in Metal-Free Perovskites by Compositional Engineering to Achieve Record Low X-Ray Detection Limits"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work innovatively utilizes compositional engineering to tailor octahedra, achieving a dimensional evolution in metal-free perovskites, and reports on metal-free perovskites with a two-dimensional structure for the first time. With the evolution in dimensions, there is a significant variation in their fluorescence and X-ray detection capabilities. Importantly, the 2D SC-based X-ray detector achieved an ultra-low LOD of 12.2&#8197;nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing the manipulation of perovskite dimensions has been proven as an effective approach in regulating perovskite properties. Nevertheless, achieving precise control over the dimensions of perovskites within the same system poses a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a sophisticated method to attain precise dimensional control in metal-free perovskites (MFPs), specifically through the process of octahedron tailoring by compositional engineering. Accordingly, we successfully instigated a transition from HPIP&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (3D), HPIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (2D) and HPIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (1D) structures. Notably, HPIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is the first 2D MFP. As anticipated, these perovskites exhibited completely distinct fluorescence and X-ray detection capabilities due to their differing dimensions. Remarkably, the 2D HPIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; device effectively hindered ion migration perpendicular to the 2D layers, achieving the lowest detection limit of 12.2&#8197;nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; among metal-free single crystals-based detectors.

         <title>Cover Picture: Translocation and Confinement of Tetraamines in Adaptable Microporous Cavities (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 30/2024)</title>

An alternative mechanism for amine grafting in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is illustrated in the cover image and reported by Carlos Mart&#237;&#8208;Gastaldo et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402973). The image shows in a Warholian style how the adaptable response of the framework allows the rearrangement of pore windows necessary to enable the translocation and binding of tetraamines inside cavities that would otherwise be inaccessible. This behaviour is activated by the dynamic response of the heterometallic Ti2Ca2 clusters in MUV&#8208;10 in the presence of triethylenetetramine molecules.

The radicals , in collaboration with water molecules, drive the breakage of V&#8208;F&#8208;V bonds in bulk phase phosphate and subsequently form a new 2D phosphate through recoordination, as reported by Xing&#8208;Long Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402371). The 2D phosphate exhibits superior carrier transport capability, lower Na+ migration barriers, and reduced volumetric strain, endowing it with excellent fast charging characteristics as sodium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. This effective strategy will provide a new insight for the optimization of SIBs.

A fluorine&#8208;free , dumbbell&#8208;shaped block&#8208;graft copolymer was synthesized and used as a hydrocarbon polymer electrolyte membrane for fuel cells, as reported by Il&#8197;Seok Chae, Jong&#8197;Hak Kim et&#8197;al in their Communication (e202406796). The unique structure of the polymer chains led to the alignment of phase&#8208;separated domains and continuous proton channels were constructed throughout the membrane. This enabled efficient proton transport and ensured stable performance. A novel design of polymer structure demonstrates a promising prospect for hydrocarbon PEMs as alternatives to PFSAs.

         <title>Enhancing the Cycle Life of Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries in Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>

Xiao et&#8197;al. demonstrate the use of an ionic liquid (IL) additive in zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8722;I2) batteries, which serves to optimize Zn solvation and the anode interface, as well as aids in inhibiting polyiodide dissolution. The research findings reveal a capacity decay rate of 0.01&#8201;% per cycle over 18,000 cycles (4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) in a full cell. Such promising results suggest a significant advancement in the field, offering high performing Zn&#8722;I2 batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8722;I2) batteries are gaining significant attention due to their low&#8208;cost, high safety and high theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, their long cycle and durability have been hampered due to the use of aqueous media that, over time, lead to Zn dendrite formation, hydrogen evolution reaction, and polyiodide dissolution. Xiao et&#8197;al. recently reported the addition of an imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL) to an aqueous electrolyte and found that the IL plays a key role in modifying the solvation of Zn2+ ions in the bulk electrolyte and the inner Helmholtz plane,&#160;repelling H2O molecules away from the Zn anode surface. UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy also indicates a strong interaction between imidazolium cation [EMIM]+ and I3&#8722;, thereby reducing polyiodide shuttling and enhancing the cycle life of the battery. Overall, a capacity decay rate of only 0.01&#8201;% per cycle after over 18,000 cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, is observed, making the use of IL additives in aqueous electrolytes highly promising candidates for Zn&#8722;I2 batteries.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Nanohoops: A New Generation of Curved Materials for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different nanohoops used to date in organic electronics are described in this Review. Through a structure&#8208;properties relationship study, the different performances reached are analysed and the potential of this new generation of curved materials discussed. This Review aims to stimulate future molecular designs of functional materials based on these conjugated macrocycles.







Abstract
Nanohoops, cyclic association of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems to form a hoop&#8208;shaped molecule, have been widely developed in the last 15&#8197;years. Beyond the synthetic challenge, the strong interest towards these molecules arises from their radially oriented &#960;&#8208;orbitals, which provide singular properties to these fascinating structures. Thanks to their particular cylindrical arrangement, this new generation of curved molecules have been already used in many applications such as host&#8211;guest complexation, biosensing, bioimaging, solid&#8208;state emission and catalysis. However, their potential in organic electronics has only started to be explored. From the first incorporation as an emitter in a fluorescent organic light emitting diode (OLED), to the recent first incorporation as a host in phosphorescent OLEDs or as charge transporter in organic field&#8208;effect transistors and in organic photovoltaics, this field has shown important breakthroughs in recent years. These findings have revealed that curved materials can play a key role in the future and can even be more efficient than their linear counterparts. This can have important repercussions for the future of electronics. Time has now come to overview the different nanohoops used to date in electronic devices in order to stimulate the future molecular designs of functional materials based on these macrocycles.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Heteroatom&#8208;Linked Non&#8208;Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful atroposelective synthesis of heteroatom&#8208;linked non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers marks a significant milestone in organic synthesis. Unlike conventional atropisomers, these unique molecules display generally lower enantiomerization barriers due to possible concerted bond rotations. Through innovative strategies, chemists have succeeded in controlling the atroposelectivity of these reactions, enabling the construction of original optically active molecular structures.







Abstract
Atropisomers hold significant fascination, not only for their prevalence in natural compounds but also for their biological importance and wide&#8208;ranging applications as chiral materials, ligands, and organocatalysts. While biaryl and heterobiaryl atropisomers are commonly studied, the enantioselective synthesis of less abundant heteroatom&#8208;linked non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers presents a formidable challenge in modern organic synthesis. Unlike classical atropisomers, these molecules allow rotation around two bonds, resulting in low barriers to enantiomerization through concerted bond rotations. In recent years the discovery of new configurationally stable rare non&#8208;biaryl scaffolds such as aryl amines, aryl ethers and aryl sulfones as well as innovative methodologies to control their configuration have been disclosed in the literature and constitute the topic of this minireview.

         <title>Progressive Optimization of Lanthanide Nanoparticle Scintillators for Enhanced Triple&#8208;Activated Radioluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A progressive optimization on lanthanide nanoparticle (LnNP) scintillators was performed to maximize their radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL) emission intensity and reveal the underlying relationship between the scintillators&#8242; structure and RL efficiency. The results regarding the RL mechanism and in vivo multimodal imaging strongly indicated the significant potential of tailored LnNP scintillators to achieve seamlessly integrated tumor radio&#8208;phototheranostics.







Abstract
Lanthanide nanoparticle (LnNP) scintillators exhibit huge potential in achieving radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (radioluminescence, RL). However, their structure&#8211;activity relationship remains largely unexplored. Herein, progressive optimization of LnNP scintillators is presented to unveil their structure&#8208;dependent RL property and enhance their RL output efficiency. Benefiting from the favorable host matrix and the luminescence&#8208;protective effect of core&#8211;shell engineering, NaGdF4&#8201;:&#8201;15&#8201;%Eu@NaLuF4 nanoparticle scintillators with tailored structures emerged as the top candidates. Living imaging experiments based on optimal LnNP scintillators validated the feasibility of laser&#8208;free continuous RL activated by clinical radiopharmaceuticals for tumor multiplex visualization. This research provides unprecedented insights into the rational design of LnNP scintillators, which would enable efficient energy conversion from Cerenkov luminescence, &#947;&#8208;radiation, and &#946;&#8208;electrons into visible photon signals, thus establishing a robust nanotechnology&#8208;aided approach for tumor&#8208;directed radio&#8208;phototheranostics.

         <title>Reviving Cost&#8208;Effective Organic Cathodes in Halide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery based on a cost&#8208;effective organic cathode material phenanthrenequinone (PQ) and a halide solid electrolyte Li2ZrCl6. The PQ cathode achieved a high specific capacity of 248&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), a high working voltage of 2.74&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li), and a good capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
The evolution of inorganic solid electrolytes has revolutionized the field of sustainable organic cathode materials, particularly by addressing the dissolution problems in traditional liquid electrolytes. However, current sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;organic batteries still face challenges such as high working temperatures, high costs, and low voltages. Here, we design an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery based on a cost&#8208;effective organic cathode material phenanthrenequinone (PQ) and a halide solid electrolyte Li2ZrCl6. Thanks to the good compatibility between PQ and Li2ZrCl6, the PQ cathode achieved a high specific capacity of 248&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), a high average discharge voltage of 2.74&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li), and a good capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C). Furthermore, the interactions between the high&#8208;voltage carbonyl PQ cathode and both sulfide and halide solid electrolytes, as well as the redox mechanism of the PQ cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, were carefully studied by a variety of advanced characterizations. We believe such a design and the corresponding investigations into the underlying chemistry give insights for the further development of practical all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;organic batteries.

     alt="Reviving Cost-Effective Organic Cathodes in Halide-Based All-Solid-State Lithium Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We design an all-solid-state lithium battery based on a cost-effective organic cathode material phenanthrenequinone (PQ) and a halide solid electrolyte Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The PQ cathode achieved a high specific capacity of 248&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), a high working voltage of 2.74&#8197;V (vs. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li), and a good capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of inorganic solid electrolytes has revolutionized the field of sustainable organic cathode materials, particularly by addressing the dissolution problems in traditional liquid electrolytes. However, current sulfide-based all-solid-state lithium-organic batteries still face challenges such as high working temperatures, high costs, and low voltages. Here, we design an all-solid-state lithium battery based on a cost-effective organic cathode material phenanthrenequinone (PQ) and a halide solid electrolyte Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Thanks to the good compatibility between PQ and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, the PQ cathode achieved a high specific capacity of 248&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), a high average discharge voltage of 2.74&#8197;V (vs. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li), and a good capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at room temperature (25&#8201;&#176;C). Furthermore, the interactions between the high-voltage carbonyl PQ cathode and both sulfide and halide solid electrolytes, as well as the redox mechanism of the PQ cathode in all-solid-state batteries, were carefully studied by a variety of advanced characterizations. We believe such a design and the corresponding investigations into the underlying chemistry give insights for the further development of practical all-solid-state lithium-organic batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Gold(I)&#8211;Acetylene Complex Synthesised using Single&#8208;Crystal Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of &#960;&#8208;acetylene gold(I) compounds as intermediates in catalysis has been postulated, but their isolation or spectroscopic detection has remained elusive. Herein, the combination of a bulky cavity&#8208;shaped phosphine along with single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal reactivity allowed for the isolation of the first gold(I)&#8211;acetylene complex, which was thoroughly characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, solution and solid&#8208;state NMR, periodic DFT, and electronic structure analyses.







Abstract
Using single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal solid/gas reactivity the gold(I) acetylene complex [Au(L1)(&#951;2&#8208;HC&#8801;CH)][BArF4] is cleanly synthesized by addition of acetylene gas to single crystals of [Au(L1)(CO)][BArF4] [L1=tris&#8208;2&#8208;(4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbiphenyl)phosphine, ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3]. This simplest gold&#8208;alkyne complex has been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solution and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and periodic DFT. Bonding of HC&#8801;CH with [Au(L1)]+ comprises both &#963;&#8208;donation and &#960;&#8208;backdonation with additional dispersion interactions within the cavity&#8208;shaped phosphine.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Hemicyanines as Modular Scaffolds for in vivo Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a modular chemical platform for the synthesis of targeted near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers including enzymatic cages and biocompatible units. We demonstrated its utility with the design of a cathepsin B&#8208;activatable agent for safe ablation of microtumors in vivo in a zebrafish preclinical model.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy is an anti&#8208;cancer treatment that requires illumination of photosensitizers to induce local cell death. Current near&#8208;infrared organic photosensitizers are built from large and non&#8208;modular structures that cannot be tuned to improve safety and minimize off&#8208;target toxicity. This work describes a novel chemical platform to generate enzyme&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers. We optimized the Se&#8208;bridged hemicyanine scaffold to include caging groups and biocompatible moieties, and generated cathepsin&#8208;triggered photosensitizers for effective ablation of human glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that enzyme&#8208;activatable Se&#8208;bridged hemicyanines are effective photosensitizers for the safe ablation of microtumors in vivo, creating new avenues in the chemical design of targeted anti&#8208;cancer photodynamic therapy agents.

         <title>Cascaded *CO&#8722;*COH Intermediates on a Nonmetallic Plasmonic Photocatalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 with 90.6&#8201;% Selectivity</title>

The &#8220;photoelectron injection&#8221;&#8208;stabilized W/Z plasmonic photocatalyst achieved efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 conversion (653.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under visible light irradiation, with an exceptionally high selectivity of 90.6&#8201;%.







Abstract
Oxygen vacancies (OV) in nonmetallic plasmonic photocatalysts can decrease the energy barrier for CO2 reduction, boosting C1 intermediate production for potential C2 formation. However, their susceptibility to oxidation weakens C1 intermediate adsorption. Herein we proposed a &#8220;photoelectron injection&#8221; strategy to safeguard OV in W18O49 by creating a W18O49/ZIS (W/Z) plasmonic photocatalyst. Moreover, photoelectrons contribute to the local multi&#8208;electron environment of W18O49, enhancing the intrinsic excitation of its hot electrons with extended lifetimes, as confirmed by in situ XPS and femtosecond transient absorption analysis. Density functional theory calculations revealed that W/Z with OV enhances CO2 adsorption, activating *CO production, while reducing the energy barrier for *COH production (0.054&#8197;eV) and subsequent *CO&#8722;*COH coupling (0.574&#8197;eV). Successive hydrogenation revealed that the free energy for *CH2CH2 hydrogenation (0.108&#8197;eV) was lower than that for *CH2CH2 desorption for C2H4 production (0.277&#8197;eV), favouring C2H6 production. Consequently, W/Z achieves an efficient C2H6 activity of 653.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light, with an exceptionally high selectivity of 90.6&#8201;%. This work offers a new strategy for the rational design of plasmonic photocatalysts with high selectivity for C2+ products.

         <title>Alkene 1,3&#8208;Difluorination via Transient Oxonium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a diastereoselective hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;difluorination of homoallylic (aryl) ethers. The transformation proceeds through a transiently formed oxonium intermediate that is opened by fluoride to rearrange an alkyl chain. The protocol is scalable and tolerates a variety of functional groups and substitution on the alkenyl chain. Mechanistic studies reveal key insights into the reaction selectivity.







Abstract
The 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes is an under&#8208;explored transformation that leads to moieties that are otherwise challenging to prepare. Herein, we report a hypervalent iodine&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;difluorination of homoallylic (aryl) ethers to give unreported 1,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;oxy groups with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. The transformation proceeds through a different mode of reactivity for 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization, in which a regioselective addition of fluoride opens a transiently formed oxonium intermediate to rearrange an alkyl chain. The optimized protocol is scalable and shown to proceed well with a variety of functional groups and substitution on the alkenyl chain, hence providing ready access to this fluorinated, conformationally controlled moiety.

The transformation proceeds through a transiently formed oxonium intermediate that is opened by fluoride to rearrange an alkyl chain. The protocol is scalable and tolerates a variety of functional groups and substitution on the alkenyl chain. Mechanistic studies reveal key insights into the reaction selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1,3-difunctionalization of unactivated alkenes is an under-explored transformation that leads to moieties that are otherwise challenging to prepare. Herein, we report a hypervalent iodine-mediated 1,3-difluorination of homoallylic (aryl) ethers to give unreported 1,3-difluoro-4-oxy groups with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. The transformation proceeds through a different mode of reactivity for 1,3-difunctionalization, in which a regioselective addition of fluoride opens a transiently formed oxonium intermediate to rearrange an alkyl chain. The optimized protocol is scalable and shown to proceed well with a variety of functional groups and substitution on the alkenyl chain, hence providing ready access to this fluorinated, conformationally controlled moiety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Borylation and subsequent halide abstraction of a tungsten&#8208;bound N2 ligand affords a cationic complex featuring a rare linear NNBR ligand. This complex undergoes an unique chain elongation reaction via iminoborane carboration reaction with bis(tert&#8208;butyl)iminoborane, giving access to a five&#8208;atom B/N chain.







Abstract
Borylation of a tungsten&#8208;bound N2 ligand and halide abstraction provides access to a cationic complex with an unprecedented linear NNBR ligand. This complex undergoes [3+2] cycloaddition with azides, and an unexpected chain&#8208;extension reaction with an iminoborane, leading to a complex with a five&#8208;atom B/N chain. These two [NNBR]&#8208;containing complexes, inorganic analogues of E.&#8197;O. Fischer's alkynylcarbynes, are very rare examples of molecules containing all&#8208;inorganic chains of sp&#8208;hybridized atoms.

         <title>Efficient Enzymatic Synthesis of Carbamates in Water Using Promiscuous Esterases/Acyltransferases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis performed under harsh reaction conditions often requires the need for protecting groups to prevent off&#8208;target reactions. While traditional chemical introduction of protecting groups disagrees with the principles of green chemistry, biocatalysis provides a promising alternative. Herein, we present an unprecedented enzymatic approach for the efficient synthesis of carbamate&#8208;protected amines in water achieving up to 99&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Biocatalysis provides an attractive approach to facilitate synthetic reactions in aqueous media. Motivated by the discovery of promiscuous aminolysis activity of esterases, we exploited the esterase from Pyrobaculum calidifontis VA1 (PestE) for the synthesis of carbamates from different aliphatic, aromatic, and arylaliphatic amines and a set of carbonates such as dimethyl&#8208;, dibenzyl&#8208;, or diallyl carbonate. Thus, aniline and benzylamine derivatives, aliphatic and even secondary amines could be efficiently converted into the corresponding benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz)&#8208; or allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc)&#8208;protected products in bulk water, with (isolated) yields of up to 99&#8201;%.

         <title>Selective Macrocyclization of Unprotected Peptides with an Ex Situ Gaseous Linchpin Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gaseous sulfonyl chloride derived reagent that enables amine&#8211;amine, amine&#8211;phenol, and amine&#8208;aniline crosslinking by a minimalist linchpin strategy was used to form macrocyclic urea or carbamate products in unprotected peptides. The reaction is operationally simple and tolerates a wide range of other amino acids. Cyclization of bioactive cyclic peptides provided a variety of bicyclic peptides with novel topologies.







Abstract
Peptide cyclization has dramatic effects on a variety of important properties, enhancing metabolic stability, limiting conformational flexibility, and altering cellular entry and intracellular localization. The hydrophilic, polyfunctional nature of peptides creates chemoselectivity challenges in macrocyclization, especially for natural sequences without biorthogonal handles. Herein, we describe a gaseous sulfonyl chloride derived reagent that achieves amine&#8211;amine, amine&#8211;phenol, and amine&#8211;aniline crosslinking through a minimalist linchpin strategy that affords macrocyclic urea or carbamate products. The cyclization reaction is metal&#8208;mediated and involves a novel application of sulfine species that remains unexplored in aqueous or biological contexts. The aqueous method delivers unique cyclic or bicyclic topologies directly from a variety of natural bioactive peptides without the need for protecting&#8208;group strategies.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Formation of Sulfurous Acid (H2SO3) in the Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laboratory experiments show the formation of sulfurous acid (H2SO3) from the gas&#8208;phase reaction of OH radicals with CH3S(O)OH for atmospheric reaction conditions with a molar yield of &#8764;50&#8201;%. H2SO3 represents a hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach acid that has never been observed in aqueous solution. In the gas phase, if once formed, it shows a certain kinetic stability with an estimated lifetime of at least one second for atmospheric water vapor conditions.







Abstract
Sulfurous acid (H2SO3) is known to be thermodynamically instable decomposing into SO2 and H2O. All attempts to detect this elusive acid in solution failed up to now. Reported H2SO3 formation from an experiment carried out in a mass spectrometer as well as results from theoretical calculations, however, indicated a possible kinetic stability in the gas phase. Here, it is shown experimentally that H2SO3 is formed in the OH radical&#8208;initiated gas&#8208;phase oxidation of methanesulfinic acid (CH3S(O)OH) at 295&#177;0.5&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar of air with a molar yield of 

53-17+7

 ${{53}_{-17}^{+\ 7}}$



&#8201;%. Further main products are SO2, SO3 and methanesulfonic acid. CH3S(O)OH represents an important intermediate product of dimethyl sulfide oxidation in the atmosphere. Global modeling predicts an annual H2SO3 production of &#8764;8&#8197;million metric tons from the OH+CH3S(O)OH reaction. The investigated H2SO3 depletion in the presence of water vapor results in k(H2O+H2SO3) &lt;3&#215;10&#8722;18&#8197;cm3&#8201;molecule&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which indicates a lifetime of at least one second for atmospheric humidity. This work provides experimental evidence that H2SO3, once formed in the gas phase, is kinetically stable enough to allow its characterization and subsequent reactions.

         <title>Dumbbell&#8208;Shaped, Block&#8208;Graft Copolymer with Aligned Domains for High&#8208;Performance Hydrocarbon Polymer Electrolyte Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 30, July 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dumbbell&#8208;shaped hydrocarbon block&#8208;graft copolymer was synthesized for use as a polymer electrolyte membrane. The introduction of comb&#8208;type side chains resulted in a highly aligned morphology with enhanced microphase separation. The poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butylene&#8208;b&#8208;styrene)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(styrene sulfonic acid) membrane achieved outstanding ion conductivity and maintained stable fuel cell performance for 150&#8197;h.







Abstract
Given the environmental concerns surrounding fluoromaterials, the use of high&#8208;cost perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) in fuel cells and water electrolysis contradicts the pursuit of clean energy systems. Herein, we present a fluorine&#8208;free dumbbell&#8208;shaped block&#8208;graft copolymer, derived from the cost&#8208;effective triblock copolymer, poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butylene&#8208;b&#8208;styrene) (SEBS), for polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs). This unique polymer shape led to the alignment of the hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic domains along a preferred orientation, resulting in the construction of interconnected proton channels across the membrane. A bicontinuous network allowed efficient proton transport with reduced tortuosity, leading to an exceptional ionic conductivity (249&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 90&#8201;% relative humidity (RH)), despite a low ion exchange capacity (IEC; 1.41). Furthermore, membrane electrode assembly (MEA) prepared with our membrane exhibited stable performance over a period of 150&#8197;h at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 30&#8201;% RH. This study demonstrates a novel polymer structure design and highlights a promising outlook for hydrocarbon PEMs as alternatives to PFSAs.

         <title>Non&#8208;isocyanate Synthesis of Covalent Adaptable Networks Based on Dynamic Hindered Urea Bonds: Sequential Polymerization and Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of environmentally sustainable processes for polymer recycling is of paramount importance in the polymer industry. In particular, the implementation of chemical recycling for thermoset polymers via covalent adaptable networks (CANs), particularly those based on the dynamic hindered urea bond (HUB), has garnered intensive attention from both the academic and industrial sectors. This interest stems from its straightforward chemical structure and reaction mechanism, which are well&#8208;suited for commercial polyurethane and polyurea applications. However, a substantial drawback of these CANs is the requisite use of toxic isocyanate curing agents for their synthesis. Herein, we propose a new HUB synthesis pathway involving thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one and a hindered amine. This ring&#8208;opening reaction facilitates the isocyanate&#8208;free formation of a HUB and enables sequential reactions with acrylate and epoxide monomers via thiol&#8211;Michael and thiol&#8211;epoxy click chemistry. The CANs synthesized using this methodology exhibit superior reprocessability, chemical recyclability, and reutilizability, facilitated by specific catalytic and solvent conditions, through the reversible HUB, thiol&#8211;Michael addition, and transesterification processes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Harvesting triplet excitons of heavy atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under aerated conditions is challenging due to the quenching of long&#8208;lived triplet states by molecular oxygen and vibrational dissipation. Herein, we show a supramolecular approach of triplet harvesting via mitigating quenching pathways of a triplet harvester. Specifically, we used a host&#8211;guest system based on  2,3:6,7&#8210;naphthalene bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;derived cyclophane (NBICy) and carbazole derivative (EtCz). Complexation studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis showed the formation of a rigid host&#8211;guest complex (K&#160;= ~104 M&#8208;1 in CCl4), resulting in triplet&#8208;exciton stabilization under aerated conditions via mitigating vibrational interference and oxygen quenching. Photophysical studies elucidate the delayed fluorescence emission from the charge&#8208;transfer state (1CT) with a quantum yield (QY) of 6&#8208;8% under ambient conditions which increased up to 36 % in an inert atmosphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Zero&#8208;Bias Anti&#8208;Ohmic Behaviour in Diradicaloid Molecular Wires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Open&#8208;shell materials bearing multiple spin centres provide a key route to efficient charge transport in single&#8208;molecule electronic devices. They have narrow energy gaps, and their molecular orbitals align closely to the Fermi level of the metallic electrodes, thus allowing efficient electronic transport and higher conductance. Maintaining and stabilising multiple open&#8208;shell states &#8211; especially in contact with metallic electrodes &#8211; is however very challenging, generally requiring a continuous chemical or electrochemical potential to avoid self&#8208;immolation of the open&#8208;shell character. To overcome this issue, we designed, synthesised, and measured the conductance of a series of bis(indeno) fused acenes, where stability is imparted by a close&#8208;shell quinoidal conformation in resonance with the diradical electronic configuration. We show here that these compounds have anti&#8208;ohmic behaviour, with conductance increasing with increasing molecular length, at an unprecedented rate and across the entire bias window ([[EQUATION]]). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations support our findings, showing the rapidly narrowing HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, unique to these diradicaloid structures, is responsible for the observed behaviour. Our results provide a framework for achieving efficient transport in neutral compounds and demonstrate the promise that diradicaloid materials have in single&#8208;molecule electronics, owing to their great stability and unique electronic structure.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional atom utilization and unique properties. However, the practical application of these catalysts is often impeded by challenges such as sintering&#8208;induced instability and poisoning of isolated atoms due to strong gas adsorption. In this study, we employed the mechanochemical method to insert single Cu atoms into the subsurface of Fe2O3 support. By manipulating the location of single atoms at the surface or subsurface, catalysts with distinct adsorption properties and reaction mechanisms can be achieved. It was observed that the subsurface Cu single atoms in Fe2O3 remained isolated under both oxidation and reduction environments, whereas surface Cu single atoms on Fe2O3 experienced sintering under reduction conditions. The unique properties of these subsurface single&#8208;atom catalysts call for innovations and new understandings in catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Unlocking Reactivity of Fragments for Fast Target&#8208;Guided Synthesis of Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We showcase the successful combination of photochemistry and kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) for rapidly pinpointing enzyme inhibitors. KTGS is a fragment&#8208;based drug discovery (FBDD) methodology in which the biological target (BT) orchestrates the construction of its own ligand from fragments featuring complementary reactive functionalities. Notably, fragments interacting with the protein binding sites leverage their spatial proximity, facilitating a preferential reaction. Consequently, the resulting bivalent ligand exhibits heightened affinity. Within the realm of KTGS strategies, in situ click chemistry stands out as the most widely used to identify potent protein binders. This approach requires significant protein contributions, such as binding interactions and appropriate orientations of fragments, to overcome high activation barriers. This leads to prolonged incubation times and the potential for generating false negatives, thereby limiting this strategy to proteins that are stable enough in buffer. We herein unveil the possibility to integrate photochemistry into the realm of KTGS, accelerating the ligation reaction between fragments to a time scale of minutes. This approach should significantly expand the narrow reactivity window of traditional KTGS reactions, paving the way for the exploration and development of novel photo&#8208;KTGS reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>The First Main Group Element Lewis Acid Thionyl chloride Adduct and its Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the adduct of aluminum trichloride with thionyl chloride has been reported, no thionyl chloride adduct of a main group element Lewis acid or organometallic compound has been structurally characterized. In this communication we present the synthesis and reactivity of the structurally ascertained adduct of thionyl chloride with tris(pentafluoroethyl)gallane as a representative of a main group element Lewis acid. Gallium and indium compounds with electron withdrawing groups, e.g. the pentafluoroethyl ligand, display versatile properties. While gallates and indates, [MR4]&#8211;, behave as weakly coordinating anions, neutral gallanes and indanes, MR3, are strong Lewis acids. Salts with the tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)gallate and &#8208;indate, [M(C2F5)4]&#8211; (M=Ga, In), have recently been studied in detail. In contrast to this, work on the syntheses of the free Lewis superacids M(C2F5)3 (M= Ga, In) is scarce and underdeveloped. The hydrates [M(C2F5)3(OH2)2] proved to be suitable starting materials, particularly due to their thermal stability. Herein we report on synthesis and characterization of reactive adducts, [M(C2F5)3D], with the weak donor molecules (D) SOCl2 and Me3SiF. The effective Lewis acidities of Ga(C2F5)3 and In(C2F5)3 were experimentally deter&#173;mined by the (modified) Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method and their catalytic potential is showcased.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Donor Acceptor Complex&#8208;Enabled &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H Alkenylation of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic amines are prevalent and vital structural components present in many bioactive compounds and natural products. Additionally, they serve as valuable intermediates and building blocks, with wide&#8208;ranging applications in organic synthesis. However, direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H alkenylation of feedstock amines, particularly for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;alkenylated cyclic amines, has posed a longstanding challenge. Herein, we present a general, mild, operationally simple, and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;alkenylation of various readily available amines with alkenylborate esters in excellent E/Z &#8208; and diastereoselectivities. This method features good compatibility with water and oxygen, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance, thereby enabling the late&#8208;stage modification of various complex molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that the formation of a photoactive electron donor&#8208;acceptor complex between 2&#8208;iodobenzamide and the tetraalkoxyborate anion, which subsequently undergoes photoinduced single electron transfer and intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer to generate the crucial &#945;&#8208;amino radicals, is the key to success of this chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and stable NIR&#8208;II phosphorescence of metallophilicmolecular oligomers for in vivo single&#8208;cell tracking and time&#8208;resolved imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular phosphorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8208;1700 nm) holds promise for deep&#8208;tissue optical imaging with high contrast by overcoming background fluorescence interference. However, achieving bright and stable NIR&#8208;II molecular phosphorescence suitable for biological applications remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a new series of symmetric isocyanorhodium(I) complexes that could form oligomers and exhibit bright, long&#8208;lived (7&#8208;8 &#956;s) phosphorescence in aqueous solution via metallophilic interaction. Ligand substituents with enhanced dispersion attraction and electron&#8208;donating properties were explored to extend excitation/emission wavelengths and enhanced stability. Further binding the oligomers with fetal bovine serum (FBS) resulted in NIR&#8208;II molecular phosphorescence with high quantum yields (up to 3.93%) and long&#8208;term stability in biological environments, enabling in vivo tracking of single&#8208;macrophage dynamics and high&#8208;contrast time&#8208;resolved imaging. These results pave the way for the development of highly&#8208;efficient NIR&#8208;II molecular phosphorescence for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Hybridization Activates Lattice&#8208;Hydroxyl&#8208;Groups of NiCo(OH) x  Nanowires for Efficient Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical dehydrogenation of hydroxides plays a crucial role in the formation of high&#8208;valence metal active sites toward 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) to produce the value&#8208;added chemical of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic (FDCA). Herein, we construct benzoic acid ligand&#8208;hybridized NiCo(OH)x nanowires (BZ&#8208;NiCo(OH)x) with ample electron&#8208;deficient Ni/Co sites for HMFOR. The robust electron&#8208;withdrawing capability of benzoic acid ligands in BZ&#8208;NiCo(OH)x speeds up the electrochemical activation and dehydrogenation of lattice&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;groups (M2+&#8208;O&#8208;H &#8652; M3+&#8208;O), boosting the formation of abundant electron&#8208;deficient and high&#8208;valence Ni/Co sites. DFT calculation reveals that the deintercalation proton is prone to establishing a hydrogen bridge with the carbonyl group in benzoic acid, facilitating the proton transfer. Coupled with the synergistic oxidation of Ni/Co sites on hydroxyl and aldehyde groups, BZ&#8208;NiCo(OH)x delivers a remarkable current density of 111.20 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.4 V for HMFOR, exceeding that of NiCo(OH)x by approximately fourfold. And the FDCA yield and Faraday efficiency are as high as 95.24% and 95.39%, respectively. The ligand&#8208;hybridized strategy in this work introduces a novel perspective for designing high&#8208;performance transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for biomass conversion.</dc:description>

DFT calculation reveals that the deintercalation proton is prone to establishing a hydrogen bridge with the carbonyl group in benzoic acid, facilitating the proton transfer. Coupled with the synergistic oxidation of Ni/Co sites on hydroxyl and aldehyde groups, BZ-NiCo(OH)x delivers a remarkable current density of 111.20 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.4 V for HMFOR, exceeding that of NiCo(OH)x by approximately fourfold. And the FDCA yield and Faraday efficiency are as high as 95.24% and 95.39%, respectively. The ligand-hybridized strategy in this work introduces a novel perspective for designing high-performance transition metal-based electrocatalysts for biomass conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Indazole to 2&#8208;cyanoindole scaffold progression for mycobacterial lipoamide dehydrogenase inhibitors achieves extended target residence time and improved antibacterial activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of death from a single infection worldwide. Drug resistance to existing and even new antimycobacterials calls for research into novel targets and unexplored mechanisms of action. Recently we reported on the development of tight&#8208;binding inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) lipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd), which selectively inhibit the bacterial but not the human enzyme based on a differential modality of inhibitor interaction with these targets. Here we report on the striking improvement in inhibitor residence time on the Mtb enzyme associated with scaffold progression from an indazole to 2&#8208;cyanoindole. Cryo&#8208;EM of Lpd with the bound 2&#8208;cyanoindole inhibitor 19 confirmed displacement of the buried water molecule deep in the binding channel with a cyano group. The ensuing hours&#8208;long &#160;improvement in on&#8208;target residence time is associated with enhanced antibacterial activity in axenic culture and in primary mouse macrophages. Resistance to 2&#8208;cyanoindole inhibitors involves mutations within the inhibitor binding site that have little effect on inhibitor affinity but change the modality of inhibitor&#8208;target interaction, resulting in fast dissociation from Lpd. These findings underscore that on&#8208;target residence time is a major determinant of antibacterial activity and in vivo efficacy.</dc:description>

         <title>Metabolic Response to Small Molecule Therapy in Colorectal Cancer Tracked with Raman Spectroscopy and Metabolomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite numerous screening tools for colorectal cancer (CRC), 25% of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease. &#160;Novel diagnostic technologies that are early, accurate, and rapid are imperative to assess the therapeutic efficacy of clinical drugs and identify new biomarkers of treatment response. Here Raman spectroscopy (RS) was used to track metabolic reprogramming in KRAS&#8208;mutant HCT116 and SW837 cells, and KRAS wild&#8208;type CC cells. RS combined with multivariate analysis methods distinguished nonresponsive, partially responsive, and responsive cells treated with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody for EGFR inhibition, sotorasib, a clinically approved KRAS inhibitor, and various doses of trametinib, an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway. Cells treated with a combination of subtoxic doses of trametinib and BKM120, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, showed a synergistic response between the two pathways. Using a supervised machine learning regression model, we established a scoring methodology trained to a priori predict therapeutic response to new treatment combinations. RS metabolites were verified with mass spectrometry, and enrichment pathways were identified, including amino acid, purine, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism that differentiated monotherapy from combination therapy. Our approach may ultimately be applicable to patient&#8208;derived primary cells and cultures of patient tumors to predict effective drugs for individualized care.</dc:description>

         <title>Hyperpolarization of 15N&#8208;Pyridinium by Using Parahydrogen Enables Access to Reactive Oxygen Sensors and Pilot In Vivo Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 15N&#8208;labelled tracer for magnetic resonance is introduced that is signal enhanced using parahydrogen and the feasibility for first pilot 15N in vivo studies is demonstrated.







Abstract
Magnetic resonance with hyperpolarized contrast agents is one of the most powerful and noninvasive imaging platforms capable for investigating in vivo metabolism. While most of the utilized hyperpolarized agents are based on 13C nuclei, a milestone advance in this area is the emergence of 15N hyperpolarized contrast agents. Currently, the reported 15N hyperpolarized agents mainly utilize the dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (d&#8208;DNP) protocol. The parahydrogen enhanced 15N probes have proven to be elusive and have been tested almost exclusively in organic solvents. Herein, we designed a reaction based reactive oxygen sensor 15N&#8208;boronobenzyl&#8208;2&#8208;styrylpyridinium (15N&#8208;BBSP) which can be hyperpolarized with para&#8208;hydrogen. Reactive oxygen species plays a vital role as one of the essential intracellular signalling molecules. Disturbance of the H2O2 level usually represents a hallmark of pathophysiological conditions. This H2O2 probe exhibited rapid responsiveness toward H2O2 and offered spectrally resolvable chemical shifts. We also provide strategies to bring the newly developed probe from the organic reaction solution into a biocompatible injection buffer and demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo 15N signal detection. The present work manifests its great potential not only for reaction based reactive sensing probes but also promises to serve as a platform to develop other contrast agents.

         <title>Toward Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Quality&#8208;Factor Wireless Masing Magnetic Resonance Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (RASER) creates masing of nuclear spin Zeeman energy level transitions. RASER is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive NMR detectors. We show wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced from 75 up to 1,000,000 via parametric pumping via active&#8208;feedback technique for RASER applications at 300&#8197;MHz that was otherwise not possible with conventional MR detector.







Abstract
It has recently been shown that a bolus of hyperpolarized nuclear spins can yield stimulated emission signals similar in nature to maser signals, potentially enabling new ways of sensing hyperpolarized contrast media, including most notably [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate that is under evaluation in over 50&#8197;clinical trials for metabolic imaging of cancer. The stimulated NMR signal emissions lasting for minutes do not require radio&#8208;frequency excitation, offering unprecedented advantages compared to conventional MR sensing. However, creating nuclear spin maser emission is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive MR detectors. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced 22&#8208;fold (to 1,670) via parametric pumping. This active&#8208;feedback technique breaks the intrinsic fundamental limit of NMR detector circuit quality factor. We show the use of parametric pumping to reduce the threshold requirement for inducing nuclear spin masing at 300&#8197;MHz resonance frequency in a preclinical MRI scanner. Indeed, stimulated emission from hyperpolarized protons was obtained under highly unfavorable conditions of low magnetic field homogeneity (T2* of 3&#8197;ms). Greater gains of the quality factor of the MR detector (up to 1&#8197;million) were also demonstrated.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly Frameworks (SAFs): Shaping the Future of Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular assembly frameworks (SAFs) emerge as a novel class of porous structures distinguished by their strategic use of non&#8208;covalent interactions. SAFs not only exhibit exceptional porosity, crystallinity, and structural stability, but also offer a solution to the limitations of MOFs and COFs caused by their dissolution&#8208;recrystallization dynamics. This development represents a significant advance in porous material chemistry, opening avenues for new applications and research.







Abstract
Supramolecular assembly frameworks (SAFs) represent a new category of porous materials, utilizing non&#8208;covalent interactions, setting them apart from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This category includes but is not restricted to hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks and supramolecular organic frameworks. SAFs stand out for their outstanding porosity, crystallinity, and stability, alongside unique dissolution&#8208;recrystallization dynamics that enable significant structural and functional modifications. Crucially, their non&#8208;covalent assembly strategies allow for a balanced manipulation of porosity, symmetry, crystallinity, and dimensions, facilitating the creation of advanced crystalline porous materials unattainable through conventional covalent or coordination bond synthesis. Despite their considerable promise in overcoming several limitations inherent to MOFs and COFs, particularly in terms of solution&#8208;processability, SAFs have received relatively little attention in recent literature. This Minireview aims to shed light on standout SAFs, exploring their design principles, synthesis strategies, and characterization methods. It emphasizes their distinctive features and the broad spectrum of potential applications across various domains, aiming to catalyze further development and practical application within the scientific community.

         <title>Tuning the Electronic Structures of Anchor Sites to Achieve Zero&#8208;Valence Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Advanced Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping boron atoms with lower electronegativity into g&#8208;C3N4 can substantially change the local electronic structures at metal anchor sites to achieve zero&#8208;valence Pd SACs with reinforced metal&#8208;support orbital hybridizations for high stability and upshifted Pd 4d orbitals for high hydrogenation activity.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have recently become highly attractive for selective hydrogenation reactions owing to their remarkably high selectivity. However, compared to their nanoparticle counterparts, atomically dispersed metal atoms in SACs often show inferior activity and are prone to aggregate under reaction conditions. Here, by theoretical calculations, we show that tuning the local electronic structures of metal anchor sites on g&#8208;C3N4 by doping B atoms (BCN) with relatively lower electronegativity allows achieving zero&#8208;valence Pd SACs with reinforced metal&#8208;support orbital hybridizations for high stability and upshifted Pd 4d orbitals for high activity in H2 activation. The precise synthesis of Pd SACs on BCN supports with varied B contents substantiated the theoretical prediction. A zero&#8208;valence Pd1/BCN SAC was achieved on a BCN support with a relatively low B content. It exhibited much higher stability in a H2 reducing environment, and more strikingly, a hydrogenation activity, approximately 10 and 34&#8197;times greater than those high&#8208;valence Pd1/g&#8208;C3N4 and Pd1/BCN with a high B content, respectively.

         <title>Desymmetrization of Cyclic Sulfonimidamides by Asymmetric Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the desymmetrization of cyclic sulfonimidamides via a palladium catalyzed asymmetric allylation. The products are further elaborated to novel tricyclic ring systems containing a stereogenic sulfur center. Mechanistic insights to the origin of selectivity are highlighted through computational studies.







Abstract
Herein we report the first transition metal&#8208;catalyzed approach to the enantioenriched synthesis of cyclic sulfonimidamides relying on commercially available palladium catalysts and ligands. High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) was employed to identify the optimal catalyst system and solvent. The method is applied to a variety of saturated and unsaturated rings and exhibits the highest selectivity for 2&#8208;substituted allyl electrophiles. The products are further elaborated to complex, tricyclic scaffolds. DFT experiments presented herein highlight the key ligand substrate interactions leading to the high levels of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Selective Increase in CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol Activity at Nanograin&#8208;Boundary&#8208;Rich Mixed Cu(I)/Cu(0) Sites via Enriching Co&#8208;Adsorbed CO and Hydroxyl Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ethylene generation pathway is usually thermodynamically preferred due to its lower activation energy barrier relative to ethanol product. Herein, we showed a method to high&#8208;efficiency CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion by enhancing the co&#8208;adsorption of *CO and hydroxyl (*OH) species over a Cu2O&#8208;derived nanocubic catalyst featured with abundant &#8220;embossment&#8208;like&#8221; structured boundaries.







Abstract
Selective producing ethanol from CO2 electroreduction is highly demanded, yet the competing ethylene generation route is commonly more thermodynamically preferred. Herein, we reported an efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion (53.5&#8201;% faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.75&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE)) over an oxide&#8208;derived nanocubic catalyst featured with abundant &#8220;embossment&#8208;like&#8221; structured grain&#8208;boundaries. The catalyst also attains a 23.2&#8201;% energy efficiency to ethanol within a flow cell reactor. In situ spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis identified that these dualphase Cu(I) and Cu(0) sites stabilized by grain&#8208;boundaries are very robust over the operating potential window, which maintains a high concentration of co&#8208;adsorbed *CO and hydroxyl (*OH) species. Theoretical calculations revealed that the presence of *OHad not only promote the easier dimerization of *CO to form *OCCO (&#916;G~0.20&#8197;eV) at low overpotentials but also preferentially favor the key *CHCOH intermediate hydrogenation to *CHCHOH (ethanol pathway) while suppressing its dehydration to *CCH (ethylene pathway), which is believed to determine the remarkable ethanol selectivity. Such imperative intermediates associated with the bifurcation pathway were directly distinguished by isotope labelling in situ infrared spectroscopy. Our work promotes the understanding of bifurcating mechanism of CO2ER&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons more deeply, providing a feasible strategy for the design of efficient ethanol&#8208;targeted catalysts.

         <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride as a Photocatalyst for Decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Couplings via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation using a metallaphotoredox approach is a key method for rapidly building molecular complexity. In this work, we demonstrate that graphitic carbon nitride, a heterogeneous semiconductor, can act as a suitable photocatalyst to induce decarboxylative bond formation. A broad scope of coupling partners is presented, in addition to photocatalyst recycling, analysis, and mechanistic investigations.







Abstract
The development of robust and reliable methods for the construction of C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds is vital for accessing an increased array of structurally diverse scaffolds in drug discovery and development campaigns. While significant advances towards this goal have been achieved using metallaphotoredox chemistry, many of these methods utilise photocatalysts based on precious&#8208;metals due to their efficient redox processes and tuneable properties. However, due to the cost, scarcity, and toxicity of these metals, the search for suitable replacements should be a priority. Here, we show the use of commercially available heterogeneous semiconductor graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) as a photocatalyst, combined with nickel catalysis, for the cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halide and carboxylic acid coupling partners. gCN has been shown to engage in single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer (SET) and energy&#8208;transfer (EnT) processes for the formation of C&#8722;X bonds, and in this manuscript we overcome previous limitations to furnish C&#8722;C over C&#8722;O bonds using carboxylic acids. A broad scope of both aryl halides and carboxylic acids is presented, and recycling of the photocatalyst demonstrated. The mechanism of the reaction is also investigated.

         <title>Antigen Delivery Controlled by an On&#8208;Demand Photorelease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) shuttles peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for the loading of Major Histocompatibility Complex class&#8197;I (MHC&#8197;I) molecules. Here, we established an approach to precisely control antigen transport by light. Upon a photochemically induced &#8216;burst&#8217; of antigens, we investigated peptide translocation by single&#8208;organelle recordings within the native peptide loading complex (PLC) containing TAP.







Abstract
To eliminate infected and cancerous cells, antigen processing and presentation play a pivotal role through the recognition of antigenic peptides displayed on Major Histocompatibility Complex class&#8197;I (MHC&#8197;I) molecules. Here, we developed a photostimulated antigen release system that enables the temporal inception of antigen flux. Simple and effective photocaging of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#8208;Nef73&#8208;derived epitope, a representative high&#8208;affinity MHC&#8197;I ligand, was provided by steric hindrance to block the recognition by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) in the peptide loading complex (PLC). In response to light, a heteronomous release of antigens and subsequent translocation in various scenarios is demonstrated, including a TAP&#8208;related ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) transporter reconstituted in liposomes and the native PLC in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane of human cells. The photochemically induced &#8216;burst&#8217; of antigens opens new opportunities for a mechanistic analysis of the antigen translocation machinery and will help to provide insights into antigen processing pathways via an on&#8208;demand, subcellular pulse&#8208;chase release of antigens.

         <title>Modulating Hydrogen Shuttling in Ammonia by Neutral and Cationic Boron&#8208;Containing Frustrated Lewis Pairs (FLPs)</title>

Abstract
Xanthene&#8208;backbone FLPs featuring secondary borane functions &#8722;B(ArX)H (where ArX=C6F5 (ArF) or C6Cl5 (ArCl)) have been targeted through reactions of the dihydroboranes Me2S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BArXH2 with [4,5&#8208;xanth(PR2)Li]2 (R=Ph, iPr), and investigated in the synthesis of related cationic systems via hydride abstraction. The reactivity of these systems (both cationic and charge neutral) with ammonia have been probed, with a view to probing the potential for proton shuttling via N&#8722;H bond &#8216;activation.&#8217; We find that in the case of four&#8208;coordinate boron systems (cationic or change neutral), the N&#8722;H linkage remains intact, supported by a NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;P hydrogen bond which is worth up to 17&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 thermodynamically, and enabled by planarization of the flexible xanthene scaffold. For cationic three coordinate systems, N&#8208;to&#8208;P proton transfer is viable, driven by the ability of the boron centre to stabilise the [NH2]&#8722; conjugate base through N&#8208;to&#8208;B &#960; bonding. This proton transfer can be shown to be reversible in the presence of excess ammonia, depending on the nature of the B&#8208;bound ArX group. It is viable in the case of C6F5 substituents, but is prevented by the more sterically encumbering and secondary donor&#8208;stabilising capabilities of the C6Cl5 substituent.

         <title>Interfacial Domino Effect Triggered by &#946;&#8208;Alanine Cations Realized Highly Reversible Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;ionized Ala+ cations trigger a domino effect after electrostatic adsorption at IHP. The electrostatic shielding regulates crystal energetic preference and realizes crystallographic optimization. The moderative electro&#8208;reduction kinetics caused by the adsorbed Ala+ realize the balance between interfacial consumption rate of Zn2+ ions and mass transfer rate, restrains the formation of concentration polarization and anion&#8208;depleted boundary.







Abstract
Realizing durative dense, dendrite&#8208;free, and no by&#8208;product deposition configuration on Zn anodes is crucial to solving the short circuit and premature failure of batteries, which is simultaneously determined by the Zn interface chemistry, electro&#8208;reduction kinetics, mass transfer process, and their interaction. Herein, this work unmasks a domino effect of the &#946;&#8208;alanine cations (Ala+) within the hydrogel matrix, which effectively triggers the subsequent electrostatic shielding and beneficial knock&#8208;on effects via the specifical adsorption earliest event on the Zn anode surface. The electrostatic shielding effect regulates the crystallographic energetic preference of Zn deposits and retards fast electro&#8208;reduction kinetics, thereby steering stacked stockier block morphology and realizing crystallographic optimization. Meanwhile, the mass transfer rate of Zn2+ ions was accelerated via the SO42&#8722; anion immobilized caused by Ala+ in bulk electrolyte, finally bringing the balance between electroreduction kinetics and mass transfer process, which enables dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition behavior. Concomitantly, the interfacial adsorbed Ala+ cations facilitate the electrochemical reduction of interfacial SO42&#8722; anions to form the inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid solid electrolyte interphase layer. The above domino effects immensely improve the utilization efficiency of Zn anodes and long&#8208;term stability, as demonstrated by the 12&#8197;times longer life of Zn||Zn cells (3650&#8197;h) and ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency (99.4&#8201;%).

         <title>SERS Detection of Trace Carcinogenic Aromatic Amines Based on Amorphous MoO3 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous MoO3 (a&#8208;MoO3) monolayers exhibit high SERS performance due to the EM&#8208;PIHET synergistic effect. It is capable of trace detection and identification of carcinogenic aromatic amines with good uniformity, acid resistance and thermal stability, which is of great significance for reducing cancer risk.







Abstract
Aromatic amines are important commercial chemicals, but their carcinogenicity poses a threat to humans and other organisms, making their rapid quantitative detection increasingly urgent. Here, amorphous MoO3 (a&#8208;MoO3) monolayers with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in the visible region are designed for the trace detection of carcinogenic aromatic amine molecules. The hot&#8208;electron fast decay component of a&#8208;MoO3 decreases from 301&#8197;fs to 150&#8197;fs after absorption with methyl orange (MO) molecules, indicating the plasmon&#8208;induced hot&#8208;electron transfer (PIHET) process from a&#8208;MoO3 to MO. Therefore, a&#8208;MoO3 monolayers present high SERS performance due to the synergistic effect of electromagnetic enhancement (EM) and PIHET, proposing the EM&#8208;PIHET synergistic mechanism in a&#8208;MoO3. In addition, a&#8208;MoO3 possesses higher electron delocalization and electronic state density than crystal MoO3 (c&#8208;MoO3), which is conducive to the PIHET. The limit of detection (LOD) for o&#8208;aminoazotoluene (o&#8208;AAT) is 10&#8722;9&#8197;M with good uniformity, acid resistance, and thermal stability. In this work, trace detection and identification of various carcinogenic aromatic amines based on a&#8208;MoO3 monolayers is realized, which is of great significance for reducing cancer infection rates.

Hexagonal comb cells of honeybees can be mimicked by assembling nanoscale molecular cylinders as reported by Hiroyuki Isobe et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202406502). The molecular honeycomb encapsulated various guests with 32 different structures, which were further diversified by 6 substituents, 3 stereochemistries and 2 intercalants. Although weak CH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds were used to assemble the cylinders, the 2D crystal was grown up to the centimeter scale, allowing for mechanical exfoliation.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Chiral Tetrakis Eu(III) Complexes with Ammonium Cations for Improved Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large dissymmetry factor of circularly polarized luminescence (gCPL) was observed in chiral tetrakis europium (Eu(III)) complexes with ammonium cations, as reported by Yasuchika Hasegawa et&#8197;al in their Communication (e202405584). The maximum gCPL value was estimated to be &#8722;1.54, which is the largest among chiral luminescent molecules. The CPL brightness of chiral Eu(III) complexes with ammonium cations were also larger than those of previous chiral Eu(III) complex with Cs+.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Plastic and Biomass&#8208;Derived Polyols to Formamide under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported an electrocatalytic strategy to upgrade plastic and biomass to formamide in the presence of NH3 over a WO3 catalyst under ambient conditions. Facilitated by nucleophilic attack of in situ formed nitrogen radicals from NH3, the C&#8722;C bond in PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol and biomass&#8208;derived polyols were effectively cleaved with C&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic upgrading of wasted plastic and renewable biomass represents a sustainable method to produce chemicals but is limited to carbohydrates, leaving other value&#8208;added chemicals, such as organonitrogen compounds, being scarcely explored. Herein, we reported an electrocatalytic oxidation strategy to transform polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) and biomass&#8208;derived polyols into formamide, in the presence of ammonia (NH3) over a tungsten oxide (WO3) catalyst. Taking EG&#8208;to&#8208;formamide as an example, we achieved a high formamide productivity of 537.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with FE of 43.2&#8201;% at a constant current of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow electrolyzer with 12&#8208;h test, representing a more advantageous performance compared with previous reports for formamide electrosynthesis. Mechanistic understanding revealed that the cleavage of the C&#8722;C bond in the EG was facilitated by nucleophilic attack of in situ formed nitrogen radicals from NH3, with resultant C&#8722;N bond construction and eventually formamide production. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to transformation of PET bottle and a series of biomass&#8208;derived polyols with carbon number from three (glycerol) to six (glucose), producing formamide with high efficiencies. This work demonstrates a sustainable upgrading strategy of plastic and biomass that may have implications to more value&#8208;added chemicals production beyond carbohydrates.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase&#8208;Supported Chemoenzymatic Synthesis and Analysis of Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoenzymatic synthesis has been successfully performed producing the longest homogeneous chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycopeptides to date. Compared to more traditional chemical synthesis, this new strategy was much more efficient, which could reduce the total number of synthetic steps by 80&#8201;%. The availability of well&#8208;defined CS glycopeptides enabled the study of the impacts of sulfation on glycopeptide structures and functions.







Abstract
Proteoglycans (PGs), consisting of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked with the core protein through a tetrasaccharide linkage region, play roles in many important biological events. The chemical synthesis of PG glycopeptides is extremely challenging. In this work, the enzymes required for synthesis of chondroitin sulfate (CS) PG (CSPG) have been expressed and the suitable sequence of enzymatic reactions has been established. To expedite CSPG synthesis, the peptide acceptor was immobilized on solid phase and the glycan units were directly installed enzymatically onto the peptide. Subsequent enzymatic chain elongation and sulfation led to the successful synthesis of CSPG glycopeptides. The CS dodecasaccharide glycopeptide was the longest homogeneous CS glycopeptide synthesized to date. The enzymatic synthesis was much more efficient than the chemical synthesis of the corresponding CS glycopeptides, which could reduce the total number of synthetic steps by 80&#8201;%. The structures of the CS glycopeptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis and NMR studies. In addition, the interactions between the CS glycopeptides and cathepsin G were studied. The sulfation of glycan chain was found to be important for binding with cathepsin G. This efficient chemoenzymatic strategy opens new avenues to investigate the structures and functions of PGs.

         <dc:description>
A synergistic platform towards 4&#8242;&#8208;thionucleosides is presented that enables both biocatalytic nucleobase diversification from 4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine in a one&#8208;pot process and chemical functionalization to access new entities. This approach delivers entry to pyrimidine and purine 4&#8242;&#8208;thionucleosides, and chemoenzymatic synthesis provided 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine as a novel nucleoside probe to monitor RNA synthesis.







Abstract
Nucleoside and nucleotide analogues have proven to be transformative in the treatment of viral infections and cancer. One branch of structural modification to deliver new nucleoside analogue classes explores replacement of canonical ribose oxygen with a sulfur atom. Whilst biological activity of such analogues has been shown in some cases, widespread exploration of this compound class is hitherto hampered by the lack of a straightforward and universal nucleobase diversification strategy. Herein, we present a synergistic platform enabling both biocatalytic nucleobase diversification from 4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine in a one&#8208;pot process, and chemical functionalization to access new entities. This methodology delivers entry across pyrimidine and purine 4&#8242;&#8208;thionucleosides, paving a way for wider synthetic and biological exploration. We exemplify our approach by enzymatic synthesis of 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine on multi&#8208;milligram scale and from here switch to complete chemical synthesis of a novel nucleoside analogue probe, 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;thiouridine. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this probe to monitor RNA synthesis in proliferating HeLa cells, validating its capability as a new metabolic RNA labelling tool.

         <title>Cover Picture: A Bioorthogonal Dual Fluorogenic Probe for the Live&#8208;Cell Monitoring of Nutrient Uptake by Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monitoring nutrient uptake in cells has been very difficult to date due to fluorophore artefacts. In their Research Article (e202401733), Sander&#8197;I. van&#8197;Kasteren et&#8197;al. report a new way of monitoring nutrient uptake. They developed a CFSE&#8208;based dual&#8208;quenched probe that becomes fluorogenic in the cytosol, and fluorescent when it reacts with incumbent nutrients labelled with click&#8208;reactive nutrients. The cover image was made by Dr. Kim Wals of KW Science Art using glass beads, embroidery silks and felt, with each individually knotted bead representative of a cellular component or molecular mechanism from the highlighted paper.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Amino Acid Building Blocks for Bioorthogonal Peptide Macrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of non&#8208;proteogenic amino acids (NPAAs) containing hypervalent iodine reagents &#8208;ethynylbenziodoxoles (EBxs)&#8208; is described. These NPAAs were compatible with both solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and solution peptide synthesis (SPS), allowing the introduction of reactive handles on specific sites in the presence of multiple identical residues. The obtained peptide&#8208;EBXs can be applied to the synthesis of cyclic peptides with unique topological properties.







Abstract
Ethynylbenziodoxol(on)es (EB(X)xs) reagents have emerged as useful reagents for peptide/protein modification due to their versatile reactivity and high selectivity. Herein, we report the successful introduction of ethynylbenziodoxoles (EBxs) on different amino acid building blocks (Lys/Orn/Dap), and show their compatibility with both solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and solution phase peptide synthesis (SPS). The selective incorporation of the EBx core into peptide sequences enable efficient macrocyclizations under mild conditions for the synthesis of topologically unique cyclic and bicyclic peptides.

         <title>Engineering Single&#8208;Atom Sites with the Irving&#8211;Williams Series for the Simultaneous Co&#8208;photocatalytic CO2 Reduction and CH3CHO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to engineer single&#8208;atom sites from d5 to d10, the Irving&#8211;Williams series was employed to accurately predict the highest stability and fastest charge&#8208;transfer efficiency. As predicted, Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs exhibits a higher activity towards the photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and the photooxidation of CH3CHO&#8208;to&#8208;CH3COOH, far surpassing other metal&#8208;SASs/CPFs.







Abstract
The bonding effects between 3d transition&#8208;metal single sites and supports originate from crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE). The 3d transition&#8208;metal atoms of the spontaneous geometrical distortions, that is the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, can alter CFSE, thereby leading to the Irving&#8211;Williams series. However, engineering single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) using the Irving&#8211;Williams series as an ideal guideline has not been reported to date. Herein, alkynyl&#8208;linked covalent phenanthroline frameworks (CPFs) with phenanthroline units are developed to anchor the desired 3d single metal ions from d5 to d10 (Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+). The Irving&#8211;Williams series was employed to accurately predict the bonding effects between 3d transition&#8208;metal atoms and phenanthroline units. To verify this, theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs exhibits higher stability and faster charge&#8208;transfer efficiency, far surpassing other metal&#8208;SASs/CPFs. As expected, Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs demonstrates a high photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO activity (~30.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and an exceptional photooxidation of CH3CHO&#8208;to&#8208;CH3COOH activity (~24.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1). Interestingly, the generated *O2&#8722; is derived from the process of CO2 reduction, thereby triggering a CH3CHO oxidation reaction. This work provides a novel design concept for designing SASs by the Irving&#8211;Williams to regulate the catalytic performances.

         <title>Lithium Borate Polycarbonates for High&#8208;Capacity Solid&#8208;State Composite Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More elastic, softer, lithium borate substituted polycarbonates show higher ionic conductivity than counterparts with more rigid structures. These leading polymers are used as binders in composite cathodes with nickel&#8208;rich cathode, sulfide solid electrolyte and carbon. The cells show higher capacity and excellent retention of capacity over 300&#8197;charge/discharge cycles at a commercially realistic 1&#8197;MPa applied pressure.







Abstract
Improving composite cathode function is key to the success of the solid&#8208;state battery. Maximizing attainable cathode capacity and retention requires integrating suitable polymeric binders that retain a sufficiently high ionic conductivity and long&#8208;term chemo&#8208;mechanical stability of the cathode active material&#8208;solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;carbon mixture. Herein, we report block copolymer networks composed of lithium borate polycarbonates and poly(ethylene oxide) that improved the capacity (200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.75&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and capacity retention (94&#8201;% over 300&#8197;cycles) of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state composite cathodes with nickel&#8208;rich LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode active material, Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte, and carbon. Tetrahedral B(OR)2(OH)2&#8722; anions immobilized on the polycarbonate segments provide hydrogen&#8208;bonding chain crosslinking and selective Li&#8208;counterion conductivity, parameterized by Li&#8208;ion transference numbers close to unity (tLi+~0.94). With 90&#8197;wt&#8201;% polycarbonate content and a flexible low glass transition temperature backbone, the single&#8208;ion conductors achieved high Li&#8208;ion conductivities of 0.2&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. The work should inform future binder design for improving the processability of cathode composites towards commercializing solid&#8208;state batteries, and allow use in other cell configurations, such as lithium&#8208;sulphur cathode designs.

         <title>Force Transduction Through Distant Force&#8208;Bearing Regioisomeric Linkages Affects the Mechanochemical Reactivity of Cyclobutane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized three non&#8208;scissile 1,2&#8208;diphenyl cyclobutanes, varying their linkage to the polymer backbone via the o, m, or p&#8208;position of the diphenyl substituents. Even though the regioisomers share the same substituted cyclobutane core structure and similar electronic stabilization of the diradical intermediate from cleaving the first C&#8722;C bond, the p isomer exhibited significantly higher mechanochemical reactivity than the o and m isomers.







Abstract
Fundamental understanding of mechanochemical reactivity is important for designing new mechanophores. Besides the core structure of mechanophores, substituents on a mechanophore can affect its mechanochemical reactivity through electronic stabilization of the intermediate or effectiveness of force transduction from the polymer backbone to the mechanophore. The latter factor represents a unique mechanical effect in considering polymer mechanochemistry. Here, we show that regioisomeric linkage that is not directly adjacent to the first cleaving bond in cyclobutane can still significantly affect the mechanochemical reactivity of the mechanophore. We synthesized three non&#8208;scissile 1,2&#8208;diphenyl cyclobutanes, varying their linkage to the polymer backbone via the o, m, or p&#8208;position of the diphenyl substituents. Even though the regioisomers share the same substituted cyclobutane core structure and similar electronic stabilization of the diradical intermediate from cleaving the first C&#8722;C bond, the p isomer exhibited significantly higher mechanochemical reactivity than the o and m isomers. The observed difference in reactivity can be rationalized as the much more effective force transduction to the scissile bond through the p&#8208;position than the other two substitution positions. These findings point to the importance of considering force&#8208;bearing linkages that are more distant from the bond to be cleaved when incorporating mechanophores into polymer backbones.

Here, we show that regioisomeric linkage that is not directly adjacent to the first cleaving bond in cyclobutane can still significantly affect the mechanochemical reactivity of the mechanophore. We synthesized three non-scissile 1,2-diphenyl cyclobutanes, varying their linkage to the polymer backbone via the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-position of the diphenyl substituents. Even though the regioisomers share the same substituted cyclobutane core structure and similar electronic stabilization of the diradical intermediate from cleaving the first C&#8722;C bond, the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; isomer exhibited significantly higher mechanochemical reactivity than the &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; isomers. The observed difference in reactivity can be rationalized as the much more effective force transduction to the scissile bond through the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-position than the other two substitution positions. These findings point to the importance of considering force-bearing linkages that are more distant from the bond to be cleaved when incorporating mechanophores into polymer backbones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;induced dynamic metal nanocrystal/semiconductor interfaces during carbon dioxide electroreduction were investigated by utilizing synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, as reported by Hao Ming Chen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202403333). The dynamic structural transformations of metal/semiconductor junction under illumination result in an intriguing selectivity switch and realize an improvement of at least 16&#8208;fold in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Oxidation of Alcohols in Gold&#8208;Coated Milling Vessels via Direct Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovating in selective alcohol oxidation, our study unveils a gold&#8208;catalyzed direct mechanocatalytic approach, boasting &gt;95&#8201;% aldehyde conversion with &lt;0.3&#8201;% overoxidation and minimal gold abrasion. Optimized parameters ensure efficiency and sustainability across alcohols, with high catalyst reusability. XPS surface analysis of the gold milling balls highlight the oxidation mechanism and its potential in green chemistry.







Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach for the selective oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding aldehydes through direct mechanocatalysis, employing a gold&#8208;coated milling vessel as catalyst and air as the oxidation agent. By adjusting milling frequency, media, and duration, high catalytic efficiencies and selectivities are achieved. Remarkably, yields of up to 99&#8201;% are obtained for specific substrates, with a turnover number (TON) of 8200 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.77&#8197;s&#8722;1, surpassing existing alternatives. Confirmation of the catalytic reaction indeed occurring on the milling tool surface was achieved through X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

         <dc:description>
Catalytic cyclopropanation reactions are demonstrated in the Research Article (e202403485) by Koji Oohora, Takashi Hayashi et&#8197;al. using myoglobins reconstituted with artificial cofactors with various redox potentials. The cover image illustrates this catalysis by showing two types of protein&#8208;based trucks carrying rice ears (starting material) to produce rice sacks (product). The elevation profiles of the routes represent the differences in the reaction energy at the active center for each cofactor. Representative artificial cofactors are shown as stick&#8208;and&#8208;ball models.

         <title>Catalytic Nitrogen Fixation Using Well&#8208;Defined Molecular Catalysts under Ambient or Mild Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined molecular transition metal complexes have been found to work as catalysts to convert N2 into NH3 under ambient reaction conditions, where involvement of both N2&#8208;splitting pathway and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer has been effective for high catalytic activity. Direct electrocatalytic and photocatalytic NH3 formation, selective catalytic hydrazine formation, and catalytic C&#8722;Si or C&#8722;N bond formation have been also established.







Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is industrially produced from dinitrogen (N2) and dihydrogen (H2) by the Haber&#8211;Bosch process, although H2 is prepared from fossil fuels, and the reaction requires harsh conditions. On the other hand, microorganisms have fixed nitrogen under ambient reaction conditions. Recently, well&#8208;defined molecular transition metal complexes have been found to work as catalyst to convert N2 into NH3 by reactions with chemical reductants and proton sources under ambient reaction conditions. Among them, involvement of both N2&#8208;splitting pathway and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer is found to be very effective for high catalytic activity. Furthermore, direct electrocatalytic and photocatalytic conversions of N2 into NH3 have been recently achieved. In addition to catalytic formation of NH3, selective catalytic conversion of N2 into hydrazine (NH2NH2) and catalytic silylation of N2 into silylamines have been reported. Catalytic C&#8722;N bond formation has been more recently established to afford cyanate anion (NCO&#8722;) under ambient reaction conditions. Further development of direct conversion of N2 into nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds as well as green ammonia synthesis leading to the use of ammonia as an energy carrier is expected.

         <title>Amorphous MnRuOx Containing Microcrystalline for Enhanced Acidic Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimal amorphous MnRuOx and RuO2 crystalline heterostructures are critical in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the acidic OER. The microcrystalline regions in the catalyst serve as a supporting framework, while the amorphous phase fills the microcrystalline interstices, thus providing substantial defects and active sites at the interfaces to facilitate efficient adsorption/conversion of OH&#8722; and charge transfer.







Abstract
Compared to Ir, Ru&#8208;based catalysts often exhibited higher activity but suffered significant and rapid activity loss during the challenging oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a corrosive acidic environment. Herein, we developed a hybrid MnRuOx catalyst in which the RuO2 microcrystalline regions serve as a supporting framework, and the amorphous MnRuOx phase fills the microcrystalline interstices. In particular, the MnRuOx&#8208;300 catalyst from an annealing temperature of 300&#8201;&#176;C contains an optimal amorphous/crystalline heterostructure, providing substantial defects and active sites, facilitating efficient adsorption and conversion of OH&#8722;. In addition, the heterostructure leads to a relative increase of the d&#8208;band center close to the Fermin level, thus accelerating electron transfer with reduced charge transfer resistance at the active interface between crystalline and amorphous phases during the OER. The catalyst was further thoroughly evaluated under various operating conditions and demonstrated exceptional activity and stability for the OER, representing a promising solution to replace Ir in water electrolyzers.

         <title>LiF&#8208;Rich Alloy&#8208;Doped SEI Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable and High&#8208;Rate Li Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron&#8208;donating feature of the spontaneously formed Li&#8722;Au alloy promotes the directional decomposition of LiTFSI to form a LiF&#8208;rich alloy&#8208;doped composite functional SEI layer, which is more conducive to the rapid and uniform transport of Li ions, and a high&#8208;rate dendrite&#8208;free stable anode interface was obtained.







Abstract
Li metal is regarded as the &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; in the next generation of anode materials due to its high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. However, sluggish Li ions interfacial transport kinetics and uncontrollable Li dendrites growth limit practical application of the energy storage system in high&#8208;power device. Herein, separators are modified by the addition of a coating, which spontaneously grafts onto the Li anode interface for in situ lithiation. The resultant alloy possessing of strong electron&#8208;donating property promotes the decomposition of lithium bistrifluoromethane sulfonimide in the electrolyte to form a LiF&#8208;rich alloy&#8208;doped solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. High ionic alloy solid solution diffusivity and electric field dispersion modulation accelerate Li ions transport and uniform stripping/plating, resulting in a high&#8208;power dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode interface. Surprisingly, the formulated SEI layer achieves an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of over 8000&#8197;h (20,000&#8197;cycles) for symmetric cells at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It also ensures that the NCM(811)//PP@Au//Li full cell at ultra&#8208;high currents (40&#8197;C) completes the charging/discharging process in only 68&#8197;s to provide high capacity of 151&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The results confirm that this scalable strategy has great development potential in realizing high power dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode.

         <title>Harnessing Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions for Water&#8208;Lean Solvation Chemistry: Achieving High&#8208;Stability Zn Anodes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate with high permanent dipole moments effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, forming a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+ and improved interfacial characteristics of electrodes, thus improving the Zn plating/stripping reversibility.







Abstract
The reversibility and stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are largely limited by water&#8208;induced interfacial parasitic reactions. Here, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate (DP) is introduced to tailor primary solvation sheath and inner&#8208;Helmholtz configurations for robust zinc anode. Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, DP with high permanent dipole moments can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Thus, interfacial side reactions can be suppressed through a shielding effect. Meanwhile, lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of DP also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Thus, these merits endow the Zn anode with a high&#8208;stability performance exceeds 3800&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Zn batteries and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% at 4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Cu batteries. Benefiting from the stable zinc anode, the Zn||NH4V4O10 cell maintains 80.3&#8201;% of initial discharge capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and exhibits a high retention rate of 99.4&#8201;% against to the initial capacity during the self&#8208;discharge characterizations.

         <title>Re&#8208;Engineering Fungal Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases by Module Dissection and Duplicated Thiolation Domains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is presented to dissect fungal nonribosomal peptide synthetases into &#8220;splitting unit&#8221; pairs (SUPs). Collaboration in SUPs is facilitated by artificial duplication of the thiolation domain and its linkers, and an optimized split site. The productivities of SUPs match or exceed those of the corresponding single&#8208;subunit chimeras or even those of native fungal enzymes, boding well for generating novel peptide natural product analogues.







Abstract
Unnatural product (uNP) nonribosomal peptides promise to be a valuable source of pharmacophores for drug discovery. However, the extremely large size and complexity of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymes pose formidable challenges to the production of such uNPs by combinatorial biosynthesis and synthetic biology. Here we report a new NRPS dissection strategy that facilitates the engineering and heterologous production of these NRPSs. This strategy divides NRPSs into &#8220;splitting units&#8221;, each forming an enzyme subunit that contains catalytically independent modules. Functional collaboration between the subunits is then facilitated by artificially duplicating, at the N&#8208;terminus of the downstream subunit, the linker &#8208; thiolation domain &#8208; linker fragment that is resident at the C&#8208;terminus of the upstream subunit. Using the suggested split site that follows a conserved motif in the linker connecting the adenylation and the thiolation domains allows cognate or chimeric splitting unit pairs to achieve productivities that match, and in many cases surpass those of hybrid chimeric enzymes, and even those of intact NRPSs, upon production in a heterologous chassis. Our strategy provides facile options for the rational engineering of fungal NRPSs and for the combinatorial reprogramming of nonribosomal peptide production.

A novel hole&#8208;transporting material [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;glycol monomethyl ether&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) butyl]phosphonic acid (GM&#8208;4PACz) is synthesized by introducing glycol monomethyl ether (GM) at carbazolyl unit, which facilitates the spreading of perovskite, has well matching energy band with perovskite, suppresses defects and releases residual stress at buried interface of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). Consequently, GM&#8208;4PACz&#8208;based IPSCs engender a high efficiency of 25.52&#8201;% and an excellent operational stability.







Abstract
Organic self&#8208;assembled molecules (OSAMs) based hole&#8208;transporting materials play a pivotal role in achieving highly efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). However, the reported carbazol&#8208;based OSAMs have serious drawbacks, such as poor wettability for perovskite solution spreading due to the nonpolar surface, worse matched energy arrangement with perovskite, and limited molecular species, which greatly limit the device performance. To address above problems, a novel OSAM [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;glycol monomethyl ether&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) butyl]phosphonic acid (GM&#8208;4PACz) was synthesized as hole&#8208;transporting material by introducing glycol monomethyl ether (GM) side chains at carbazolyl unit. GM groups enhance the surface energy of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)/SAM substrate to facilitate the nucleation and growth of up perovskite film, suppress cation defects, release the residual stress at SAM/perovskite interface, and evaluate energy level for matching with perovskite. Consequently, the GM&#8208;4PACz based IPSC achieves a champion PCE of 25.52&#8201;%, a respectable open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.21&#8197;V, a high stability, possessing 93.29&#8201;% and 91.75&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after aging in air for 2000&#8197;h or tracking at maximum power point for 1000&#8197;h, respectively.

The neighbouring synergy in high&#8208;density Ir single atoms for alkaline electrocatalytic oxygen evolution is described by Chuanyi Jia, Zhirong Zhang, and Jun Bao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404418). The neighbouring Ir single atoms stabilize the *OOH intermediates via additional hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, thus significantly reducing the reaction energy barriers compared to isolated Ir single atoms. The discovery of the synergetic interaction in neighbouring Ir single atoms offers guidance for developing efficient electrocatalysts.
