         <title>Corrosion of Calcium Metal in Ca(TFSI)2/DMAc Electrolyte and its Solution  via  Alloy Interface and Competitive Solvation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calcium metal batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high theoretical capacity and the abundance of calcium, but suffer from the incompatible electrolyte with calcium metal. Here, we unveil two types of corrosion of calcium metal in Ca(TFSI)2/DMAc electrolytes: native passivation from solvent reduction during aging and electrochemical corrosion from anion decomposition. The native passivation layer shows cracks in the calcium metal surface and the passivation layer aggravates the electrochemical corrosion by the decomposition of TSFI&#8722; to the large grain Ca2+&#8208;insulator CaF2, leading to the calcium metal battery failure. We introduce bifunctional SnI2 electrolyte additive to simultaneously mitigate both corrosions. The Sn2+ cations facilitate the spontaneous galvanic replacement reaction to form the Ca&#8208;Sn alloy, inhibiting native passivation, while the I&#8722; anions replace TSFI&#8722; to participate in the Ca2+ primary solvation shell and prevent the electrochemical TSFI&#8722; decomposition. By taking advantage of those features above, over 500 hours of stable cycling with a reduced overpotential of 0.33 V at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.1 mAh cm&#8722;2 were achieved, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ca(TFSI)2&#8208;based electrolytes. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of corrosion at calcium metal surface and will guide suitable electrolyte design for anti&#8208;corrosion in metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Chemo&#8208;divergent Hydrogenation of Ethylene Carbonate Enabled by Multi&#8208;functional Poly(ionic liquids)&#8208;stabilized Ru Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic carbonates, in particular ethylene carbonate (EC), are pivotal compounds across chemical sciences because of their unique properties. Although, their transformation into valuable products has attracted great attention, efficient and selective transformations remained challenging. In this work, we report a catalytic system composed of Ru nanoparticles stabilized by poly(ionic liquids) (Ru@PIL), that enable the selective chemo&#8208;divergent hydrogenation of EC into either EtOH and CO2 or EG and CH4, under mild and solvent&#8208;free conditions. Those transformations relied on the multi&#8208;task ability of PILs, which provide an efficient electrosteric protection of the NPs, good solubility in neat carbonates and an organocatalytic activity depending on the nature of the PIL counter&#8208;anions. Hence, PIL incorporating nucleophilic anions, such as I&#8208;, trigger the cascade transformation of EC into EtOH via a sequential decarboxylation&#8208;hydrogenation process. Conversely, in presence of non&#8208;nucleophilic anions, the PIL is catalytically spectator, yielding to the &#8220;direct hydrogenation&#8221; of EC by the RuNPs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Iron&#8208;Sulfur Cluster of Bacterioferritin&#8208;Associated Ferredoxin (Bfd): A &#8216;Biological Fuse&#8217; that Prevents Oxidative Damage to Cells?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron is in an essential micronutrient in living systems. However, it is also potentially toxic and so the concentration of chelatable iron within cells is tightly regulated to prevent catalytic formation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ferritins play a key role in iron homeostasis by storing excess iron as an insoluble ferric mineral within the protein. When bacterial cells become iron deficient, this store may be accessed by reduction/solubilisation of the iron. Bacterioferritins utilise heme, bound at an inter&#8208;subunit site, to support electron transfer to the stored mineral. Electrons for heme reduction are shuttled from NADPH via Bfd, a [2Fe&#8208;2S] cluster&#8208;containing ferredoxin. This raises the paradox that the synthesis of an iron&#8208;dependent protein cofactor is required under conditions of iron&#8208;deficiency so that stored iron can be utilised. Here we show that exposure of Bfd to ROS suppresses the capacity of the protein to stimulate iron release from bacterioferritin. We propose that reliance of iron release on Bfd evolved to ensure that chelatable iron levels do not increase under oxidative stress conditions. Thus, the Bfd iron&#8208;sulfur cluster functions as a &#8216;biological fuse&#8217; in providing a fail&#8208;safe that immediately halts iron release once ROS accumulate to damaging concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Chelation&#8208;Driven Electrolyte Design for Enhanced Interface and Electrochemical Window in Aqueous Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chelating agents have been reported as effective electrolyte additives in aqueous aluminum batteries. Bis(2&#8208;methoxyethyl)amine (BMEA), in particular, is believed to reshape the solvation structure, thereby enabling a wider electrochemical window. Additionally, it can participate in the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the aluminum surface, evidenced by atom probe topography (APT), effectively protecting the electrode from corrosion. Aqueous aluminum&#8211;organic batteries utilizing this electrolyte containing BMEA demonstrate high specific capacity and stable cycling performance.








Abstract
Aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries have garnered significant attention owing to the abundance of aluminum resources, high theoretical specific capacity, and excellent safety. However, challenges such as electrolyte&#8208;induced water decomposition, aluminum anode corrosion, and electrode material compatibility continue to constrain their performance. In this study, we restructured the solvation environment using the chelating reagent Bis(2&#8208;methoxyethyl)amine (BMEA), achieving an expanded electrochemical window of 2.2&#160;V and mitigating hydrogen evolution side reactions. Advanced atom probe tomography analysis confirmed that BMEA actively participates in the formation of the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), effectively preventing aluminum surface corrosion and extending the cycle life of the aluminum anode. Employed as a BMEA&#8208;containing electrolyte in aluminum&#8211;organic batteries, the resulting Al||Tetrachloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TCB) battery delivered a high capacity of 218.0&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and demonstrated stable cycling over 300 cycles. This study highlights the potential of chelating agents as additives in advancing high&#8208;performance aluminum batteries.

         <title>SPLICEIT Fluorescent Sensor for Integrating Dopamine Release with Cellular Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Single&#8208;chain protein&#8208;based ligand indication through a chimerically&#8208;engineered integrator tool&#8221; (SPLICEIT) is a G&#8208;protein coupled receptor&#8208;based sensor design that leaves a permanent fluorescent mark. We show dopamine detection in primary cultured neurons with a fourfold signal increase normalized to an mCherry (mCh) marker. The SPLICEIT design is generalizable and paves the way for further studies into neuromodulator release across the brain.








Abstract
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter essential for motor control, reward processing, and motivation through G&#8208;protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Recent GPCR&#8208;based real&#8208;time sensors allow for optical monitoring of dopamine release in behaving animals. However, there is still a need for high resolution mapping of dopamine release across large mouse brain volume for systemic studies. To fill this need, we have developed a new chimeric GPCR&#8208;based sensor to detect dopamine with a permanent green fluorescent mark through a combination of computational modeling and rational design. This new sensor, named &#8220;Single&#8208;chain Protein&#8208;based Ligand Indication through a Chimerically&#8208;Engineered Integrator Tool&#8221; (SPLICEIT), detects dopamine at cellular&#8208;resolution with high specificity and a fourfold signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio. We also developed a version of SPLICEIT whose signal can be normalized for varying sensor expression in cell culture and in vivo. This paves the way for further studies into dopamine release across the brain and enables the possibility of whole&#8208;brain dopamine mapping.

         <title>Synthesis of Porous Carbon&#8208;Based Network Containing Ultranarrow Nonplanar Nanopores on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective synthesis of nonplanar [32]annulene porous carbon&#8208;based network that contains the ultranarrow periodic nanopores on Au(111) have been achieved. The reaction mechanisms were confirmed by a series of control experiments. A significant hole doping due to charge transfer from [32]annulene porous carbon&#8208;based network to Au(111) substrate was revealed by experimental and calculated characterizations.








Abstract
Introduction of twisted structures into low&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;based nanostructures has important ramifications on their inherent physical behavior. The fabrication of graphene derivatives with nonplanar characteristics remains challenging, especially for extended two&#8208;dimensional&#160;(2D) structures. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel nonplanar [32]annulene porous carbon&#8208;based network that contains the narrowest periodic nanopores and exhibits the highest negative curvature among 2D nonplanar carbon&#8208;based nanostructures synthesized up to date. The success is driven by the dissymmetrical debromination and regioselective coupling reactions of precursor molecules on Au(111) surface, as corroborated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES). We characterize electronic properties of the [32]annulene porous carbon&#8208;based network with the aid of scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and demonstrate a significant hole doping induced by interfacial charge transfer between the nonplanar nanoarchitecture and the Au(111) substrate.

         <title>Rationally Designed Asymmetric Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Cu Ligand to Stabilize Active Sites Towards Superior Industrial&#8208;Standard Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Cu ligand located in PtCu2(111)/CuO(002) heterojunction interface effectively balance the adsorption and dissociation of reaction intermediates at different active sites, and simultaneously prevent the dissolution or agglomeration of Pt and Cu atoms. 








Abstract
Developing efficient and durable Pt&#8208;based catalysts via interface engineering remains a critical yet challenging task for water electrolysis under high&#8208;pH conditions. Herein, we design a unique asymmetric Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Cu ligand at the PtCu2(111)/CuO(002) heterojunction interface to promote alkaline HER kinetics. This ligand balances the adsorption and desorption of H* on the Pt site by accelerating electron transfer at the interface while enhancing the adsorption of H2O on the Cu site. Moreover, the strong d&#8208;d/sp hybridization and more delocalized d&#8208;DOS located at the Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Cu ligand enhance the interatomic interactions, which helps alleviate the dissolution and agglomeration of Pt and Cu atoms. As anticipated, the PtCu2/CuO requires ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 10, 14 and 47&#160;mV in, respectively, alkaline, acidic and neutral electrolytes to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Even more surprising is that the PtCu2/CuO||RuO2 dual&#8208;electrode hydrolysis cell can stably operate at a high current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 for more than 500&#160;h in a simulated industrial environment, demonstrating significant potential for industrial applications. This work provides a new paradigm for the design of industrially relevant high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based alkaline hydrogen evolution catalytic materials.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Driven In Situ Formation of Bimetallic Catalysts via Sn2+/Sn4+ Interconversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative in situ redox&#8208;driven strategy utilizes Sn2+/Sn4+ ions interconversion for the synthesis of Sn&#8208;based bimetallic catalysts. This approach involves immobilizing Sn2+ ions on Al&#8208;deficient alumina, followed by secondary metal ions capture via redox reactions.








Abstract
Bimetallic catalysts have garnered substantial interest across diverse fields due to their distinctive geometric and electronic structures. Nevertheless, achieving uniformly distributed bimetallic catalysts remains challenging due to the solubility or charge properties of ions in specific bimetallic systems. Herein, we present an innovative in situ redox&#8208;driven synthesis strategy utilizing Sn2+/Sn4+ interconversion to address these challenges. By immobilizing Sn2+ ions on Al&#8208;deficient alumina and capturing secondary metal ions through redox reactions, we successfully synthesized eight distinct Sn&#8211;M bimetallic catalysts. The representative Sn&#8211;Pt catalysts derived from [PtCl4]2&#8722; or [Pt(NH3)4]2+ ions, lead to the reduction of Pt2+ to Pt0 with analogous local structures, resulting in comparable catalytic performance in carbon monoxide oxidation and propane dehydrogenation. This redox&#8208;driven synthesis strategy can be extended to other bimetallic systems, with promising preliminary results observed in Cr&#8211;M systems. This innovative strategy effectively mitigates the hydrolysis of tin ions, neutralizes the influence of ion charges, and addresses the solubility challenges of secondary metal ions, providing a robust solution for the design of bimetallic catalysts.

         <title>HCl Intake via Nanobubbles Induces Redox Radicals for Aqueous Cl2 and H2 Production Without Catalyst and Bias Applied</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanobubble with HCl intake generates &#183;OH and e&#8722;aq, enabling efficient aqueous Cl2 and H2 production without catalysts or external bias. The gas composition critically determines the generation of water redox radicals, creating a sustainable interfacial region for halogenation chemistry and energy&#8208;efficient transformations.








Abstract
Bubbling is a widely used method to enhance gas hydration and dissolution in aqueous solutions. Understanding the bubble&#8208;induced interface&#8208;rich aqueous system is crucial for elucidating gas&#8208;involved solution chemical reactions, yet this area remains underexplored. Here we report the formation of aqueous Cl2 and H2 driven by nanobubbles, achieved by introducing redox&#8208;active HCl gas through a gas diffusion electrode without applying bias or loading catalysts. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) revealed that increasing HCl intake elevates the concentration of hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) and hydrated electrons (e&#8722;aq), more than an order of magnitude higher than that of feeding Ar alone. High&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry identified spin&#8208;trapping agent stabilized radical intermediates, including &#183;Cl, ClO&#183;, and &#183;H. Iodometric titration estimated the equivalent Cl2 content at approximately 18&#160;mmol L&#8722;1, while gas chromatography verified H2 formation. This study demonstrates that bubbling redox&#8208;active gases through aqueous solution can activate water reactivity, leading to the conversion of the gases themselves.

         <title>Supramolecular Host&#8211;Guest Assemblies for Tunable and Modular Lysosome&#8208;Targeting Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present host&#8211;guest bridged lysosome&#8208;targeting chimeras (HGTACs), a supramolecular platform for tunable, reversible protein degradation. Utilizing &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;adamantane interaction, HGTACs link lysosomal targeting receptors to proteins of interest, enabling targeted lysosomal degradation. By adjusting stoichiometry and introducing competitive ligands, we precisely control degradation, whereas the recyclable LTR&#8208;binding host ensures sustained activity, redefining lysosome&#8208;targeting chimeras.








Abstract
Heterobifunctional drugs have revolutionized chemical biology and therapeutic innovation, yet their fixed covalent linkages constrain dynamic adaptability. Here, we introduce host&#8211;guest bridged lysosome&#8208;targeting chimeras (HGTACs), a supramolecular bifunctional platform that utilizes &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;adamantane host&#8211;guest interactions to achieve tunable and modular assembly. HGTACs effectively facilitated lysosomal degradation of both extracellular and transmembrane proteins, including NS&#8208;650, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. By deconstructing lysosome&#8208;targeting chimeras into host and guest components, HGTACs enable spatiotemporal control over protein degradation through noncovalent bridging. This strategy allows for the fine&#8208;tuning of degradation efficiency by adjusting stoichiometric ratios and introducing competitive ligands. Notably, the recyclable nature of the asialoglycoprotein receptor&#8208;binding host module conferred sustained degradation activity. In vivo, EGFR&#8208;targeting HGTACs significantly reduced EGFR protein levels and suppressed tumor growth in xenograft models. This supramolecular control system reshapes lysosome&#8208;targeting chimeras, providing a flexible and efficient strategy for advancing chemically induced proximity&#8208;based modalities.

By deconstructing lysosome-targeting chimeras into host and guest components, HGTACs enable spatiotemporal control over protein degradation through noncovalent bridging. This strategy allows for the fine-tuning of degradation efficiency by adjusting stoichiometric ratios and introducing competitive ligands. Notably, the recyclable nature of the asialoglycoprotein receptor-binding host module conferred sustained degradation activity. In vivo, EGFR-targeting HGTACs significantly reduced EGFR protein levels and suppressed tumor growth in xenograft models. This supramolecular control system reshapes lysosome-targeting chimeras, providing a flexible and efficient strategy for advancing chemically induced proximity-based modalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chlorine Radical&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic C&#9472;C Coupling of Methanol to Ethylene Glycol with Near&#8208;Unity Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Z&#8208;scheme ZnIn2S4/TiO2&#8208;Cl photocatalyst pioneers selective methanol C&#9472;H bond activation under mild conditions, achieving 96.7% ethylene glycol selectivity. By leveraging photogenerated holes to cycle Cl&#8722;/Cl&#8226;, the system drives hydrogen abstraction for C&#9472;H cleavage and suppresses overoxidation, steering methanol valorization from traditional C1 pathways to sustainable C2 chemistry.








Abstract
The selective activation of inert C&#9472;H bonds in methanol under mild conditions to synthesize high&#8208;value C2 products remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the competing high reactivity of O&#9472;H bonds. Herein, we pioneer a chlorine radical&#8208;mediated strategy to redirect the photocatalytic reaction pathway for methanol conversion toward ethylene glycol (EG). Efficient C&#9472;H bond activation is achieved by constructing a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst (ZnIn2S4/TiO2&#8208;Cl) composed of chlorinated TiO2 (TiO2&#8208;Cl) and ZnIn2S4 with efficient charge separation. Photogenerated holes in this system preferentially oxidize surface&#8208;adsorbed Cl&#8722; to chlorine radicals (Cl&#8226;). These radicals drive a thermodynamically favorable hydrogen atom transfer via hydrogen abstraction, cleaving the C&#9472;H bond of methanol to form hydroxymethyl radicals (&#8226;CH2OH). Subsequent C&#9472;C coupling of &#8226;CH2OH intermediates, synergistically combined with a self&#8208;sustaining Cl&#8722;/Cl&#8226; cycle, produces EG with exceptional selectivity (96.7%) and yield (21.6&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) while suppressing overoxidation. In contrast, nonchlorinated catalysts predominantly utilize photogenerated holes for O&#9472;H bond cleavage under identical conditions, yielding only C1 products (HCHO, HCOOH). This work not only establishes a solar&#8208;driven approach for methanol valorization but also advances mechanistic insights into radical&#8208;mediated pathway control in heterogeneous photocatalysis.

         <title>Multipath ROS Storm and Immune Activation via&#160;Sulfur Vacancy&#8208;Optimized ZnIn2S4&#160;Nanosheets for Piezocatalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We modulate the piezocatalytic performance of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets (ZIS NSs) through sulfur vacancy (S&#7525;) engineering to construct a therapeutic system with multipath ROS generation and immune synergy. The gradient S&#7525; increases the piezoelectric coefficient of the ZIS. Under US, the piezoelectrically tilted band structure synergistically produces &#8226;O2&#8722;, 1O2, &#8226;OH and H2O2. ZIS NSs can effectively inhibit tumor growth under US and activate antitumor immune processes. 








Abstract
Piezocatalytic&#160;therapy is a novel therapeutic strategy that uses mechanical energy to drive catalytic reactions to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, existing materials are limited by low intrinsic catalytic efficiency and a single route to ROS production. This makes it difficult to break through the antioxidant barrier of the tumor microenvironment, which severely limits the antitumor efficacy. Herein, we synthesized sulfur vacancy (Sv)&#8208;engineered ZnIn2S4 nanosheets (ZIS&#8208;2/4/8) by adjusting the concentrations of sulfur source thioacetamide (TAA). The increase in Sv concentration simultaneously achieved the optimization of the energy band structure and the enhancement of the piezoelectric performance (d33 from 21.6 to 46.7&#160;mV V&#8722;1). Under US irradiation, Sv&#8208;ZnIn2S4 can efficiently generate ROS storms via multiple pathways, including &#8226;O2&#8722;, 1O2, &#8226;OH, and H2O2, which overcome the limitations of the tumor microenvironment and achieved effective tumor cell killing. In addition, the ROS storm induced by the ultrasound (US) can also initiate immunogenic cell death (ICD), promoting dendritic cells (DCs) maturation and CD8&#8314; T cells infiltration. This multi&#8208;pathway ROS burst strategy not only breaks through tumor antioxidant defenses but also induces ICD to form a cascade of immune responses. This demonstrates the advantages of combining piezocatalytic and immunotherapy.

         <title>A Multifunctional Polyester Nanoplatform for the Synergistic Anticancer: Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy and Targeted Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a multifunctional polyester nanoplatform integrating photodynamic activation, oxygen delivery, GSH depletion, HIF&#8208;1&#945; siRNA delivery, and tumor targeting. This system remodeled the tumor microenvironment by alleviating hypoxia and silencing hypoxia&#8208;inducing genes and greatly enhanced photodynamic and gene therapies for cancer.








Abstract
Gene therapy (GT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) present promising approaches for cancer treatment. However, GT is frequently impeded by the lysosomal capture of nucleic acids, while PDT is constrained by low oxygen levels in tumors. Herein, we reported the design of a versatile block polyester vector, BFN2, which comprises of a photosensitizer BODIPY (B), an oxygen carrying perfluorinated carbon chain (F) as well as a GSH&#8208;responsive, and RNA&#8208;condensing [12]aneN3 (N) moiety. In the presence of DOPE (D) and DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;iRGD (R), BFN2 is able to carry oxygen and condense HIF&#8208;1&#945; siRNA efficiently and afford hybrid nanoparticles BFN2DR/HIF&#8208;1&#945; siRNA@O&#8322;. These combined functionalities work together to reverse tumor hypoxia, remodel the tumor microenvironment, and allow for the efficient lysosomal escape of nucleic acids, thereby significantly boosting the efficacy of PDT and GT in solid tumors. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that the BFN2&#8208;DR/HIF&#8208;1&#945; siRNA@O&#8322; nanoplatform significantly exhibited substantial inhibitory effects in 4T1 tumors with TGI up to 87%. This research marks the first&#8208;in&#8208;class integration of such multimodality therapeutic strategies within a single block polymeric vector, thus offering a novel perspective for developing effective oncological treatment paradigms.

         <title>Cascade Electrocatalytic Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia Using Bimetallic Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tandem Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabricating covalent organic frameworks electrocatalyst with bimetallic active sites and promoting cascade electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia through the copper&#8208;cobalt tandem mechanism. The Cu sites serve as the activation centers for adsorption and the initial 2e&#8722; process. The &#8208;N&#8208;Co&#8208;O&#8208; interface promotes water adsorption and dissociation, facilitates the formation of *H&#8208;rich interface, and boosts the subsequent 6e&#8722; process, thus accelerating efficient synthesis of ammonia.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a promising approach to simultaneously realize pollutant removal and ammonia generation. However, this process involves the transfer of eight electrons and nine protons along with multiple by&#8208;products, resulting in a significant challenge for achieving high ammonia yield and selectivity. Herein, we introduced bimetallic covalent organic frameworks catalysts with Cu and Co active sites to achieve a two&#8208;step tandem reaction, avoiding excessive nitrite accumulation and enabling efficient NO3RR. For the initial two&#8208;electron process, the Cu sites in the bimetallic catalyst exhibit a strong binding affinity with nitrate, promoting their conversion to nitrite. The Co sites enhance the supply and adsorption of active hydrogen and stabilize the subsequent six&#8208;electron process, thereby improving the overall catalytic efficiency. Compared to monometallic Cu and Co catalysts, the CuCo bimetallic catalyst demonstrates superior ammonia yield and Faradaic efficiency (NH3 yield rate&#160;=&#160;20.8 mg&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;2, FE&#160;=&#160;92.16% in 0.3&#160;M nitrate). Such coordinated two&#8208;step process advances the efficiency and applicability of NO3RR through optimizing a cascade catalytic reaction, thereby establishing an innovative path for the engineering of NO3RR electrocatalysts.

Herein, we introduced bimetallic covalent organic frameworks catalysts with Cu and Co active sites to achieve a two-step tandem reaction, avoiding excessive nitrite accumulation and enabling efficient NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR. For the initial two-electron process, the Cu sites in the bimetallic catalyst exhibit a strong binding affinity with nitrate, promoting their conversion to nitrite. The Co sites enhance the supply and adsorption of active hydrogen and stabilize the subsequent six-electron process, thereby improving the overall catalytic efficiency. Compared to monometallic Cu and Co catalysts, the CuCo bimetallic catalyst demonstrates superior ammonia yield and Faradaic efficiency (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate&#160;=&#160;20.8 mg&#183;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, FE&#160;=&#160;92.16% in 0.3&#160;M nitrate). Such coordinated two-step process advances the efficiency and applicability of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR through optimizing a cascade catalytic reaction, thereby establishing an innovative path for the engineering of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Coordination Induced Fullerene Dimers on Hot Pt(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermal evolution of C60${\rm C}_{60}$ islands on Pt(111) includes the transition from segregated fullerene islands to dimers and the subsequent growth of graphene quantum dots. After annealing at 800K$800 \,\mathrm{K}$, the coordination of C60${\rm C}_{60}$ molecules promotes structural transformations toward separated dimers, with potential for advanced synthesis and lubricative applications.








Abstract
The fullerene family is known for its unique properties, facilitating the formation of large, lubricated nano&#8208;onions and the fragmentation into small carbon clusters through various processes. In this study, we explore the thermal evolution of C60${\rm C}_{60}$ islands on Pt(111), focusing on the segregation of C60${\rm C}_{60}$ islands, the formation of fullerene dimers, and the subsequent development of large graphene sheets. Using noncontact atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy, we observed that after annealing at 500K$500 \,\mathrm{K}$, the C60${\rm C}_{60}$ islands showed minimal change compared to their deposition at room temperature. However, at 800K$800 \,\mathrm{K}$, pairs of separated C60${\rm C}_{60}$ dimers appeared, which, due to their low mobility, have the potential to transform into graphene quantum dots (GQDs). Further annealing at 900K$900 \,\mathrm{K}$ controlled and refined the quality and dimensions of the graphene patches. This process not only provides an effective method for producing high&#8208;quality graphene but also permits to preserve isolated C60${\rm C}_{60}$ dimers on the Pt(111) surface, offering valuable insights for advanced synthesis and lubrication&#160;applications.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Controlled Lysine&#8208;Selective Crosslinking Decodes Protein Complexes and Dynamic Interactomes in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;controlled lysine&#8208;selective crosslinking (VL&#8208;XL) strategy is introduced for exploring protein complexes and dynamic interactomes in live cells. By synergistically integrating the advantages of temporal control, high biocompatibility, and lysine selectivity, VL&#8208;XL provides a robust chemical tool for proteomics and drug discovery, which is expected to inspire innovative solutions to address unresolved questions across multiple fields.








Abstract
Crosslinking strategies have emerged as an attractive technology for deciphering protein complexes and protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs). However, commonly used crosslinking strategies present significant challenges for the precise analysis of protein complexes and dynamic PPIs in native biological environments. Here, we report the development of the first visible&#8208;light&#8208;inducible lysine&#8208;specific homobifunctional photo&#8208;crosslinkers and introduce Visible&#8208;light&#8208;controlled Lysine&#8208;selective crosslinking (VL&#8208;XL) strategy for in&#8208;depth analysis of protein complexes and profiling dynamic interactomes in live cells. By synergistically integrating the advantages of temporal control, high biocompatibility, and lysine selectivity, the VL&#8208;XL strategy not only provides an effective solution for protein complexes studies&#8212;achieving residue&#8208;specific crosslinked peptides, delivering high&#8208;confidence data and streamlined mass spectrometry (MS) data analysis&#8212;but also reveals dynamic interactomes in various scenarios. The VL&#8208;XL strategy successfully profiles the time&#8208;resolved, epidermal growth factor (EGF)&#8208;stimulated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) interactome, providing valuable insights into regulatory mechanisms of EGFR signaling. More importantly, the VL&#8208;XL strategy effectively unveils molecular glue degrader&#8208;induced E3 ligase interactome, leading to discovery of neo&#8208;substrates such as Sestrin&#8208;2 (SESN2) and opening an innovative avenue for identifying novel targets for degradation. Overall, the VL&#8208;XL strategy provides&#160;a robust chemical tool, inspiring innovative solutions to address unresolved questions in multiple fields.

         <title>Unconventional PROTACs for Targeted Protein Degradation in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the challenges of conventional proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs), various &#8220;unconventional PROTACs&#8221; including PROTACs with unconventional binding ligands, PROTACs with unconventional linkers, pro&#8208;PROTACs, and self&#8208;assembled PROTACs have been proposed. These unconventional PROTACs show great promise for targeted protein degradation in cancer therapy. This review summarizes recent advances in the development of unconventional PROTACs.








Abstract
Targeted protein degradation, which aims to eliminate dysregulated proteins, has emerged as a promising strategy for conquering challenging therapeutic targets. Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) is a heterobifunctional molecule that utilizes the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system to selectively degrade target proteins. Due to its ability to degrade &#8220;undruggable&#8221; proteins without causing drug resistance, PROTAC has shown great potential in innovative drug development, especially in cancer therapy. However, conventional PROTACs suffer from several limitations, such as limited solubility, poor permeability, hook effect, and off&#8208;target toxicity. Therefore, structural innovation of conventional PROTACs to make them meet the therapeutic demand is essential for unlocking the full potential of PROTACs as a therapeutic tool. Here, we summarize four types of unconventional PROTACs for addressing the above challenges and enhancing cancer therapy efficacy, including PROTACs with unconventional binding ligands, PROTACs with unconventional linkers, pro&#8208;PROTACs, and self&#8208;assembled PROTACs. These optimized designs contribute to the development of PROTACs&#8208;based universal platforms, providing directions for innovative drug developments and expanding the applications of PROTACs in cancer therapy.

         <title>Confinement of Polyiodides by Dual&#8208;Functional Tetrazine Cathodes in Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly engineered tetrazine derivative BMT enables dual&#8208;functional cathode chemistry in Zn&#8211;I2 batteries. i) Redox enhancement: BMT exhibits reversible two&#8208;electron redox activity at 1.0&#160;V versus Zn/Zn2+, delivering supplementing electron transfer pathways for the cathode. ii) Polyiodide confinement: Stable 2I3&#8722;@BMT precipitates form through covalent&#8208;electrostatic synergistic interactions (binding constant: 6.28&#160;&#215;&#160;103&#160;M&#8722;1), effectively suppressing polyiodide shuttling. The BMT&#8208;based cathode achieves unprecedented performance metrics: record&#8208;high iodine anchoring efficiency index (IAEI&#160;=&#160;1.65), 99.6% Coulombic efficiency at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, ultralong cycle life exceeding 33&#160;000 cycles in coin cells, and practical high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading pouch cells (15.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) with 76.2% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine batteries offer great potential for energy storage due to their long&#8208;term cycle stability, flat voltage plateau, inherent safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, their performance is limited by capacity fading and low Coulombic efficiency (CE) caused by the I3&#8722; shuttle effect. In this work, we propose a molecularly engineered tetrazine derivative, 3,6&#8208;bis(2&#8208;morpholinoethyl)&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine (BMT) as a multifunctional cathode to address these challenges. BMT exhibits a reversible two&#8208;electron redox process, boosting charge storage capacity, and forms stable precipitation with I3&#8722; ions at a 1:2 stoichiometric ratio, effectively inhibiting the shuttle of polyiodide by covalent&#8208;electrostatic synergistic confinement. As expected, the BMT&#8208;based cathode exhibits a CE of 99.6% at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, a high specific discharge capacity of 207&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 as well as &#8764;100% capacity retention over 33&#160;000 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, achieving a record iodine anchoring efficiency. Furthermore, the Zn&#8211;I2 pouch cell with high iodine mass loading (15.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) delivers a practical cathode energy density of 145.2&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and maintains 76.2% of its capacity after 800 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This work presents a mechanism&#8208;driven cathode design strategy that integrates redox activity and polyiodide confinement, providing a blueprint for the development of stable iodine&#8208;based batteries.

As expected, the BMT-based cathode exhibits a CE of 99.6% at 2&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a high specific discharge capacity of 207&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; as well as &#8764;100% capacity retention over 33&#160;000 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, achieving a record iodine anchoring efficiency. Furthermore, the Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell with high iodine mass loading (15.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) delivers a practical cathode energy density of 145.2&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and maintains 76.2% of its capacity after 800 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work presents a mechanism-driven cathode design strategy that integrates redox activity and polyiodide confinement, providing a blueprint for the development of stable iodine-based batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Rate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Photoreduction by Dual&#8208;Proton Hydrogenation Pathway Over Pd&#8208;Anchored Oxygen&#8208;Deficient ZnO Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Note that the CO2 molecule is adsorbed and polarized on the metal nanocluster, while the two H2O molecules are simultaneously activated on the OL and VO, releasing two protons to assist CO2 activation into CH4 via the stepwise DPECT pathway, thus remarkably shortening the number of reaction steps relative to the traditional CO2&#8208;COOH&#8208;CH4 process.








Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 into CH4 usually comprises upto eight proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps, greatly reducing the conversion performance. Here, we report a new dual&#8208;proton hydrogenation pathway for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion, which can condense every two proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps into one single step. Also, we pioneer the use of in situ synchrotron&#8208;radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry to distinguish the crucial HCOOH from COOH intermediates, overcoming the limitation of in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy. Taking the synthetic Pd/ZnO&#8208;VO nanosheets as an example, synchrotron&#8208;radiation X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy discloses the Pd nanoclusters are anchored on the ZnO&#8208;VO nanosheets via building Pd&#9472;O bonds, while theoretical calculation demonstrates charge accumulation on the interfacial Pd sites. In situ spectroscopic characterizations, labelling experiments, and adsorption energy calculations collectively establish CO2 undergoes stepwise dual&#8208;proton hydrogenation routes, gradually transforming into *HCOOH, *HCHO, *CH3OH, and CH4, different from the traditional CO2&#8208;COOH&#8208;CH4 processes. Thus, the Pd/ZnO&#8208;VO nanosheets exhibit superior CH4 evolution rate of 257.6&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, outperforming all previously reported photocatalysts. This work unlocks an efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 pathway, largely reducing the number of reaction steps.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkylation for the Construction of Fluoro, Chloro, and Trifluoromethyl Stereogenic Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;hydride catalyzed enantioconvergent hydroalkylation with allenes and alkenes is achieved with high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. This method allows the streamlined synthesis of enantiomerically enriched C(sp3)&#8211;fluorine, &#8211;chlorine, and &#8211;trifluoromethyl stereocenters.








Abstract
Organic compounds containing a chiral, halogenated aliphatic carbon center are useful in medicinal chemistry, but their enantioselective synthesis remains difficult. Here, we develop a general approach to access these compounds through cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of allenes and alkenes with dihaloamides. The reactions of allenes and terminal alkenes lead to alkylation only at the terminal position. In contrast, the reactions of internal alkenes occur via chain&#8208;walking and alkylation at the terminal position. These reactions operate by enantioconvergent transformation of racemic secondary alkyl halides to give enantio&#8208;enriched products. The method exhibits broad scope and high chemo, regio, and enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility of the method is demonstrated by further transformations of the products as well as the application in late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex substrates.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Metal Ce&#8208;Zr&#8208;Mn Clusters as Photo&#8208;Catalysts for Decarboxylative Functionalization of Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative hydrazination of carboxylic acids is achieved using a 1:5:2 ratio of three metal salts, Ce(OtBu)4, Zr(OtBu)4, and Mn(OAc)3, as a catalyst under visible light irradiation, in which single cerium&#8208;incorporated hexanuclear mixed&#8208;metal clusters containing a [CeZr5O4(OH)4]12+ core are formed with association of manganese(II) species. The catalytic activity is much higher than that by hexanuclear cerium(IV) clusters.








Abstract
Decarboxylative hydrazination of carboxylic acids was achieved using a 1:5:2 ratio of three metal salts, Ce(OtBu)4, Zr(OtBu)4, and Mn(OAc)3, as a catalyst under visible light irradiation. The catalytic activity, compared with our previously developed Ce6 cluster photo&#8208;catalysts, was enhanced by the formation of single cerium&#8208;incorporated hexanuclear mixed&#8208;metal clusters containing a [CeZr5O4(OH)4]12+ core. The manganese salts further accelerated the overall reaction rate (10 times faster reaction rate with the manganese salt than that of the manganese&#8208;free conditions). Using the isolated cluster, CeZr5O4(OH)4(OCOCH2tBu)12(HOCOCH2tBu)4 (4a), with Mn(OAc)3, phenol and thiophenol&#8208;containing carboxylic acids were transformed to their decarboxylative hydrazinated products in moderate to high yields, while a mixture of Ce6O4(OH)4(OCOCH2tBu)12(HOCOCH2tBu)4 (4c) and Mn(OAc)3 or Ce(OtBu)4, Zr(OtBu)4, and Mn(OAc)3 yielded lower amounts of the products. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating cerium(IV) into the zirconium&#8208;based core to tolerate these easily oxidizable functional groups. Upon exposure of 4a to blue LED light under an argon atmosphere, the CeZr5 cluster produced 2,2,5,5&#8208;tetramethylhexane, a radical coupling product derived from the carboxylate ligand on 4a, in half an equivalent per cluster, consistent with the photo&#8208;reduction of cerium(IV) and inertness of the oxo&#8208; and hydroxo&#8208;bridged Zr5 motif as a metallo&#8208;ligand around the cerium(IV) site. Moreover, decarboxylative oxygenation of carboxylic acids under air followed by treatment with NaBH4 resulted in the production of one&#8208;carbon shortened alcohols in excellent yields when using Ce(OtBu)4 and Zr(OtBu)4 or Hf(OtBu)4 in a 1:5 ratio: the reaction rates were 8&#8211;10 times higher than that of the previously developed cerium&#8208;catalyzed reaction under identical conditions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Customizable Library of Nickel Trifluoromethylation Catalysts via Selective C&#9472;F and C&#9472;O Bond Cleavage</title>

         <dc:description>
Carbatranes and anionic pincer ligands were self&#8208;assembled via one&#8208;pot C&#9472;F or C&#9472;O bond cleavage and the formation of C&#9472;O, C&#9472;N, or C&#9472;C bonds, forming ligand architectures inaccessible by common synthetic methods. This approach allowed to build a customizable library of nickel catalysts for light&#8208;induced C&#9472;H bond trifluoromethylation. Carbatrane ligands support nickel in +3 and +4 oxidation states allowing for their direct reactivity comparison.








Abstract
Using a combination of metal&#8208;promoted reactivity, in situ covalent bond modification, and hydrogen bonding&#8208;promoted fluorine labilization, a unified approach was developed to self&#8208;assemble a library of customizable ligand architectures directly at the nickel center via selective cleavage of C&#9472;F or C&#9472;O bonds and the formation of C&#9472;C or C&#9472;N bonds. As a result, a structurally diverse set of nickelacarbatrane and pincer complexes was obtained, including unsymmetrical and mixed&#8208;heterocyclic atranes and trifluoromethylated pincers that cannot be accessed by conventional organic synthetic methods or require multiple steps and a tedious and low&#8208;yielding separation. This suggests a possibility of a spontaneous generation of high&#8208;complexity structures from a commonly used metal precursor and simple N&#8208;heterocycle building blocks, despite commonly believed innocence of the C&#9472;F bonds, which may also generate catalytically active species.

         <title>Overcoming Photochemical Limitations in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Low&#8208;Energy Light Driven Selective 1O2 Generation Achieved by Donor&#8211;Acceptor Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate for the first time that a novel donor&#8211;acceptor strategy in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has been developed to regulate the localized electronic state structures for efficient and selective 1O2 generation under low&#8208;energy light. The engineered COF selectively produced 1O2 under red light through a coupled charge transfer mechanism and exhibited exceptional photocatalytic performance in 1O2 driven advanced oxidation, achieving gram&#8208;scale production under red light, even when operating through translucent barriers.








Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a crucial role in various photocatalytic oxidation reactions; however, achieving high&#8208;efficiency and selective 1O2 production under low&#8208;energy light remains a challenge. Herein, we present a novel donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) strategy in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to regulate the localized electronic state structures for efficient and selective 1O2 generation under low&#8208;energy light. Notably, the rationally incorporation of the negatively charged carbonyl groups into the basal plane of the COF strengthens the D&#8211;A interaction, improves light harvesting in the lower&#8208;energy region, and facilitates highly selective 1O2 generation through a coupled charge&#8208;transfer mechanism. As a result, the engineered COF demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic performance in 1O2 driven advanced oxidation, enabling gram&#8208;scale production under red light, even when operating through translucent barriers. A mechanistic study revealed that the distinct 1O2 production under low&#8208;energy light is attributed to the spatially locked structure and charge localization around active centers. These features enhance strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction, promote effective charge separation and transport properties, and ultimately facilitate the activation of O2 to 1O2. This study paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance COF photocatalysts for low&#8208;energy light&#8208;driven reactive oxygen species generation in advanced oxidation processes.

         <title>Multi&#8208;ion Coordinated Water Network in Dilute Acid Electrolytes for Ultralow&#8208;Temperature (&#8804;&#8722;80 &#176;C) Proton Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong&#8208;super&#8208;cooling dilute acid electrolyte with stable multi&#8208;ion coordinated water network is developed, which effectively disrupts the hydrogen bond network of water molecules through the synergetic effect between Zn2+ and ClO4&#8722; to promote proton transport. Consequently, the electrodes and hybrid proton capacitors deliver excellent rate performance and ultralow&#8208;temperature stability.








Abstract
Proton batteries/capacitors, known for fast ion diffusion kinetics, are a promising alternative for low&#8208;temperature energy storage. However, ultralow&#8208;temperature (&#8804;&#8722;60 &#176;C) proton energy storage devices have been impeded by the strong corrosion of high&#8208;concentration acids and the high freezing point of low&#8208;concentration acids. Here, a strong&#8208;super&#8208;cooling electrolyte with a multi&#8208;ion coordinated water network (hybrid electrolyte of dilute acid and chaotropic zinc salt) is designed for fast proton transport at low temperatures. The chaotropic zinc salt not only reduces the number of free water but also minimizes the number of strong hydrogen bonds in the electrolyte, thus inhibiting the transition of the water molecules to an ordered arrangement at low temperatures. More importantly, the formation of stable Zn2+&#8722;H2O&#8722;ClO4&#8722; water molecule network, driven by strong interactions between ions, can effectively improve the proton transport to achieve the excellent rate performance of electrodes. This electrolyte also enables a long cycle life of the assembled CuHCF//&#945;&#8208;MoO3 for over 15&#160;000 cycles below&#160;&#8722;60 &#176;C, expediting the development of proton energy storage devices at ultralow temperatures.

         <title>Selective Scission of Orthogonal Bonds in Four&#8208;Membered Ring Mechanophores upon Activation by a Rotaxane Actuator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rotaxane actuator controls bond scission&#8212;perpendicular or parallel to the axle&#8212;based on bulky group orientation in a 4&#8208;membered ring. This allows diverse functional molecules to be released from a single core structure, expanding the molecular variety obtainable from new or existing mechanophores.








Abstract
Mechanophores (mechanosensitive molecules) are usually activated by pulling force transduced by polymer covalently attached to their structures. A variety of mechanophores have been described to date but many rely on a limited number of core structures. The diversity of products formed mechanochemically could be improved by promoting the scission of varied bonds within a single mechanophore. 4&#8208;membered rings are particularly suited for this as two sets of products can be obtained by formal retro&#8208;[2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition depending on the pulling direction. This concept has been applied to a couple of mechanophores but the repositioning of the anchoring points often requires a redesign of the structures, and the pulling activation is not amenable to the release of the products. Here we show that the unique pushing activation of a rotaxane actuator enables the selective activation of covalent bonds parallel or perpendicular to the main chain in diazetidinone and &#946;&#8208;lactam mechanophores. The selectivity depends on the orientation of the bulky substituents pointing toward or away from the incoming macrocycle. We were able to release ketene and triaryl imine/ethene molecules, and to generate imine, azobenzene, and isocyanate units. This alternative activation method demonstrates how to elicit new reactivity from known mechanophores and should inspire the design of new ones. The variety of structures released/generated here illustrate how this approach can be used for the release of reactive species and other functional molecules.

         <title>Direct Activation of Sulfides by C&#8211;H Oxidation with Photoexcited Nitroarenes: Formal Manipulations of the C&#9472;S Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical anaerobic oxidation of sulfides, using nitroarenes as bifunctional reagents, enables the formal manipulation of the C&#9472;S bond. The method allows direct and selective access to versatile carbonyl compounds from largely inert sulfides by C&#8211;H oxidation, thus avoiding multistep activation by sulfur oxidation. The mild photo&#8208;induced protocol has been engaged in telescoped procedures to convert sulfides into amines, alcohols, and alkenes.








Abstract
The sulfide motif is distributed widely across chemical and biological space. In synthesis, its installation often marks the end point of a sequence, due to its relative inertness; sulfides typically require direct oxidation of sulfur before they are receptive toward transformation. Unfortunately, selective S&#8208;oxidation is not always straightforward, with the need for oxidants lacking chemoselectivity in the presence of functionality and delivering mixtures of oxidation products. This multistep manipulation of the sulfide motif, initiated by direct S&#8208;oxidation, limits the use of sulfides as synthetic handles for downstream manipulation. Herein, we describe a direct activation of sulfides by C&#8211;H oxidation alpha to sulfur&#8212;rather than traditional oxidation at sulfur&#8212;that facilitates efficient formal C&#9472;S bond manipulation. The mild nature of the photo&#8208;induced anaerobic oxidation protocol enables its merger with high&#8208;value transformations in telescoped or one&#8208;pot protocols that deliver branched amines, secondary alcohols, and alkenes from aldehyde and ketone intermediates. The method expands the chemistry of sulfides by diverting reactivity away from sulfur (oxidation, alkylation) and instead targeting directly the alpha position, resulting in formal manipulation of the C&#9472;S bond, and redefining sulfides as latent synthetic handles to be &#8220;switched on&#8221; at will.

         <title>Ternary Potassium&#8208;Bismuth&#8208;Telluride Intermetallic Support Promotes Electrochemical Stability in Potassium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the enhanced performance of potassium metal batteries enabled by a ternary potassium&#8208;bismuth&#8208;telluride intermetallic synthesized via accumulative roll bonding. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray nano tomography and cryogenic focused ion beam microscopy reveal the uniform electrodeposition on the intermetallic in contrast to the porous baseline. Multiscale simulation provides&#160;insight into adatom energetics, film nucleation, early&#8208;stage SEI morphology and interfacial stability.








Abstract
We employed accumulative roll bonding to fabricate self&#8208;standing metallurgical composite of in situ formed alkaline potassium&#8208;bismuth&#8208;telluride intermetallic K2(Bi2/6Te3/6Vac1/6) embedded in potassium metal. This newly discovered thermodynamically stable potassiophilic crystal, termed &#8220;KBT&#8221;, is fcc antifluorite with K2Te archetype. Symmetric cells achieve 880 h of cycling at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2. Potassium metal battery (KMB) with Prussian blue (PB) cathode in carbonate electrolyte retains&#160;80% capacity after 200 cycles at 1C. In ether&#8208;based electrolyte with organic cathode, it achieves&#160;80% retention&#160;after 900 cycles at 2C. Combined synchrotron X&#8208;ray nano&#8208;tomography, cryogenic&#8208;focused ion beam microscopy (Cryo&#8208;FIB)&#160;and sputter&#8208;down X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrate uniform electrodeposits, versus baseline of potassium filaments intermixed with pores and coarse SEI. Binary K3Bi&#8208;K and K2Te&#8208;K intermetallic supports also provide improved electrochemical performance, albeit to lesser extent. Multiscale simulation provides&#160;insight into role of support structure in adatom energetics, film nucleation, early&#8208;stage&#160;SEI&#160;morphology and interfacial stability.

         <title>Zwitterionic Heavier Pnictinidenes in Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we describe a new class of zwitterionic heavier pnictogen species with bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene)borate as ligands, enabling the isolation of stable Sb and Bi species in multiple oxidation states. Computational analysis of zwitterionic pnictinidenes revealed their cationic character at the metal centre while holding unique electronic properties that contribute to their nucleophilicity and stability. These systems participate in oxidative addition and reductive elimination processes, and display redox catalytic activity in hydrodefluorination reactions, marking a unique example of cationic pnictinidene catalysing a redox transformation and providing reactivity beyond the constraints of pincer ligands. Additionally, we report on a novel dehydrogenative thiolation of silanes. This work expands the scope of low&#8208;valent pnictogen chemistry, providing a novel platform for main group redox catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast (600 ps) Vacuum&#8208;UV Reflective Scintillation Enabled by Surface Exciton Recombination in Layered Perovskite PEA2PbBr4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photodetection is pivotal for space exploration and radiation monitoring, yet its dynamic imaging capability is significantly hindered by the slow response of conventional scintillators. However, existing scintillators exhibit microsecond&#8208;to&#8208;nanosecond decay time, failing to meet sub&#8208;nanosecond ultrafast imaging demands. Here, we uncovered a surface exciton recombination mechanism in layered perovskite PEA2PbBr4, where lattice contraction induced exciton localization, achieving ultrafast decay time of 600 ps&#8212;over 100&#8208;fold faster than commercial scintillation. A reflective optical configuration was designed to suppress self&#8208;absorption, improving the light utilization efficiency. This work established a material paradigm for ultrafast dynamic imaging and opens avenues for advancing space science and high&#8208;energy physics detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolytes with Tailored Solvent&#8208;Solvent Interactions for Flame&#8208;Retardant High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium metal batteries (SMBs), which possess abundant sodium resources and high energy density, have attracted widespread attention.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sodium metal batteries (SMBs), which possess abundant sodium resources and high energy density, have attracted widespread attention. However, the continuous reaction between the electrolyte and the sodium metal anode, along with the formation of an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), leads to rapid capacity decay and the safety hazard of potential ignition.

         <title>Ultralong&#8208;cycling Lithium Storage of SrGe2O4S Anode Enabled by in situ Formed Oxysulfide Matrix</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries demand next&#8208;generation alloying&#8208;type anodes with high capacity and low voltage. While silicon&#8208;based anodes are in industrial use, commercial alloying&#8208;type anodes still suffer from excessive volume expansion and inadequate cycle life. Even incorporating silicon&#8208;carbon composites within graphite (typically &lt;20% in commercial products) fails to resolve these limitations. Herein, we report a novel SrGe2O4S anode for ultralong&#8208;cycling lithium storage. An oxysulfide matrix (Li&#8322;O/SrS) was in situ formed around Ge nanodomains. Enabled by the strong covalency of soft S2&#8315; anions and the pinning effect of large Sr2&#8314; ions, this synergistic matrix has demonstrated capabilities to enhance interfacial compatibility with Ge, facilitate efficient Li&#8314; transport, suppress agglomeration of Ge nanoparticles and buffer volume expansion, as evidenced by in/ex situ characterizations, density functional theory calculations, and finite element analysis simulations. The anode harvests a low charging medium voltage of 0.42 V and reversible capacity of 587 mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles (8300 h) with 93.2% capacity retention. The LiCoO2||SrGe2O4S full cell delivers a high capacity of 142 mA h g&#8722;1 and energy density of 482 Wh kg&#8208;1. This work sheds light on constructing functional matrix to relieve volume expansion and particle agglomeration of high&#8208;capacity ultralong&#8208;cycling alloying&#8208;type anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Ion Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>A Structure&#8208;Preserving, Dimensionality&#8208;Increasing Strategy for the Stepwise Synthesis of Microporous &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with a Broad (100) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal oxides with diverse structures and dimensionalities are typically synthesized via solid&#8208;state or hydrothermal reactions. However, it is quite difficult to retain the structures of the starting materials when 0D metal salts or molecular clusters are used as precursors because higher&#8208;dimensional structures form by structural reorganization through isomerization and decomposition/condensation reactions. In this study, we demonstrated a structure&#8208;preserving, dimensionality&#8208;increasing strategy for the synthesis of 2D &#945;&#8208;MoO3 from 0D [Mo2O5(H2O)6]2+ species via a 1D [Mo2O6{(CH3)2NCHO}]n intermediate while maintaining the structures of the precursors. By simple temperature&#8208;controlled calcination, metastable crystals of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 in which the (100) plane was the broad face were successfully synthesized, differing from conventional &#945;&#8208;MoO3 in which the (010) plane is the broad face. In addition, the prepared metastable crystals possessed large surface areas, unusual micropores, and surface&#8208;exposed coordinatively unsaturated Mo sites, allowing them to serve as high&#8208;performance acid catalysts. This synthesis strategy is expected to facilitate the synthesis of metastable structures and the design of defects and surface structures at the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>Aluminum distribution in Ferrierite zeolites influences the performance of methane oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free aluminosilicate FER&#8208;type zeolite has been demonstrated to effectively catalyze methane to methanol using N2O as the oxidant with distorted tetra&#8208;coordinated aluminum (AlIV&#8208;2) and penta&#8208;coordinated aluminum (AlV) as potential active sites. However, the specific effects of Al distribution on the active Al species have not been thoroughly investigated. Herein, aluminosilicate FER&#8208;type zeolites with controllable Al distribution were developed. Al distribution, including the arrangement and location of Al atoms, was characterized using 27Al MQMAS/MAS and 29Si MAS NMR spectra. The arrangement of aluminum, particularly the isolated Al and paired Al in as&#8208;synthesized samples, influenced the proximity between oxidative and acidic sites in H&#8208;type samples. Al locations involved the specific positioning of bifunctional sites and affected the final product. The increased CH4 conversion at 250&#8208;275 oC of FER zeolite with Al preferential population at T4 sites confirmed the higher activity of Al species from T4 sites. Additionally, a higher proportion of Al atoms in 10&#8208;ring channels facilitated the tandem conversion of methane to methanol on oxidative sites, followed by methanol to hydrocarbons on acidic sites at 300&#8208;375 oC. This study corroborated and expanded upon our recent research and highlighted the significant impact of Al distribution in FER zeolite on methane oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed COF/Zeolite Composites for Augmented Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of COF/zeolite composite photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide were fabricated via 3D printing technology. The 3D&#8208;printed architectures feature honeycomb&#8208;like channels, which facilitate the in&#8208;situ growth and high crystallinity of COFs. Leveraging the superior hydrophilicity and O2 affinity of zeolite, the homogeneous composite boosts efficiency by 52% over pristine COF.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), characterized by high porosity and fine&#8208;tuned structures, are promising photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, their hydrophobic nature restricts the mass transfer in water, presenting challenges in achieving high performance. Coupling COFs with hydrophilic zeolites can potentially advance H2O2 production, yet integrating these two distinct types of porous materials is challenging. Herein, we first applied 3D printing technology to fabricate COF/zeolite composite catalysts, which enabled superior photosynthesis of H2O2. By precisely optimizing binders and prepolymerization conditions, homogeneous inks composed of zeolite nanocrystals and initial polymeric precursors were prepared with appropriate rheology for 3D printing. The resultant monolith with honeycomb&#8208;like open&#8208;channels was favorable for the in&#8208;situ growth and crystallization of COF by facilitating the efficient molecular transfer of condensing agents and large covalent segments during solvothermal post&#8208;treatment. Mechanistic studies indicated that introducing zeolites enhanced the hydrophilicity and O2 affinity within the composite, favoring the oxygen reduction reaction pathway. Consequently, the photosynthesis of H2O2 by the COF/zeolite composite was markedly improved by 52% compared to the bare COFs. This work provides a facile way to integrate COFs and zeolites by 3D printing, which may open diverse applications of such composites by taking advantage of both merits.

Mechanistic studies indicated that introducing zeolites enhanced the hydrophilicity and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affinity within the composite, favoring the oxygen reduction reaction pathway. Consequently, the photosynthesis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the COF/zeolite composite was markedly improved by 52% compared to the bare COFs. This work provides a facile way to integrate COFs and zeolites by 3D printing, which may open diverse applications of such composites by taking advantage of both merits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Buried Interface Modification Strategy for Efficient Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A buried interface modification (BIM) strategy was proposed to regulate the crystallization of Sn&#8208;based perovskite films by using multifunctional surface modifiers. High&#8208;quality Sn&#8208;based perovskite films with a lower defect density were achieved, which leads to high&#8208;performance near&#8208;infrared (NIR) Sn&#8208;based perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.9%. 








Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskites show great potential for environmentally friendly and high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the development of Sn&#8208;based perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) lags significantly behind that of lead&#8208;based perovskites. This is mainly due to the faster crystallization rate of Sn&#8208;based perovskites that leads to a higher defect density in Sn&#8208;based perovskite films, thereby serious nonradiative recombination. Here, we demonstrated a buried interface modification (BIM) strategy to regulate the crystallization kinetics of Sn&#8208;based perovskite films by using carboxylate as multifunctional surface modifiers. We reveal that the buried interface is critical to improve the nucleation and crystallization of Sn&#8208;based perovskite films. As a result, efficient near&#8208;infrared Sn&#8208;based PeLEDs were achieved with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.9%. This work suggests an efficient and elegant route to obtain high&#8208;performance Sn&#8208;based perovskite films and devices.

         <title>Electrochemical Enantioselective Oxidation of Indoles via Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalysis in Cooperation with H3PO4 in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binary organic&#8211;inorganic acid cooperative catalytic system has been developed to achieve highly enantioselective electrochemical oxidative rearrangement of indoles. The use of electricity as an oxidant in this case showed several advantages including environmental benignity and improved enantiocontrol. A biphasic electrolysis system contributes to the general substrate scope by physically separating the chiral organic acids from the achiral inorganic acids.








Abstract
Disclosed here is the first catalytic enantioselective electrochemical oxidative rearrangement of indoles for the efficient synthesis of highly enantioenriched spirooxindoles. The in&#8208;situ generated HBr from substrate oxidation, known to be detrimental to the reaction itself, was perfectly consumed by cathode reduction. Challenges of this process include the difficulty in maintaining the synergy between substrate oxidation and cathode reduction as well as the general incompatibility of a hydrogen bonding catalytic system with the aqueous acidic media. A monophasic system was initially developed, but with little substrate generality. Further analysis of the mechanism and careful optimization allowed the development of a much more general and robust biphasic system that exhibited multiple advantages over chemical oxidation, including broader scope, less waste, milder conditions, and better enantioselectivity. It is also the first demonstration of chiral phosphoric acid catalysis in cooperation with H3PO4 in acidic aqueous media.

         <dc:description>Tetrodotoxin is a neurotoxic marine alkaloid, first isolated in 1909 from pufferfish and named after the biological order tetraodontiformes. Since its structural elucidation in 1964, it has attracted the interest of synthetic organic chemists due to its exceptional polarity, complex architecture, and important biological activity. This review highlights the diversity of the tetrodotoxin natural product family and discusses the origins of derivatives, biosynthetic hypotheses, and biological activities. Furthermore, potential therapeutic applications and structure activity relationship studies are covered, along with the total syntheses of the natural product and selected derivatives that were published to date.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cobotic, Digitally Controlled Schlenk&#8208;line Unlocks Access to Elusive Lewis&#8208;Base Stabilised Copper Bis(Disilylamides)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cobotic digital chemistry approach succeeds where manual synthesis failed. Herein, we present our new &#8220;AutoSchlenk&#8221; line which, coupled with other digital chemistry tools, was key to the synthesis and isolation of an unstable, and previously inaccessible, three&#8208;coordinate Cu(II) hexamethylsilylamide complex.








Abstract
Silylamides are important ligands in coordination chemistry for their ability to stabilise low coordination numbers and provide soluble, and even volatile, metal complexes. Such compounds provide valuable insights into the fundamental bonding and reactivity of their respective metals. Despite the wealth of homo&#8208; and heteroleptic hexamethyldisilazide complexes of divalent 3d ions (Sc&#8208;Ni, Zn), attempts to access the corresponding divalent copper complexes have yielded only Cu(I) species. Herein, we demonstrate the stabilisation and isolation of a formally Cu(II) bis&#8208;hexamethyldisilazide which was achieved by implementing novel digital chemistry tools. In order to successfully isolate (DMAP)CuII(N{SiMe3}2)2 (DMAP&#160;=&#160;N,N&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine), we investigated the roles of the co&#8208;ligand and silylamide transfer reagent in the kinetics of its formation. Crucial to these studies was our newly developed &#8220;cobotic&#8221; Schlenk line which provides&#160;digital control of the atmosphere under which we conduct our highly reactive syntheses. In digitising Schlenk&#8208;line handling, we have improved synthetic productivity by creating protocols for automated inertisation, solvent evaporation, liquid handling and crystallisation all while capturing reaction log data. Importantly, our Cu silylamide synthesis provides a case study showing that our cobotics approach allows for the discovery and isolation of unstable species which may remain elusive by traditional manual or fully autonomous methodologies.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Mediated Charge Transfer Regulation of Inner Core Clusters in Hybrid Copper(I)&#8208;Based Halides for High&#8208;Efficiency X&#8208;Ray Scintillation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by coordination dynamics, a solvent mediation strategy was used to modulate coordination environments and intramolecular charge transfer of organic cuprous halides to achieve vibrant emissions. After optimized regulation, a 10 times enhancement of radioluminescence (RL) compared to that of the C6H18N2Cu2Br4 scintillator was achieved with a high light yield of about 73881&#160;photons/MeV (C12H28N4Cu2I2) and excellent photochemical stability.








Abstract
Cu(I)&#8208;based metal halides have gained significant interest as scintillators. However, their X&#8208;ray luminescence efficiency is mainly determined by the competition between radiative organic ligands and nonradiative metal cluster&#8208;centered charge transfer. How to regulate their charge transfer to enhance radiative emission is an intractable challenge. Here, guided by coordination dynamics, we present a solvent mediation strategy to modulate coordination environments and intramolecular charge transfer of organic cuprous halides to achieve vibrant emissions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the coordinated clusters can efficiently absorb radiation ionization to generate electron&#8208;hole pairs and transfer them to ligands for enhanced luminescence. Conversely, ligand&#8208;free structures exhibit an absence of organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;related excited states upon excitation, leading to luminescence quenching. Due to optimized metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) dynamics, a five times enhancement of emission efficiency was achieved with a peak photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 82.14%. Correspondingly, radioluminescence (RL) was significantly improved to 2.22 and 10 times greater than that of (Lu,Y)2SiO5:Ce (LYSO) and C6H18N2Cu2Br4 with a high light yield of 73881&#160;photons/MeV (C12H28N4Cu2I2) and excellent photochemical stability. A high X&#8208;ray imaging resolution of 9.7&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1 was also demonstrated by the soft C12H28N4Cu2I2 screen even with the thickness of 30&#160;&#181;m. Our study provides a solvent&#8208;mediated ligand engineering of copper halide cluster scintillators.

Correspondingly, radioluminescence (RL) was significantly improved to 2.22 and 10 times greater than that of (Lu,Y)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;:Ce (LYSO) and C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with a high light yield of 73881&#160;photons/MeV (C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and excellent photochemical stability. A high X-ray imaging resolution of 9.7&#160;lp&#160;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; was also demonstrated by the soft C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; screen even with the thickness of 30&#160;&#181;m.

         <title>Twist&#8208;Promoted Photoredox Catalysis in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Defluorination Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOF Y&#8208;TCPDA bridged by a newly designed, twisted, and photosensitizing ligand has been prepared with a significantly prolonged lifetime of charge&#8208;transfer state and excellent stability toward F&#8722; solutions. Y&#8208;TCPDA competently catalyzed chemoselective defluorinative functionalization and olefin reductive cross&#8208;coupling with high turnover numbers (TON) of up to 9000, outperforming the homogeneous counterparts.








Abstract
The relatively short excited&#8208;state lifetime is one main drawback of organic photosensitizers, resulting in their restricted catalytic capability and high catalyst loadings. We herein report the design of a twisted ligand N9,N9,N10,N10&#8208;tetrakis[(1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid]&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthracene diamine (H4TCPDA). Its twisted geometry significantly elongates the lifetime of charge&#8208;transfer state as substantiated by detailed ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopic and electrochemical studies. Moreover, its rigid structure benefits the formation of highly crystalline Y&#8208;TCPDA metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with excellent stability toward F&#8722; solutions. Therefore, Y&#8208;TCPDA competently catalyzes chemoselective defluorinative modifications, a challenge remained in MOF catalysis, and olefin reductive cross&#8208;coupling with high turnover numbers of up to 9000. Control experiments underscore the protection of organic photocatalytic centers by the MOF platform, while similar organic catalysts are found to be decomposed in a homogeneous catalytic system.

         <title>Enhancing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Activity by Controlling Oxidation State of Iridium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The IrOx/oxi&#8208;TiN catalysts demonstrate a general correlation between iridium oxidation state and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity.








Abstract
Iridium oxides with high oxidation states have been reported to be effective in enhancing the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Herein, we develop ultrasmall IrOx nanoparticles (NPs) over titanium nitride (TiN), which undergoes surface oxidation under oxidative conditions to form oxygen&#8208;modified TiN (oxi&#8208;TiN), enabling the formation of highly oxidized Ir&#948;+ (&#948; &gt; 4). This IrOx/oxi&#8208;TiN catalyst delivers higher Ir mass activity than commercial IrO2, while comparable stability is maintained. The superior OER activity of IrOx/oxi&#8208;TiN is further demonstrated in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE), requiring only 1.88&#160;V to reach 3 A cm&#8722;2, achieving the U.S. Department of Energy 2025 target (1.90&#160;V at 3 A cm&#8722;2). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms that the superior OER activity of IrOx/oxi&#8208;TiN originates from highly oxidized Ir&#948;+ under OER conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a general correlation between the oxidation state of Ir and OER overpotential. Specifically, the introduction of interfacial oxygen at the Ir/TiN interface increases the oxidation state of deposited Ir&#948;+ from &#948; &lt; 4 to &#948;&#160;&gt; 4, decreasing the OER overpotential. This study highlights the critical role of high oxidation states of Ir&#948;+ in enhancing OER activity, providing guidance for the development of advanced acidic OER catalysts.

         <title>Lattice Distortion Promoting Wavelength&#8208;Tunable Emissions in Cu(I)&#8208;Based Halides for Thermography and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design and synthesize (DMAP)Cu3I4 single crystals with wavelength&#8208;tunable emission from red to NIR, attributed to energy transfer from CC to XMCT. A high thermal sensitivity (0.0001&#8208;0.6&#160;K&#8722;1) and high spatial thermography with spatial resolution up to &#8722;20&#160;lp mm&#8722;1 were achieved by engaging characteristics of wavelength&#8208;tunable emission in (DMAP)Cu3I4&#8208;based films.








Abstract
Low dimensional hybrid metal halides as a chemically tunable platform achieve multi&#8208;functional optical applications with versatile luminescence mechanisms. Herein, we design and prepare Cu(I)&#8208;based hybrid halide (DMAP)Cu3I4 (DMAP&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;Dimethylaminopyridine), with ambient temperature&#8208;induced photoluminescence evolution from red to near&#8208;infrared emissions. The in situ variable&#8208;temperature crystallographic study reveals lattice distortion with more disordered [Cu3nI4n]n&#8722; units appear at high temperature, further indicating that the observed wavelength&#8208;tunable emission is attributed to transitions from Cu cluster center to halogen&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer. Thus, (DMAP)Cu3I4 shows a compelling thermometric precision (high sensitivities of 0.0001&#8211;0.6&#160;K&#8722;1) at a wide temperature range of 80&#8211;300&#160;K. In particular, the remote thermography is established with a high spatial resolution of &#8722;20&#160;lp mm&#8722;1 by processable thin films. These findings enhance the potential for molecular&#8208;level illumination in Cu(I)&#8208;based halides and contribute to the exploration of their optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Intramolecular Dual Donor&#8208;Acceptor Featured Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabled by Gating Effects for Ultra&#8208;Stable Na&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Finely tailored intramolecular dual donor&#8208;acceptor decorated covalent organic framework (designated as TB&#8208;Br&#8208;COF) with two electron migration routes (dual D&#8594;A) and sufficient surface sodiophilic centers is explored as a guiding Na+ transport accelerator via gating effects to exclude competitive anion near Na interface for facilitating the uniform Na deposition.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) face severe challenges of uncontrolled sodium dendrite growth and interfacial instability. Herein, guided by theoretical predictions, a distinct locally polarized covalent organic framework (TB&#8208;Br&#8208;COF) was synthesized and employed as a Na&#8314; transport accelerator to promote uniform Na deposition. TB&#8208;Br&#8208;COF excited the gating effect (a high gating ratio of 23.1) through electronic response to accomplish the separation of Na+ from the electrolyte solvent via the sodiophilic sites (&#8208;O&#8208;C&#9552;C units, C&#9552;N linkages, C&#9472;Br bonds, and aromatic rings). Simultaneously, it synergistically induced two electron migration routes based on the dual donor&#8208;acceptor (linkages and linkers) structures, thereby enhancing both electron separation efficiency and Na+ cations&#8217; transport. Benefiting from that, the TB&#8208;Br&#8208;COF&#8208;based symmetric battery achieved an ultra&#8208;stable operating time of 1000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 1 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the full battery based on the modified Na@TB&#8208;Br&#8208;COF electrode and the carbon&#8208;coated Na3V2(PO4)3/C (NVP/C) demonstrated high compatibility and good cycling stability. Theoretical calculation and in situ spectra measurements have jointly proved the molecular stability and mechanical robustness. Therefore, this investigation unveils an unconventional method for creating COF&#8208;based protective layers for the practical SMBs.

Moreover, the full battery based on the modified Na@TB-Br-COF electrode and the carbon-coated Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/C (NVP/C) demonstrated high compatibility and good cycling stability. Theoretical calculation and in situ spectra measurements have jointly proved the molecular stability and mechanical robustness. Therefore, this investigation unveils an unconventional method for creating COF-based protective layers for the practical SMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Highly Selective Electrocatalytic 1,4&#8208;NADH Regeneration Based on Host&#8211;Guest Recognition Mediated by Cucurbit[8]uril on NiO&#8221;</title>

         <dc:description>
Ning et&#160;al., have reported a very interesting and promising electrochemical method of 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration. The only part of this article that seems to be disputable is the reported mass spectrometry data, namely, the lack of specification of the employed LC&#8208;MS conditions, sometimes the wrong m/z values assigned to the species claimed to be identified, and the lack of the mass spectra of NADH.








Abstract
Recently, Ning et&#160;al., have reported a very interesting and promising electrochemical method of 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration. NAD+ forms host&#8211;guest complex with the cucurbit[8]uril anchored to the NiO surface, and then NAD+ approaches the surface&#8208;adsorbed hydrogen atoms on NiO, which leads to the effective 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration. It is reasonable to expect that the method will find practical application in the industrial processes in which 1,4&#8208;NADH is employed, lowering their costs. The only part of the article by Ning et&#160;al., which seems to be disputable, is the reported mass spectrometry data, sometimes a lack of data, as described in detail in this correspondence.

         <title>Efficient Harvesting of Triplet Excitons via a T1&#8208;Blocked TADF Mechanism in Series Group&#8208;IV MOFs for Optimal X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scintillators play vital roles in fields such as medical imaging, high&#8208;energy physics, astronomy, and radiation monitoring. Their operational principle, rooted in the excitation of high&#8208;energy radiation, underscores that luminescence efficiency in scintillators is fundamentally limited by their capacity to harness triplet excitons. In this context, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules present a promising avenue, enabling the efficient utilization of triplet excitons through thermally activated up&#8208;conversion, thereby advancing the development of superior scintillators. Our investigation reveals a T1&#8208;blocked TADF mechanism in H4TCPE, where efficient singlet&#8208;triplet exciton transfer arises from the minimized S1&#8208;T2 energy gap (0.18 eV). Unlike conventional TADF molecules, H4TCPE features carboxylic acid groups that enable heavy metal coordination to enhance X&#8208;ray attenuation. Using tetravalent metals (Zr, Hf, Th) as nodes and H4TCPE as linkers, we fabricated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that synergize H4TCPE's TADF properties with metal&#8208;enhanced radiation absorption. The resulting MOFs show X&#8208;ray detection and imaging performances superior to pure H4TCPE (20.0 lp/mm and 1.15 &#956;Gy/s for Th&#8208;TCPE v.s. &lt;14.3 lp/mm and 5.01 &#956;Gy/s for H4TCPE), with efficacy correlating to metal atomic number. This work not only broadens TADF molecular diversity through a new energy transfer mechanism and pioneers TADF&#8208;MOF integration for advanced radiation detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Interplay between Stereochemically Active Lone Pair Repulsions, Sigma Hole Interactions, and Delocalized Redox Processes in Topochemical Fluoride&#8208;Ion Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Topochemical insertion/extraction of cations has emerged as a generalizable strategy for modulating the crystal structure and electronic structure of periodic solids. In contrast, strategies for topochemical anion insertion are poorly explored and fundamental design principles for designing insertion hosts to accommodate anions remain scarce. Here, we observe reversible room&#8208;temperature fluoride&#8208;ion insertion within tunnels of Sn2TiO4 defined by the stereochemical expression of Sn 5s2 lone pairs. X&#8208;ray scattering studies of fluoride&#8208;ion&#8208;insertion&#8208;induced modulation of crystal structure and X&#8208;ray absorption/emission spectroscopy probes of electronic structure along with magnetic susceptibility measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations are used to decipher design principles underpinning reversible fluoride&#8208;ion insertion and bulk diffusion. Fluoride&#8208;ion insertion is enabled by a combination of a large, polarizable tunnel, delocalized redox at Ti&#8212;O&#8212;Sn centers, inherent repulsion between the fluoride&#8208;ion and Sn 5s2 electron lone pairs, and the formation of dative interactions between Sn&#8208;centered &#963;&#8208;holes and fluoride&#8208;ions, yielding a reversible capacity of 0.5 fluoride&#8208;ions per Sn2TiO4 formula unit. Our results demonstrate that the complex interplay between dative interactions and stereochemically active lone&#8208;pair repulsions is critical to defining the thermodynamics and kinetics controlling fluoride&#8208;ion insertion and diffusion. As such, the design of fluoride&#8208;ion insertion hosts required for anion batteries requires site&#8208;selective modification to modulate lattice&#8212;ion interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable Catalytic Divergent Synthesis by a Viologen&#8208;Functionalized Lanthanide&#8208;Organic Tetrahedral Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitchable catalysis presents a significant challenge, particularly in the modulation of reaction pathways. In this study, we describe a redox&#8208;active lanthanide&#8208;organic tetrahedral cage 1, self&#8208;assembled from a viologen&#8208;functionalised ditopic tridentate ligand and Eu(III) ions. Complexation&#8208;induced charge redistribution and spatial rearrangement of ligands in the assembly endow 1 with distinct photochromic properties and redox activities compared to free ligand L. 1 can serve as a photoswitchable catalyst for divergent chemical transformations of various tetraarylborates, giving biaryls and phenols via photo&#8208;oxidative coupling reaction under 365 nm light irradiation, or producing mono&#8208;arene products through catalytic de&#8208;composition process in the absence of light. This work represents the first example of photoswitchable divergent synthesis by a single self&#8208;assembled coordination cage, paving the way for the design and construction of novel supramolecular edifices with switchable functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Access to P(V)&#8208;Stereogenic Compounds via Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetrization of (Thio)Phosphonic Dichlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral phosphorus(V) centers&#8212;particularly those bearing fully heteroatom&#8208;substituted frameworks&#8212;are key stereochemical motifs in pharmaceuticals, nucleic acid therapeutics, and functional materials. However, their stereoselective construction remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrization strategy enabled by rationally engineered PIM ligands that affords broad and modular access to structurally diverse P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds. By harnessing the tunable Lewis acidity and well&#8208;defined chiral environment of the catalyst&#8212;together with the distinct mechanistic features of chiral Lewis acid catalysis&#8212;this strategy overcomes the substrate scope limitations that have constrained traditional approaches. The method demonstrates broad functional group tolerance and delivers high levels of stereocontrol across seven distinct substitution patterns, including the efficient construction of chiral P=S motifs previously considered synthetically challenging. Importantly, the approach enables efficient late&#8208;stage derivatization of nucleosides and their analogs, thereby providing a general entry point to stereodefined P(V)&#8208;containing bioactive molecules. This work not only expands the utility of transition&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis in phosphorus chemistry, but also establishes a versatile framework for applications in drug discovery and nucleic acid&#8208;based therapeutics where precise stereochemical control is essential.</dc:description>

However, most of the methods involve harsh conditions &amp; sacrificial reagents, are energy&#8208;intensive &amp; time&#8208;consuming, and generate secondary pollution. This study presents a lithium&#8208;selective ligand&#8208;assisted cooperative approach for the selective leaching of lithium under mild conditions. It is revealed that the synergistic actions of anthraquinone salt (Na2AQAc) and H2O2 generate highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as &#8226;OH, &#8226;O2&#8722;, and 1O2 that facilitate oxidative delithiation supported by spin trapping EPR and quenching experiments. As a result, a phase transition of cathode material and concurrent lithium abstraction by the ligand, forming an octanuclear lithium complex ([Li8(AQAc2&#8208;)2(&#181;&#8208;OH2)2(H2O)12]4+) in the leachate was observed. Consequently, a leaching efficiency of 97% with over 99% selectivity was achieved under the optimized conditions of 3.5% H2O2 (v/v), 30 &#176;C, 72 mM Na2AQAc, 40g/L pulp density, and a reaction time of 1 h. A recycling strategy was demonstrated to recover anthraquinone acid, and lithium was separated as high&#8208;purity Li2CO3. This method offers the advantages of room&#8208;temperature operation, neutral pH conditions, shorter time duration, minimal reagent usage, and the ability to recycle the reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Counterion&#8208;Mediated Luminophore Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emissive organic salts have long been integral to the discovery of fluorescence phenomena and functional luminescent dyes. Typically, one component of the salt acts as the photoactive unit (luminophore) and its non&#8208;emissive counterion is selected to independently tune bulk physical properties, such as solubility. However, the impact of counterion choice on the aggregation and resulting emissive state of organic salts in solution has not been widely investigated. Here, we report that a single cationic luminophore gives rise to either monomer, dimer, excimer or multichromatic emission under otherwise identical conditions by varying only its counterion. We employ N&#8208;methyl quininium (MeQn+) as a permanently charged cationic luminophore, which we pair with a series of monovalent anions. At low solution&#8208;state concentrations, all the salts give identical absorption and emission spectra that correlate with the MeQn+ monomer. However, at higher concentrations, the emission, excitation and absorption data differ, revealing the presence of monomer, dimer, excimer, or all three, depending on the structure of the anion. Understanding and modulating the formation of dimeric or other well&#8208;defined aggregated species by specific ion effects could be exploited in the design of molecular probes for biological systems or emissive thin&#8208;film dispersions for optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Is Phenylnitrene a Missing Link in the Formation of Polycyclic Aromatic Nitrogen Heterocycles?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new formation pathway for polycyclic aromatic nitrogen heterocycles (PANHs) has been found. The reaction of phenylnitrene and the propargyl radical leads to quinoline, proving that nitrenes are suitable precursors for nitrogen incorporation mechanisms. We use double imaging photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy to identify the products and quantum chemistry to explore the mechanism in detail. 








Abstract
The incorporation of heteroatoms into the framework of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), in particular of nitrogen to yield polycyclic aromatic nitrogen heterocycles (PANHs), has been proposed for both astronomical and combustion environments, but no suitable precursors and pathways have been found. Analogous pathways to PAH formation are kinetically or energetically inhibited in the presence of a nitrogen heteroatom. We report on the reaction of phenylnitrene (3PhN, c&#8208;C6H5N) with resonance&#8208;stabilized propargyl radicals (C3H3) and find that the association reaction bifurcates depending on the orientation of the attacking propargyl radical and yields multiple isomeric products. Among them, we identify the condensed&#8208;ring quinoline and conclude that nitrenes are viable candidates to drive the formation of PANHs.

         <title>Deciphering and Predicting Thermal and pH Stabilities of Triplex DNA Under Multifactorial Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplex DNA plays essential roles in disease pathogenesis and therapeutic targeting. To unravel how environments and sequence modulate triplex stability, we developed a high&#8208;throughput 5DFRETMA method. Predictive models were further developed to not only predict thermal stability but also pioneer the prediction of pH stability under variable temperatures and ionic strengths.








Abstract
Triplex DNA, a critical noncanonical nucleic acid structure, plays essential roles in gene regulation, disease pathogenesis, and therapeutic targeting. To unravel how environmental and sequence factors modulate triplex stability, we developed a high&#8208;throughput 5D fluorescence resonance energy transfer melting annealing (5DFRETMA) method. No less than 414 sets of buffer conditions were tested. Monotonically negative correlations were observed between thermal stability and pH, as well as between pH stability and temperature. These relationships are sequence dependent: triplexes with higher G&#8226;C+ Hoogsteen base pair content display a higher sensitivity to pH and temperature variations. Ionic strength exerts dual effects: stabilizing the Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in A&#8226;T base pairs while destabilizing them in G&#8226;C+ base pairs, resulting in a complex ionic strength dependent stability diagram. Critically, as the G&#8226;C+ content increases, the relationship between triplex stability and ionic strength shifts progressively from a monotonically positive to negative dependence. We developed predictive models that not only predict thermal stability but also pioneer the prediction of pH stability under variable temperatures and ionic environments. This work advances the mechanistic understanding of triplex DNA behavior in biologically complex settings, offering tools for the rational design of gene targeted therapeutics and synthetic biology applications.

         <title>Interfacing B&#8208;DNA and DNA Mimic Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical aromatic oligoamide DNA mimic foldamers that reproduce the shape and charge distribution of duplex B&#8208;DNA have been interfaced with DNA duplexes by means of a new linker that serves both as a DNA hairpin and as an aromatic oligoamide unit. In the resulting chimeric molecules, the linker does not perturb the DNA duplex structure and converts the chirality of DNA into handedness control of the foldamer helix.








Abstract
A linker unit was designed and synthesized that can serve both as a hairpin turn in a DNA duplex and anchor point for an aromatic helical foldamer mimicking the shape and surface properties of B&#8208;DNA. Methods were developed to synthesize natural/non&#8208;natural chimeric molecules combining foldamer and DNA segments. The ability of the linker to position the foldamer helix and the duplex DNA so that their rims and grooves are in register, despite their completely different chemical nature, was demonstrated using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, circular dichroism and molecular models. Bio&#8208;layer interferometry confirmed that artificial hairpin DNA duplexes keep their ability to bind to DNA binding proteins. The chimeric molecules may pave the way to competitive inhibitors of protein&#8208;DNA interactions involving sequence&#8208;selective DNA&#8208;binding proteins.

         <title>Enantioselective de novo Construction of Pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;fused Helicenoids via NHC Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented helicoselective synthesis of an array of pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;fused [5]helicenoids and [4]helicenoids has been realized by a one&#8208;step de novo construction strategy based on NHC&#8208;organocatalytic (3+3) annulation of ester&#8208;derived alkynyl acylazoliums with enolizable polyaromatic ketones.








Abstract
Helicenoids have attracted considerable interest in diverse research areas owing to their unique structural and electronic characteristics. However, catalytic asymmetric synthesis of helically chiral molecules has remained a formidable challenge. In particular, the organocatalytic enantioselective construction of heterohelicenoids has witnessed fairly limited progress, presumably due to the lack of rational design of competent substrates, the right choice of suitable reactions, and highly effective catalytic systems. In this study, we report the helicoselective and divergent synthesis of a new class of pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one&#8208;fused [5]helicenoids and [4]helicenoids through an NHC organocatalytic step&#8208;economical (3+3) annulation reaction. The protocol features broad substrate scope, ease of late&#8208;stage functionalization, and excellent stereo&#8208;control with enantioselectivities up to &gt;99%. Moreover, the optical properties of the synthesized oxohelicenoids and their derivatives were characterized to explore their potential applications in material sciences.

The protocol features broad substrate scope, ease of late-stage functionalization, and excellent stereo-control with enantioselectivities up to &amp;gt;99%. Moreover, the optical properties of the synthesized oxohelicenoids and their derivatives were characterized to explore their potential applications in material sciences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Theodor F&#246;rster: Life and FRET from 1933 to 1951. A Viewpoint from the Archives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theodor F&#246;rster's name is forever linked to FRET (F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer) and while his development of FRET theory is well known and recognized, only few is documented about his scientific career and life from 1933 to 1951. By reviewing documents from different archives, this Viewpoint Article discusses F&#246;rster's life and career before, during, and after National Socialism in Germany.








Abstract
FRET stands for F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. While much is known about resonance energy transfer, much less is known about F&#246;rster&#8211;apart from the fact that he was the one who translated FRET from a theoretical phenomenon into a broadly usable method for investigating and understanding biomolecular interactions on the nanoscale. Arguably, a major reason for the limited recognition of Theodor F&#246;rster is his scientific career during the Nazi time in Germany about which little is documented. By reviewing documents from different archives, this Viewpoint Article&#8211;on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his death&#8211;sheds some light on F&#246;rster's life from 1933 to 1951 and describes how a young scientist struggled during dark times in history.

         <title>Direct Integration of Functionalized Bridges by One&#8208;Step Superacid&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction to Fabricate Porous Polymers for CO2 Capture and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;step polymerization of unfunctionalized polyaromatic monomers and glyoxylic acid under superacid&#8208;catalysis conditions promotes the simultaneous generation of highly porous 3D architectures and the controlled decoration of pore surfaces with aliphatic carboxylic acids. These ultra&#8208;microporous frameworks and their ester and polyionic derivatives, based on Li+ and Na+ carboxylate, demonstrate exceptional affinity for CO2 and CO2/N2 separation capabilities. 








Abstract
A novel class of ultra&#8208;microporous functionalized porous organic polymers (POPs) was developed starting from glyoxylic acid as a cross&#8208;linker and triflic acid as a catalyst on polyaromatic monomers, generating in situ methine bridges with carboxylic acids. This one&#8208;pot synthetic method generated functionalized POPs with high connectivity per each aromatic group and a high density of aliphatic carboxylic acids decorating the pore walls. Remarkably, the functional groups were transformed into esters, Na&#8208; and Li&#8208;carboxylates by post&#8208;synthetic modification with high yields, generating polyionic porous polymers. These porous polymers displayed excellent CO2 adsorption at 298&#160;K and isosteric heat of adsorption with values as high as 50&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for the Na&#8208;containing POP endowed with numerous ionic charges, as estimated by direct measurements with microcalorimetry coupled to CO2 adsorption isotherms. Dynamic breakthrough experiments on self&#8208;supporting monolithic composites demonstrated high selectivity for CO2 adsorption over N2 up to 500 for diluted streams and 340 under relevant conditions for carbon capture from flue gases (0.15 CO2 partial pressure).

         <title>Reactivity of Pnictaalumenes Towards 1,3&#8208;Dipole Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pnictaalumenes with a Pn&#9552;Al multiple bonds undergo azide or diazoalkene insertions rather than [3+2] cycloadditions. This results in AlN2P heterocycles, which show a great structural variety depending on the sterics of the azide. With TMS&#8208;diazoalkane, thermal rearrangements afford rare cyanidoaluminates.








Abstract
Alkynes undergo 1,3&#8208;dipolar cyclization reactions with organic azides giving 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. Pnictaalumenes RPn&#9552;AlR&#712; are the isoelectronic congeners of alkynes, hence a similar reactivity toward 1,3&#8208;dipole molecules is expected. Herein, we report the reactions of DippTerPn&#9552;AlCp* (DippTer&#160; = &#160;2,6&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)&#8208;C6H3, Cp*&#160; = &#160;[Me5C5], Pn&#160; = &#160;P, As) toward aryl azides. Instead of the anticipated phosphaaluminatriazole products from a [3+2] cyclization, the formation of four&#8208;membered AlN2Pn ring systems of the general form DippTerPn(&#956;&#8208;NR)2AlCp* was observed. Depending on the steric profile of the azide, different outcomes were observed: a) N&#945; insertion into the Pn&#9552;Al bond accompanied by twofold N2 elimination, b) N&#947; insertion under preservation of the N3 motif, or c) mixed Na/N&#947; products. The bonding situation is complex and best described as Al(III) complexes with NPnN&#8208;amino&#8208;amide&#8208;type ligands. A twofold insertion also occurs with the isovalent electronic diazoalkane Me3Si(H)C&#9552;N2, yielding imine&#8208;substituted AlN2Pn derivatives. In the case of its P&#8208;congener, two thermal rearrangements were observed, which first result in a AlN3P ring species with a terminal Al&#9472;CN unit, followed by a second slower rearrangement to an aluminate cyanido complex with an unusual NNN pincer&#8208;type ligand framework. The current study contrasts well&#8208;established [3+2] cyclization reactions between alkynes and 1,3&#8208;dipoles and provides access to unprecedented ligand motifs.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of Aliphatic Alcohol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction of aliphatic mesylates is reported. This reaction provides a strategy for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive compounds that have high F(sp3). Preliminary mechanistic experiments confirm a stereoablative reaction outcome, consistent with alkyl radical intermediates. Application in an enantioselective transformation is demonstrated for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;aryl glutaramides.








Abstract
Reactions leveraging readily available starting materials are valuable for synthetic utility, especially for late&#8208;stage functionalization. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling (XC) reaction of aliphatic sulfonates with aryl boronic acids. This reaction provides straightforward access to an array of arylated products in good yield. We have established a one&#8208;pot protocol allowing for the arylation of alcohols in a single reaction vessel. Additionally, an asymmetric reaction was developed to provide enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;aryl and heteroaryl glutarimides in good yield and enantioselectivity.

This reaction provides a strategy for late-stage functionalization of bioactive compounds that have high F(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Preliminary mechanistic experiments confirm a stereoablative reaction outcome, consistent with alkyl radical intermediates. Application in an enantioselective transformation is demonstrated for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;-aryl glutaramides.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactions leveraging readily available starting materials are valuable for synthetic utility, especially for late-stage functionalization. Herein, we report a nickel-catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross-coupling (XC) reaction of aliphatic sulfonates with aryl boronic acids. This reaction provides straightforward access to an array of arylated products in good yield. We have established a one-pot protocol allowing for the arylation of alcohols in a single reaction vessel. Additionally, an asymmetric reaction was developed to provide enantioenriched &#945;-aryl and heteroaryl glutarimides in good yield and enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identification of Ti(salen) Complexes for Efficient Catalysis in Single&#8208;Electron Steps by Cyclic Voltammetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst screening without catalysis. By combining cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations we were able to identify a highly active catalyst for the radical arylation of epoxides without performing any reactions. The prevention of chloride binding that leads to catalyst inhibition was established as the key structural feature. Our best catalyst is applicable for a broad variety of substrates after electrochemical or chemical activation.








Abstract
We describe the identification of an active Ti(salen) catalyst for the radical arylation of epoxides by a cyclic voltammetry study of mechanism&#8208;based predictors, such as the redox potentials of the complexes and their EqCr&#8208;equilibria, for the success of catalysis. Surprisingly, by far the most active catalyst features an uncommon tetrasubstituted ligand backbone, which renders chloride binding to the active Ti(III) species less favorable, thereby increasing catalyst activity due to improved substrate binding. Catalysis is most efficient in the &#8220;green&#8221; solvent ethyl acetate and can be initiated using base metals as well as electrochemical methods for the reduction of the Ti(salen)&#8208;precatalyst. Compared to the commonly employed titanocene catalysis, the use of the newly developed Ti(salen) catalyst allows for the use of milder and more sustainable reactions conditions, a broader substrate scope, and facile modification of the catalyst's electronic and steric properties.

         <title>Escape from Flatland: Stereoselective Synthesis of Hexa&#8208;aryl Borazines and their sp2&#8208;Based 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short text: The first synthesis of hexa&#8208;arylborazines with ortho&#8208;substituted aryl groups expands their three&#8208;dimensional structure. By selecting the appropriate ortho&#8208;substituent, the ArLi adds to the BN&#8208;core in a controlled manner, guiding the stereochemical outcome of the three&#8208;substitution reaction. This stereoselective approach enables the synthesis of multichromophoric borazine derivatives, demonstrating how the stereochemical arrangement influences their redox behavior.







Abstract
Borazine and its derivatives can be considered critical doping units for engineering hybrid C(sp2)&#8208;based molecules with tailored optoelectronic properties. Herein, we report the first synthesis of hexa&#8208;arylborazines that, bearing ortho&#8208;substituted aryl moieties, extend three&#8208;dimensionally. Using a one&#8208;pot protocol, we first form an electrophilic chloroborazole and then react it with an aryl lithium (ArLi). By selecting the appropriate ortho&#8208;substituent, we can guide the ArLi to add to the BN&#8208;core in a specific way, ultimately controlling the stereochemical outcome of the three&#8208;substitution reaction. Rationalization of the stereochemical model through computational analysis allowed us to show that when aryl lithium nucleophiles bearing rigid long&#8208;range ortho&#8208;substituents are used, i.e., stiff substituents. The ortho&#8208;substituent shields its side of the electrophilic B3N3 core, biasing the incoming ArLi to add anti at each addition step, forming the final tri&#8208;aryl borazine exclusively as cc&#8208;isomer. Leveraging this stereoselective approach, prototypical multichromophoric borazine derivatives were prepared, and we showcased how the stereochemical arrangement of these chromophores distinctly influences their redox behavior. This methodology paves the way for previously inaccessible borazines to serve as privileged precursors to transcend the conventional bidimensionality associated with graphenoid systems and pioneer the construction of new forms of three&#8208;dimensional C(sp2)&#8208;based architectures.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Boosts the Uptake of Small Molecules in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bonding, a non&#8208;covalent interaction between the chalcogen atom (S, Se, Te) and Lewis base, plays crucial roles in catalysis, anion recognition, protein confirmation, enzyme activity and drug design. Herein, we show that chalcogen bonding can be used as a driving force to enhance the uptake of small molecules in mammalian cells. A systematic investigation using several chalcogen&#8208;containing fluorescent molecules reveal that the cellular uptake strongly depends on the nature of chalcogen atom and the compounds with heavier chalcogen atoms (Se and Te), which can form stronger chalcogen bonds, are preferentially taken up by the cells. This study suggests that the biological activities of chalcogen&#8208;based compounds may depend not only on their chemical reactivity, but also on their chalcogen bond forming ability with the cell membrane.</dc:description>

         <title>A Polyaromatic Metallotube with a Dual Multi&#8208;Functionalization Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;functionalization is an advanced, key synthetic method in supramolecular systems, whereas the previous method relies heavily on the substitution on the organic frameworks. Here we report a polyaromatic metallotube capable of dually multi&#8208;functionalizing the metal sites in an efficient post&#8208;assembly fashion. The Pt(II)&#8208;linked tube with tetrachloro groups is prepared from two PtCl2 hinges and two bent bispyridine ligands in high yield. The new metallotube efficiently converts to tetra&#8208;substituted tubes by the first multiple functionalization, through the replacement of the chloro groups with various alkynyl groups. The tubular structures before/after the functionalization are unequivocally confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. A resultant tetraammonium&#8208;attached Pt(II)tube exhibits high water solubility and uptake abilities toward spherical and rod&#8208;like compounds. The metallotube strongly binds one molecule of fullerene C60 in the polyaromatic cavity yet releases it through the second multi&#8208;functionalization by tetrabromination of the metal hinges in a quantitative and reversible manner. Even after Bingel reaction within the tube, sterically demanding bis&#8208;substituted fullerenes (&gt;~80% selectivity) are readily released by the second functionalization. The present method, i.e., the use of simple PtCl2 hinges, will be applicable to wide&#8208;ranging metallo&#8208;supramolecules to enhance their structural and functional versatilities via post&#8208;multifunctionalizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Benzannulation of Oxaquadricyclanes Promoted by a Polyoxometalate Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the significance of strain&#8208;release reactions, various spring&#8208;loaded molecules have emerged as important building blocks in diverse fields of chemical science. Despite progress in this area, oxaquadricyclanes remain an understudied class of molecules. In the present report, the strain energy of in situ&#8208;generated oxaquadricyclane was utilized for benzannulation reaction, which was photocatalyzed by a polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based photocatalyst ({Mo7O24@&#947;&#8208;FeO(OH)}), in which the Anderson&#8208;type polyoxomolybdate [Mo7O24]6&#8722; anions enhance the stability of photoactive &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore. The band alignment of this POM&#8208;based complete inorganic semiconductor enables the harvesting of photons from visible light and provides superior thermal and oxidative stability while addressing the cost and performance limitations of conventional organo&#8208;photocatalysts. Using this novel photocatalyst, we successfully synthesized benzindene and dihydrophenanthrene scaffolds from dienyl sulfoxonium ylides and electron&#8208;deficient alkynes through unusual photochemical rearrangements. These benzannulated compounds are notable for their structural similarity to bioactive aromatic steroids and demonstrate their potential as lead candidates for therapeutic development. Through systematic optimization and mechanistic studies, we highlight the critical role of the polyoxometalate catalyst, the challenges of controlling strain energy&#8208;driven reactivity, and the selective rearrangement of oxaquadricyclane scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Role of Lattice Selenium in Electrocatalytic Self&#8208;Reconstruction for Boosting Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cathode reconstruction is equally crucial for water electrolysis, yet has received less attention than anode. Lattice selenium (Se) doping is an effective strategy to improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts in cathode, but many fundamental questions concerning the actual role of Se on the active species as well as catalytic kinetics remain to be clarified, especially in those electrocatalytic self&#8208;reconstruction systems. Here, we&#160;showcase the accelerated two&#8208;stage structural evolution of Se doped cobalt phosphide (Se&#8208;CoP) during alkaline HER by operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, combined with high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis. Further density functional theory calculations suggest that the in situ formed dual&#8208;component heterostructure of highly crystalline Co(OH)2 and robust Co nanoclusters, which decorated with residual Se, is responsible for the high HER performance. The reconstructed Se&#8208;CoP on carbon cloth delivers a low overpotential of 79 &#177; 2 mV at 100 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2 and achieves an impressive charge transfer amount of&#160;6.3&#215;105 C&#183;cm&#8208;2&#160;operating at 500 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2, surpassing the reported electrocatalysts constructed by non&#8208;noble metal phosphides. This work provides brand&#8208;new perspectives on the self&#8208;reconstruction perturbed by heteroatoms for well&#8208;designed composite electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging One&#8208; and Multi&#8208;Photon Processes in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Enhanced NIR Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal and Photochemical Conversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct application of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light for solar&#8208;thermal and solar&#8208;chemical conversions is of emergent interest to improving efficiency in solar&#8208;energy utilization. Herein, we report a synthetic approach to NIR&#8208;responsive materials by self&#8208;assembly of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF&#8208;1/2/3) from multifunctionalized Ru&#8208;components incorporating chiral, photoactive, H&#8208;bonding, &#960;&#8208;stacking, and protonation/deprotonation subunits. Significantly, protonation of the imidazole&#8208;subunits in HOF&#8208;3 promotes densified packing to extend NIR&#8208;absorption tail up to 1100 nm with a narrowed bandgap of 1.41 eV, meanwhile leads to spontaneous resolution of enantiomeric &#916;&#8208;/&#923;&#8208;HOF&#8208;3. Consequently, remarkably enhanced photothermal effect and photocatalytic performance, including chiroptical activity induced by circularly polarized NIR&#8208;light, are achieved through synergy of direct one&#8208; and multi&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;absorption,&#160;underscoring effectiveness to bring multifunctionalities into ordered HOFs for generation of robust and effective materials with multimode NIR&#8208;responsiveness.</dc:description>

         <title>An Integrated Tandem&#8208;Structured Separator Enables Dual&#8208;Enhanced Stable Interfaces for Long&#8208;Cycle&#8208;Life and High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (AZIBs) hold great promise for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies due to their inherent safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. However, unstable interfacial chemistry manifested as polyiodides formation and accumulation at the cathode, alongside dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the anode results in capacity loss. Moreover, polyiodide migration toward the anode further triggers severe Zn corrosion, exacerbating interfacial instability. Herein, we design an integrated tandem&#8208;structured separator comprising an In2O3&#8208;SiO2 (ISO) layer with a buffer&#8208;release&#8208;repair mechanism and a polyiodide adsorption&#8208;catalysis layer featuring Co nanoparticles&#8208;encapsulated carbon nanofiber (Co@CNF) to achieve dual&#8208;enhanced stable interfaces. Specifically, amphoteric In2O3 within the ISO layer effectively neutralizes OH&#8315; generated by localized HER, concurrently releasing soluble indium species. These indium species subsequently electrodeposit to form zincophilic and HER&#8208;inhibiting sites on the affected regions, restoring interfacial environment and mitigating Zn anode degradation. Meanwhile, the Co@CNF layer anchors polyiodides and significantly catalyzes conversion kinetics, suppressing the shuttle effect and preventing polyiodide&#8208;induced anode corrosion. Benefiting from the synergistic stabilization of both electrode interfaces, the as&#8208;fabricated Zn||ISO+Co@CNF||I2 full cells achieve a high areal capacity of 2.97 mAh cm&#8208;2 and remarkable cycling stability over 20,000 cycles. This work provides valuable insights into designing functional separators for practical AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbocation&#8208;Based Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters with Efficient Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters hold great promise for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays, but are fundamentally restricted to wide&#8208;energy&#8208;gap heteropolycyclic systems typically with blue&#8208;to&#8208;green emissions, while their yellow&#8208;to&#8208;red emissions remain a major challenge. Here we propose a strategy for developing MR&#8208;TADF emitters with narrow energy gaps (less than 2.20 eV) by doping positively&#8208;charged carbenium ion (C+) into polycyclic skeletons to create strong short&#8208;range charge transfer with electron&#8208;rich nitrogen atoms, achieving a significant 160 nm emission redshift compared to the benchmark neutral boron&#8208;based counterpart. Furthermore, steric isopropyl groups and bulky tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate counter ions are synergistically integrated to suppress intermolecular aggregation, yielding high solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum efficiencies up to 90%. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the emitters exhibit promising external quantum efficiency of 29.4% with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 0.17 eV, opening the way for development of ion&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters toward efficient long&#8208;wavelength narrowband electroluminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategic secondary coordination implantation towards efficient and stable Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalysts for PEMFCs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts demonstrate platinum&#8208;comparable initial activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), their operational durability in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) remains fundamentally limited by progressive destabilization of Fe&#8208;N bond under electrochemical cycling, resulting in irreversible metal leaching, catastrophic catalyst degradation and the so&#8208;called activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. Herein, guided by first&#8208;principles screening, we demonstrate that the strategic implantation of transition metal ions with d&#8208;orbital characteristics analogous to the active site into the secondary coordination sphere, functioning as non&#8208;catalytic stabilizers, enables dynamic neutralization of reaction intermediates&#8208;induced electronic polarization, thereby achieving stabilization of metal&#8208;nitrogen bonds during the ORR cycle. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the integration of isovalent Ru ions as electron&#8208;buffing site in the designed FeRu dual&#8208;atom catalyst not only achieves a high peak power density of 1.73 W cm&#8208;2 with a current density of 58 mA cm&#8208;2 at 0.9 V, but also exhibits exceptional durability, with a current decay rate of just 0.2 mA cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 and over 97% Fe retention after prolonged stability tests. This stands in stark contrast to Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C counterparts, which retain less than 11% of Fe sites under identical conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extreme similarity in electronic and steric reactivity among the C&#8208;H bonds present on alkyl&#8208;substituted aromatic rings presents a formidable challenge when it comes to achieving high selectivity during the para&#8208;selective functionalization of these bonds. This article presents a unique study that delves into the para&#8208;selective functionalization or dearomatization functionalization of benzene rings, achieved through the reaction of carbenes with allyl sulfoxides. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the transformation likely proceeds via an uncommon carbene&#8208;mediated [4,5]&#8208;rearrangement process.</dc:description>

         <title>[TeSeS2]2&#8211;: The First Heterotriple&#8208;Chalcogenide Motifs Decode Giant Mid&#8208;Far Infrared Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical anisotropy, a cornerstone of polarization control, presents fundamental challenge in functional optical material design due to the intricate interplay between its regulation mechanisms and performance optimization. The development of mid&#8208;far infrared (MFIR) birefringent crystals has long been shackled by the incompatibility between giant optical anisotropy and ultrabroad transparency in conventional chalcogenides. Here, we resolve this challenge via heterotriple&#8208;chalcogenide engineering in the first thiotellurite birefringent family, BaTeQ3 (Q = S, Se), featuring isolated [TeQ3]2&#8722; motifs. The BaTeS3 achieves a large experimental birefringence (&#916;n=0.193@550 nm, 15&#215; commercial MgF2). While strategic selenium substitution creates the first heterotriple&#8208;chalcogenide motif&#8212;[TeSeS2]2&#8722; in BaTeSeS2, delivering calculated &#916;n=0.55@550 nm&#8212;a 284% increase from BaTeS3 and surpassing all known commercial benchmarks. These materials concurrently exhibit ultrabroad transparency (0.42&#8208;25 &#956;m), overcoming the classical trade&#8208;off between anisotropy and IR transparency. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that their extraordinary optical anisotropy stems from synergistic stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP)&#8208;driven electron localization in [TeQ3]2&#8211; units (electron localization function &gt; 0.8) and Se&#8208;induced pyramidal distortion. The pioneering [TeSeS2]2&#8722; heterotriple&#8208;chalcogenide motif establishes a transformative design paradigm, not only redefines the materials motifs for giant MFIR birefringence but also unlocks unprecedented opportunities in next&#8208;generation infrared lasers, polarizers, and quantum communication devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Vinylated Cyclic Allene: A Fleeting Strained Diene for the Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fleeting molecules possessing strained multiple bonds are important components in organic synthesis due to their ability to undergo various chemical reactions driven by the release of strain energy. While the use of strained &#960;&#8208;bonds as 2&#960; components, represented by dienophiles in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, has been well studied, &#8220;the strained diene (4&#960; component) approach&#8221; for molecular construction remains underexplored. Herein, we report the design of a vinyl cyclic allene (1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexadiene) as a highly reactive strained diene and the development of its Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. Experimental and computational studies of vinyl cyclic allenes revealed that this diene system undergoes cycloaddition with dienophiles regio&#8208; and stereoselectively under mild reaction conditions. These studies also provide insight into the reactivity and selectivity of the system. The strained diene approach enables the convergent construction of polycyclic molecules through bond disconnections distinct from conventional retrosynthetic analysis, thus offering an efficient strategy for the assembly of functional molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Crystalline/Amorphous Interfaces for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the request for carbon neutrality, CO2 electroreduction to high&#8208;value fuels and chemicals, particularly formic acid, has become as a promising approach. However, implementing it on an industrial scale is hindered by the catalyst instability under high current densities and the excessive energy consumption of conventional electrolysis systems. To tackle these challenges, we propose an amorphization strategy to regulate catalyst reconstruction under operational conditions. In particular, an amorphous In&#8208;based catalyst, InOx(OH)3&#8722;2x, was designed and achieved high Faradaic efficiencies of 98% at &#8722;800 to &#8722;1000 mA cm&#8722;2 for CO2 electroreduction to formate, while maintaining stability for 100 hours. Mechanistic studies show that InOx(OH)3&#8722;2x undergoes partial reduction to stable crystalline/amorphous In/In&#8208;OH interfaces instead of fully reducing to metallic In, enhancing the adsorption of CO2 and *OCHO intermediate. To improve the economic viability of electrolysis system, a CO2 electroreduction coupled with waste plastics electrooxidation system for formate production was constructed. Compared to conventional electrolysis system, the coupled system reduced energy consumption by 34.7% and increased formate production by 49.7%, offering a more energy&#8208;efficient and cost&#8208;effective approach to CO2 electroreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of ambient organic acids on the water structure at TiO2 interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A molecular&#8208;level understanding of the effects of ambient organic compounds on the wettability of titanium dioxide (TiO2) surfaces is relevant to many of its energy&#8208;related and environmental applications. Herein, we focus on two common atmospheric carboxylic acids, formic and acetic acid, and characterize their adsorption/ desorption at the aqueous interfaces of anatase and rutile TiO2&#160;using molecular dynamics with an ab initio deep neural network potential. Our simulations show that these acids prefer to be localized in the interfacial water layers close to the TiO2 surface where they are stabilized by the interaction/exchange of their acid proton with a surface oxygen, rather than chemisorb at the surface Ti sites by displacing the adsorbed water. Notably, these acids make the surface of anatase hydrophobic, whereas the larger fraction of adsorbed water dissociation can offset their effect on rutile. These results provide a picture where carboxylic acids control the wettability of TiO2 largely through acid&#8208;base chemistry at the interface rather than chemisorption on the oxide surface, a finding that can help improve the design of self&#8208;cleaning surfaces and photocatalytic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Phosphorylation of Phenols and Benzenediols by the Kinase PsiK and Variants Thereof</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorylation plays important roles in biology by modulating the structure, reactivity, and biological function of a broad range of molecules. Biocatalytic phosphorylation has attracted attention from synthetic chemists due to its selectivity and mild reaction conditions using ATP as a phosphate donor. Given the potential synthetic utility of kinases with activity on small molecule substrates, we explored the activity of PsiK, the enzyme responsible for selective 4&#8208;O&#8208;phosphorylation of 4&#8208;hydroxytryptamine or psilocin in psylocybin biosynthesis by&#160;Psilocybe cubensis.&#160;We find that PsiK has good activity on a range of substituted phenols and benzenediols beyond its native substrate, enabling preparative phosphorylation of different substrates, and substantially expands the substrate scope of biocatalytic phosphorylation. We also show that active site mutations can further expand substrate scope and improve site&#8208;selectivity. This engineering effort was greatly expedited using DESI&#8208;MS screening, which enabled analysis of 2,688 reactions in only 40 min. Finally, gram&#8208;scale phosphorylation of a representative substrate was achieved with a turnover number over 10,000. Together, these results highlight the biocatalytic utility of PsiK and derivatives thereof for selective phosphorylation of phenols and benzenediols under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Clinical Detection Accuracy of Large Structured Viral RNA via DNAzyme Cleavage and Antisense&#8208;Assisted Rolling Circle Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitive detection of viral RNA is critical for accurate diagnostics, particularly during outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) is a powerful isothermal amplification strategy that can be directly primed by RNA, eliminating the need for reverse transcription. Previous approaches have used 10&#8208;23 DNAzymes to cleave viral RNA, generating 3&#8242;&#8208;ends for hybridization to circular DNA templates (CDTs). However, the resulting RNA fragments often retained secondary or tertiary structures that hindered CDT binding and limited RCA efficiency. To address this challenge, we developed antisense oligonucleotide&#8208;assisted RCA (ASO&#8208;RCA), a general strategy that uses short upstream antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to remodel RNA structure and expose the CDT&#8208;binding site. Using five DNAzyme&#8208;CDT systems targeting distinct regions of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome, we show that ASO inclusion improves CDT hybridization and enhances RCA output&#8212;by up to 70&#8208;fold. This enhancement was observed using both linear and quasi&#8208;exponential RCA formats and remained effective in 50% pooled saliva. When applied to clinical saliva samples, ASO&#8208;assisted RCA markedly improved diagnostic performance, achieving 100% sensitivity and up to 97.5&#8211;100% accuracy across multiple systems. These findings establish ASO&#8208;DNAzyme&#8208;RCA as a simple, robust, and clinically relevant platform for improving nucleic acid detection in structured RNA targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Chirally Chimeric Protein Nanoparticle Vaccines via Mirror&#8208;Image Spy Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mirror&#8208;image proteins and nucleic acids exhibit remarkable biostability and bioorthogonality, offering a promising strategy to enhance the longevity of biological therapeutics. Here, we present a modular approach for constructing complex protein architectures that integrate both natural&#8208;chirality (L&#8208;) and mirror&#8208;image (D&#8208;) motifs.&#160;Key to this strategy is the development of D&#8208;SpyStapler&#8212;a chemically synthesized, chirally inverted ligase that enables the efficient conjugation of D&#8208;SpyTag and D&#8208;BDTag.&#160;By exploiting the achirality of glycine (Gly), we used L&#8208;sortase to covalently link D&#8208;peptides (e.g., SpyTag or BDTag, bearing an N&#8208;terminal poly&#8208;Gly motif) to L&#8208;proteins (e.g., GFP, VLP&#8208;forming Mi3, or antigens) containing a C&#8208;terminal LPXTG sorting signal. The resulting D&#8208;SpyTagged and D&#8208;BDTagged proteins were further assembled via D&#8208;SpyStapler. This method enabled the construction of chirally chimeric VLP vaccines displaying antigens derived from malaria parasites and coronaviruses in various forms&#8212;recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides&#8212;providing significant flexibility and modularity for vaccine design. The resulting chirally hybrid vaccines exhibited enhanced proteolytic resistance in vitro and elicited potent immune responses in vivo.&#160;This study provides a versatile platform for developing long&#8208;acting therapeutics and vaccines.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterizing Disorders Within Cathode Materials of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we categorized the structural disorder of cathode materials by the scale of ordering from short&#8208;range to long&#8208;range. Additionally, we summarized how we can interpret the analyzed data, highlighting the advantages of each characterization based on X&#8208;ray, electron, neutron, laser, and magnetic fields in elucidating the relationship between disorder and properties to enhance the energy density of cathode materials.








Abstract
The demand for developing high&#8208;energy density cathode materials has been increasing. The energy densities of cathode materials have been improved by adapting structural deviation from the ideal fully ordered &#945;&#8208;NaFeO2 type, but that led to limitations in terms of structural stability and safety. Although disorders in cathode materials are closely related to their electrochemical properties, unfortunately, characterizing the disorder itself in cathode materials has been challenging due to its complex parasitic reaction and strong correlation with other disorders occurring during charge/discharge. In this review, we categorize various disorders by their scales of ordering from short&#8208;range to long&#8208;range. We addressed the principles of various characterization tools to figure out how they can help to identify the structural disorder in cathode materials. Specifically, we focused on the underlying principles of each characterization technique to correlate different disorder&#8208;driven phenomena through several case studies. It underscores the substantial importance of disorder&#8208;property relationships and the corresponding characterization methods, which can provide novel research strategies for developing high&#8208;energy density cathode materials with decent structural stability.

         <title>Reactive Cysteines in Proteins are the Dominant Reductants for Platinum(IV) Prodrug Activation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt&#8208;Luc was developed as a pioneering bioluminescent reporter for real&#8208;time monitoring of Pt(IV) reduction in live cells. Using this advanced reporter, we identified that reactive cysteines in proteins, rather than those in small molecules, predominantly mediate the reduction of Pt(IV) prodrugs. Furthermore, the thiol&#8208;mediated reduction of Pt(IV) complexes was corroborated in vivo.








Abstract
The intracellular reduction of Pt(IV) prodrugs is crucial for their anticancer efficacy. However, the major components responsible for the reduction of Pt(IV) complexes within live cells remain elusive. Herein, we developed an aminoluciferin&#8208;functionalized Pt(IV) complex, Pt&#8208;Luc, that can be used as a bioluminescent reporter for real&#8208;time monitoring of Pt(IV) reduction in live cancer cells by capturing immediate bioluminescent signals from the released aminoluciferin. Utilizing this powerful reporter, we found that the reduction of Pt(IV) prodrugs in live cancer cells significantly slows down when cysteine levels are reduced, while the levels of glutathione do not impact the reduction rate. Further investigation reveals that reactive cysteines in proteins, rather than small&#8208;molecule thiols, play a primary role in reducing the Pt(IV) complex. In vivo studies reveal a substantial 63% decrease in bioluminescence from Pt&#8208;Luc in thiol&#8208;blocking tumors in mice, reinforcing the pivotal role of reactive cysteines in Pt(IV) reduction. This study provides valuable insights into the activation mechanisms of Pt(IV) prodrugs in live cells and in vivo, enhancing our understanding of prodrug activation beyond buffer systems or fixed cells.

         <title>Benchmark Paraffin Adsorption in a Super&#8208;Hydrophobic Porous Coordination Polymer with Blade&#8208;Like Circular Phenyl Nanotraps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;hydrophobic porous coordination polymer (ZnFPCP) with blade&#8208;like circular phenyl nanotraps was designed to address the long&#8208;standing challenge of paraffin/olefin separation under humid conditions. The confined nonpolar environment enables record&#8208;high uptake of C3H8 and C2H6 at low pressures, exceptional selectivity over olefins, and high productivity of polymer&#8208;grade olefins in breakthrough experiments.








Abstract
Selective capture of paraffin from olefin that permits one&#8208;step purification of olefin is significantly important, yet developing adsorbents with high selectivity and hydrophobicity remains a daunting challenge. Although aromatic environments can enhance paraffin affinity and hydrophobicity through nonpolar interactions, water adsorption still occurs in regions distant from the aromatic rings, as well as in secondary pores that are always overlooked. Herein, we reported an ultramicroporous porous coordination polymer (ZnFPCP) featuring blade&#8208;like circular phenyl paraffin nanotraps. As further validated by density functional tight binding (DFTB) calculations, grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and in situ Fourier&#8208;tansform infrared absorption (FT&#8208;IR) analysis, these ultramicroporous paraffin nanotraps created by surrounding benzene rings enhance the paraffin&#8208;selective adsorption, and the segmented spaces between adjacent nanotraps in the blade&#8208;like structure, combined with hydrophobic petal&#8208;like secondary pore channels enclosed by fluorinated functional groups, further mitigate the water co&#8208;adsorption. Remarkably, ZnFPCP exhibited outstanding ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST) selectivity (C3H8/C3H6: 2.08, C2H6/C2H4: 2.93) under ambient conditions and record&#8208;breaking C3H8/C2H6 uptake at low pressures. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated the excellent performance of ZnFPCP in olefin purification, affording the exceptional productivity of ultra&#8208;high purity (99.99%) for C3H6 and C2H4. Robust stability and super hydrophobicity highlight its potential in harsh industrial application scenarios.

         <title>Retained Oxygen Regulation in Oxide&#8208;Derived Copper for Promoted CO2 Electroreduction Toward Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thickness determined strategy has been demonstrated to regulate oxygen retention in oxide&#8208;derived Cu for CO2 electroreduction. With the thickness decreasing to 1.6&#160;nm, the CuO nanosheets exhibit enhanced oxygen retention and reoxidation ability, achieving up to 84.6% C2+ faradaic efficiency at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the retained oxygen facilitates *CHO intermediate formation and promotes *OC&#9472;CHO coupling, thereby enhancing C2+ selectivity.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to multicarbon products provides an attractive route to store intermittent renewable electricity as high value&#8208;added chemicals. Oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8208;Cu) has been widely investigated for its tunable selectivity toward multicarbon (C2+) products; however, it still remains a challenge to understand and regulate the retained oxygen of OD&#8208;Cu in the complex reconstruction process. In this work, we investigate thickness determined residual oxygen in OD&#8208;Cu, using CuO nanosheets as prototype precatalysts. When the thickness of CuO precatalyst decreased to 1.6&#160;nm, the enhancement of the ability to retain oxygen are achieved, leading to selective C2+ production with Faradaic efficiency of around 80% over a wide current density range of 300&#8211;700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a peak value of 84.6% at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Long&#8208;time molecular dynamics simulations reveal the enhanced stability of Cu&#8211;CuO structure with the layers of removed oxygen increased, favoring *CHO formation and *OC&#8208;CHO coupling toward C2+ products; structural characterizations and electrochemical results further demonstrate the reconstructed stacked nanosheets with high oxygen retention capacity and easily reoxidized metallic Cu sites. This work underscores the crucial role of the retained oxygen for the OD&#8208;Cu performance and provides insights into designing OD&#8208;Cu with oxygen retention to enhance C2+ products formation.

         <title>Organic Cation Modulation in Hybrid Zirconium Halides for High&#8208;Performance Flexible X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the molecular design based on the steric hindrance effect and hydrogen bond, a new hybrid material with high&#8208;quality 0D structure, better lattice stability, and fewer defects is obtained, and finally achieves the excellent large&#8208;area detection performance with a high spatial resolution of 21.35&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1 and a low detection limit of 2.270&#160;&#181;Gyair&#160;s&#8722;1.








Abstract
Exploiting novel materials featuring high&#8208;quality zero&#8208;dimensional structure, remarkable lattice stability, and minimal defects represents an efficacious strategy for enhancing the detection performance of X&#8208;ray scintillators. Here, we design and synthesize two novel zirconium&#8208;based organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIMHs), C14H40N4ZrCl8 and C6H16N2ZrCl6. Based on the steric hindrance effect of organic cations, the distance between [ZrCl6]2&#8722; polyhedra was designed, and the electronic coupling interactions among polyhedra were adjusted, thus precisely engineering excellent zero&#8208;dimensional materials. Simultaneously, the stronger N&#9472;H+&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl&#8722; bond is introduced to avoid structural instabilities and more defects due to the bigger organic cation in C14H40N4ZrCl8. As expected, C14H40N4ZrCl8 exhibits more remarkable luminescence behavior compared to C6H16N2ZrCl6. The photophysics process involving self&#8208;trapped excitons and defects is elaborately expounded using first&#8208;principles calculations, luminescence properties, and stabilities. Finally, a flexible and large&#8208;area scintillation screen based on C14H40N4ZrCl8 is fabricated and attains a high spatial resolution of 21.35&#160;lp mm&#8722;1 and a lower limit of detection of 2.270&#160;&#181;Gyair&#160;s&#8722;1, outperforming the resolution of most blue&#8208;emitting scintillation screens. These results imply that the zirconium&#8208;based OIMHs possess significant potential applications for medical diagnostics, security scanning, and non&#8208;destructive testing.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Basicity Diverts the Site&#8208;Selectivity of Aromatic Deuteration: Application to the Late&#8208;Stage Labeling of Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a metal&#8208;free method for aromatic deuterium labeling via photoexcitation in deuterated HFIP. This approach leverages the enhanced basicity of excited&#8208;state aromatics to achieve selective hydrogen isotope exchange at challenging positions. Demonstrated on complex drug molecules, this efficient strategy provides a valuable tool for isotope labeling, with mechanistic insights confirmed by transient absorption spectroscopy.








Abstract
Isotope labeling, particularly with deuterium (2H), plays a critical role in drug discovery due to its ease of incorporation and its potential to switch unwanted metabolic transformations. Deuterium incorporation can enhance drug stability, affect pharmacokinetics, and alter metabolism pathways. Current deuterium labeling methods focus on hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE), and typically rely on the use of transition metal catalysis. Herein, we present a metal&#8208;free approach for aromatic HIE, utilizing photoexcitation in deuterated hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP&#8208;d1). By exploiting the enhanced basicity of excited&#8208;state aromatics, this method achieves selective deuteration at positions often inaccessible by traditional methods. The approach is efficient and was demonstrated across a broad number of complex drug molecules. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms the formation of deuterated arenium ions.

         <title>Zwitterionic Dipeptide Surface Functionalization of Detonation Nanodiamond for Enhanced Control in Biological Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report a systematic investigation of novel zwitterionic dipeptide functionalized nanodiamonds to ensure colloidal stability over a broad pH range and in biological media. In vitro experiments in 2D and 3D cell cultures revealed a dipeptide&#8208;dependent biocompatibility and cellular uptake. 








Abstract
Utilizing nanoparticles as innovative theranostic agents for biomedical applications requires full control over the material's properties to dictate their interactions within a biological environment. Owing to its versatile surface chemistry and high biocompatibility, nanodiamond (ND) represents a promising platform for novel healthcare treatments. To ensure the performance and safety of NDs, their properties and behavior must remain unchanged upon administration, a key challenge in nanomedicine. Recently, zwitterionic surface modifications have emerged as new strategies to substantially improve protein&#8208;repelling properties and biocompatibility of nanomaterials. Using for the first time covalently conjugated zwitterionic dipeptides as surface modulators for ND particles, we were able to provide a readily accessible, reproducible, and tunable functionalization. The obtained particles demonstrate enhanced colloidal stability and conservation of particle size over a broad pH range and in different protein&#8208;containing media compared to the starting material. By simple selection of different dipeptides, we can carefully tailor the biocompatibility and cellular uptake of functionalized NDs. We reveal the functionalized NDs&#8217; behavior in biologically relevant 3D organotypic models and how different dipeptide&#8208;functionalized NDs interact with squamous epithelium ex vivo. The results pave the way for various applications, e.g., biosensing, tissue engineering or targeted drug delivery of these highly biologically suitable nanoparticles.

         <title>Achieving a Highly Reversible Four&#8208;Electron Redox of S/Cu2S for Aqueous Zn/S&#9472;Cu Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the regulation of spatial&#8208;confinement carbon (SC&#8208;C), the oxidation sequence of CuI and S2&#8722; in Cu2S was changed (from path I to path II), and the formation of irreversible intermediate CuS was inhibited, thus achieving a stable one&#8208;step four&#8208;electron conversion between S &#8596; Cu2S. 








Abstract
The combination of sulfur (S) cathode with Cu2+/Cu+ redox carriers has been considered as a promising cathode for the next&#8208;generation aqueous energy storage device due to the high specific capacity (two&#8208;step four&#8208;electron conversion), intrinsic safety, and low cost. Nevertheless, the unsatisfactory cycling stability of a sulfur&#8211;copper (S&#8211;Cu) cathode hinders its practical application. Herein, the two&#8208;step four&#8208;electron conversions are first decoupled in our study, identifying the inferior conversion reversibility between the intermedia CuS and the final product S as the primary cause for deteriorating cycling capability. Concerning the different hydrated dimensions of the Cu(H2O)62+ and Cu(H2O)2+, the strategy of &#8220;spatial confinement&#8221; is proposed to alter the oxidation path of Cu2S and prevent the formation of the intermedia CuS. To ensure efficient S incorporation into the spatially confined carbon matrix, selenium (Se) is employed to &#8220;cut&#8221; the S8 into short&#8208;chain molecules. Consequently, the well&#8208;designed S&#8211;Cu cathode achieves a one&#8208;step four&#8208;electron reaction and exhibits superior electrochemical stability with an average capacity attenuation of 0.034% during 700 cycles. Our study provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the conversion mechanism for the S&#8211;Cu cathode within the spatial&#8208;confinement environment and renders valuable insights for developing advanced conversion&#8208;type cathodes in aqueous energy&#8208;storage device.

         <title>Indole&#8208;Quinoline Transmutation Enabled by a Formal Rhodium Carbynoid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#945;&#8208;diazotrifluoroethyl sulfonium salt developed as a trifluoromethyl cationic carbyne (CF3C+:) precursor can be utilized in single&#8208;atom skeletal editing, rapidly enabling indole&#8208;quinoline transmutation in a unique manner. N&#8208;unprotected and 2&#8208;nonsubstituted indoles were well&#8208;tolerated, thus providing a complementary approach to other recently developed protocols.








Abstract
Skeleton editing is an emerging and powerful tool in organic chemistry because it can simplify synthetic procedures towards complex molecules. Herein, we present an approach for indole&#8208;quinoline transmutation through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;carbon insertion into the C2(sp2)&#9472;C3(sp2) bond of an indole with an &#945;&#8208;diazotrifluoroethyl sulfonium salt that we developed. This protocol involves a formal trifluoromethyl rhodium carbynoid (CF3C+ = Rh) resembling a trifluoromethyl cationic carbyne (CF3C+:), allowing facile access to an array of quinolines in moderate to high yields. Potential applications in the late&#8208;stage skeletal editing of pharmaceutical and natural product derivatives, preparation of adapalene analogs, scaled&#8208;up synthesis, and transformations of products are highlighted. Finally, a computational study was conducted to support the envisioned mechanism.

         <title>Building Ultrathin MOL/MOL S&#8208;Scheme Heterostructures toward Boosted Photocatalytic Charge Kinetics for Efficient H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin 2D morphologies, S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, and abundant open metal sites have been integrated into an advanced MOL/MOL heterostructure built from porphyrinic and pyrene&#8208;based MOLs via an accessible pH&#8208;adjusted electrostatic assembling. The thoroughly optimized charge kinetics in this architecture result in synergistically enhanced photocatalysis, achieving a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art H2 evolution activity among all&#8208;MOF systems.








Abstract
Photocatalytic efficiencies highly depend on the kinetic behaviors of photogenerated electrons in catalysts. Herein, based on the promising metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), we design and build an advantageous architecture of ultrathin MOF&#8208;layer (metal&#8208;organic layers [MOL]) heterojunctions by a facile pH&#8208;adjusted electrostatic assembling of pre&#8208;exfoliated porphyrinic and pyrene&#8208;based MOLs. Such an architecture constitutes an S&#8208;scheme junction to drive interfacial charge separation, features ultrathin structures to shorten charge transfer distances, and maximizes accessible metal sites to facilitate terminal charge reaction, thoroughly promoting the charge kinetics in materials. The resulting MOL/MOL composites perform a significantly enhanced catalytic activity for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 evolution, 8.5 and 106 times that of individual MOLs. Further fine&#8208;tuning into more reactive metal nodes achieves an optimal H2 production (2027&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1) with a high apparent quantum yield of 2.75% without additional cocatalysts, ranking among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activities from all&#8208;MOF photocatalysts. This work demonstrates an accessible and universal methodology to realize a superior ultrathin MOL/MOL heterojunction architecture toward accelerated charge kinetics, providing valuable insights for the development of efficient photocatalyst systems for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversions.

         <title>Remote Silyl Groups Enhance Hydrolytic Stability and Photocleavage Efficiency in Carbamates for Protein Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>

Introducing remote silyl groups into coumarin derivatives enhances their hydrolytic stability and photocleavage efficiency. This innovative molecular design enables efficient protein release from solid phase material upon photo irradiation, advancing applications in chemical biology and photomanipulation.








Abstract
Photocleavable molecules are valuable tools for biological studies, enabling spatiotemporal activation of molecular functions within cellular environments. In particular, coumarin&#8208;based photolytic molecules are useful because of their ability to flexibly tune the wavelength of photostimulation through their structural modifications. Ideal photocleavable molecular tools require hydrolytic stability and selective susceptibility to photo stimuli. However, conventional coumarin&#8208;based molecules have not simultaneously achieved both highly efficient photocleavage and hydrolysis resistance. Herein, we proposed a novel molecular design concept that introduces a silyl group into coumarin&#8208;based molecules at a position remote from the photolabile bond, creating an ideal photocleavable molecule for chemical biology tools. The established orbital effect of the remotely introduced silyl group improves the photolysis efficiency of coumarin&#8208;based molecules, while its bulkiness substantially enhances their hydrolytic stability in aqueous environments and under enzymatic conditions. Furthermore, this improvement in molecular functionality contributes to the development of high&#8208;performance protein&#8208;release biomaterials.

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell Hyperbranched Polymers via Catalytic Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent linkage of a ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) monomer and a chain transfer agent (together transfer&#8208;mer) forms an ABB&#8242;&#8208;type hyperbranching agent. Slow addition of the transfer&#8208;mer to a Grubbs ruthenium complex yields hyperbranched polymers. Further chain extension creates core&#8208;shell unimolecular micelles with hydrophilic cores, enabling fast dye encapsulation. Depending on the monomer, the dye can also be released on demand.








Abstract
This work explores the synthesis, characterization, and applications of hyperbranched polymers (HBP) using a divergent ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) approach. An ABB&#8242;&#8208;type hyperbranching monomer, formed by covalently linking a traditional ROMP monomer to a chain transfer agent, was diluted with a linear comonomer to produce branched polymers with controlled molar mass and dispersity. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and X&#8208;ray scattering confirmed their globular shape in solution. Additionally, we functionalized HBPs to create core&#8208;shell materials capable of encapsulating organic dyes efficiently. The study also highlights their role in sustainable polymer design, demonstrating degradation under mild acidic conditions. Core&#8208;shell particles synthesized via this approach enabled efficient capture and rapid, on&#8208;demand release of guest molecules, emphasizing their potential in drug delivery and advanced materials science.

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of Keto&#8208;Enol Tautomerism in Electrolytes for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>

Description: The reversibility of the Zn anode is dramatically improved by dynamic modulation of the keto&#8208;enol tautomerism of &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl electrolyte additives for suppressing the adverse reactions in this work.








Abstract
The reversibility of zinc (Zn) anode is subject to adverse reactions. Herein we design a dynamic modulation strategy via enol&#8208;keto tautomerism to inhibit the side reactions, thus improving the reversibility of the Zn anode. Density functional theory calculations and experimental results demonstrate the keto form of additives can be adsorbed on the Zn anode, inhibiting dendrite growth, while the enol form can serve as a bidentate ligand to participate in the construction of solvation sheath for Zn2+, enhancing the kinetics of Zn2+ transport, simultaneously suppressing water activity and reducing HER and corrosion. Consequently, the Zn anode&#160;with optimal electrolyte additive achieves high reversibility, where Zn||Zn symmetric cells operate over 4000 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2/10 mAh cm&#8722;2, and Zn||Cu asymmetric cells have a life for 930 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2/10 mAh cm&#8722;2. Further, this dynamic modulation enables Zn||V2O5 full cells to work over 5000 cycles with a capacity retention of 83% at 5 A g&#8722;1, and the Zn||Br2 pouch cells deliver a high capacity of &#8764;180 mAh. This study offers an original perspective on the dynamic regulation of electrolytes for Zn anode.

         <title>Engineering of Transmembrane Alkane Monooxygenases to Improve a Key Reaction Step in the Synthesis of Polymer Precursor Tulipalin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biosynthesis route for the polymer precursor tulipalin A starting from isoprenyl acetate is proposed. The alkane monooxygenase AlkB catalyzes the chemoselective terminal hydroxylation of isoprenyl acetate. Rational enzyme engineering further increased the activity of the membrane enzyme. An alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase pair enabled complete oxidation to the carboxylic acid, thus paving the way to biotechnological tulipalin A production.








Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactone tulipalin A, a defense compound found in tulips, can polymerize via addition at the vinyl group or via ring&#8208;opening polymerization, making it a highly promising monomer for bio&#8208;based polymers. Since the biosynthesis of tulipalin&#160;A in plants remains elusive, we propose an alternative pathway for its synthesis starting from the terpenoid intermediate isoprenyl acetate. While fungal unspecific peroxygenases showed a preference for the unwanted epoxidation of the exo&#8208;olefin group, bacterial alkane monooxygenases were selective for terminal hydroxylation. By combining protein engineering based on de novo structure prediction of the membrane enzymes with cell engineering, the specific activity was increased 6&#8208;fold to 1.83&#160;U&#160;gcdw&#8722;1. Oxidation of the formed allylic alcohol by a three&#8208;enzyme cascade and subsequent lactonization yielded tulipalin A. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of producing the polymer precursor tulipalin&#160;A from terpenoid intermediates and provide a solid foundation for future metabolic engineering endeavors.

         <title>Sustainable and Simple Water&#8208;Induced Separation of Ionic Liquid Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover image illustrates an innovative method for recovering ionic liquids (ILs) from their mixtures. This approach enables the recovery of over 99% of the IL by simply adding water&#8211;abundant, and safe solvent&#8211;under mild conditions, all while preserving the integrity of the ILs. This method marks the beginning of a new field in IL recycling, driven by the strategic balance of hydrophilicity among the components of the IL mixture.








Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are often considered inseparable once mixed, posing a major challenge for their reuse and recycling. We demonstrate a simple and effective method to separate ILs containing hydrophobic ([NTf2]&#8722;) and hydrophilic ([OAc]&#8722;) anions under ambient conditions. This process is driven by the thermodynamic behavior of the ILs in presence of water that enables the near&#8208;complete (&#10878;99%) recovery of pure components without complex purification steps. Our findings prove that pure ILs can easily be recovered after being mixed and open new pathways for the sustainable use of ionic fluids in various&#160;applications.

         <title>Hydride&#8208;Richest Molecular Complex: Ligand&#8208;Length Facilitated Cu40H38 Nanoclusters Exhibiting High Catalytic Performance for Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two copper hydride clusters, Cu40H38 and Cu18H16, with similar structures but different sizes, are reported. Cu40H38, achieved by ligand&#8208;length modulation, records the highest hydride content and metal&#8208;ligand ratio among copper hydride clusters. Its high metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio increasing naked copper atoms on the surface enhance catalytic activity for the selective reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds, offering new avenues for high&#8208;performance catalyst design.








Abstract
Copper hydride clusters are extensively studied for their significant potential catalysis. Although clusters with a high hydride content are particularly intriguing, they present considerable synthetic challenges. Herein, we report two copper hydride clusters, Cu18H16 and Cu40H38, which exhibit similar layered structures and components, albeit differing in size. The larger&#8208;sized Cu40H38 with more hydrides was achieved through ligand&#8208;length modulation by replacing 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe) in the synthesis of Cu18H16 with 1,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)pentane (dpppe). Cu40H38 is remarkable for i) the highest number of hydrides among known molecular compounds, ii) the highest number of unligated copper atoms and the highest metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio in copper hydride clusters. Moreover, catalytic studies on the selective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds demonstrate that Cu40H38 is a promising catalyst and provide clear structural evidence that a less sterically hindered cluster surface, with a high metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio, is beneficial for high&#8208;performance catalysis. The findings highlight the importance of surface composition and ligand coverage in catalytic efficiency and offer new avenues for designing high&#8208;performance copper hydride cluster catalysts.

         <title>Molecular Geometry&#8208;Property Relationship of Benzodipyrrole&#8208;Based A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A Type Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>

This study synthesizes four isomers of benzodipyrrole&#8208;based A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type organic semiconductor acceptors for organic solar cells (OSCs), and investigates their molecular geometry&#8208;property relationship. The results highlight the effect of geometry on the physicochemical properties, molecular orientation and stacking, as well as donor&#8211;acceptor interaction and miscibility, ultimately contributing to the high power conversion efficiency of 19.94% (certified as 19.54%) for the OSCs based on D18:C&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl.








Abstract
Molecular geometry plays a crucial role in determining the physical and chemical properties of organic semiconductor materials. However, there is little research on the molecular geometry&#8208;property relationship of A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type small molecule acceptors (SMAs), which are the most representative organic semiconductor materials used in organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we used dichlorine&#8208;substituted benzene as the A&#8217; unit to overcome the geometry constraints imposed by the conventional A&#8217; unit that has a large size. Four isomers of benzodipyrrole&#8208;based SMAs (C&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl, &#577;&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl, M&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl, and S&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl) with C&#8208;, &#577;&#8208;, M&#8208;, and S&#8208;shaped molecular geometries were synthesized, and the effect of molecular geometry on their photovoltaic performance was studied. We revealed that the molecular geometry influences the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties in three aspects: 1) intrinsic physicochemical properties, including energy levels, absorption, and reorganization energy; 2) molecular stacking pattern, which governs the exciton diffusion and charge transport processes; and 3) donor&#8211;acceptor interaction and miscibility. We found that the C&#8208;shaped molecular geometry possesses a suitable energy level and absorption range, dense and ordered molecular stacking, and improved donor&#8211;acceptor interaction and miscibility. These advantages enable a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.94% (certified as 19.54%) for the binary OSCs based on D18:C&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl active layer. The other SMAs showed weaknesses in different aspects, such as limited absorption of &#577;&#8208;shaped SMA, large reorganization energies and loose molecular stacking of M&#8208;shaped SMA, low solubility and strong aggregation of S&#8208;shaped SMA. These properties resulted in inferior photovoltaic device performance. These findings on the molecular geometry&#8208;property relationships will be instructive for future molecular design of high&#8208;performance A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type SMAs.

         <title>Unraveling the Complexity of Divalent Hydride Electrolytes in Solid&#8208;State Batteries via a Data&#8208;Driven Framework with Large Language Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a data&#8208;driven framework that combines experimental and computational information to accelerate the discovery of high&#8208;performance divalent hydride solid&#8208;state electrolytes, enabling precise predictions of activation energies and novel ionic migration mechanisms which are essential for next&#8208;generation energy storage technology.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are essential for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies. However, the exploration of divalent hydrides is hindered by complex ionic migration mechanisms and reliance on &#8220;trial&#8208;and&#8208;error&#8221; methodologies. Conventional approaches, which focus on individual materials and predefined pathways, remain inefficient. Herein, we present a data&#8208;driven artificial intelligence framework that integrates a comprehensive SSE database with large language models and ab initio metadynamics (MetaD) simulations to accelerate the discovery of hydride SSEs. Our study reveals that hydrides incorporating neutral molecules have great potential, with MetaD revealing novel &#8220;two&#8208;step&#8221; ion migration mechanisms. Predictive models developed using both experimental and computational data accurately forecast ionic migration activation energies for various types of hydride SSEs. In particular, some SSEs with carbon&#8208;containing neutral molecules exhibit notably low activation energy, with barriers as low as 0.62&#160;eV. This framework enables the rapid identification of optimized SSE candidates and establishes a transformative tool for advancing sustainable energy storage technologies.

         <title>Water&#8208;in&#8208;Acid Strategy for Corrosion&#8208;Free Proton Storage: Phosphoric Acid Electrolyte Engineering Toward Sustainable Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>

The high&#8208;concentration water&#8208;in&#8208;acid electrolyte enables ultra&#8208;stable aqueous proton storage by synergistically enhancing proton activity and transport kinetics while effectively suppressing parasitic side reactions and electrode dissolution. 








Abstract
Aqueous proton batteries, leveraging the intrinsic advantages of protons such as minimal hydrated radius, natural abundance, and rapid transport kinetics, have emerged as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, conventional strong acid electrolytes like H2SO4 suffer from critical limitations including electrode dissolution and incompatibility with battery components. To circumvent these challenges, weak acids (e.g., HCOOH and H3PO4) have been strategically selected as alternative electrolytes due to their non&#8208;corrosive characteristics. Particularly, the implementation of high&#8208;concentration &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;acid&#8221; (WIA) effectively suppresses undesirable interactions between electrode materials and free water molecules. Through electrolyte engineering, we developed a 9.5&#160;M H3PO4 WIA system that synergizes with a molybdenum trioxide electrode, achieving remarkable electrochemical performance: a high reversible capacity of 229.8&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 3&#160;A g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability with 83.86% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5&#160;A g&#8722;1, surpassing conventional H&#8322;SO&#8324;&#8208;based systems by both capacity and cyclability. This innovative approach establishes a new paradigm for developing high&#8208;performance aqueous energy storage systems through acid&#8208;dominated electrolyte design.

         <title>Stabilizing Lattice Oxygen to Enable Durable MnO2 Electrocatalyst for Simultaneous Acidic Hydrogen Production and Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>

MnO2 is one of the promising anode catalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, but it suffers from overoxidation and dissolution. This study observed that the lattice oxygen in &#947;&#8208;MnO2 was involved in water oxidation via Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen mechanism, which possibly accelerates the Mn dissolution. Instead, glucose oxidized to formic acid on &#947;&#8208;MnO2 via Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood mechanism, improving the durability of anode catalyst and product value of anodic product.







Abstract
Understanding and steering the stability of earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts in acidic medium is essential for proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer. Manganese oxide (MnO2) is one of the promising candidates for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but it still suffers from the overoxidation and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we observed that lattice oxygen was involved in the OER process on &#947;&#8208;MnO2 via Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen mechanism. Combined with theoretical calculation, we revealed that the release of lattice oxygen lowers the energy barrier of Mn dissolution and compromises the electrode durability. Based on this finding, we propose a strategy to efficiently stabilize lattice oxygen and suppress Mn overoxidation by replacing OER with glucose oxidation to formic acid, which follows a Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood mechanism. As a result, the durability of &#947;&#8208;MnO2 was enhanced by 1100 times, enabling long stability up to 960&#8197;hours. Moreover, we demonstrated a production rate of 487.1&#8197;mmol h&#8722;1 for formic acid and 16.7&#8197;L&#8201;h&#8722;1 for H2 at 40&#8197;A in a PEM electrolyzer, providing a sustainable and scalable route for converting water and biomass into valuable chemicals and fuels.

By integrating large language models, big data analytics, and ab initio metadynamics simulations, Hao Li and co&#8208;workers developed a powerful AI&#8208;driven framework that unravels previously hidden ion migration pathways in hydride&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) (e202506573). This integrative approach enables accurate prediction and efficient screening of high&#8208;performance SSEs, paving the way for next&#8208;generation multivalent solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A groundbreaking new reaction pathway is disclosed, in which for the first time a lanthanide half&#8208;sandwich unit inserts into an existing sandwich complex. As result triple decker complexes are formed, which are classical sandwich complexes with the lanthanide sandwiched between cyclic aromatic carbon ligands. The unique feature of the compounds introduced in this work is the combination of the two largest aromatic all&#8208;carbon rings known in coordination chemistry&#8212;the 8&#8208; and 9&#8208;membered rings&#8212;into lanthanide triple&#8208;decker sandwich compounds, as demonstrated by Florian Weigend, Peter W. Roesky et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202503942).

Dynamic monitoring of pH fluctuations within brain lesions in real time offers a promising strategy for elucidating how local acidosis contributes to neuronal hyperexcitability and the evolution of neurological disease. In their Research Article (e202504822), Cong Wang, Cong Li et&#160;al. report a precisely engineered monolayer self&#8208;assembly approach that greatly improves the signal intensity and photostability of SERS&#8208;based imaging. Leveraging this platform, they construct a tandem dual&#8208;ratiometric SERS probe capable of accurate and dynamic digital decoding of pH within diseased brain tissue, providing new insight into the microenvironmental cues that shape disease progression.

In their review, Yang, Krueger, and Hamers highlight recent advances in diamonds that impact chemical scientists. Advances in growth of diamonds have yielded improved quality and lower cost, while new and emerging applications in areas such as energy storage, photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;catalysis, sensing, and quantum science have expanded applications.








Abstract
Diamond as a material has many unique properties. Its high optical dispersion, extraordinarily high mechanical strength, and unparalleled thermal conductivity have long made it a material of interest for applications such as high&#8208;temperature electronics and as wear&#8208;resistance coatings. More recently, diamond has emerged as a material with a wide range of applications in chemistry and biology. The high intrinsic stability of diamond, coupled with the ability to modify diamond surfaces with a wide range of inorganic, organic, and biological species via highly stable covalent linkages, provides a wealth of opportunity to couple diamond's chemical properties with its extraordinary physical properties. The practical utility of diamond has been greatly expanded in recent years through dramatic advances in the ability to produce diamond in bulk, thin film, and nanoparticle form, with controlled doping and purity at modest cost. These advances, together with diamond's highly stable and tunable surface chemistry with versatility of physical structure enable a wide range of emerging applications of interest to chemists, including quantum science, biomedicine, energy storage, and catalysis. Yet, to fully exploit the unique properties of diamond, some formidable chemical challenges lie ahead.
We begin by reviewing some of the features of diamond that are of particular importance to the chemistry community. We aim to highlight some of the important applications where diamond chemistry plays a key role, identify some of the key observations, and outline some of the future directions and opportunities for diamond in the chemical world.

         <title>Periodic Patterning of Matter in Non&#8208;Equilibrium Liesegang&#8208;Type Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the self&#8208;organization of materials into Liesegang patterns. It examines their formation mechanisms, physicochemical properties, and occurrence across materials science, geology, and biology. It highlights their potential applications in electronics and environmental monitoring, as well as their role in providing insights into the origin of life.








Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;organization of unordered molecules into ordered, spatiotemporal patterns of complex structures through non&#8208;equilibrium reaction&#8211;diffusion (RD) processes is ubiquitous in nature across all scales. Unlike many RD processes that typically lead to transient patterns, periodic precipitation reactions governed by the Liesegang phenomenon are distinguished by the formation of stable, permanent structures. This unique characteristic makes them valuable tools in the development of hierarchical multifunctional materials, an area that has seen significant progress in recent decades. This review summarizes the fundamental aspects of the Liesegang phenomenon, focusing on the key characteristics, compositional features, inherent properties, and formation mechanisms of Liesegang patterns in chemical systems, while also highlighting their occurrence in biological and geological settings. We discuss recent advancements in applying periodic precipitation to address global challenges in microelectronics and environmental monitoring, concluding with a forward&#8208;looking perspective on the promising future applications of the Liesegang periodic precipitation in materials science, nanotechnology, medicine, and environmental engineering.

         <title>MOF Catalysts for Plastic Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses MOFs as emerging heterogeneous catalysts for plastic depolymerization. Leveraging their bottom&#8208;up designability, thermal stability, and high porosity, MOF catalysts are suitable for a range of different depolymerization reactions for the wide range of plastics currently available.








Abstract
Depolymerization is a promising solution to address the escalating global plastic waste crisis, as a key enabler for emerging technologies in chemical upcycling and closed&#8208;loop recycling of plastics. By virtue of their unparalleled bottom&#8208;up designability for structural control, stability, reactivity, and compatibility with catalytically&#8208;active metal nanoparticles and enzymes, MOFs have enormous potential as an emerging class of porous heterogeneous catalysts for plastics depolymerization. Herein, we highlight key considerations and advances in MOF catalyst development and design for a range of depolymerization reactions, including alcoholysis, hydrogenolysis, pyrolysis, photocatalytic oxidation, and enzymatic hydrolysis. Other than enabling MOFs to efficiently depolymerize the most abundant plastics in production today, including those with unreacted C&#9472;C backbones (e.g., polyolefins) and polymers with cleavable backbone linkages (e.g., polyesters), their versatility also extends to emerging applications in microplastic capture and degradation from wastewater.

&lt;p&gt;This minireview discusses MOFs as emerging heterogeneous catalysts for plastic depolymerization. Leveraging their bottom-up designability, thermal stability, and high porosity, MOF catalysts are suitable for a range of different depolymerization reactions for the wide range of plastics currently available.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depolymerization is a promising solution to address the escalating global plastic waste crisis, as a key enabler for emerging technologies in chemical upcycling and closed-loop recycling of plastics. By virtue of their unparalleled bottom-up designability for structural control, stability, reactivity, and compatibility with catalytically-active metal nanoparticles and enzymes, MOFs have enormous potential as an emerging class of porous heterogeneous catalysts for plastics depolymerization. Herein, we highlight key considerations and advances in MOF catalyst development and design for a range of depolymerization reactions, including alcoholysis, hydrogenolysis, pyrolysis, photocatalytic oxidation, and enzymatic hydrolysis. Other than enabling MOFs to efficiently depolymerize the most abundant plastics in production today, including those with unreacted C&#9472;C backbones (e.g., polyolefins) and polymers with cleavable backbone linkages (e.g., polyesters), their versatility also extends to emerging applications in microplastic capture and degradation from wastewater. These unique properties of MOFs position them as potentially scalable and reusable heterogeneous catalysts that can complement existing inorganic catalysts for practical depolymerization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temporary Structural Supports for Chemical Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protecting groups to accomplish regioselectivity in synthesis by temporarily shielding functional groups that would otherwise react are indispensable in organic chemistry. Recently the analogous importance of temporary groups for the synthesis of biomacromolecules, especially proteins, has been recognized to solve the problems due to poor solution behavior of synthetic protein intermediates. 








Abstract
The range of functional proteins that can be prepared by chemical protein synthesis includes those bearing complex modifications and incorporating d&#8208;amino acids, and exceeds what can be accessed by biological means, but the technique is still limited by the unfavorable solution behavior of many synthetic protein intermediates in buffer, leading to inefficient ligation, purification, and in vitro folding. One approach to address this limitation is the use of temporary structural supports&#8212;chemical modifications, usually solubilizing functionalities such as polyamines or carbohydrates&#8212;that are installed on either the backbone or side chains of the synthetic protein intermediates and removed at a later stage of chemical protein synthesis. The basic processes for introducing and removing such temporary structural supports are reminiscent of the canonical protecting groups ubiquitous in organic chemistry. However, unlike the synthesis of small organic molecules, where solubility is rarely an issue, the purpose of temporary structural supports is to modulate the solution behavior of the synthetic protein intermediates to prevent them from aggregation, precipitation, or retention in unfavorable solvation&#8208;phase conformations. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the development of temporary structural supports for chemical protein synthesis and organize them into three categories: 1) Temporary structural supports to improve solubility; 2) Temporary structural supports to assist chemical ligation; and 3) Temporary structural supports to promote in vitro folding.

         <title>Enzymatic Amination for Stereocontrolled Functionalization of Cyclohexanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient biocatalytic platform has been established for the synthesis of cis/trans and axial chiral cyclohexylamines with excellent stereoselectivity, high yield, and a broad substrate scope. The industrial applicability of this biocatalytic approach was exemplified through 10g&#8208;scale preparative reactions and the chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of key intermediates for the 11&#946;&#8208;HSD1 inhibitors AM&#8208;7715.








Abstract
Functionalizing the symmetric carbonyl carbon of cyclohexanone to achieve stereocontrol, resulting in saturated cyclohexanes with either cis/trans or axial stereochemistry, poses significant challenges in chemical synthesis, and existing methodologies are limited. In this study, we present an enzymatic reductive amination strategy to attain this objective. By engineering the enzyme pocket of the sole imine reductase (IRED) M5, we successfully synthesized over 80 cis/trans and axially chiral 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexylamines in a stereo&#8208;complementary fashion, adhering to industrial standards, via the reductive amination of 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones. Mechanistically, the reshaping of the enzyme pocket allows the optimized variants to distinguish between different imine precursors and selectively bind their specific configurations with favorable binding energies, thereby facilitating the generation of stereochemically distinct products. We propose that this stereocontrolled&#8208;functionalization strategy could be extended to a broader range of cyclohexylamines with diverse substituents.

         <title>Photosynthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8722; Using CH4 in Homogenous Rhenium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a Re catalysis of one&#8208;pot synthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8722; using CH4 as a reductant under UV light irradiation. We are able to directly convert NO3&#8722;, leading to several environmental issues, to NH3, an essential compound as a fertilizer and industrial raw material, by means of CH4, which has a high affinity with renewable resource/energy, as a reductant under light, a renewable energy.








Abstract
We present Re catalysis of one&#8208;pot synthesis of NH3 from NO3&#8722; using CH4 as a reductant under UV light irradiation at room temperature. NO3&#8722; leads to environmental issues such as water contamination, eutrophication, and biodiversity loss. In a natural system and a sewage facility, NO3&#8722; can be detoxified to N2 using hydrogen donors by a microbial process. However, it is better to convert NO3&#8722; to NH3 rather than N2. To develop a desirable process of NO3&#8722; to NH3 for a sustainable society, it is required that the reducing agent is derived from a renewable resource/energy. Thus, we turned our attention to CH4, which has a high affinity with renewable resource/energy since it can be produced from livestock waste. Therefore, our system reported here is to directly convert NO3&#8722; to NH3 using CH4 with light energy.

         <title>Synthesis of Sensitive RNAs Using Fluoride&#8208;Cleavable Groups as Linkers and Amino&#8208;Group Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many sensitive modifications such as N4&#8208;acetylcytidine (ac4C) are found in RNAs. Chemical synthesis of such RNAs is challenging. By using the fluoride&#8208;cleavable SoM for amino&#8208;group protection and SoA as a linker, the synthesis of ac4C&#8208;RNAs is demonstrated. Because fluoride is compatible with almost all natural RNA modifications, the new RNA synthesis method is expected to be widely applicable in areas such as epigenetics and nucleic acid therapeutics.








Abstract
A chemical method suitable for the synthesis of RNAs containing modifications such as N4&#8208;acetylcytidine (ac4C) that are unstable under the basic and nucleophilic conditions used by standard RNA synthesis methods is described. The method uses the 4&#8208;((t&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)&#8208;2&#8208;methoxybutanoyl (SoM) group for the protection of exo&#8208;amino groups of nucleobases and the 4&#8208;((t&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)&#8208;2&#8208;((aminophosphaneyl)oxy)butanoyl (SoA) group as the linker for solid phase synthesis. RNA cleavage and amino deprotection are achieved using fluoride under the same conditions used for the removal of the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH silyl protecting groups. Using this method, a wide range of electrophilic and base&#8208;sensitive groups including those that play structural and regulatory roles in biological systems and those that are artificially designed for various purposes are expected to be able to be incorporated into any position of any RNA sequences. As a proof of concept, several RNAs containing the highly sensitive ac4C epitranscriptomic modification was synthesized and purified with RP HPLC. MALDI MS analysis indicated that the ac4C modification is completely stable under the fluoride deprotection conditions. The sensitive RNA synthesis method is expected to be able to overcome the long&#8208;lasting obstacle of accessing various modified sensitive RNAs to projects in areas such as epitranscriptomics, molecular biology and the development of nucleic acid therapeutics.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Supported Single Fe/Co/Ni Atom Catalysts for Water Oxidation: Unveiling the Dynamic Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined in situ XAS and electrochemical characterizations reveal the structural rearrangement of carbon&#8208;supported Fe/Co/Ni single&#8208;atom catalysts during water oxidation. Our findings highlight the formation of dual metal active sites bridged by oxygen atoms during the reaction, providing key mechanistic insights into the identification of true active sites, which are crucial for advancing future research on this class of catalysts.








Abstract
Extensive research has been conducted on carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for electrochemical applications, owing to their outstanding conductivity and high metal atom utilization. The atomic dispersion of active sites provides an ideal platform to investigate the structure&#8211;performance correlations. Despite this, the development of straightforward and scalable synthesis methods, along with the tracking of the dynamic active sites under catalytic conditions, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we introduce a biomass&#8208;inspired coordination confinement strategy to construct a series of carbon&#8208;supported SACs, incorporating various metal elements, such as Fe, Co, and Ni. We have systematically characterized their electronic and geometric structure using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Through in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), atomic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses, it is demonstrated that the single atoms undergo structural rearrangement to form amorphous (oxy)hydroxide clusters during oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where the newly formed oxygen&#8208;bridged dual metal M&#9472;O&#9472;M or M&#9472;O&#9472;M&#8217; (M/M&#8217; = Fe, Co, Ni) moieties within these clusters play key role in the OER performance. This work provides essential insights into tracking the actual active sites of SACs during electrochemical OER.

         <title>The Role of Convex Edge Site in Fully&#8208;Exposed Pt Cluster Catalyst for Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we demonstrate that the convex edge sites predominant within the fully&#8208;exposed Pt clusters on CeO2 outperform other active structures (e.g., terrace sites and hollow sites) in cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction due to their excellent C&#9472;H bond activation capability and prohibition of undesired C&#9472;C bond cleavage&#8208;induced site reactions or benzene poisoning. 








Abstract
Achieving a precise understanding of the active site structure has long been an ultimate goal in fundamental heterogeneous catalysis research, yet it remains exceptionally challenging in nanocluster catalysis. In Pt&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenation reactions, such as cyclohexane dehydrogenation for liquid organic carriers (LOHC), previous efforts have provided valuable insights into the size effects of nanoclusters. However, the optimal geometry of the active sites has remained elusive and, at times, contradictory. In this study, we investigate the geometric effect and the active site structure in fully&#8208;exposed Pt clusters supported on ceria that exhibit superior activity in cyclohexane dehydrogenation (11.4&#160;mol molPt&#8722;&#185; s&#8722;&#185;), characterized by small coordination numbers, high metal utilization efficiency, and abundant convex edge sites. Through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that the convex edge sites predominant within the fully&#8208;exposed Pt clusters outperform other active structures (e.g., terrace sites, hollow sites, etc.) in dehydrogenation reactions. These convex edge sites are not only efficient in C&#9472;H activation but, more notably, are also resistant to detrimental carbonaceous intermediates, hence enabling high and long&#8208;lived H2 production activity.

         <title>Enhancing Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Peroxide Conversion Efficiency by Promoting the Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation Pathway via Modulating the Main Electron Transition Orbital</title>

Optimized donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers, featuring precisely positioned triazine acceptors at the 2,7 positions of pyrene donors, regulated electron transitions from the lower HOMO&#8208;1 orbital, enabling efficient two&#8208;electron water oxidation reactions (2e&#8722; WOR) for H2O2 production, with high yields and impressive solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiencies.








Abstract
Photosynthetic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production involves coupling oxygen reduction and water oxidation half&#8208;reactions. However, the low efficiency of water oxidation constrains the overall solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen peroxide conversion efficiency under natural conditions. The two&#8208;electron water oxidation pathway holds potential for enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis, yet its regulatory mechanisms and detailed understanding remain inadequately explored. Herein, we construct donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers with pyrene as the electron donor and triazine as the electron acceptor. By optimizing the connecting positions of the electron acceptors at the 2,7 positions of the electron donors, the main excited state is regulated from S1 to S2, leading to the electron transition from the lower HOMO&#8208;1 orbital. This modulation effectively enhances the oxidation capacity of the photocatalyst, enabling it to undergo two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) for H2O2 production. Consequently, the WOR activity reaches a remarkable efficiency of 2560&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, corresponding to a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of up to 0.94%. This strategy of modulating electronic transition orbitals to enhance the water oxidation capacity of the material significantly improves photocatalytic performance and facilitates its application in natural environments.

         <title>An A&#8208;T Hoogsteen Base Pair in a Naked DNA Hairpin Motif: A Protein&#8208;Recognized Conformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In duplex DNA, base pairs are Watson&#8208;Crick, with Hoogsteen pairing only dominating upon protein binding or DNA damage. Using NMR, we find an A&#8208;T Hoogsteen base pair in transposon DNA hairpins even without TnpA protein. The Hoogsteen conformation is specific to DNA, and its propensity depends on the length and sequence of apical loop residues. Hoogsteen base pairs may shape genomic structures during replication and transcription.








Abstract
In duplex DNA, A&#8208;T and G&#8208;C form Watson&#8208;Crick base pairs, and Hoogsteen pairing only dominates upon protein binding or DNA damage. Using NMR, we show that an A&#8208;T Hoogsteen base pair previously observed in crystal structures of transposon DNA hairpins bound to TnpA protein forms in solution even in the absence of TnpA. This Hoogsteen base pair, located adjacent to a dinucleotide apical loop, exists in dynamic equilibrium with a minor Watson&#8208;Crick conformation (population &#8764;11% and lifetime &#8764;55 &#181;s). Extending the apical loop to three residues inverted the equilibrium, making Watson&#8208;Crick the dominant state and the Hoogsteen conformation recognized by TnpA a minor state (population &#8764;14% and lifetime &#8764;28 &#181;s). The propensity for Hoogsteen pairing depended on apical loop residues, which form contacts directly or indirectly stabilizing the Hoogsteen conformation. A structure survey did not reveal Hoogsteen pairing near RNA apical loops making them unique to DNA. Our results demonstrate that Hoogsteen can be the dominant state even in naked unmodified duplex DNA and identify 5&#8242;&#8208;CTT(T/C)AG&#8208;3&#8242; as a DNA&#8208;specific apical loop motif stabilized by Hoogsteen pairing. Hoogsteen base pairs may be prevalent in DNA hairpins forming during replication and transcription, with broad implications for the genomic landscape.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Regulation of Catalytic DNA Circuits Using Phosphorylated Charge Reversal Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional enzyme&#8208;responsive peptide (ERP) was developed for efficient loading and specific intracellular delivery or release of catalytic DNA circuitry probes via phosphorylation&#8208;based charge reversal procedure, thus enabling the precisely space&#8208;controllable in vivo microRNA (miRNA) imaging.








Abstract
Catalytic DNA circuits have emerged as a powerful tool for high&#8208;performance biosensing application; however, the establishment of a safe and efficient in vivo delivery system remains a critical bottleneck. Peptides serve as attractive carriers due to their rich chemical diversity, excellent biocompatibility, high loading capacity, and specific binding ability, making them ideal candidates for the on&#8208;demand regulation of DNA circuits&#8212;yet remains largely unexplored. In this study, we developed a multifunctional enzyme&#8208;responsive peptide (ERP) for the efficient loading and specific intracellular delivery and release of catalytic circuitry probes through a phosphorylation&#8208;based charge reversal procedure. This ERP&#8208;programmed catalytic DNA circuit enables the precise, spatially controllable in vivo imaging of microRNA (miRNA). The multifunctional cationic peptide formed a stable nanocomplex with anionic DNA cargo via strong electrostatic interactions, thus protecting the DNA probes from degradation in biological environments. Moreover, with the ability to actively targeting tumor cells and facilitate endogenous phosphorylation&#8208;guided release of DNA probes, this multifunctional peptide could significantly reduce the nonspecific delivery of probes to healthy tissues, thereby minimizing unwanted off&#8208;site signal leakage. By the integration of cell&#8208;selective delivery and site&#8208;specific stimulation, this endogenously regulated and multiply guaranteed DNA circuit system paves a simple yet effective way for disease diagnosis.

         <title>Saarvienin A&#8212;A Novel Glycopeptide with Potent Activity against Drug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structurally distinct glycopeptide, saarvienin A, represents a new family of glycopeptide antibiotics consisting of five sugar/aminosugar units connected to a halogenated peptide core. Saarvienin A overcomes vancomycin resistance and shows strong activity against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, in particular, high&#8208;priority pathogens such as methicillin&#8208;resistant, vancomycin&#8208;intermediate, and daptomycin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus.








Abstract
A member of a new family of glycopeptides, named saarvienin A, was isolated from a rare actinomycete Amycolatopsis sp. YIM10. Extensive NMR and MS analyses revealed a halogenated peptide core comprising four amino acids cyclized via a ureido linkage with an exocyclic 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;(4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)propyl residue connected to a five&#8208;sugar/aminosugar chain. Two of the three aminosugars constitute the N&#8208;methylated and N,O&#8208;dimethylated derivatives of eremosamine (4&#8208;epi&#8208;vancosamine) that have not been reported in any natural product. Saarvienin A exhibits potent activity against a range of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, effectively overcoming resistance to several frontline antibiotics in clinical isolates. It demonstrates an eight&#8208;fold reduction in minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against methicillin&#8208;resistant, vancomycin&#8208;intermediate, and daptomycin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus compared to vancomycin.

         <title>Enhancing Built&#8208;In Electric Field via Balancing Interfacial Atom Orbit Hybridization at Boride@Sulfide Heterostructure for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field in transition metal&#8208;based boride@sulfide heterostructured catalysts by balancing interfacial atom orbit hybridization, induces the upshifted d&#8208;band center, optimizes the adsorption energy of OH* intermediates, and reduces the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step (OH* desorption step), thus favoring the enhancement of electrocatalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Exploring nonprecious metal&#8208;based catalysts for cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has facilitated the realization of hydrogen economy toward water electrolysis in alkaline media. However, the difficult water dissociation process for the Volmer step (H2O&#160;&#8594;&#160;H*&#160;+&#160;OH*) and the subsequent unsuitable OH* adsorption energy on nonprecious metal&#8208;based catalysts severely reduce the kinetics of HER. Herein, the universal synthesis for a series of transition metal (Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, and W)&#8208;based boride@sulfide heterostructured catalysts is realized by using the molten&#8208;salt method to conduct the in situ boronization of commercial sulfides. Significantly, WB2@WS2 heterostructured catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability for HER. Balancing interfacial atom orbit hybridization between W(d)&#8208;B(s,p) and W(d)&#8208;S(s,p) at WB2@WS2 heterostructured interface enhances the built&#8208;in electric field. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation results reveal that the strong built&#8208;in electric field in WB2@WS2 optimizes the adsorption and desorption of OH* intermediate, reducing the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (OH* desorption step), and thus favoring the enhancement of catalytic performance toward HER.

         <title>Origin of Lithium Dendrite Formation in Sulfide&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ionization levels (ILs) of typical Li3PS4 (LPS) configurations served as effective descriptors to evaluate the preference of Li0 deposition within LPS&#8208;based electrolytes. Both bulk LPS and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, comprising crystalline LPS (c&#8208;LPS), amorphous LPS (a&#8208;LPS), and fully lithiated LPS (LixLPS), were predicted to be electrochemically resistive upon Li0 deposition. Conversely, the defect configurations, including crack surfaces and grain boundaries (GBs), were identified as critical contributors to the Li dendrite initiation and propagation over the course of battery cycling, ultimately driving dendrite growth.








Abstract
The Li dendrite growth during battery cycles is a well&#8208;known obstacle to the practical application of sulfide&#8208;based electrolytes (SEs), notably Li3PS4 (LPS), in lithium metal batteries. However, there remains a significant gap in understanding the mechanism for Li dendrite penetration through SEs exhibiting high shear modulus. Herein, we investigate the optimum deposition sites for Li0 atoms within typical LPS configurations, encompassing crystalline, lithiated, and degraded structures, with their ionization levels employed as descriptors to determine the preferential state (Li0/Li+) of the interstitial Li. Our results suggest that both bulk LPS and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer are predicted to be electrochemically resistive upon Li0 deposition. Conversely, the defect configurations, including cracks&#160;and grain boundaries (GBs), exhibit a marked propensity to promote the electrochemical deposition of Li0 atoms. Once Li dendrites initiate, the electronic conductivities of those defects undergo a significant surge, catalyzing electron transport and facilitating Li dendrite penetration through the SEs, ultimately driving dendrite growth. Furthermore, we underscore the synergistic interaction between Li dendrite propagation and crack formation within SEs, offering deeper insights into the electrochemical&#8208;mechanical degradation mechanism in SEs. These findings present novel methodologies for predicting Li dendrite growth and open up alternative perspectives in SE engineering.

&lt;p&gt;The ionization levels (ILs) of typical Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LPS) configurations served as effective descriptors to evaluate the preference of Li&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; deposition within LPS-based electrolytes. Both bulk LPS and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, comprising crystalline LPS (c-LPS), amorphous LPS (a-LPS), and fully lithiated LPS (Li&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;LPS), were predicted to be electrochemically resistive upon Li&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; deposition. Conversely, the defect configurations, including crack surfaces and grain boundaries (GBs), were identified as critical contributors to the Li dendrite initiation and propagation over the course of battery cycling, ultimately driving dendrite growth.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Radical Alkylation by Synergistic Lewis&#8208;Acid&#8208;Enzyme and Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new&#8208;to&#8208;nature biocatalytic radical alkylation of 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles is achieved through the cross&#8208;integration of a Lewis&#8208;acid (LA)&#8208;type artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) and a photobiocatalysis strategy. Directed evolution leads to enantiodivergent synthesis with different mutants. Detailed mechanistic studies illustrate a difference in reactivity and enantiomeric preference between the illuminated and dark conditions.








Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) and photoenzymatic catalysis represent two cutting&#8208;edge approaches to creating new enzyme reactivity. However, the potential of merging these two strategies remains underdeveloped for enantiocontrolled biotransformations. Herein, we develop a synergistic metalloenzymatic and photoredox catalysis platform to enable enantiodivergent radical alkylation of 2&#8208;acyl imidazoles. Specifically, cupin proteins are redesigned to function as copper(II)&#8208;based Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;enzymes (LAses), which, in synergy with tripyridinyl&#8208;ruthenium&#8208;based photoredox catalysis, precisely control the generation, reactivity, and selectivity of abiological radicals, thereby unlocking non&#8208;natural enzyme reactivity. Powered by protein engineering, repurposed photo&#8208;LAses facilitate the green and efficient synthesis of diverse enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;chiral ketones in high enantioselectivity (both enantiomers accessible, up to 97% yield and 98.5:1.5 enantiomeric ratio [er]). Detailed mechanistic studies suggest a radical addition to the metalloenzymatic enolate pathway and explain the switched selectivity from dark to photoconditions.

         <title>Conformationally Locked Peptide&#8211;DNA Nanostructures for CRISPR&#8208;Amplified Activity&#8208;Based Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of chemical probes, termed cleavable, locked initiator probes (CLIPs). CLIPs are peptide&#8211;DNA nanostructures resembling molecular beacons but enable activity&#8208;based CRISPR&#8208;amplified molecular sensing. CLIPs detect various disease&#8208;relevant proteases, yield superior sensitivity compared to commercial probes, and enable the monitoring of active proteases in colorectal cancer cell lysates.








Abstract
We introduce a new class of chemical probes for activity&#8208;based sensing of proteases, termed cleavable, locked initiator probes (CLIPs). CLIPs contain a protease&#8208;cleavable peptide linked between two programmable DNA strands&#8212;an &#8220;initiator&#8221; DNA and a shorter &#8220;blocking&#8221; DNA. These DNA sequences are designed to hybridize, creating a &#8220;locked&#8221; hairpin&#8208;like structure. Upon proteolytic cleavage, the initiator strand is released, triggering the activation of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a enzymes and producing an amplified fluorescence response. CLIPs generate more than 20&#8208;fold turn&#8208;on signals at room temperature (25 &#176;C), significantly outperforming commercial probes by yielding &#8764;40&#8208;fold lower limits of detection (LOD) at 100&#8208;fold lower concentrations. Their versatility enables the detection of various disease&#8208;relevant proteases&#8212;including the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease, caspase&#8208;3, matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;7, and cathepsin B&#8212;simply by altering the peptide sequence. Importantly, CLIPs detect cathepsin B in four different colorectal cancer cell lines, highlighting their clinical potential. Taken together, the sensitivity (LOD: &#8764;88 pM), selectivity, and rapid assay time (down to 35 min), combined with the ability to operate in complex biological media with minimal sample preparation, position CLIPs as powerful chemical tools for activity&#8208;based sensing of functional enzymes.

         <title>High Partial Molar Volume Polymer Electrolyte for Upgraded Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article demonstrates an underexplored design strategy to experimentally verify the impact of chemical potential difference (&#8710;&#181;) on the growth of Li&#8208;dendrites through manipulation of the partial molar volume of Li+ (VLi+${V}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^ + }$) in the polymer electrolyte. The high&#8208;VLi+${{\mathrm{V}}}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^ + }$ electrolyte can effectively reduce the &#8710;&#181; after Li deposition and stabilize Li metal anode by enhancing the interfacial exchange current density.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries combined with solid electrolytes represent a highly promising technology for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage systems. However, their cycling performance encounters inferior stability due to the continuous growth of Li&#8208;dendrites. The initial motivation for Li&#8208;dendrite growth theoretically arises from the high chemical potential difference (&#8710;&#181;) at the electrolyte/Li metal interface, yet the effectiveness of &#8710;&#181; regulation lacks experimental validation. Here, we experimentally present the impact of &#8710;&#181; on the growth of Li&#8208;dendrites through manipulation of the partial molar volume of Li+ (VLi+${V}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^ + }$) in the polymer electrolyte. By weakening Li&#8211;O coordination structure, the as&#8208;produced high&#8208;VLi+${V}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^ + }$ polymer electrolyte (108.5&#160;cm3 mol&#8722;1) shows 83% decrease in &#8710;&#181; (289&#160;J mol&#8722;1) compared with conventional counterparts, thereby enabling stable cycling for &gt;10 months in a Li||Li cell and &gt;2000 cycles in a Li||Cu cell with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 96%. To one's delight, a practical cylindrical Li||Li[Ni0.5Co0.3Mn0.2]O2 cell with capacity of 0.62 Ah delivers excellent cycle stability with negligible capacity attenuation over 85 cycles at 0.2 C. The beneficial role of high VLi+${V}_{{\mathrm{Li}}^ + }$ is leveraged to introduce a new dimension in polymer electrolyte engineering, highlighting the underexplored design strategy of regulating interfacial &#8710;&#181; to rejuvenate practical lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Chiral Luminescent Ion Pair (CLIP) Strategy Enables Amorphous Platinum Complexes Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral luminescent ion pair (CLIP) materials based on chiral anion strategy were synthesized with high&#8208;performance circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) in amorphous states. The trade&#8208;off problem between good processability and high asymmetry factor was solved by constructing CLIP molecules and utilizing polymer entanglement or rapid solvent evaporation to form amorphous structures.








Abstract
Chiral ion&#8208;pairing (CIP) has been developed as an effective chirality transfer strategy from chiral ionic species to its achiral counter&#8208;ionic substrate. When the achiral counter&#8208;ions were endowed with luminescent properties, the resultant chiral luminescent ion pair (CLIP) will open a new window for high&#8208;performance chiral luminescence. In this research, three pairs of CLIP molecules featuring the platinum complexes as achiral cationic luminophores and the chiral anion (CA) as chiral source were constructed. The CLIP molecules demonstrate circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with quantum yields (&#934;PL) up to 71.5%, dissymmetry factor (gcpp) values of 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 in amorphous state and gcpp up to &#8722;0.99 in cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC). Results show that the chiroptical properties can be assigned to the chirality transfer from the CAs to the formed twisted dimeric or oligomeric self&#8208;assemblies of platinum complex cations. This research presents a new approach for achieving high&#8208;performance chiral luminescence of amorphous chiral metal complexes, providing a concise model for revealing the chirality transfer in CLIP materials.

&lt;p&gt;A series of chiral luminescent ion pair (CLIP) materials based on chiral anion strategy were synthesized with high-performance circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) in amorphous states. The trade-off problem between good processability and high asymmetry factor was solved by constructing CLIP molecules and utilizing polymer entanglement or rapid solvent evaporation to form amorphous structures.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Low&#8208;Redox&#8208;Barrier Two&#8208;Electron p&#8208;Type Phenoselenazine Cathode for Superior Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;electron organic chalcogen small molecules as cathode materials were reported, where phenoselenazine liberates high dual&#8208;electron utilization of 99.2% due to high coordination activity, efficient electron delocalization, and charge storage kinetics with an ultralow activation energy (0.23&#160;eV). The Zn&#8208;organic battery delivers the highest capacity storage and energy density among the reported p&#8208;type cells, along with good cycling stability.








Abstract
Organic p&#8208;type cathode materials with high redox potentials and fast kinetics have captured widespread attention in propelling Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). However, their anion&#8208;accessible capacity is insufficient due to single electron reaction and/or high energy barrier of each redox&#8208;active unit. Here, we design two&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type organic chalcogen small molecules (phenoxazine (PO), phenothiazine (PS), and phenoselenazine (PSe)) with tuned charge distributions and electron transfer behaviors as cathode materials for ZOBs. With the decrease of chalcogenide electronegativity (O&#160;&gt;&#160;S&#160;&gt;&#160;Se), PSe liberates the strongest coordination activity, efficient electron delocalization, and charge storage kinetics with an ultralow redox activation energy (0.23&#160;vs. 0.34&#160;eV of PS and 0.41&#160;eV of PO), which contributes to high dual&#8208;electron utilization of phenazine motifs of 99.2% (vs. 68.8% of PS and 52.7% of PO). Consequently, Zn||PSe battery delivers the highest capacity storage (227&#160;mAh g&#8722;1) and energy density (273&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) among the reported p&#8208;type cells, along with long life (10&#160;000 cycles). A two&#8208;electron redox mechanism is unlocked at amine/selenium sites of PSe, accompanied by reversible uptake of two CF3SO3&#8722; anions. This study highlights the considerable potential of low&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier multielectron design for high&#8208;performance organic cathodes toward advanced ZOBs.

         <title>Synergistic Co&#8208;Recycling: Selective Oxidation of Polyethylene to Dicarboxylic Acids over Spent LiCoO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a co&#8208;upcycling strategy to simultaneously valorize waste polyethylene and spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. By repurposing retired LiCoO2 cathode materials as catalysts, we demonstrate the oxidative reformation of polyethylene into high&#8208;value dicarboxylic acids with an impressive yield of 77.5&#160;wt%. Notably, the lithium&#8208;deficient LiCoO2 catalysts inherent to degraded LIBs exhibit superior catalytic activity compared to their stoichiometric counterparts.








Abstract
The escalating production of lithium&#8208;ion batteries and plastics poses critical challenges to environmental integrity and resource sustainability. Here, we report a synergistic co&#8208;recycling strategy for spent lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) cathodes and waste polyethylene (PE), leveraging the catalytic properties of LCO to oxidize PE into high&#8208;value dicarboxylic acids. Through a combination of density functional theory calculations, electron spin resonance, and in situ infrared spectroscopy, we reveal that lithium&#8208;deficient LCO undergoes a spin&#8208;state transition of Co3+ to a high&#8208;spin state, facilitating the activation of oxygen and the generation of singlet oxygen. This reactive oxygen species drives the selective oxidation of PE via hydrogen atom transfer, achieving dicarboxylic acid yields of up to 77.5&#160;wt%, markedly exceeding previous benchmarks. Validation with real&#8208;world plastic waste and spent batteries underscores the feasibility of this approach, presenting a sustainable paradigm&#8208;shift solution for the efficient management of lithium&#8208;ion batteries and plastic waste in a circular economy.

         <title>An Enzymatic Platform for Asymmetric Synthesis of Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered P450 enzymes were employed to catalyze the asymmetric oxidation of dihydrosilanes, producing Si&#8208;stereogenic chiral silanols with good yields and high enantioselectivies. The evolved variant ASOx&#8208;6 exhibits a 54&#8208;fold activity increase compared to the wild&#8208;type enzyme on the model substrate. A combination of experimental and computational mechanistic studies provided detailed insights into this biocatalytic process.








Abstract
Chiral silanols are important synthetic targets and have garnered increasing attention in the materials and pharmaceutical industries over recent decades. A promising approach for their efficient synthesis is asymmetric silane oxidation. While chemists have developed several transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed systems for asymmetric hydrolytic oxidation of silanes, no biocatalytic methods have been available for enantioselective synthesis of Si&#8208;stereogenic compounds, including chiral silanols. Here, we present an enzymatic platform for the asymmetric aerobic mono&#8208;oxidation of dihydrosilanes using an engineered P450BM3 enzyme. Through six iterative rounds of directed evolution, we identified the optimal evolved variant, ASOx&#8208;6, which exhibits a 54&#8208;fold improvement in kcat/KM compared with the wild&#8208;type enzyme. Moreover, a variety of aryl&#8211;alkyl substituted dihydrosilanes are accepted by ASOx&#8208;6, including those bearing heteroaromatic rings. Finally, mechanistic insights obtained from kinetic isotope experiments and computational studies further elucidate the nature of this biocatalytic transformation.

Using ammonia in combination with hypochlorites as simple oxidants under phase&#8208;transfer conditions allows for the direct oxidative &#945;&#8208;amination of reactive enolate precursors such as cyclic &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, oxindoles, as well as malonitriles and malonates with good to excellent yields.








Abstract
We, herein, introduce a method for the direct &#945;&#8208;amination of different carbonyl compounds by employing aqueous ammonia as the N&#8208;source. Upon using NH3 in combination with hypochlorites as simple oxidants under phase&#8208;transfer catalytic conditions it is possible to carry out the direct &#945;&#8208;amination of reactive enolate&#8208;precursors such as cyclic &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, oxindoles, as well as malonitriles and malonates with good to excellent yields, while simple ketone precursors being out of the scope thus far. Furthermore, a first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for an asymmetric variant by employing a chiral quaternary ammonium salt is reported.

Upon using NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in combination with hypochlorites as simple oxidants under phase-transfer catalytic conditions it is possible to carry out the direct &#945;-amination of reactive enolate-precursors such as cyclic &#946;-ketoesters, oxindoles, as well as malonitriles and malonates with good to excellent yields, while simple ketone precursors being out of the scope thus far. Furthermore, a first proof-of-concept for an asymmetric variant by employing a chiral quaternary ammonium salt is reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of Nitrofuran Pharmaceuticals Using Acetyl Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust, automated continuous flow system enables safe, high&#8208;yield nitration of furfural to key nitrofuran intermediates using in situ acetyl nitrate generation. Demonstrated on representative essential World Health Organization (WHO) active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), this innovative open&#8208;source platform ensures rapid synthesis, enhanced safety, and excellent reproducibility, aligning with modern pharmaceutical standards.








Abstract
Nitrofurfural is a key building block for the synthesis of antimicrobial nitrofurans as active pharmaceutical ingredients. Its synthesis involves the nitration of furfural, a substrate derived from biobased resources. However, furfural has a delicate heteroaromatic backbone. Typical nitrations involve harsh reaction conditions, which often compromise this structure, resulting in poor reproducibility and low yields. Although acetyl nitrate, a mild nitrating agent, is suitable for this task, major deterrents remain. First, its conventional preparation method involves conditions that are not compatible with furfural. Second, significant safety concerns are associated with the unstable and explosive nature of acetyl nitrate. These critical issues are addressed herein. A safe and robust continuous flow platform featuring in situ generation of acetyl nitrate for the nitration of furfural to nitrofurfural is reported. The high level of integration and automation enables remote process operation by a single operator. Key furfural&#8208;based pharmaceutical intermediates were synthesized with favorable metrics and high reproducibility. The efficiency of this flow platform is demonstrated using a selection of best&#8208;selling nitrofuran pharmaceuticals (nifuroxazide, nifurtimox, nitrofurantoin, and nitrofural), which were obtained with excellent isolated yields in under five minutes.

         <title>Plasmonic&#8208;Hydrogel Hybrid Biomaterials Via In Situ Seeded Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed chemical analysis of the interactions between Au3+ ions and gelatin&#8208;based hydrogels enables the development of a robust &#8220;in situ&#8221; seed&#8208;mediated synthesis of plasmonic gold nanoparticles, whereby gold salts are reduced directly on the surface of hydrogel substrates to form the nanostructures. These hybrid plasmonic&#8208;hydrogel materials have potential applications in 3D cell culture, tumor/tissue models, and chemical and biological sensors.








Abstract
The combination of hydrogels and functional plasmonic metal nanoparticles affords the development of unique hybrid systems, such as actuators, biosensors, and drug delivery systems, among others. Being typically prepared in colloidal suspension, incorporating shape&#8208;controlled plasmonic nanoparticles on polymer substrates typically requires lengthy processes involving synthesis, washing, and self&#8208;assembly. We report an alternative, robust in situ seed&#8208;mediated growth method whereby either isotropic or anisotropic gold and silver nanoparticles can be prepared directly on gelatin&#8208;based hydrogels, taking advantage of the polymer's native chemical functionalities. In&#8208;depth characterization of gold precursor&#8211;polymer interactions enabled the rational growth of branched gold nanoparticles on biocompatible hydrogels with different physicochemical properties. In situ seeded growth circumvents traditional limitations imposed by the need for colloidal stability, thereby enabling gold nanoparticle synthesis under surfactant&#8208;free conditions and in high ionic strength solutions, thus enhancing their suitability for applications involving live cells. This method can be expanded to create libraries of hybrid plasmonic materials with potential impact in the fabrication of functional 3D cell culture substrates, as well as biological and chemical sensors.

         <title>Spider Eye Development Editing and Silk Fiber Engineering Using CRISPR&#8208;Cas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>

Spiders exhibit unique traits with significant implications for a diversity of fields, and gene editing provides new opportunities for advancing research in these areas. In this study, we developed a CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 protocol for spiders, enabling gene knock&#8208;outs/knock&#8208;ins to study gene function and introduce new phenotypic traits.








Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 gene editing represents an effective and precise technology to induce mutations in the genome, and it has been applied to a wide range of organisms for diverse purposes. However, CRISPR&#8208;based gene editing in spiders has not been reported to date. In this study, we demonstrate CRISPR&#8208;mediated microinjection in parental spiders leading to both knock&#8208;out (KO) and knock&#8208;in (KI) mutations within the spider's offspring. The KO of the gene sine oculis causes total eye loss, confirming the role of the gene in the development of all spider eyes. The KI of a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP&#8208;KI) within a spider silk gene encoding one compound of the major ampullate silk of the spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum yields red fluorescent silk fibers. This finding demonstrates the feasibility of functionalizing silk proteins in spiders using CRISPR&#8208;based gene editing without influencing silk assembly. Our study expands the application of CRISPR to spiders and provides insights in the fields of developmental genetics as well as material sciences.

         <title>The Flexibility of Tetra(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Ligands Controls the Nuclearity and Geometry of Polynuclear MI&#8210;NHC Assemblies</title>

         <dc:description>
Tetracarbene ligands composed of two di(phenylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)amine groups linked by an anthracene bridge exhibit restricted rotation of the Cphenyl&#9472;N&#9472;Cphenyl plane relative to the anthracene moiety if the N(Ph&#9472;NHC)2 moieties are directly attached to anthracene. The presence or absence of this restriction has been used in coordination driven self&#8208;assembly to prepare discrete M4L2, M6L3 and M8L4 (M&#160;=&#160;Ag+, Au+) assemblies. 








Abstract
A series of tetrakisimidazolium salts bearing two di(phenylimidazolium)amine groups linked by differently substituted anthracenes has been prepared. These are H4&#8208;1a(PF6)4 (anthracene bridge), H4&#8208;1b(PF6)4 (phenyl&#8208;anthracene&#8208;phenyl bridge), H4&#8208;1c(PF6)4 (anthracene&#8208;phenyl bridge), and H4&#8208;1d(PF6)4 (anthracene&#8208;phenyl&#8208;anthracene bridge). X&#8208;ray crystallography showed that those ligand precursors having the di(phenylimidazolium)amine connected directly to the anthracene experience restricted rotation about the N&#9472;Canthracene bond. Depending on their flexibility, the reaction of the tetrakisimidazolium salts with Ag2O followed by transmetalation with [AuCl(THT)] yielded octanuclear ([Au8(1a)4](PF6)8), tetranuclear ([Au4(1b)2](PF6)4), hexanuclear ([Au6(1c)3](PF6)6), or octanuclear ([Au8(1d)4](PF6)8) assemblies, demonstrating the direct bonding strategy can be employed for the selective synthesis of polynuclear poly&#8208;NHC (NHC&#160;=&#160;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) metallosupramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Massive Production of Dimerized Imine in Aqueous Phase via an Atomically Engineered Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically engineered photocatalyst efficiently weakens the interfacial energy barrier, thus resulting in promoted charge separation for imine production coupled with H2 evolution in aqueous media. Moreover, the spatially separated redox sites suppress the severe hydrogenation side reaction of imine, achieving excellent photocatalytic activity and &gt;&#160;99% imine selectivity.








Abstract
Photocatalytic selective oxidation of organics coupled with green H2 evolution represents a promising avenue for the sustainable production of value&#8208;added chemicals, but suffers from sluggish charge separation and difficult selectivity manipulation. In particular, the Schottky barrier&#8208;induced adsorption of expected organic products at reduction sites tends to trigger the hydrogenation side reaction, which is more pronounced in the ideal aqueous environment due to distinct polarity. Here, we report a precise cocatalyst strategy on ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) photocatalyst at the atomic level to eliminate the Schottky barrier between ZIS and cocatalyst, thus achieving exceptional activity (565&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1) and selectivity (99%) for photocatalytic dimerized imine production in aqueous media, which is five times more effective than ZIS loaded with Pt nanoparticles. The excellent performance is achieved by effectively attenuating the accumulation of photogenerated holes near the Pt sites and then suppressing the unwanted hydrogenation side reaction. We further demonstrate that our system can be directly scaled up to 0.5&#160;m2 for scalable outdoor experiment and achieve solar&#8208;driven production of benzylimine with 125&#160;mL yield and 97&#160;wt% purity for two weeks under solar irradiation. This study presents an interfacial atomical design strategy for photocatalysts to efficiently produce high&#8208;value imine coupled with H2 under mild and green conditions.

         <title>Fluorogenic Interacting Protein Stabilization for Orthogonal RNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorogenic interacting protein stabilization (FLIPS) system is developed via engineering of the fluorescence protein&#8208;fused RNA binding proteins (RBPs) through circular permutation and incorporation with a C&#8208;terminal poly(arginine)&#8208;appended degron. Our system enables multi&#8208;color and orthogonal imaging of RNAs, single&#8208;molecule RNA imaging, and simultaneous tracking of RNA translocation dynamics in live cells.








Abstract
Live imaging of RNAs is crucial to interrogate their cellular functions, but genetically encodable RNA imaging systems compatible with multiplexed and in vivo applications remain a persistent challenge. We propose a new concept of fluorogenic interacting protein stabilization (FLIPS) that enables the engineering of RNA&#8208;binding proteins (RBPs) such as MCP, L7Ae, Cse3, and LIN28A into orthogonal RNA&#8208;stabilized fluorogenic proteins for multiplexed RNA imaging. The FLIPS system comprises elaborate engineering of the fluorescence protein&#8208;fused RBPs through circular permutation and incorporation with a C&#8208;terminal poly(arginine)&#8208;appended degron. We show that the RNA motifs bind and stabilize the cognate&#8208;engineered RBPs with a proximity&#8208;mediated synergistic effect from the poly(arginine) region due to enhanced electrostatic interactions. The FLIPS design affords a generally applicable strategy for different RNA motifs and RBPs, enabling orthogonal and multi&#8208;color fluorescence&#8208;activated RNA imaging. The design is demonstrated for multicolor and orthogonal imaging of RNAs, single&#8208;molecule RNA imaging and tracking, simultaneous imaging of two RNAs in nuclear condensates, and biplexed tracking of RNA translocation into cytosolic condensates. The versatility of our system highlights its potential for interrogating RNA biology and developing RNA&#8208;based imaging tools.

         <title>A Ketone&#8208;Accepting Pictet&#8211;Spenglerase for the Asymmetric Construction of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Tetrahydro&#8208;&#223;&#8208;carboline Alkaloids</title>

         <dc:description>
We explore KslB, a Pictet&#8211;Spenglerase (PSase) capable of accepting ketones, in preparing 1,1&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;&#223;&#8208;carbolines. Biocatalytic optimizations show its broad promiscuity, excellent stereoselectivity, stability (TTN&#160;&gt;&#160;4&#160;38&#160;000), and application in an enzyme&#8208;cascade with tryptophan synthase. X&#8208;ray characterization demonstrate conserved features among bacterial PSases like McbB and KslB and offered insights into KslB's ability to accept ketones.








Abstract
In light of the ubiquity of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#223;&#8208;carboline (THBC) motif in alkaloid natural products, developing asymmetric methodology for its preparation is highly valuable. Despite the immense progress toward achieving stereoselective Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction with aldehydes, the analogous reaction with ketones is still underdeveloped. Exploiting KslB, a Pictet&#8211;Spenglerase from the biosynthesis of kitasetaline, we develop a general, diastereoselective, and protecting&#8208;group free method for the construction of densely functionalized THBCs with &#945;&#8208;quaternary center by coupling tryptophan derivatives and &#945;&#8208;keto acids. We determine the stereochemistry of kitasetalic acid, KslB's physiological product and a key biosynthetic intermediate toward kitasetaline, and established that KslB's selectivity is opposite to what is achieved chemically. Our investigations of KslB show its high activity (total turnover number &gt;438000), substrate promiscuity, and tolerance for high substrate concentrations (0.1&#160;M). Additionally, a TrpB&#8208;KslB cascade enables the construction of complex tricyclic products from simple indoles in one&#8208;pot. X&#8208;ray structural characterization of KslB sheds light on potential active site interactions to account for its stereoselectivity and ability to accept ketone substrates.

         <title>Water Serving as Cocatalyst for the Highly Efficient Homogeneously Catalyzed Conversion of N2O/H2 Mixtures with Optimized Rhodium NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Feeling thirsty? A highly active rhodium olefin&#8211;amine carbene catalyst enables water&#8208;assisted, autocatalytic N&#8322;O hydrogenation. The increased &#960;&#8208;acidity of the NHC enhances the acidity of the cooperative ligand, improving catalytic efficiency. A unique dimeric [Rh]&#8322;[H&#8323;O&#8322;]&#8315; complex was identified, with structural analysis and DFT calculations revealing the efficient release of N&#8322; and water.








Abstract
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a valuable oxygen/nitrogen transfer reagent but reactions with N2O are challenging due to its inertness. Consequently, it accumulates in the atmosphere, and because it is both an ozone&#8208;depleting reagent and potent green&#8208;house gas, effective mitigation methods become important. This study presents rhodium(I) amido bis(olefin) N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes [Rh(trop2N)(NHC)] as robust homogeneous catalysts for the direct hydrogenation of N2O. Kinetic experiments and DFT calculations show that increasing &#960;&#8208;acidity of the NHC and the presence of water significantly enhance the catalytic efficiency. The rhodium&#8208;amido bond facilitates cooperative H2&#8208;cleavage and oxygen atom transfer from N2O. The catalyst is regenerated with the loss of water from the hydroxide intermediate [Rh(OH)(trop2NH)(NHC)], which forms a dimeric complex with a central bridging hydrated hydroxide ligand [H3O2]&#8722;. Water facilitates dinitrogen (N2) loss from an intermediate containing an oxy&#8208;diazene ligand [H&#9472;N&#9552;N&#9472;O]&#8722;. The optimized catalyst achieves a TON&#160;&gt;&#160;230&#160;000 and TOF&#160;&gt;&#160;1300 h&#8722;1.

         <title>Coupling of CuO@NiBiOx Catalyzed Glycerol Oxidation to Carbon Dioxide Reduction Reaction for Enhanced Energy Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CuOx@NiBiOx core&#8208;shell&#8208;like catalyst is synthesized. Thanks to the Bi presence, the electronic structure of Ni is tuned, leading to better catalytic performance for glycerol oxidation compared to both CuOx and CuOx@NiOx catalysts. Additionally, coupling glycerol oxidation with CO2 reduction significantly reduces the operational voltage and the specific energy required for formate production. 








Abstract
Glycerol electrooxidation reaction (GEOR) is a promising alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrolyzers, overcoming the inherent challenges of high energy demand and low&#8208;value output of water oxidation. Here, we designed a non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalyst (CuO@NiBiOx, CNBO) for selective and efficient GEOR. The CNBO catalyst demonstrated high selectivity and achieved nearly 100% GEOR Faradaic efficiency (FE), 80%&#8211;90% of which is conveyed into formic acid (FA). Bismuth incorporation modified the structure of the mixed oxide, increasing the surface concentration of Ni(III) species and enhancing the GEOR activity. In situ studies confirmed the formation of NiOOH, which is identified as the active site for GEOR and suggests an indirect GEOR mechanism. This study demonstrates the potential of GEOR to replace OER in Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) electrolyzers. Depending on the selected CO2RR catalyst (Ag or Sn), we could obtain either an easy&#8208;to&#8208;separate mixture of high&#8208;added value products (CO and FA) or a single product (FA) with FEFA &gt;&#160;85% at both electrodes. Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing OER with GEOR in a CO2RR&#8208;electrolyzer can save up to 25% of the electrolysis energy input, while the co&#8208;production of FA at both electrodes halves the energy per mole required for its electrosynthesis.

         <title>Local Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Oxygen Exchange for Active and Durable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to enhance OER activity and durability by tailoring pseudo&#8208;amorphous IrOx with a locally ordered rutile structure and unique defects is developed. The generated defect&#8208;active sites afford the oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated oxygen exchange process with favorable O&#9472;O bonding and efficient lattice oxygen recovery, presenting a 2200&#160;h stability at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1.68&#160;V at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 1000&#160;h in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. 








Abstract
Developing an active and durable acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst is vital for implementing a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) in sustainable hydrogen production. However, it remains dauntingly challenging to balance high activity and long&#8208;term stability under harsh acidic and oxidizing conditions. Herein, through developing the universal rare&#8208;earth participated pyrolysis&#8208;leaching approach, we customized the active and long lifespan pseudo&#8208;amorphous IrOx with locally ordered rutile IrO2 and unique defect sites (IrOx&#8208;3Nd). IrOx&#8208;3Nd achieved a low overpotential of 206&#160;mV and long&#8208;term durability of 2200&#160;h with a slow degradation rate of 0.009&#160;mV&#8201;&#160;h&#8722;1 at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and, more importantly, high efficiency in PEMWE (1.68&#160;V at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 1000&#160;h) for practical hydrogen production. Utilizing in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, we found that lattice oxygen vacancies (Ov) and contracted Ir&#8208;O in locally ordered rutile IrO2 induced the Ov&#8208;modulated lattice oxygen exchange process, wherein thermodynamically spontaneous occupation of surface hydroxyl groups on Ov and effective promotion of O&#9472;O coupling and lattice oxygen recovery accounted for enhanced activity and durability. This work underscores the importance of tailor&#8208;made local configuration in boosting activity and durability of OER catalyst and different insights into the promotion mechanism.

This study introduces the construction of human heart inflammatory organoids with intricate structures and diverse cell lineages and the development of an artificial AI&#8208;enabled method for quantitative assessment of inflammation levels in this model. Furthermore, we devised a novel therapeutic strategy to boost endogenous energy molecule production in heart inflammatory organoids to address energy metabolic disorders. This research provides a convenient method for quantitative inflammation evaluation and offers a promising tool for drug discovery.








Abstract
Inflammation plays a crucial role in progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); thus, the discovery of rapid and precise analytical tools to assess inflammation related to CVDs is highly desirable for their diagnosis and therapeutic discovery. However, a straightforward and systematic method for quantitative assessment of inflammation levels in heart organoids has yet to be developed. Herein, we describe the construction of human heart inflammatory organoids with intricate structures and diverse cell lineages and the development of an artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;enabled method for quantitative assessment of inflammation levels in this model. Furthermore, we devised a novel therapeutic strategy to boost endogenous energy molecule production in heart inflammatory organoids to address energy metabolic disorders. This research provides a convenient method for quantitative inflammation evaluation and offers a promising tool for drug discovery.

         <title>Balancing CO2 Adsorption and H2 Activation on Confined ZnOx Species for CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2 activation on ZnO suffers from the poisoning effect of strong CO2 adsorption, which impedes CO2 hydrogenation. In contrast, monodispersed ZnOx confined on ZnCr2O4 facilitates CO2 activation without compromising H2 activation. This catalyst demonstrates a dual&#8208;site mechanism, enabling H2 homolytic activation and CO2 hydrogenation at 303&#160;K.








Abstract
Many oxide catalysts exhibit high selectivity but low conversion in CO2 hydrogenation due to strong CO2 adsorption, which often impedes H2 dissociation and subsequent hydrogenation. Herein, we report that a ZnCr2O4@ZnOx catalyst featuring monodispersed ZnOx overlayer confined on ZnCr2O4 facilitates CO2 activation without compromising H2 activation. This catalyst demonstrates a dual&#8208;site mechanism in which ZnCr2O4 surface and/or ZnOx/ZnCr2O4 interface provide sites for CO2 activation and monodispersed ZnOx promote homolytic H2 dissociation and formation of stable metal&#9472;H species, enabling formate formation through hydrogen spillover to CO2 adsorption sites for hydrogenation at 303&#160;K. In contrast, H2 activation on ZnO or ZnCr2O4 suffers from the poisoning effect of strong CO2 adsorption. Consequently, the ZnCr2O4@ZnOx catalyst shows 2&#8722;8 folds enhancement in CO2 hydrogenation between 623&#8722;773&#160;K than ZnO and maintains 33% conversion and 100% CO selectivity at 723&#160;K over 150&#160;h. The established structure&#8208;performance relationship illustrates the critical role of dual&#8208;site catalysis and hydrogen spillover in hydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Near&#8208;Zero Thermal Expansion in Coordination Polymer Cd(1,2,4&#8208;Triazole)2(H2PO4)2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural dynamics and the chemical bonding origin of a volumetric near&#8208;zero thermal expansion in a coordination polymer across 25&#160;K to 400&#160;K is studied using multi&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray crystallography and X&#8208;ray electron density analysis. The lattice expansion in the a and c directions is counteracted by contraction along b axis, caused by concerted out&#8208;of&#8208;plane single atom librations of similarly oriented adjacent triazole rings in the wine&#8208;rack motifs.








Abstract
Zero thermal expansion is a rare but desirable physical property for materials. Here, we report an unprecedented near&#8208;zero thermal expansion (nZTE) behavior in a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) coordination polymer (CP) Cd(1,2,4&#8208;triazole)2 (H2PO4)2 (Cd&#8208;Tz) across a broad temperature range of 25&#160;K&#8211;400&#160;K. Using multi&#8208;temperature high&#8208;resolution single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, we investigated the structural dynamics of the wine&#8208;rack&#8208;like framework of Cd&#8208;Tz and compared it with that of positive thermal expansion (PTE) CPs Zn&#8208;Tz and Mn&#8208;Tz with similar framework topology. We show that nZTE in Cd&#8208;Tz is a consequence of two monotonic and opposing trends with PTE (&#945;a, &#945;c&#8764;22&#160;MK&#8722;1) in the ac plane and negative thermal expansion (NTE) in the b direction (&#945;b&#8764;&#8722;47&#160;MK&#8722;1). A new mechanism for the uniaxial NTE is established based on concerted out&#8208;of&#8208;plane single atom libration of similarly oriented adjacent triazole rings in the wine&#8208;rack motifs. X&#8208;ray electron density analysis and modeling of low&#8208;temperature vibrational anharmonicity reveals the role of Cd&#8208;triazole bonds and hydrogen bonds in promoting the single atom libration. Tuning the metal&#8722;ligand bonding strength through minor substitution of Zn/Mn (&#8764;8/12%) in the Cd&#8208;Tz lattice results in a prominent shift from nZTE to NTE behavior in the solid solution phases.

         <title>Reduction of the Thermal Conductivity of Polyurethanes by Fluorination: Impact of Crystallinity, Atomic Density, and Sound Velocity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a rich database of structure&#8211;property relationships that will help guide future work in designing polymers with low intrinsic thermal conductivity. Fluorinated polymers are widely utilized in industry for their outstanding hydrophobicity, chemical resistance, and heat resistance. Our study provides insights that fluorinated polymers have generally lower thermal conductivity, offering benefits for industry where thermal insulation is desired. This study provides an important step in the validation of computational studies and advances the development of machine learning models for the thermal conductivity of polymers.








Abstract
The intrinsic thermal conductivity (&#923;$\text{\ensuremath{\Lambda}}$) of polymers ranges between 0.13&#160;W m&#8722;1K&#8722;1 in amorphous polyvinyl chloride to 60&#160;W m&#8722;1K&#8722;1 in ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene. Increasing the amorphous content of polymers to further lower &#923;${\Lambda}$ is insufficient as this approach reaches a practical limit at approximately 0.15&#160;W m&#8722;1K&#8722;1. Inspired by the low &#923;${\Lambda}$ and low speed of sound of fluorinated liquids, we explored whether this behavior in liquids can be extended to polymers. We synthesized seven partially fluorinated (9%&#8211;17% atomic fraction F) and ten conventional polyurethanes. Fluorinated polyurethanes exhibit a reduction in &#923;${\Lambda}$ up to 50% compared to their nonfluorinated counterparts. Microstructural analysis revealed that the fluorinated polyurethanes exhibited reduced crystallinity and increased molecular spacing. Furthermore, we observed a decreased speed of sound in fluorinated polymers by forced Brillouin scattering via a new analysis method that captures weak signals from highly scattering semicrystalline polymers. The lowest thermal conductivity, 0.13&#160;W m&#8722;1K&#8722;1 at room temperature, was observed in polyurethane synthesized from 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5&#8208;octafluoro&#8208;1,6&#8208;hexanediol (16F) and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). Our study provides deeper insights into the relationship between &#923;${\Lambda}$, microstructure, and chemical structure, paving the way to rational design of polymers with thermal conductivity below the lowest limit of conventional amorphous polymers.

         <title>Acidic CO2 Electrolysis With Near&#8208;Ideal Selectivity and Carbon Efficiency Enabled by Overcoming Its Inherent Trade&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inherent trade&#8208;off exists in acidic CO2 electrolysis: increasing cation concentrations improves Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward CO2R products but comes at the expense of reduced single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency (SPCE). Modifying SnO2 with polyimide achieved a near&#8208;ideal SPCE of 95.7% and FE of 96% (toward HCOOH) at pH 1.36 with potassium ions down to even 0.1&#160;M. 








Abstract
Carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO2R) in acid tends to be a promising route to avoid CO2 loss in alkaline and neutral electrolytes; however, high alkali cation concentrations (typically &#8805;3&#160;M) are required to activate CO2 and suppress water electroreduction, causing carbonate formation and thus unsatisfied single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency (SPCE). Based on theoretical and experimental analyses, we show that an inherent trade&#8208;off exists: increasing cation concentrations improves Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward CO2R products but comes at the expense of reduced SPCE. We demonstrate a polyimide&#8208;modification strategy to overcome this trade&#8208;off by taking advantage of the amino groups that can effectively capture protons, creating a local alkaline microenvironment surrounding the electrode surface. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, SnO2 nanoparticles were modified with polyimide and acted as a CO2R catalyst, which achieved, simultaneously, near&#8208;ideal SPCE of 95.7% and FE of 96% (toward HCOOH) at pH 1.36 with dilute potassium ions down to even 0.1&#160;M. We expect that these findings will accelerate the development of carbon&#8208; and electron&#8208;efficient acidic CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Through&#8208;Space 1,4&#8208;Ni/H Shift: Unlocking Migration along Coupling Partners in Olefin Borylcarbofunctionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented migratory functionalization of olefins is reported, where migration occurs selectively along the coupling partner via a 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shift. Additionally, the integration of 1,2&#8208;Ni/H and 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shifts enables a two&#8208;fold migration, facilitating selective borylative remote C(sp3)&#9472;H/C(sp2)&#9472;H cross&#8208;coupling.








Abstract
Olefin migratory functionalization is a well&#8208;established strategy for the selective installation of functional groups at remote C(sp3)&#8722;H positions along an alkyl chain. However, prior research has predominantly focused on migration along the alkene component. Herein, we describe a conceptually new migratory coupling strategy for the difunctionalization of alkenes, where migration selectively occurs along the C(sp2) coupling partner rather than the alkene component, facilitated by a through&#8208;space 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shift. This approach offers a modular three&#8208;component strategy for the selective and efficient construction of densely functionalized alkyl boronates from readily accessible chemicals. Moreover, by integrating the 1,2&#8208;Ni/H shift with the 1,4&#8208;Ni/H shift, this platform has been expanded to achieve a two&#8208;fold migration along both the alkene components and the coupling partners, facilitating selective borylative remote C(sp3)&#9472;H/C(sp2)&#9472;H cross&#8208;coupling.

     alt="Through-Space 1,4-Ni/H Shift: Unlocking Migration along Coupling Partners in Olefin Borylcarbofunctionalization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unprecedented migratory functionalization of olefins is reported, where migration occurs selectively along the coupling partner via a 1,4-Ni/H shift. Additionally, the integration of 1,2-Ni/H and 1,4-Ni/H shifts enables a two-fold migration, facilitating selective borylative remote C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H/C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H cross-coupling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olefin migratory functionalization is a well-established strategy for the selective installation of functional groups at remote C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H positions along an alkyl chain. However, prior research has predominantly focused on migration along the alkene component. Herein, we describe a conceptually new migratory coupling strategy for the difunctionalization of alkenes, where migration selectively occurs along the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) coupling partner rather than the alkene component, facilitated by a through-space 1,4-Ni/H shift. This approach offers a modular three-component strategy for the selective and efficient construction of densely functionalized alkyl boronates from readily accessible chemicals. Moreover, by integrating the 1,2-Ni/H shift with the 1,4-Ni/H shift, this platform has been expanded to achieve a two-fold migration along both the alkene components and the coupling partners, facilitating selective borylative remote C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H/C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;H cross-coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pangenome Analysis of the Plant Pathogen Pseudomonas syringae&#160;Reveals Unique Natural Products for Niche Adaptation</title>

A pangenome analysis of the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae reveals two novel natural product families that facilitate niche adaptation. Comprehensive genomic and chemical analyses uncover unique biosynthetic gene clusters linked to host specificity and environmental fitness.








Abstract
Pseudomonas syringae is a soil&#8208;dwelling bacterium that exhibits remarkable niche adaptability, and it is known for its devastating impact as a plant pathogen. This bacterium has an outstanding capability to produce a wide array of biologically active natural products. P. syringae coexists with amoebal predators and fungal strains, which drives the production of secondary metabolites for predator evasion in addition to niche adaptation. In this study, we conducted a broad pangenomic analysis of 18 taxonomically distinct P. syringae strains, leading to the identification of 231 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Among these, nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) were particularly abundant, indicating their potential significance within this ecological context. We discovered and elucidated the structures of two novel classes of bioactive compounds, the syrilipamides and chlorosecimides. Furthermore, a bioinformatic analysis enabled the identification of an undescribed halogenase, SecA, essential for the chlorination of secimide A. We observed that syrilipamides and secimides and in particular mixtures thereof, exhibit amoebicidal activities. Additionally, secimides showed selective antifungal activity. These findings provide valuable insights into the ecological roles of P. syringae natural products and highlight their potential for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Erasable Fluorescence Imaging Technology Enables Continuous Tracking for Identical Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new erasable labeling method, utilizing melamine&#8208;mediated reversible DNA self&#8208;assembly, realizes fluorescence labeling at 25&#160;&#176;C and fluorescence erasing at 37&#160;&#176;C for the specific marker on the identical living cell at any time. Due to its simple conditions satisfying the most fundamental experimental scenarios, this method has high potential as a powerful preliminary screening tool for new biological mechanisms through continuously tracking the life activities of cells.








Abstract
Subtle molecular events may trigger a cascade of &#8220;butterfly effects&#8221; to reverse cell fate, so dynamic tracking of relevant markers can provide crucial clues to decipher the unknown. However, existing analytical techniques are still at static&#8208;analysis level, and cutting&#8208;edge fluorescence imaging is limited by signal interference at adjacent time, failing to realize continuous observation for identical live cells. Herein, we develop a new temperature&#8208;controlled imaging technology, where melamine&#8208;mediated reversible DNA self&#8208;assembly drives the fluorescence illuminating and extinguishing at any time, achieving repeated erasable imaging for identical living cells. This method can track cell behaviors by taking dynamic monitoring of cell differentiation as an example, and timely fluorescence erasing guarantees authenticity for imaging results and minimizes interference with cellular activities. Thanks to high feasibility in fundamental experimental scenarios, this method hopefully provides a powerful preliminary screening tool for exploring new biological mechanisms in cell interactions, developmental transformations, downstream response inquiry, and so forth.

         <title>Photoactivated Enzymatic Reaction Network Enables Spatiotemporal Programming of Thiol/Disulfide Redox Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a redox&#8208;based enzymatic reaction network that can be photoactivated and recharged multiple times to sustain dissipative disulfide formation. The innovative system integrates an upstream oxidative enzymatic process with a downstream reducing agent&#8208;regenerating enzymatic mechanism. The redox&#8208;based enzymatic reaction network facilitates lithographic programming of sol&#8208;gel transformation in a hydrogel material system.








Abstract
Implementing photoactivation into chemical reaction networks (CRNs) offers opportunities for on&#8208;demand and remote activation, fuel storage, creating autonomous materials and systems with precise spatial activation. However, examples in this domain remain limited. Here, we introduce a cascaded redox&#8208;based enzymatic reaction network (ERN) capable of photoinitiation and refueling, centered around dissipative aromatic disulfide bond formation. To achieve photoinitiation, we integrate an upstream enzymatic module (EM) into the ERN, where the substrate of the EM can be photouncaged using blue light irradiation. A downstream regeneration system enhances the robustness of the reducing environment for repeated fueling. This cascaded ERN operates in solution, allowing for controlled dissipative disulfide formation while avoiding short&#8208;circuit reactions (SCR) between the oxidative and reductive halves of the reaction cycle. To showcase the utility of this photoactivated ERN, we couple it with aromatic thiol&#8208;terminated star polymers (sPEG&#8208;ArSH) to enable spatiotemporally controlled dissipative hydrogel formation using lithographic masks.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Polyorganosiloxanes via Photo&#8208;Induced Anionic Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Using a Latent Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled photo&#8208;induced anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of cyclosiloxane was achieved by developing an efficient photobase generator, yielding polyorganosiloxanes with predetermined molar masses and low dispersities. The cleavage of latent catalyst and reversible equilibrium among silanol, ion pair, and anionic species collectively command the kinetics and help mitigate side reactions, thereby enhancing control over polymerization.








Abstract
Precise, controlled, and living polymerization of cyclosiloxanes is garnering considerable attention due to the distinct properties and promising applications of polyorganosiloxanes in various fields. In this contribution, photo&#8208;induced living anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of cyclosiloxanes is achieved by developing an efficient photobase generator (PBG). Structure&#8208;photoactivity analysis of the photo&#8208;latent catalyst is undertaken by synergistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental investigations. DFT calculations predict the superior photoactivity of the synthesized PBG2 (i.e., 2&#8208;[(9&#8208;oxo&#8208;9H&#8208;thioxanthen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)oxy]acetic&#8208;1,5,7&#8208;riazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) and provide insights into the structure&#8208;catalytic activities, which is confirmed through the experiments. Polyorganosiloxanes&#160;with predetermined molar masses and low dispersities (&#272; &lt;&#160;1.30) are produced through on&#8208;demand cleavage of PBG2 under various light intensities, different PBG2 loadings, and sequential addition of monomers. On&#8211;off light switching enables the polymerization in a rate&#8208;controlled manner. Later on, mechanistic insights by DFT calculations identify the anionic species for nucleophilic attack and reveal that the reversible equilibrium involving anionic species, catalyst cations, and ion pairs contributes to precise control over chain growth during photopolymerization. Furthermore, deterministic kinetic simulation disentangles the effects of the cleavage rate and loading of PBG2 on polymerization kinetic behaviors. This developed photopolymerization strategy shows promising potential to expand the application of polyorganosiloxanes in advanced manufacturing fields.

         <title>A Novel Synthetic Pathway to Lanthanide Triple&#8208;Decker Complexes: Selective Expansion of a Sandwich Complex by an Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reaction pathway is disclosed, in which for the first time a lanthanide half&#8208;sandwich unit inserts into an existing sandwich complex. As a result, a triple&#8208;decker complex is formed, which can also be accessed in a salt metathesis from unprecedented inverse sandwich compounds.








Abstract
Commonly, multi&#8208;decker sandwich complexes can either be formed in a one&#8208;step reaction or in a stepwise fashion by stacking deck by deck. Herein, we showcase a new reaction pathway, in which for the first time a lanthanide half&#8208;sandwich unit inserts into an existing sandwich complex. As a result of the insertion of a cyclocene half&#8208;sandwich fragment {LnII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)} (CotTIPS&#160;=&#160;1,4&#8208;(iPr3Si)2C8H62&#8722;) into a classical divalent sandwich complex [LnII(&#951;9&#8208;Cnt)2] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Sm, Eu, Yb; Cnt&#160;=&#160;C9H9&#8722;$_{9^-}$), the unprecedented triple&#8208;decker sandwich complexes of the type [(&#951;9&#8208;Cnt)LnII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnII(&#951;9&#8208;Cnt)] were obtained. A plausible reaction pathway was determined by quantum chemical calculations. Additionally, we synthesize the same lanthanide sandwich complexes in a traditional, stepwise fashion. For this, we initially present the novel inverse sandwich compounds [LnIII(thf)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(thf)2] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Sm,&#160;Eu, thf&#160;=&#160;tetrahydrofuran) and [YbII(BH4)(thf)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)YbII(BH4)(thf)2] consisting of a cyclooctatetraene middle deck sandwiched between two divalent lanthanides as precursors. Subsequent salt metathesis reactions with [K(Cnt)] (Cnt&#160;=&#160;C9H9&#8722;$_{9^-}$) gave rise to the title compounds [(&#951;9&#8208;Cnt)LnII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnII(&#951;9&#8208;Cnt)]. The unique feature of these compounds is the combination of the two largest aromatic all&#8208;carbon rings known in coordination chemistry&#8212;the 8&#8208; and 9&#8208;membered rings&#8212;into lanthanide triple&#8208;decker sandwich compounds.

         <title>Mn2+&#8208;Activated Alkali Lithooxidosilicate Phosphors as Sustainable Alternative White&#8208;Light Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu2+&#8208;activated alkali lithooxidosilicates are celebrated phosphor materials. We showed for the first time that the alternative, more abundant transition metal ion Mn2+ can also be incorporated into those compounds. The phosphors show two emission bands (green and red), making them interesting candidates for pc&#8208;wLEDs with only one converting phosphor. The ratio of the two bands can be tailored by the composition of the host compound.








Abstract
Eu2+&#8208;activated alkali lithooxidosilicates have emerged as promising candidates for narrow&#8208;band cyan and green&#8208;emitting phosphors for human&#8208;centered lighting. Despite the vivid research on Eu2+&#8208;activated alkali lithooxidosilicates, little to nothing is known about the possible luminescence with other activator ions than Eu2+. The more abundant transition metal ion Mn2+ is a potential alternative emitter with tunable emission over the visible spectral range. Mn2+&#8208;activated alkali lithooxidosilicates show two emission bands in the green and red spectral range, respectively, making them intriguing candidates for one&#8208;component phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes. A total of seven Mn2+ activated compounds were prepared to elucidate possible trends. The results show that the ratio between green and red emission correlates to the size of the available activator sites and is easily controlled by the composition of the alkali lithooxidosilicate host compounds. Temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence studies reveal that thermal quenching occurs slightly above room temperature for those compounds, which may be connected to the comparably low band gaps for silicates (Eg &lt; 6&#160;eV) and a consequent thermal ionization of excited electrons into the conduction band. Overall, this study comprises the first class of compounds with efficient tailored white&#8208;light emission based on Mn2+ within one host compound.

         <dc:description>
Efficient electrophotochemical C&#9472;H fluoroalkylation of complex bioactive substrates with abundant fluoroalkyl carboxylic acids employing an inexpensive iron(III) catalyst accompanied by hydrogen evolution reaction has been developed.








Abstract
Chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective functionalization of complex molecules poses a fundamental challenge. Herein, we introduce a resource&#8208;economic photoelectrocatalysis strategy to enable versatile direct fluoroalkylations catalyzed by Earth&#8208;abundant iron and paired with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Notably, the devised approach proved amenable to versatile late&#8208;stage C&#9472;H fluoroalkylations of bio&#8208;relevant heterocycles, such as xanthines, nucleobases, and nucleosides. Mechanistic studies supported a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer&#8208;induced formation of the fluoroalkyl radical.

         <title>Artificial Cation&#8211;Chloride Co&#8208;Transporters for Chloride&#8208;Facilitated Lithium/Magnesium Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial cation&#8211;chloride co&#8208;transporter was realized using a porous organic framework with weak surface charge and narrow pores that achieved the simultaneous selective separation of Cl&#8722; and alkaline ions. With the help of this co&#8208;transport, high&#8208;flux and highly selective Li+ sieving was achieved from NaCl&#8208;rich brines, out&#8208;performing reported membranes and reversing the current industrial brine&#8208;based lithium extraction process.








Abstract
Inspired by nature, many artificial ion sieving materials have been developed, shedding light on the next&#8208;generation ion, e.g., Li+, extraction applications. Artificial co&#8208;transporters remain difficult to construct since they have a much more complex ion&#8208;sieving property. For example, the cation&#8211;chloride co&#8208;transporters have both alkaline ion and chloride ion selectivity but no alkaline ion/chloride ion selectivity. We here demonstrate a method to construct artificial co&#8208;transporters, using a porous organic framework membrane which has a relatively disordered stacking structure and rich quaternary ammonium groups paired with counter&#8208;ions. This imparts the membrane with extremely narrow pores (&#8764;0.3&#160;nm) and almost no surface charge, enabling size&#8208;based high alkaline ion selectivity against other cations, high Cl&#8722; selectivity against other anions, but almost no alkaline ion/Cl&#8722; selectivity. Such synchronized sieving property allows us to enhance the extraction of high&#8208;value cations (Li+) by simply feeding excessive low&#8208;value anions (Cl&#8722;). As a demonstration, we realized high&#8208;flux (0.44&#160;mol&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) and highly selective (selectivity: 185) Li+/Mg2+ separation by reversing the current industrial brine&#8208;based lithium extraction process, i.e., sieving Li+ before removing NaCl.

This imparts the membrane with extremely narrow pores (&#8764;0.3&#160;nm) and almost no surface charge, enabling size-based high alkaline ion selectivity against other cations, high Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity against other anions, but almost no alkaline ion/Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity. Such synchronized sieving property allows us to enhance the extraction of high-value cations (Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) by simply feeding excessive low-value anions (Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). As a demonstration, we realized high-flux (0.44&#160;mol&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and highly selective (selectivity: 185) Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; separation by reversing the current industrial brine-based lithium extraction process, i.e., sieving Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; before removing NaCl.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Tailored Shape&#8208;Matched Interactions Towards Ambient&#8208;Temperature Argon Removal for Oxygen Purification</title>

         <dc:description>
Integrating spheroidal shape&#8208;matched interactions within a MOF can fit the spherical Ar atoms well for achieving Ar&#8208;selective adsorption. The proposed approach of fabricating shape&#8208;matched interactions within a MOF in this study not only paves a promising avenue in non&#8208;polarized gas recognition and separation but also offers a solution for ready&#8208;to&#8208;use high&#8208;purity O2 production under extreme conditions.








Abstract
High&#8208;purity oxygen (O2) is essential for high&#8208;value&#8208;added applications in the medical, aerospace, and electronics sectors. The production of high&#8208;purity O2 via non&#8208;thermal&#8208;driven pressure&#8208;swing adsorption has the advantages of portable operation and low energy consumption. However, effectively removing trace amounts of argon (Ar) impurities in this process is indispensable, and it is a fundamental challenge to achieve the preferential adsorption of inert Ar atoms over polar O2 molecules instead of traditional thermodynamic or molecule sieving strategies. Herein, we have demonstrated this problem was addressed by integrating spheroidal shape&#8208;matched interactions to fit the spheroid Ar atoms while repulsing the linear O2 molecules. Using this strategy, customized TYUT&#8208;20 enables the exceptional recognition of Ar atoms over O2 molecules, demonstrating an unprecedented Ar adsorption capacity of up to 14.5 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1 and a top&#8208;performing Ar/O2 (1.54) selectivity at 298 K and 1 bar. The Ar atom recognition mechanism on this adsorbent has been investigated using Ar&#8208;loaded single crystal diffraction analysis and molecular simulation studies. The productivity of high&#8208;purity O2 (&gt;99.99%) from a 5/95 Ar/O2 mixture breakthrough experiment reached 6.6 L&#160;kg&#8722;1 under ambient conditions, which highlighted TYUT&#8208;20 as a very promising adsorbent in ready&#8208;to&#8208;use high&#8208;purity O2 production.

         <title>Controlled Growth of Oligophenylene&#8208;Structures on Graphene for Facile Secondary Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By thermal decomposition of different BPO&#8208;based peroxides with different substituents, dendrimeric oligophenylene structures with thicknesses up to 10&#160;nm have been grown on graphene in a controlled manner. These newly introduced structures provide active sites for further functionalization as they have a higher reactivity than the graphene lattice, as shown by their subsequent functionalization with bromomethyl groups. These functional oligophenylene structures can serve as a versatile platform for secondary functionalization, as shown by the introduction of azide, nitrile, and phosphonate groups. The approach presented here opens up a novel route to generate nanometer&#8208;sized graphene&#8208;based materials with tailored properties for subsequent applications.








Abstract
Functionalization of graphene derivatives is a common approach to tune material properties for use in various applications. Because of the low reactivity of the unsaturated carbon lattice of graphene, not only are few chemical approaches suitable for successful functionalization, such as those involving highly reactive in situ formed radical species or nitrene and carbene compounds, but also the degree of functionalization is usually limited, modifying only a few percent of the carbon atoms. Typically, uncontrolled side reactions such as homocoupling and oligomerization of newly introduced functional groups can occur instead of direct coupling to the carbon lattice. We want to turn this unwanted side reaction into an advantage and use intentionally formed covalent dendrimeric oligophenylene structures for secondary functionalization. We show that these oligomeric structures can be grown to specific thicknesses and used for further functionalization with bromomethyl groups at high density on the surface. This functionalization opens further avenues for subsequent nucleophilic substitution, as exemplified by the introduction of versatile azide, nitrile, and phosphonate groups. The results presented here are not only applicable to large oligophenylene structures, but also demonstrate that, in principle, single aryl moieties on graphene of any size and density can be successfully functionalized.

         <title>A Joyful Journey: Tungsten(VI) and Tungsten(V) Fluorides Meet N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes and Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first tungsten(VI) fluoride complexes coordinated with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes and cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbenes were synthesized and characterized. Reduction of these seven&#8208;coordinated complexes afforded rare octahedral tungsten(V) fluoride complexes, a dinuclear fluoride&#8208;bridged complex (cAACMe), or a seven&#8208;coordinated (cAACMe) bis&#8208;carbene complex. These d0 tungsten complexes and metal&#8208;centered d&#185; radicals expand the scope of tungsten halide chemistry and are convenient entries into tungsten fluoride chemistry in simple organic solvents.








Abstract
The first complexation of tungsten(VI) fluoride with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and a cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (cAACMe) is reported, which led to formation of the complexes [(NHC)WF6] (NHC&#160;=&#160;IiPrMe, 1; BIiPr, 2; IMes, 3; IDipp, 4; and SIDipp, 5) and [(cAACMe)WF6] 6. Solid&#8208;state structural analysis revealed distorted mono&#8208;capped trigonal prismatic geometries for 2 and 3, whereas 6 adopts a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination. Reduction of 1&#8211;6 with 0.5 equivalents of TMS&#8208;pyrMe&#8208;TMS afforded rare tungsten(V) fluoride complexes [(NHC)WF5] (NHC&#160;=&#160;IiPrMe, 7; BIiPr, 8; IMes, 9; IDipp, 10; and SIDipp, 11). Reduction of 6 with TMS&#8208;pyr&#8208;TMS yielded the dinuclear, fluoride&#8208;bridged complex [(cAACMe)WF5]2 12. Subsequent addition of a second equivalent cAACMe to 12 gave the mononuclear, seven&#8208;coordinated bis&#8208;carbene complex [(cAACMe)2WF5] 13. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and EPR spectroscopy confirm a predominantly metal&#8208;centered d&#185; radical in both 12 and 13. These findings expand the scope of tungsten fluoride chemistry by providing rare examples of tungsten(VI) and tungsten(V) complexes stabilized by soft carbon&#8208;donor ligands, paving the way for further exploration.

         <title>Phthalocyanine Grafting Strategy Induces Strong Intrinsic Electric Fields and Molecule&#8208;Edge Carrier Transport Pathways for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy for optimizing the anchoring sites of small molecular ligands is presented through the development of a molecularly functionalized layer, 4EtCz&#8208;Pc, which is characterized by a strong dipole moment and a large internal electric field. This study introduces an efficient approach for facilitating charge carrier separation.








Abstract

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction on Cobalt&#8208;Based Perovskite via Regulating Reaction Pathway Through Donation&#8208;Back&#8208;Donation Modulation</title>

The electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (eNRR) offers environmental benefits but lacks understanding of its reaction pathways, limiting efficient, low&#8208;cost catalyst design. This study raises the strategy of enhancing eNRR by tuning the reaction pathway through a &#8220;donation&#8208;back&#8208;donation&#8221; mechanism. By controlling the spin state of cobalt, perovskite SrCoO3 with a low&#8208;spin state shows 18 times higher ammonia yield than Co3O4, demonstrating the potential of low&#8208;cost catalysts for efficient ammonia production. 








Abstract
The electrocatalytic approach of combining N2 and H2O to produce ammonia, known as the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (eNRR), has garnered significant attention due to its environmental benefits and potential for supporting a decentralized agricultural economy. However, the underlying chemistry governing the reaction pathways remains poorly understood, hindering the design of low&#8208;cost and efficient eNRR catalysts. Here we report the enhancement of the electrocatalytic eNRR activity of perovskite oxides by tuning the reaction pathway through a &#8220;donation&#8208;back&#8208;donation&#8221; mechanism. This is achieved by controlling the spin state via adjusting the distribution of d orbital electrons in low&#8208;cost transition metals, such as cobalt. Specifically, the cobalt in perovskite SrCoO3 (SC) with a low&#8208;spin state demonstrates an 18 times higher ammonia yield rate compared to that in Co3O4 and 1.5 times higher than cobalt in perovskite LaCoO3 (LC). The low spin states of cobalt in SC enable better control of the eNRR reaction pathway over the transformation of *N2H to *NHNH or *NNH2, resulting in alternating hydrogenation in SC rather than distal hydrogenation in LC with a high spin state. The unprecedented improvement in eNRR by regulating the spin state of Co demonstrates the bright of low&#8208;cost Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts for ammonia production.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Allylic C&#9472;H Amination of Olefin with Nitroarenes via Intermolecular Nitroso Ene Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>

We present a practical method for synthesizing aromatic allylamines via iron&#8208;catalyzed reductive allylic amination. This approach eliminates the need for noble metals and complements existing oxidative allylic amination by tolerating oxidizable and nucleophilic functionalities.








Abstract
Aromatic allylamines are essential in the synthesis of diverse pharmaceutical building blocks. While oxidative allylic C&#9472;H amination using anilines has advanced significantly, achieving intermolecular reductive allylic C&#9472;H amination of olefins with readily available nitroarenes remains a considerable challenge. Here, we demonstrate that replacing silanes with a combination of protons and electrons enables selective reductive allylic C&#9472;H amination, avoiding the competing hydroamination pathway. The key to this transformation is the use of 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol (TFE) as the solvent. This process complements previous oxidative allylic C&#9472;H amination by eliminating the need for noble metal catalysts while tolerating oxidizable or nucleophilic functional groups. Notably, this method facilitates the functionalization of bioactive compounds, underscoring its potential in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, by leveraging its reactivity with trisubstituted olefins, this approach, when combined with metal hydride atom transfer (MHAT) reactions, offers a unique strategy for regioselective and modular difunctionalization of aliphatic olefins. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies highlight the crucial roles of TFE in stabilizing the nitrosoarene intermediate and promoting the key nitroso&#8208;ene step.

         <title>Tandem Dual&#8208;Ratiometric SERS Probe Enables Raman Imaging of Neurological pH Fluctuations in Epilepsy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a universal dendrimer&#8208;based approach, a highly sensitive tandem dual&#8208;ratiometric SERS probe with blood&#8208;brain barrier crossing ability, RHP@Au, is constructed to specifically visualize pH changes in brain disease. This sensor facilitates real&#8208;time monitoring of neuroinflammation generation and pH fluctuations in living epileptic mice.








Abstract
An imbalance of brain pH is closely associated with biochemical reactions, ion regulation, and electrical activity, serving as a hallmark for various neurological disorders. High&#8208;resolution imaging of pH fluctuations in brain disease is crucial for understanding pathological processes. However, current pH probes are inadequate for this purpose due to poor blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) penetration or insufficient specificity. Herein, we reported a tandem dual&#8208;ratiometric surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) probe, RHP@AuS, capable of crossing the BBB to address these challenges. RHP@AuS leveraged dendrimers for the facile one&#8208;step synthesis of SERS probes, significantly enhancing signal intensity and reproducibility. RHP@AuS can be sequentially activated by neuroinflammation&#8208;associated H2O2 and pH, exhibiting highly selective ratiometric responses to pH fluctuations in brain disease. Dynamic SERS imaging revealed that during neuronal epileptic activity, inflammation increased and local pH dropped sharply to around 6.6. Building on these findings, a drug combination with dual neuroinflammation&#8208;mitigating and pH&#8208;regulating properties was developed, effectively alleviating epilepsy in mouse models. This study opens new avenues for developing imaging probes for the brain and deepens our understanding of the roles of pH in neurological disorders.

         <title>Modulating Active Hydrogen Supply and O2 Adsorption: Sulfur Vacancy Matters for Boosting H2O2 Photosynthesis Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient photocatalyst of Ni doped ZnS with sulfur vacancy is designed for photocatalytic H2O2 production via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. The Ni and S dual sites with optimized O2 adsorption and efficient *Hads supply contributes to a high H2O2 yield of 5649.49 &#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under UV&#8211;vis light irradiation in pure water.








Abstract
Photocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) represents a promising approach for H2O2 production. However, the lack of photocatalysts with appropriate O2 adsorption and hydrogenation capabilities impedes the H2O2 production performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of Ni&#8208;doped ZnS hollow nanocubes with S vacancies (Ni&#8208;ZnS&#8208;Sv) as a dual&#8208;site 2e&#8722; ORR photocatalyst for efficient H2O2 production. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal the vital roles of Sv in modulating the electronic structures of Ni and S dual sites toward enhanced 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity and activity. The atomically dispersed Ni sites with electron&#8208;rich state enable a Pauling&#8208;type (end&#8208;on) O2 adsorption configuration and a modest binding strength of O2 and OOH*, largely avoiding the O&#9472;O bond cleavage. Besides, the formation of electron&#8208;deficient S sites weakens the S&#9472;Hads bond, facilitating *Hads migration to adjacent Ni sites and accelerating the hydrogenation kinetics of O2 to OOH* intermediate. As a result, the elaborately designed Ni&#8208;ZnS&#8208;Sv photocatalyst exhibits a high H2O2 yield of 5649.49 &#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under UV&#8211;vis light irradiation in pure water. Our work offers new insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis systems.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient photocatalyst of Ni doped ZnS with sulfur vacancy is designed for photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production via two-electron oxygen reduction reaction. The Ni and S dual sites with optimized O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and efficient *H&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt; supply contributes to a high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 5649.49 &#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under UV&#8211;vis light irradiation in pure water.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR) represents a promising approach for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. However, the lack of photocatalysts with appropriate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and hydrogenation capabilities impedes the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of Ni-doped ZnS hollow nanocubes with S vacancies (Ni-ZnS-Sv) as a dual-site 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR photocatalyst for efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal the vital roles of Sv in modulating the electronic structures of Ni and S dual sites toward enhanced 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR selectivity and activity. The atomically dispersed Ni sites with electron-rich state enable a Pauling-type (end-on) O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption configuration and a modest binding strength of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and OOH*, largely avoiding the O&#9472;O bond cleavage. Besides, the formation of electron-deficient S sites weakens the S&#9472;H&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt; bond, facilitating *H&lt;sub&gt;ads&lt;/sub&gt; migration to adjacent Ni sites and accelerating the hydrogenation kinetics of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to OOH* intermediate. As a result, the elaborately designed Ni-ZnS-Sv photocatalyst exhibits a high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 5649.49 &#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under UV&#8211;vis light irradiation in pure water. Our work offers new insights into the design principles of high-performance photocatalysts for artificial H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gallium&#8208;Based Eutectic Alloys as Liquid Electron Donors to Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Selective Hydrogenation of Vanillin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that gallium&#8208;based eutectic alloys enhance catalytic performance by facilitating electron spillover to atomically dispersed ruthenium sites. The as&#8208;obtained Ru1@m&#8208;tube(GaInSn) achieved nearly 100% vanillin conversion within 5&#160;h and exhibited an impressive 93.8% selectivity for vanillyl alcohol. The electron transfer shifts the catalytic pathway, improving desorption of vanillyl alcohol and inducing a performance reversal between hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation. Our approach offers a novel strategy for optimizing SAC in fine chemical industries.








Abstract
Tuning the catalytic pathways of atomically dispersed single&#8208;atom catalysts (SAC) has emerged as an effective strategy to optimize their overall catalytic activity. Herein, we present Ru1@m&#8208;tube, a hollow carbon nitride&#8208;supported Ru SAC, coated with eutectic galinstan (GaInSn), as a model catalyst, we demonstrate a performance inversion in vanillin conversion. Vanillin, as a biomass&#8208;derived compound with industrial relevance, presents challenges in catalytic hydrogenation, making it an ideal model reaction to test and compare the catalyst's selectivity and efficiency. The as&#8208;obtained Ru1@m&#8208;tube(GaInSn) achieved nearly 100% vanillin conversion within 5&#160;h and exhibited an impressive 93.8% selectivity for vanillyl alcohol. Electron spillover from gallium&#8208;based eutectic alloys to highly diluted ruthenium sites enhances the desorption of vanillyl alcohol, resulting in an exceptional performance shift between hydrogenation and hydrodeoxygenation. Our findings not only offer a novel approach for modulating SAC performance via liquid&#8211;metal interfaces but also expand the understanding of promoter screening for various challenging reactions.

         <title>Annulated Radical Cations with a C4E2&#8208;Core (E&#160;=&#160;P, As, Sb): Stable Pnictogen Analogs of Elusive Aryl Radical Anions of Birch Reduction Reactions</title>

One&#8208;electron (1e&#8208;) oxidations of the base&#8208;stabilized cyclic bis&#8208;pnictinidene compounds 1&#8208;E afford the 7&#960;&#8208;electron C4E2&#8208;ring&#8208;containing radical cations [2&#8208;E]&#9679;+, which are valence isoelectronic to the benzene radical anion [C6H6]&#9679;&#8722; of the Birch reduction reactions. Further, 1e&#8208;oxidations of [2&#8208;E]&#9679;+ give the dications [3&#8208;E]2+, while reactions with TEMPO (or Ph2Se2) yield the corresponding diamagnetic monocations.








Abstract
The benzene radical anion (C6H6)&#9679;&#8722;, possessing a 7&#960;&#8208;electron count, is a crucial intermediate in the Birch reduction and has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. Herein, we report the tricyclic pnictogen radical cations [(ADC)E]2[B], [2&#8208;E][B] (ADC&#160;=&#160;PhC{N(Dipp)C}2; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; E&#160;=&#160;P, As, Sb; [B] = [B1] = B(C6F5)4 or [B2] = {3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}) featuring a central 7&#960;&#8208;electron planar C4E2 ring embedded between two 1,3&#8208;imidazole&#8208;based anionic dicarbene (ADC) frameworks, as crystalline solids. [2&#8208;E][B] are prepared by one&#8208;electron (1e) oxidations of the corresponding base&#8208;stabilized cyclic bis&#8208;pnictinidene compounds [(ADC)E]2 (1&#8208;E). Calculated spin densities (for E&#160;=&#160;P 76%, As 80%, Sb 88%) and EPR measurements suggest that [2&#8208;E]&#9679;+ are pnictogen&#8208;centered radicals and stabilized by the delocalization of the unpaired electron over the C4E2 ring. The EPR spectra of [2&#8208;E][B] exhibit characteristic signals for S = &#189; systems with clear hyperfine coupling constants for the two similar P, As, or Sb nuclei. Further 1e&#8208;oxidations of [2&#8208;E][B] result in the dicationic 6&#960;&#8208;electron C4E2&#8208;species [(ADC)E]2[B]2 [3&#8208;E][B]2, which readily undergo comproportionations with 1&#8208;E to afford [2&#8208;E][B]. The radical reactivity of [2&#8208;E][B2] is shown with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) and diphenyl diselenide (PhSeSePh) in yielding compounds [(ADC)2E{E(TEMPO)}][B2] (4&#8208;E) (E&#160;=&#160;P, Sb) and [(ADC)2P{P(SePh)}][B2] (5&#8208;P), respectively.

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of Interactions Between Hydrophobic Tag&#8208;Conjugated DNA Nanoprobes and Cell Membrane Facilitates ATP Imaging in the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a conformational switching&#8208;based strategy was developed for dynamically modulate interactions between hydrophobic tag&#8208;conjugated DNA nanoprobes (HT&#8208;DNPs) and cell membrane, enabling selective and efficient functionalization of target cells with HT&#8208;DNPs. The constructed HT&#8208;DNPs could be selectively anchored to target cells or accumulated in the tumor microenvironment (TME) for specific ATP imaging.








Abstract
Conjugating hydrophobic tags to oligonucleotides facilitates the swift and efficient creation of membrane&#8208;anchored DNA nanoprobes. However, the membrane&#8208;anchoring of these hydrophobic tag&#8208;conjugated DNA nanoprobes (HT&#8208;DNPs) lacks specificity among different cell types. To address this challenge, we herein report a conformational switching&#8208;based strategy for selectively anchoring HT&#8208;DNPs to target cells. In our design, HT&#8208;DNPs with extended or compact conformations possess weak or strong interactions with cell membrane, respectively. Thus, interactions between HT&#8208;DNPs and cell membrane can be dynamically controlled by altering the conformation of HT&#8208;DNPs. Initially, the extended HT&#8208;DNPs exhibit poor membrane&#8208;anchoring ability that is impute to their weak hydrophobic interactions with cell membrane. However, in slightly acidic conditions, HT&#8208;DNPs intercalated with DNA i&#8208;motif&#8208;forming sequences can fold into a compact conformation and exhibit strong hydrophobicity, thus achieving selective and efficient anchoring of HT&#8208;DNPs to target cells in such environments. Utilizing this method, we constructed HT&#8208;DNPs for imaging of ATP in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our results indicate that these HT&#8208;DNPs can effectively accumulate at tumor sites for specific ATP imaging following intravenous injection. This strategy paves new avenues for the selective and efficient functionalization of target cells with various membrane&#8208;anchored DNA nanostructures, including DNA nanoprobes, DNA nanocircuits, and DNA nanomachines.

In our design, HT-DNPs with extended or compact conformations possess weak or strong interactions with cell membrane, respectively. Thus, interactions between HT-DNPs and cell membrane can be dynamically controlled by altering the conformation of HT-DNPs. Initially, the extended HT-DNPs exhibit poor membrane-anchoring ability that is impute to their weak hydrophobic interactions with cell membrane. However, in slightly acidic conditions, HT-DNPs intercalated with DNA i-motif-forming sequences can fold into a compact conformation and exhibit strong hydrophobicity, thus achieving selective and efficient anchoring of HT-DNPs to target cells in such environments. Utilizing this method, we constructed HT-DNPs for imaging of ATP in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our results indicate that these HT-DNPs can effectively accumulate at tumor sites for specific ATP imaging following intravenous injection. This strategy paves new avenues for the selective and efficient functionalization of target cells with various membrane-anchored DNA nanostructures, including DNA nanoprobes, DNA nanocircuits, and DNA nanomachines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Dactyloquinone A and Spiroetherone A via a Metal&#8208;Hydride Hydrogen Atom Transfer (MHAT) Process and a Quinol&#8211;Enedione Rearrangement</title>

         <dc:description>
Total syntheses of the meroterpenoid quinones dactyloquinone A and spiroetherone A were achieved from a common intermediate through the following original key steps: a metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) process with a quinone monoacetal in the case of dactyloquinone A, and a quinol&#8211;enedione rearrangement in the case of spiroetherone A.








Abstract
We report the total synthesis of dactyloquinone A and spiroetherone A from a meroterpenoid scaffold obtained by the deconjugative alkylation of a Wieland&#8211;Miescher type ketone. For dactyloquinone A, we employed an intramolecular hydrofunctionalisation of the internal trisubstituted alkene with a quinone monoacetal via a metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) process to form the key C&#9472;O bond. For spiroetherone A, we relied on a stereospecific quinol&#8211;spiroenedione rearrangement. The initially postulated structure of spiroetherone A was first synthesized, but was found to be different from the natural product. Finally, spiroetherone A was shown to be epimeric at the spirocyclic carbon. This finding was confirmed by total synthesis involving epimerization of the spirocycle via a late&#8208;stage singlet oxygen [4+2] cycloaddition to a cyclohexadiene derived from the initial enedione.

         <title>Catalytically Active Coacervates Sustained Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our findings demonstrate that simple building blocks can access active condensates by exploiting their own catalytic prowess that eventually helps in the realization of an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium spatially confined state under open conditions. The active system, which catalyzes a metabolically relevant C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming reaction, conceptually foreshadows strategies for developing synthetic cells and also suggests their possible candidacy as the earliest protocells.








Abstract
Metabolically active membraneless organelles of extant biology have the capability to maintain their structure under nonequilibrium conditions by leveraging chemical reactions. Herein, we report active coacervates accessed via a mixture of minimal building blocks that featured &#960;&#8208;electron rich short peptide, positively charged aldehyde, and a cyclic ketone under nonequilibrium conditions. Peptide bound with the aldehyde by a dynamic covalent bond and demixed to form coacervates through hydrophobic interactions. Importantly, the short&#8208;peptide could utilize its free amine (&#946;&#8208;alanine) to catalyze C&#9472;C bond formation which eventually led to the depletion of one of the building blocks (aldehyde) via aldol reaction; an intrinsic catalytic role that helped the coacervate to suppress coalescence. Notably, under continuous additions (open system) of the depleting precursors, the active coacervates were able to demonstrate spatial stability for longer duration. This out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium behavior of phase separated droplets in presence of flux of building blocks is reminiscent of the active membraneless organelles seen in contemporary biochemistry.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization Enables Access to High&#8208;Performance Aliphatic&#8208;Aromatic Polyamides with Chemical Recyclability</title>

         <dc:description>
To address these key challenges faced in PA6 chemistry, we aimed to prepare a new class of benzo&#8208;fused caprolactams bearing various substituents (BLMR) as monomers. The robust polymerization of these monomers furnished a series of semiaromatic polyamides P(BLMR) with improved water resistance, transparency, and chemical recyclability.








Abstract
Although polyamides (PAs) have served as one of the most important engineering thermoplastics, it remains a long&#8208;standing challenge for chemical recycling of PAs to monomers. Herein, we report a facile approach to construct a series of benzo&#8208;fused caprolactams with various functionalities (BLMR). These BLMR monomers underwent robust and well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization to afford P(BLMR) products with high thermal stability, enhanced water resistance, and tunable mechanical properties. Impressively, chemical recycling of P(BLMR) to monomer could be accomplished with excellent efficiency in dilute solution at 100&#8722;150 &#176;C with a mixed catalyst of t&#8208;BuOK and La[N(SiMe3)2]3, thus establishing a closed&#8208;loop circularity. The precise control of the polymerization and the recyclability of these semiaromatic polyamides promote a sustainable circular economy while offering the potential to access high&#8208;performance materials with tunable thermal and mechanical properties and enhanced water resistance.

         <title>Flow Battery with Remarkably Stable Performance at High Current Density: Development of A Nonfluorinated Separator with Concurrent Rejection and Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic redox flow batteries are promising for grid stabilisation, but the insufficient ion separation by membrane separator can limit the lifetime and increase the cost. Here, we present an ultra&#8208;ion&#8208;selective SPEEK&#8208;SX membrane, it enables 600 cycles at 160&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with only 0.00935% per cycle capacity decay, outperforming Nafion&#8208;212, offering a fluorine&#8208;free alternative.








Abstract
Redox flow batteries show promise for large&#8208;scale grid stabilisation. Of these, organic redox flow batteries (ORFBs) harbour the potential for sustainable and economic operation due to the materials deployed. Their long&#8208;term operation requires exquisite transport control of species across the cell, with movement of cations key for high current density, and anionic rejection needed for cycling stability. Nafion, although promising as a commercial separator, faces cost and sustainability limitations due to its fluorinated nature and per&#8208; and polyfluroralkyl substances (PFAS) generation. Here, we report the tailored combination of a hydrophilic mixed&#8208;matrix membrane, SPEEK&#8208;SX, with sulphonated polydichloroxylene (Sp&#8208;DCX) as the additive and sulphonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) as the matrix. Compared to Nafion&#8208;212, the dense aromatic backbone of SPEEK efficiently rejected the crossover of electrolytes, with sulfonate groups housed within Sp&#8208;DCX micropores increasing Na+ mobility. SPEEK&#8208;SX2 exhibited 190 times higher Na+/ Fe(CN)64&#8722; selectivity and 6 times higher Na+/ 2,6&#8208;DHAQ2&#8722; selectivity compared to Nafion&#8208;212. This enabled stable operation for 600 cycles at a high current density of 160&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with only 0.00935% per cycle capacity decay. In contrast, the SPEEK membrane exhibited 0.07% per cycle decay, whereas Nafion&#8208;212 failed to run at this high current density.

         <title>Reverse Regioselective Dicarbofunctionalization via Anti&#8208;Michael&#8208;Type Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reverse regioselective dicarbofunctionalization of acrylamides via anti&#8208;Michael&#8208;type addition is reported. Various (hetero)arene nucleophiles and carbon electrophiles were incorporated in a manner opposite to conventional regioselectivity. A key feature of this reaction is the formation of an alkylpalladium intermediate, which enables the achievement of the uncommon regioselectivity.








Abstract
Vicinal dicarbofunctionalization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is a classical yet versatile method for constructing complex molecular architectures in a single step. However, the regioselectivity is typically governed by the electronic properties of the alkene moiety, leading to the introduction of a nucleophile at the &#946;&#8208;position and an electrophile at the &#945;&#8208;position. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed dicarbofunctionalization of acrylamides via anti&#8208;Michael&#8208;type addition, achieving reverse regioselectivity relative to traditional approaches. This strategy enables the efficient incorporation of various (hetero)arene nucleophiles at the &#945;&#8208;position and carbon electrophiles, including iodoarenes, vinyl iodides, and iodomethane, at the &#946;&#8208;position to furnish dicarbofunctionalized amides in good yields. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the reaction proceeds through an alkylpalladium intermediate formed via the &#945;&#8208;addition of a nucleophile.

         <title>Boosting Hydrogenation of CO2 Using Cationic Cu Atomically Dispersed on 2D &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring cationic Cu atomically dispersed on &#947;&#8208;Al&#8322;O&#8323; nanosheets has been developed, demonstrating exceptional thermal stability and catalytic activity for CO&#8322; hydrogenation. Compared to traditional Cu/ZnO/Al&#8322;O&#8323; systems, this catalyst achieves higher methanol (CH3OH) and dimethyl ether (DME) production rates, driven by the unique substitution of Cu for pentacoordinated Al sites. This innovative design enhances H&#8322; activation and methanol synthesis, offering new insights into single&#8208;atom catalysis for sustainable CO&#8322; utilization.








Abstract
The continuous development of novel catalytic approaches is crucial for advancing efficient CO2 hydrogenation processes. Drawing inspiration from single&#8208;atom catalysis and 2D materials, we designed a new 2D single&#8208;atom catalyst with excellent thermal stability by thermally treating Cu&#8208;adsorbed &#947;&#8208;AlOOH nanosheets, which yielded a Cu/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst with high activity in the hydrogenation of CO2&#8208;yielding methanol (CH3OH), dimethyl ether (DME), and CO as products. The active Cu sites are monodispersed and highly stable due to their cationic oxidation state and their substitution for pentacoordinated aluminum (AlP) sites on particle surfaces. This study demonstrates an efficient approach for achieving a high CO2 hydrogenation rate (30.45&#160;mol mol&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) using a catalyst system that lacks metallic Cu centers, traditionally considered essential for H&#8322; dissociation, and employs what was previously thought to be an inert metal oxide (&#947;&#8208;Al2O3) for CO and CH3OH production. Ongoing mechanistic studies aim to elucidate the synergy between cationic Cu single atoms and &#947;&#8208;Al2O3, a Lewis acid support, in facilitating hydrogen (H2) activation and methanol formation.

         <title>Constructing Large&#8208;Area Oriented Covalent Organic Framework Based PN Heterostructure Films to Enhance Artificial Photosynthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose for the first time the concept of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid oriented PN heterostructured films to modulate the photocatalytic performance by constructing COF&#8208;based PN heterostructured films, and our mechanistic studies confirm that oriented TAPB&#8208;DMTA COFs based on thin films of PN heterostructures can provide the driving force to enhance the separation efficiency and transport kinetics of photogenerated carriers, thereby greatly improving the photocatalytic activity. 








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) films exhibit enormous application potential in the photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), however, they suffer from various photogenerated electron&#8208;hole recombination. Herein, we first report a new strategy of in situ constructing oriented COF&#8208;based PN heterostructure film through single&#8208;layer MoS2 induced growth, significantly enhancing the photogenerated carrier separation efficiency, which promotes the photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis. Experimental results reveal that the as&#8208;made oriented TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF/MoS2 (TAPB: 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl) benzene, DMTA: 2,5&#8208;Dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde) film exhibits a high photocatalytic H2O2 yield of 8154 &#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is &#8764;2.5 times and &#8764;4 times higher than that of non&#8208;oriented TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF films and powder. The mechanism reveals that the oriented structure of the TAPB&#8208;DMTA COF can significantly promote the generation and the transmission of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs along the skeleton and layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking direction, thus enhancing the photocatalytic H2O2 performance. The new strategy of in situ constructing oriented COFs&#8208;based PN heterostructure film for enhancing the photosynthesis of H2O2 will open the door to rational design of molecular films towards high photogenerated carrier separation efficiency.

         <title>Wearing Gigantic Silver Armor on Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Containing Polyoxometalates: Formation of Supertetrahedral Intercluster Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthetic approach has been developed to construct three TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic closed Ag clusters, which can form interesting supertetrahedral intercluster packing structures and exhibit photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. 








Abstract
Compared to versatile polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;templated Ag clusters, the construction of closed Ag clusters using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;containing polyoxometalates (TMCPOMs) as anionic templates has, to our knowledge, never been reported. In this work, we have synthesized three TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic closed Ag clusters, [{(Co0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(SiW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[SiW12O40]2&#183;10CH3CN (1), [{(Cu0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(SiW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[SiW12O40]2 (2), and [{(Co0.58W0.42)3(OH)3(Ag0.5O3)(GeW9O34)}4@Ag114Br4(tBuC&#8801;C)72]&#183;[GeW12O40]2 (3), using a universal one&#8208;pot solvothermal synthetic approach. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses demonstrate that the high&#8208;nuclearity transition metal&#8208;containing (M&#160;=&#160;Co/Cu) POMs with idealized Td symmetry are closely covered by gigantic Ag armors, representing the largest TMCPOM&#8208;templated closed Ag clusters to date. Moreover, compounds 1&#8722;3 can form interesting supertetrahedral intercluster packing structures through Columbic and hydrogen bonding interactions between the cationic TMCPOM&#8208;templated gigantic {Ag114} clusters and the counter [XW12O40]4&#8722; (X&#160;=&#160;Si/Ge) anions. Upon light irradiation, all three compounds exhibited decent photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity, which is dependent on their different electronic structures.

         <title>Proteome&#8208;Wide Data Guides the Discovery of Lysine&#8208;Targeting Covalent Inhibitors Using DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work adopts the ABPP&#8208;CoDEL strategy to develop a selection platform for lysine&#8208;targeting covalent inhibitors. The platform integrates proteome&#8208;wide lysine data to select potential targets, and utilizes CoDELs featuring diverse warheads, facilitating the discovery of a series of lysine&#8208;targeting covalent inhibitors, covering photo&#8208;covalent, reversible covalent, and irreversible covalent reaction mechanisms. 








Abstract
Broadening the application of covalent inhibitors requires the exploration of nucleophilic residues beyond cysteine. The covalent DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (CoDEL) represents an advanced technology for covalent drug discovery. However, its application in lysine&#8208;targeting inhibitors remains uncharted territory. Here, we report the utilization of CoDEL selection guided by proteome&#8208;wide data to identify lysine&#8208;targeting covalent inhibitors. A comprehensive assessment of activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) data on lysine distribution and ligandability reveals potential targets for selective covalent inhibition, including phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), bromodomain (BRD) family proteins, and ubiquitin&#8208;conjugating enzyme E2 N (UBE2N). The 10.7&#8208;million&#8208;member CoDELs, featuring diverse lysine&#8208;reactive warheads, enable the discovery of a series of covalent inhibitors, covering photo&#8208;covalent, reversible covalent, and irreversible covalent reaction mechanisms. In&#8208;depth characterization of binding sites and modes of action provides structural and functional insights. Notably, irreversible covalent inhibitors unveil a novel mechanism for regulating UBE2N&#8208;mediated ubiquitination by modulating the conformation of the protein complex. Our work adopts the ABPP&#8208;CoDEL strategy, offering an efficient and versatile selection method for the development of covalent inhibitors targeting functional lysines.

         <title>Accelerated Oxide&#8208;Zeolite Catalyst Design for Syngas Conversion by Reaction Phase Diagram Analysis and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxide&#8208;zeolite (OXZEO) catalysis provides an approach for the direct syngas&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (STO) conversion, with oxides generating intermediates and zeolites catalyzing light olefin formation. Enhancing oxide activity remains a key challenge. We combined DFT calculations, reaction networks, reaction phase diagram (RPD) analysis, and machine learning (ML) to predict high&#8208;performance catalysts. The results align with experiments, accelerating catalyst screening, and offering a versatile strategy for catalyst discovery.








Abstract
Oxide&#8208;zeolite (OXZEO) catalyst design concept provides an alternative approach for the direct syngas&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (STO) with superior selectivity. Enhancing the activity of oxide components remains a critical and long&#8208;pursued target in this field. However, rational design strategies for optimizing oxides and improving the catalyst performance in such complex reaction networks are still lacking. We employed energetic descriptors such as the adsorption energies of CO* and O* (GadCO* and GadO*) through reaction phase diagram (RPD) analysis to predict the catalyst performance. The prediction was initially validated by the catalytic activity trends measured by experiments. Machine learning (ML) was further utilized to accelerate the screening of new catalysts. Ultimately, Bi&#8208;doped and Sb&#8208;doped ZnCrOx were theoretically predicted as optimized oxide candidates for the OXZEO reaction, which was experimentally verified to be more active than the currently best ZnCrOx counterpart. This work demonstrated enhanced OXZEO catalysts for STO as well as a research paradigm integrating theory and experiment to optimize bifunctional catalysts for complex reaction networks.

         <title>Achieving High Fill Factor via Increasing Interfacial Disorder to Inhibit Bimolecular Recombination for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule, CNDT, is introduced into the active layer and increases the disorder of electron donor/acceptor interfaces. It enhances the energy of the charge transfer state and leads to an uphill energy barrier for bimolecular recombination, reduces charge recombination rate/ratio and inhibits bimolecular recombination in OSCs. Therefore, D18:L8&#8208;BO based OSCs featuring CNDT achieve arecord fill factor of 83.17% and an impressive PCE of 19.80%.








Abstract
The inferior fill factor (FF) is one of main reasons impeding further improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). But no theoretical framework for high FFs has been established yet. Herein, an efficient strategy is developed to enhance FFs via introducing a small molecule, CNDT, into active layer. CNDT increases the electron donor/acceptor interface disorder, raises the energy barrier for charge back transfer, and thus reduces bimolecular recombination rate constant (krec). We show that CNDTs distribute across electron donor/acceptor interfaces of D18:Y6+, disturbe the molecular stacking of Y6, lead to a more disordered interfaces, while maintaining higher crystal quality compared to D18:Y6. This disorder, along with a higher energy of charge transfer states magnifies the energy barrier for charge recombination, decreases charge recombination rate/ratio, reduces krec, and inhibits bimolecular recombination in devices. Therefore, FFs of OSCs are improved from 75.78% (D18:Y6) to 81.13% (D18:Y6+), yielding a higher PCE of 19.45%. Moreover, D18:L8&#8208;BO+ based OSCs feature FFs over 83%, a record for OSCs so far, with PCEs reaching 19.80%. This work demonstrates that increasing interface disorder, without sacrificing crystal quality, enhances energy barriers of charge recombination and inhibits bimolecular recombination to efficiently improve FFs for higher PCEs.

         <title>Non&#8208;Precious Metal Catalysts with Gradient Oxidative Dual Sites Boost Bimolecular Activation for Catalytic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering highly active dual sites enhances catalytic oxidation reactions by optimizing bimolecular activation. By immobilizing Cu2+ on NO3&#8315;&#8208;grafted TiO2 and applying thermal treatment, Ti&#8208;doped CuO is successfully synthesized on a TiO2 support. This catalyst, featuring gradient oxidative Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti/Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Cu dual sites, shows strong potential for low&#8208;temperature catalytic removal of NH&#8323; and various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for environmental applications.








Abstract
Catalytic oxidation emerges as a highly promising and cost&#8208;effective approach for eliminating gaseous pollutants, greenhouse gases, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from industrial exhaust streams. However, achieving the simultaneous activation of O2 and substrate molecules at low temperatures using non&#8208;precious metal catalysts remains a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce gradient oxidative Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti/Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Cu dual sites that enhance bimolecular activation for catalytic oxidation reactions. The catalyst, Ti&#8208;doped CuO, is synthesized on a TiO2 support through the immobilization of Cu2&#8314; on NO3&#8315;&#8208;grafted TiO2, followed by thermal treatment. The resulting gradient oxidative Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti/Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Cu sites exhibit exceptional catalytic oxidation activity for NH3 and various VOCs at low temperatures, matching the performance of precious metal&#8208;based catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Engineering highly active dual sites enhances catalytic oxidation reactions by optimizing bimolecular activation. By immobilizing Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; on NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8315;-grafted TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and applying thermal treatment, Ti-doped CuO is successfully synthesized on a TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; support. This catalyst, featuring gradient oxidative Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti/Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Cu dual sites, shows strong potential for low-temperature catalytic removal of NH&#8323; and various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for environmental applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic oxidation emerges as a highly promising and cost-effective approach for eliminating gaseous pollutants, greenhouse gases, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from industrial exhaust streams. However, achieving the simultaneous activation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and substrate molecules at low temperatures using non-precious metal catalysts remains a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce gradient oxidative Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti/Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Cu dual sites that enhance bimolecular activation for catalytic oxidation reactions. The catalyst, Ti-doped CuO, is synthesized on a TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; support through the immobilization of Cu&lt;sup&gt;2&#8314;&lt;/sup&gt; on NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8315;-grafted TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, followed by thermal treatment. The resulting gradient oxidative Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti/Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Cu sites exhibit exceptional catalytic oxidation activity for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and various VOCs at low temperatures, matching the performance of precious metal-based catalysts. Notably, during NH&#8323; oxidation, Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti sites enhance the activation of both O&#8322; and NH&#8323;. HNO intermediates formed on Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Ti sites react with NH intermediates on neighboring Cu&#9472;O&#9472;Cu sites&#8212;producing N&#8322; and H&#8322;O via an imide mechanism&#8212;which effectively lowers the reaction barrier for catalytic NH&#8323; oxidation.

         <title>Extending Frontier Molecular Orbitals Delocalization via Donor Fusion: Construct Long&#8208;Wavelength Twisted Multiple Resonance Emitters with Efficient Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general donor fusion strategy is proposed to extend frontier molecular orbital delocalization to construct long&#8208;wavelength narrowband emitters. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecules, BN&#8208;PhAzCz and BN&#8208;tCzAzPh, are constructed. BN&#8208;PhAzCz achieves the best device performances, exhibiting green emission at 528&#160;nm with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.69), maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 38.2%, and efficiency roll&#8208;off of 28.0% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are promising candidates for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) displays. Here, we propose a general strategy for post&#8208;functionalizing MR core, introducing donors on the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) position via Suzuki coupling and then fusing the donors to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) position via Scholl cyclization, which can extend frontier molecular orbitals delocalization to construct long&#8208;wavelength narrowband emitters. Two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecules, BN&#8208;PhAzCz and BN&#8208;tCzAzPh, are constructed, achieving large spectral red&#8208;shifts while maintaining narrowband emission. The distorted configuration resulting from the hetero[6]helicene structure introduces twisted &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transition, which effectively enhances spinorbit coupling, ultimately enabling molecule BN&#8208;PhAzCz to achieve a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC = 6.4 &#215; 104 s&#8722;1). BN&#8208;PhAzCz&#8208;based single&#8208;host OLED exhibits green emission at 528 nm with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.69) and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 38.2% with efficiency roll&#8208;off of 28.0% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 under 5 wt% doping concentration. Even at 20 wt% doping concentration, the maximum EQE remains at 29.6% with little change in the spectral profile.

         <title>Suppressing Dendrite Growth by Dolosse&#8208;Structured ZIF&#8208;67 Polycrystalline Membranes Through Eliminating Interfacial Electrolyte Turbulence on Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the dolosse structures on coastlines to reduce the impact of waves, a MOF polycrystalline membrane with macro&#8208;microporous was constructed on the Zn foil. The dolosse&#8208;like structure effectively eliminates turbulence at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, enabling Zn2+ to deposit in a stable electrolyte environment. This reduces the secondary nucleation rate of Zn and inhibits dendrite growth.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are considered a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, but the Zn dendrite problem limits their practical application potential. Although existing solutions, such as electrolyte additives and electrode coatings, can effectively address this issue, but almost all these solutions are based on a static electrolyte model and overlook the relationship between electrolyte flow and dendrite growth. Herein, inspired by the principle of dolosse to reduce the impact of waves on coastlines, we utilized the epitaxial growth characteristics of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to construct a ZIF&#8208;67 polycrystalline membrane with macro&#8208;microporous on Zn foil (D&#8208;67M@Zn). The dolosse&#8208;like structure of the membrane effectively eliminates turbulence at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, enabling Zn2+ to deposit in a stable electrolyte environment, reducing the secondary nucleation rate of Zn, and inhibiting dendrite growth. The macro&#8208;microporous skeleton also helps regulate the morphology of Zn deposition, as confirmed by fluid dynamics analysis and AC&#8208;STEM. Benefiting from the unique properties of D&#8208;67M, both symmetric cells and full cells based on the D&#8208;67M@Zn anode exhibit impressive cycling stability.

         <title>Deciphering Complex Electrochemical Reaction Dynamics and Interactions of Single Nanoentities via Evanescent Scattering Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present electrochemical evanescent scattering microscopy (EC&#8208;ESM), a label&#8208;free imaging technique with high spatial resolution, surface sensitivity, and throughput. EC&#8208;ESM enables direct visualization of single silver nanoparticle and nanowire dissolution on ITO electrodes, providing detailed insights into nanoscale motion, interfacial interactions, and electron transfer dynamics. 








Abstract
Electrochemical reactions at the nanoscale are governed by intricate surface interactions, yet existing imaging techniques often lack the surface sensitivity and throughput needed to resolve these dynamics clearly. Here, we introduce electrochemical evanescent scattering microscopy (EC&#8208;ESM), a high&#8208;throughput, surface&#8208;sensitive imaging technique that enables real&#8208;time tracking of single&#8208;nanoentity electrochemistry with high resolution. Using EC&#8208;ESM, we monitored the motion and dissolution dynamics of silver nanoparticles and identified a clear relationship between nanoparticle velocity and electron transfer rates. The high throughput of EC&#8208;ESM not only ensures statistical reliability but also allows the detection of rare electron transfer events in molecularly modified AgNPs. Additionally, EC&#8208;ESM's high resolution enabled direct imaging of both single and interacting silver nanowires, revealing diverse dissolution behaviors that provide insights into structural and surface properties. We envision EC&#8208;ESM as a powerful platform for advancing nanoscale electrochemical research and interfacial charge transfer studies.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Degradation Mechanism of Fluorinated Pollutants Using a Bilayer WO3 Photoanode: Synergistic Role of Holes and Hydroxyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a bilayer WO&#8323; photoelectrode with an electron transport layer and a heterophase junction, enabling efficient PEC degradation of fluorinated pollutants. The ETL&#8208;heterophase junction enhances charge separation, accelerates electron extraction, and suppresses charge recombination, enabling activation of fluorinated pollutants by h&#8314;, promoting C&#9472;F bond cleavage by &#8729;OH, and facilitating the degradation process.








Abstract
Fluorinated organic pollutants pose significant environmental and health risks due to the high stability of C&#9472;F bonds, necessitating effective strategies for their degradation. Herein, we present a bilayer WO3 photoelectrode (double&#8208;WO3) incorporating an electron transport layer (ETL) and a hexagonal&#8208;monoclinic heterophase junction for PEC degradation of fluorinated pollutants. The double&#8208;WO&#8323; catalyst achieves a high photocurrent density (4.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.2 VRHE) and nearly complete degradation (99.9%) of bisphenol AF (BPAF), 4&#8208;fluorophenol (4&#8208;FP), and pentafluorophenol (PFP), with 99.9% mineralization of PFP. Experimental and transient photocurrent (TPC) analyses confirm that the ETL&#8208;heterophase junction structure enhances electron extraction and surface reaction kinetics while minimizing electron&#8208;hole recombination. In this process, photogenerated h&#8314; excites fluorinated pollutants, enhancing C&#9472;F bond susceptibility to &#8729;OH attack, which facilitates bond cleavage and subsequent oxidation into CO2, H2O, and F&#8722;. This study offers a promising strategy for designing advanced PEC systems and effectively remediating persistent fluorinated contaminants.

The ETL-heterophase junction enhances charge separation, accelerates electron extraction, and suppresses charge recombination, enabling activation of fluorinated pollutants by h&#8314;, promoting C&#9472;F bond cleavage by &#8729;OH, and facilitating the degradation process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorinated organic pollutants pose significant environmental and health risks due to the high stability of C&#9472;F bonds, necessitating effective strategies for their degradation. Herein, we present a bilayer WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photoelectrode (double-WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) incorporating an electron transport layer (ETL) and a hexagonal-monoclinic heterophase junction for PEC degradation of fluorinated pollutants. The double-WO&#8323; catalyst achieves a high photocurrent density (4.3&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.2 V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;) and nearly complete degradation (99.9%) of bisphenol AF (BPAF), 4-fluorophenol (4-FP), and pentafluorophenol (PFP), with 99.9% mineralization of PFP. Experimental and transient photocurrent (TPC) analyses confirm that the ETL-heterophase junction structure enhances electron extraction and surface reaction kinetics while minimizing electron-hole recombination. In this process, photogenerated h&#8314; excites fluorinated pollutants, enhancing C&#9472;F bond susceptibility to &#8729;OH attack, which facilitates bond cleavage and subsequent oxidation into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. This study offers a promising strategy for designing advanced PEC systems and effectively remediating persistent fluorinated contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stepwise Crystallization Synthetic Strategy for Monodisperse InSb Colloidal Quantum Dots with Mid&#8208;Infrared Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stepwise crystallization synthetic strategy for monodisperse InSb colloidal QDs with mid&#8208;infrared absorption is proposed, generating QDs with unprecedented 5.8&#8211;22.2&#160;nm size range and a remarkably low size distribution deviation of 5.8% without the need of any size&#8208;selective precipitation. For the first time, InSb QDs with absorption wavelength extending 3000&#160;nm have been realized, a record among environmental&#8208;friendly QDs.








Abstract
Colloidal InSb quantum dots (QDs) are promising mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) photodetection materials due to their suitable bandgap, unparalleled room temperature electronic properties, environmental&#8208;friendly elemental composition, and facile solution processability. However, current InSb QDs suffer from limited spectral absorption within 2&#160;&#181;m, polydisperse QDs populations, and complex size&#8208;selective precipitation for further use, due to the lack of applicable growth theory and synthetic method. Here, we present a novel synthetic strategy for InSb QDs, which is featured by the initial formation of an amorphous intermediate and a subsequent stepwise crystallization process. This strategy enables the achievement of monodisperse InSb QDs with unprecedented 5.8&#8211;22.2&#160;nm size range, and a remarkably low size distribution deviation of 5.8% without the need of any size&#8208;selective precipitation. For the first time, we realize the synthesis of InSb QDs with absorption wavelength exceeding 3000&#160;nm, the record among the environmental&#8208;friendly QDs. The results presented here will pave the way toward environmental&#8208;friendly QDs as outstanding infrared optical and optoelectronic materials and push the frontier of solution&#8208;processed QDs into the mid&#8208;infrared regime applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide Enabled by Tri&#8208;Coordinated Cobalt Sites in Silicate&#8208;1 Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon&#8208;free electrocatalyst based on embedding Co sites into silicate&#8208;1 zeolite exhibits exceptional 2e&#8722; ORR performance. The aligned microporosity of silicate&#8208;1 zeolite isolates Co sites to derive a specific tri&#8208;coordination unit of Co(OSi)3 moiety. Such a moiety facilitates O2 chemisorption while it holds moderate bonding with *OOH intermediates to reduce the whole barrier of H2O2 formation. It achieves a high yield of 11.56&#160;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via metal&#8208;catalyzed two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) emerges as a sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone method. However, metal catalysts are commonly supported by graphitic carbon that is susceptible to being oxidized by reactive oxygen species generated in ORR and have limited oxygen capacities. Here, we report a silica&#8208;based electrocatalyst embedding cobalt (Co) sites into silicate&#8208;1 (S&#8208;1) zeolite, which exhibited exceptional 2e&#8722; ORR performance. The aligned microporosity of S&#8208;1 zeolite highly isolated Co sites to derive a specific tri&#8208;coordination unit of Co(OSi)3 moiety. The nanochannels of S&#8208;1 zeolite further provide robust and substantial reaction spaces, where the Co(OSi)3 moiety facilitates O2 chemisorption and holds moderate bonding with *OOH intermediates to reduce the barrier of H2O2 formation. It achieved high Faradaic efficiency over 96% and a steady yield of 11.56&#160;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in a gas diffusion electrode setup. This work provides a novel insight into 2e&#8722; ORR on Co sites and highlights the potential of zeolite&#8208;based materials for electrochemical applications.

         <title>A Hypoxia&#8208;Triggered Bioreduction of Hydrophilic Type I Photosensitizer for Switchable In Vivo Photoacoustic Imaging and High&#8208;Specificity Cancer Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrophilic type I phototherapeutic agent (NanoPcN8O) was developed which selectively responded to hypoxic tumor microenvironments and switched on type I photodynamic and photothermal effects as well as a photoacoustic signal for activatable photoacoustic imaging and tumor phototherapy. This phototherapeutic agent achieved a notable therapeutic effect with high biosafety. 








Abstract
Considering that hypoxia is strongly connected with tumor proliferation, metastasis, invasion, and drug resistance, it is of significant implication for alleviating the effects of hypoxia in tumor treatment. The negligible oxygen&#8208;dependent nature of type I photosensitizers (PSs) has made them appropriate candidates for the treatment of hypoxic tumors. However, the lack of effective molecular design approaches, the phototoxicity of PSs to normal tissue before and after treatment, and the drawbacks of poor hydrophilicity severely hinder the development of PSs in hypoxic tumor therapy. Thus, developing a hydrophilic PS with good hypoxia resistance and minimal side effects is an urgent but challenging problem. Herein, we present a nanotheranostic (NanoPcN8O) based on the self&#8208;assembly of a hydrophilic phthalocyanine derivative (PcN8O), a hypoxia&#8208;responsive bioreductive phototherapeutic agent suitable for activatable photoacoustic (PA) imaging and tumor therapy. Hypoxic regions in various tumors exhibit strong reductive capability, and only in such conditions did NanoPcN8O feature multiple N&#8208;oxide groups that could be bioreduced to yield the product NanoPcN8 with abundant electron&#8208;rich tertiary amine groups, which switches on the type I photodynamic and photothermal effects, facilitating the generation of type I reactive oxygen species (ROS) and heat. Better still, NanoPcN8O achieved hypoxia&#8208;induced selective PA imaging in a preclinical model. Based on these merits, the hypoxia&#8208;induced switchable type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) strategies demonstrated remarkable phototherapeutic efficiency with high biosafety. This delicate design is anticipated to offer a novel and safe strategy to overcome hypoxia resistance in phototherapeutics.

The C&#9472;C bond linked COF have synthesized through the photothermal catalysis under visible light, which can be a photocatalyst to highly promote oxidation of benzyl amines. A new photoinduced thermally&#8208;driven postsynthetic strategy has been developed to construct COFs via crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation, the COF showing an excellent catalytic performance in promoting aerobic oxidation of benzylamine.








Abstract
Although photothermal catalysis is a clean, efficient, and green approach to access organic products, its application in the synthesis and transformation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) remains unprecedented. Herein, we report the photothermal catalytic synthesis of C&#9472;C bond linked COF under visible light, which can be a reusable photocatalyst to highly promote oxidation of benzyl amines. Furthermore, we have developed a new postsynthetic modification strategy to construct COFs by photoinduced thermally&#8208;driven hydroamination via crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation. The obtained COF containing sulfonic acid group showed an excellent catalytic performance in promoting aerobic oxidation of alkyl arenes under mild reaction conditions. These results not only enrich the COF synthetic methodology but also open a new route to access COFs in a green and sustainable way.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although photothermal catalysis is a clean, efficient, and green approach to access organic products, its application in the synthesis and transformation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) remains unprecedented. Herein, we report the photothermal catalytic synthesis of C&#9472;C bond linked COF under visible light, which can be a reusable photocatalyst to highly promote oxidation of benzyl amines. Furthermore, we have developed a new postsynthetic modification strategy to construct COFs by photoinduced thermally-driven hydroamination via crystal-to-crystal transformation. The obtained COF containing sulfonic acid group showed an excellent catalytic performance in promoting aerobic oxidation of alkyl arenes under mild reaction conditions. These results not only enrich the COF synthetic methodology but also open a new route to access COFs in a green and sustainable way.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionally Tunable Star&#8208;Shaped Multivalent crRNAs for Photocontrol CRISPR/Cas Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
From Line to Stars: Star&#8208;shaped crRNAs with photo&#8208;labile linkers have been successfully designed and constructed to enable precise, wavelength&#8208;specific activation of CRISPR/Cas editing. Using distinct light&#8208;responsive groups, these unique RNA structures allow independent regulation of multiple genes. This innovative approach advances genome engineering, therapeutic strategies, and complex biological research.








Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced shortpalindromic repeats/CRISPR&#8208;associated (CRISPR/Cas)&#8208;based genome editing has significantly advanced genetic engineering due to its precision, simplicity, and versatility. However, achieving precise spatial and temporal control remains challenging, restricting therapeutic and research applications. Herein, we introduce a novel class of star&#8208;shaped, multivalent crRNAs engineered for precise spatiotemporal control of CRISPR/Cas9 and Cas12a editing systems. These crRNAs are synthesized via single&#8208;site chemical modification and can be efficiently purified. By integrating distinct photo&#8208;responsive chemical linkages, we achieved selective activation of crRNA activity upon irradiation with specific wavelengths, enabling orthogonal regulation of multiple genetic targets simultaneously. This method demonstrated robust OFF&#8208;ON switching capabilities in vitro, characterized by minimal leakage and rapid activation. Importantly, the approach also proved highly effective for temporally controlled gene editing in mammalian cells in vivo, achieving considerable editing efficiency following brief photoactivation. Due to its target sequence&#8208;independent, single&#8208;site modification design, this strategy may serve as a universal solution for diverse CRISPR/Cas systems, eliminating cumbersome optimization processes. Future advancements incorporating long&#8208;wavelength responsive and reversible linkers promise further enhancement of tissue penetration and control, significantly broadening the applicability and impact of this approach in biological research and therapeutic interventions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Methanol Activation on Hexagonal CdS for Triggering C&#9472;H Methylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexagonal&#8208;CdS&#8208;based photocatalytic methanol activation was employed for triggering C&#9472;H methylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes. The hole&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated cleavage of methanol C&#9472;H bond and electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated reduction of hydroxymethylated intermediate were identified. Such transformations not only facilitate the cascade utilization of photogenerated holes and electrons, but also enable selective generation of hydroxymethylated/methylated products.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven methanol activation paves the way for pursuing C&#9472;H methylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes, where selectively converting methanol into the corresponding hydroxymethyl radical (&#8226;CH2OH) is an essential prerequisite. Inspired by the versatile methanol activation on photoexcited solids, we here report a practicable semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalytic system for C&#9472;H methylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes. To be specific, hexagonal cadmium sulfide (h&#8208;CdS) was identified to be an ideal platform for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic methanol activation, where selective &#8226;CH2OH generation undergoing a hole&#8208;transfer process without any additional co&#8208;catalysts or co&#8208;solvent could trigger C&#9472;H hydroxymethylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes. The following electron transfer between photoexcited h&#8208;CdS and hydroxymethylated intermediates could finally lead to the formation of methylated N&#8208;heteroarenes. The transformations facilitate the cascade utilization of photoinduced hole and electron, thereby endowing h&#8208;CdS with extraordinary photocatalytic performance. Besides, selective generation of hydroxymethylated/methylated product could be facilely implemented in the presence/absence of electron scavengers.

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell Structured Composite Solid Electrolyte Enables High&#8208;Rate All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell structured composite SE is designed and synthesized, which exhibits high oxidative stability, superior ionic conductivity and enhanced mechanical strength. By using this SE as both the catholyte and SE layer, a mechanically robust and homogeneous battery design was created, which could mitigate the chemomechanical contact loss. As a result, rapid ion transport is achieved across the multi&#8208;scale interfaces, enabling superior rate performance that surpasses the best&#8208;reported ASSSBs.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries (ASSSBs) have emerged as the promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage; however, they still face challenges related to ionic transport across multi&#8208;scale interfaces, which leads to suboptimal battery performances. In this study, we propose a core&#8208;shell structured composite electrolyte with Na3PS4 sulfide solid electrolyte (SE) as the core and Na2.25Y0.25Zr0.75Cl6 halide SE as the shell. This design strategy boosts high SE's oxidative stability (4.0&#160;V), ionic conductivity (0.44 mS cm&#8722;1) and mechanical strength (Young's modulus of 9.19&#160;GPa). These properties enable the composite SE to effectively mitigate the chemo&#8208;mechanically&#8208;induced multi&#8208;interfacial contact losses at the cathode side. Additionally, the homogeneous full&#8208;cell configuration, utilizing the core&#8208;shell structured composite electrolyte as both catholyte and SE layer, demonstrates superior rate capability, achieving a discharge capacity of 76.4 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 2.0 C, significantly outperforming the conventional sandwich&#8208;like designs. This work not only provides a novel design strategy for functional SE but also offers valuable insights into the chemo&#8208;mechanical failure mechanism at multiscale interfaces of ASSSBs.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Thianthrene Covalent Trimer Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Materials for Low&#8208;Concentration Oxygen Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;emission system of fluorescence (Fluo.) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with moderate spin&#8208;orbit coupling was constructed via thianthrene covalent trimerization, enabling high oxygen sensitivity and ratiometric optical oxygen sensing. The significant emission color and intensity change under varying oxygen concentrations allows for real&#8208;time video&#8208;based monitoring of low&#8208;concentration oxygen.








Abstract
Oxygen is ubiquitous and vital to life, industry, and environmental safety, so accurate and reliable oxygen sensing and detection are of great significance, especially for oxygen in the low concentration range. Herein, two pure organic metal&#8208;free room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials were developed using a covalent trimerization strategy of thianthrene (TA), which exhibit high oxygen sensitivity and fluorescence&#8208;RTP separated dual emission due to the moderate spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC). Compared with traditional metal&#8208;organic complexes, the oxygen sensitivity of RTP is improved by about two orders of magnitude, especially facilitating accurate quantitative detection of low&#8208;concentration oxygen. Leveraging oxygen quenching&#8208;induced changes in emission color and intensity, coupled with computer&#8208;assisted image processing, a simple oxygen monitoring device was established to realize real&#8208;time and accurate detection of low&#8208;concentration oxygen, promoting the industrial practical application in many related fields.

Developing acceptors geared toward efficient facilely processed OSCs is imperative for widespread commercialization. Herein, an alkyl linearization strategy was adopted to promote compact and face&#8208;on molecular stacking, and further vinyl functionalization of alkyl terminals provided additional interaction sites to manifest enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of BTP&#8208;V6, resulting in record PCEs of 19.2% and 20.1% for as&#8208;cast and optimal LBL OSCs, respectively.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable as&#8208;cast organic solar cells (OSCs) is imperative for alleviating costs and complexity for large&#8208;scale commercial applications. Nevertheless, achieving the desired double&#8208;fibril morphology of active layer through single&#8208;step processing is challenging. Herein, two nonfullerene acceptors, namely BTP&#8208;N6 and BTP&#8208;V6, are designed and synthesized to construct as&#8208;cast OSCs by introducing linear alkyl chains adjacent to the pyrrole moiety. The reduction of steric hindrance attributable to linear chains engenders diminished dihedral angles of molecular skeletons, thereby promoting compact and face&#8208;on oriented molecular stacking. Moreover, BTP&#8208;V6 featuring vinyl&#8208;functionalized linear chains manifests additional interaction sites with neighboring molecules to instigate enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking during rapid film&#8208;formation process and engenders the formation of a refined double&#8208;fibril network morphology, which facilitates exciton dissociation, bolsters charge carrier transport, and suppresses recombination loss. Consequently, the D18:BTP&#8208;V6 based device attained a record&#8208;shattering efficiency of 19.2% with a high fill factor (FF) of 80.7%, and also demonstrated robust thermal and shelf stability. Moreover, the meticulously optimized layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) structured devices achieved an excellent efficiency up to 20.1%. This study introduces a viable strategy for alkyl chain modification to fabricate efficient and stable as&#8208;cast devices, with the anticipation of expediting the progression toward widespread commercialization of OSCs.

         <title>Neighboring Carbon Defects Enhanced Molecular Oxygen Activation of Cobalt Single Atom Catalysts Toward Efficient Aerobic Alcohols Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular oxygen (O2) activation is crucial but challenging for aerobic reactions. By introducing neighboring carbon defects, the d&#8208;electron arrangement of cobalt single atom is regulated from low spin to high spin, enhancing O2 adsorption at cobalt site, resulting in the formation of more radicals &#183;O2&#8722; to achieve alcohol oxidation to acids and esters.








Abstract
The effective adsorption and activation of molecular oxygen (O2) is crucial for aerobic alcohol oxidation; however, flexibly modulating the electronic structure of catalysts to improve the capability remains challenging. Herein, the concentration of carbon defects surrounding the nitrogen&#8208;coordinated cobalt (Co) single atoms on candle soot is controlled just through adjusting the amount of polyethyleneimine which chemically decorates the surface of candle soot to anchor Co ions. The concentration increase of carbon defects boosts the aerobic alcohol oxidation over the Co single&#8208;atom catalyst as well as ruthenium single&#8208;atom catalyst. Moreover, a series of alcohols, including those with sensitive groups, reach an outstanding yield. Significantly, the calculations and experiments verify that the carbon defects lead to the rearrangement of d&#8208;orbitals of Co atom and an elevation in the spin states of dyz and dz2${{\mathrm{d}}}_{{{\mathrm{z}}}^2}$ orbitals. Furthermore, compared with low&#8208;spin Co atom, the stronger electron&#8208;transfer interaction between high&#8208;spin Co atom and O2 enhances the adsorption and activation of O2 and the generation of more superoxide radicals to promote alcohol oxidation. Our findings provide a new way for developing advanced single&#8208;atom catalysts for sustainable aerobic alcohol oxidation via manipulating the spin configurations of single atoms.

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrogenation of Quinolines to Form 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrahdyroquinolines Using Water as the Hydrogen Atom Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential process combining hydrogenation and a subsequent stereomutation is presented for trans selective hydrogenation of quinolines using water as the hydrogen atom source. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hydrogenation proceeds through a cascade process comprising an initial cis selective photocatalytic hydrogenation of the heteroarene core of the quinoline followed by a trans selective photoisomerization.








Abstract
The design of a sequential process combining hydrogenation and a subsequent stereomutation is an attractive strategy for the stereoselective reduction of cyclic disubstituted &#960;&#8211;systems to access the thermodynamically more stable trans isomer, which would be the minor compound considering a kinetically controlled cis hydrogenation process. Herein, we demonstrate stereoselective photocatalytic phosphine&#8208;mediated quinoline reductions with water as the hydrogen atom source under mild conditions to afford the corresponding 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines with complete selectivity towards reduction of the heteroaromatic part. The method shows broad functional group tolerance and provides access to trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydroquinolines with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. These trans isomers are not readily obtained using established methods, as transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed regioselective quinoline hydrogenations provide the corresponding cis&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted isomers with high selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hydrogenation of the 2,3&#8208;disubstituted quinolines proceeds through a cascade process comprising an initial cis selective photocatalytic hydrogenation of the heteroarene core of the quinoline, followed by a trans selective photoisomerization.

         <title>Regulating Interfacial Molecular Configuration to Drive Facet&#8208;Selective Zn Metal Deposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a fundamental study elucidating the influence of dicarboxylic acids with varying alkyl chain lengths on their adsorption configuration, strength, and deposition rate on Zn surfaces, which ultimately enables control over highly facet&#8208;selective Zn deposition at metal&#8208;molecule bridging interface.








Abstract
The direct use of metal anode emerges as a key strategy in advancing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, applicable across non&#8208;protonic, aqueous, and solid&#8208;state battery systems. To enhance battery durability, one effective approach involves employing interfacial molecular modification to modulate metal's facet orientation, reducing the tendency of metals to form random and loose morphologies during deposition. Herein, we propose a model to elucidate how dicarboxylic acid molecules with varying alkyl chain lengths modulate their adsorption behavior and deposition rate on zinc (Zn) surfaces, achieving facet&#8208;selective Zn deposition. Taking glutaric acid (GA) as an example, its medium alkyl chain length allows for a &#8220;flat&#8208;lying&#8221; adsorption configuration on Zn(002) surface, resulting in strong adsorption and Zn&#8208;GA metal&#8208;molecule bridging interface. This regulates Zn2+ diffusion process and restricts its accessibility to Zn(002) facet, facilitating the selective exposure of Zn(002) facet. Due to this design, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell stably operates at a high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high depth of discharge of 85%. The Zn||MnO2 pouch cell achieves a high capacity of 1.1&#160;Ah with 90% capacity retention. This metal&#8208;molecule interface design can be extended to other metal anodes, with the potential for tailored molecular selections to regulate the selective growth of crystal facets.

We demonstrate that this domain, which interacts with the minor groove of dsDNA, is functionally ambidextrous &#8211; that it can bind to dsDNA of either chirality. Moreover, binding of both chiral forms of dsDNA is mediated by an overlapping binding surface. These results reveal new insights into the evolution of the (HhH)2&#8208;Fold and its mode of binding. 








Abstract
The helix&#8208;hairpin&#8208;helix (HhH) motif is an ancient and ubiquitous nucleic acid&#8208;binding element that has emerged as a model system for studying the evolution of dsDNA&#8208;binding domains from simple peptides that phase separate with RNA. We analyzed the entire putative evolutionary trajectory of the HhH motif &#8211; from a flexible peptide to a folded domain &#8211; for functional robustness to total chiral inversion. Against expectations, functional &#8220;ambidexterity&#8221; was observed for both the phase separation of HhH peptides with RNA and binding of the duplicated (HhH)2&#8208;Fold to dsDNA. Moreover, dissociation kinetics, mutational analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations revealed an overlap between the binding modes adopted by the natural and mirror&#8208;image proteins to natural dsDNA. The similarity of several dissociation phases upon chiral inversion may reflect the history of (HhH)2&#8208;Fold binding, with the ultimate emergence of a high&#8208;affinity binding mode, supported by a bridging metal ion, depopulating but not displacing more primitive (potentially ambidextrous) modes. These data underscore the surprising functional robustness of the HhH protein family and suggest that the veil between worlds with alternative chiral preferences may not be as impenetrable as is often assumed.

A silver single&#8208;atom&#8208;loaded thiophene&#8208;conjugated carbon nitride (Ag@T&#9472;C3N4) photocatalyst with high carrier concentration and efficient carrier separation. It enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2O2 production and selective benzyl alcohol oxidation. Thiophene conjugation and Ag single atoms enhance light absorption and accelerate the 2e&#8722; ORR, boosting H2O2 yield, while photogenerated holes promote benzyl alcohol oxidation. The biphasic system enables spontaneous product separation. DFT calculations reveal Ag&#8208;thiophene interactions optimize the reaction pathway, strengthen catalyst&#8211;intermediate interactions, and reduce Gibbs free energy, thus enhancing efficiency.








Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of silver single&#8208;atom&#8208;loaded thiophene&#8208;conjugated carbon nitride (Ag@T&#9472;C3N4), a material with high carrier concentration and efficient carrier separation. Under visible light, Ag@T&#9472;C3N4 catalyzes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde, achieving production rates of 4729.82 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 for H2O2 and 19.71 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 for benzaldehyde. The synergy between thiophene conjugation and silver atoms extends visible light absorption and accelerates the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), enhancing H2O2 yield. Photogenerated holes oxidize benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, while the biphasic benzaldehyde&#8208;water system enables spontaneous product separation. In situ Raman spectroscopy, rotating disk electrode testing, EPR, GC&#8208;MS, and DFT calculations highlight the critical role of thiophene&#8208;silver synergy in optimizing reaction pathways, enhancing catalyst&#8208;intermediate interactions, and reducing Gibbs free energy, improving H2O2 and benzaldehyde synthesis. This study provides new insights for designing carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts and offers a strategy for co&#8208;producing value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Ternary Metalation in a Copper&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework for Tandem Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 25, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem photocatalytic heterometallic COF system combining photosensitive Ru sites, CO&#8208;producing Co sites, and multi&#8208;electron&#8208;reducing trinuclear Cu sites has been constructed by a sequential post&#8208;synthetic metallization strategy. The synergistic effect of the multiple Ru, Co, and Cu sites leads to a highly efficient and selective photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reduction, with a CH4 evolution rate of 31.5&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 95%.








Abstract
Developing multifunctional photocatalysts with efficient synergistic effects for selective photocatalytic CO2 reduction is sought&#8208;after yet challenging. Herein, a tandem photocatalytic strategy has been developed through sequential post&#8208;synthetic metalation (SPSM) of variable Ru/Co&#8208;sites into a trinuclear Cu&#8208;based COF, Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, to construct a series of tri&#8208;metallized covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF(Ru/Co)&#8208;X (X&#160;=&#160;1, 2, or 3, corresponding to the Ru:Co molar ratios of 1/39.6, 1/19.6, or 1/12.7, respectively), for photocatalytic CO2 methanation in high selectivity. The introduction of a small fraction of Ru&#8208;sites confers the framework with enhanced visible&#8208;light response, while the Co&#8208;sites immobilized in the bipyridine units significantly boost the generation of CO to enrich its concentration around the active trinuclear Cu&#8208;sites, which enables dramatically improved photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity toward CH4. Significantly, the optimized Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF(Ru/Co)&#8208;2 showcases exceptional photocatalytic activity with a CH4 evolution rate of 31.5&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 95%, 15.0 times higher than that of Cu3&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF(Ru) merely introducing Ru&#8208;photosensitizer. The underlying photocatalytic mechanism has been studied to unveil how the ternary Ru/Co/Cu&#8208;sites collaborate to result in highly efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reduction, shedding light on the design of highly selective CO2 methanation photocatalysts by leveraging the synergistic effect of multiple active centers within heterometallic covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (HM&#8208;COFs).

         <title>Catch, Cut, or Block? Versatile 4&#8208;N&#8208;Derivatized Sialyl Glycosides for Influenza Virus Neuraminidase Detection and Purification</title>

Sialyl glycosides containing 4&#8208;N&#8208;derivatized sialic acids synthesized by a highly efficient one&#8208;pot two&#8208;enzyme (OP2E) chemoenzymatic sialylation strategy have been shown to be versatile probes. They can resist sialidase cleavage, be selective substrates by influenza sialidases, or be nanomolar substrate analog&#8208;based inhibitors and affinity ligands selectively for influenza sialidases. Beads immobilized with 4&#8208;guanidino&#8208;sialosides have been demonstrated for purifying influenza virions.








Abstract
Seasonal influenza continues to threaten human lives and pose a significant burden to healthcare systems and the economy, emphasizing the need for developing better influenza vaccines, diagnostics, and antiviral therapeutics. To address these challenges, we generated a library of structurally diverse sialyl glycosides containing 4&#8208;N&#8208;derivatized sialic acids by a highly efficient one&#8208;pot two&#8208;enzyme chemoenzymatic sialylation strategy. Sialosides containing 4&#8208;azido&#8208;substituted sialic acid were selectively cleaved by sialidases from influenza viruses, whereas sialosides containing 4&#8208;acetamido&#8208;modified sialic acid were resistant to sialidase cleavage. Interestingly, sialosides containing 4&#8208;amino&#8208; or 4&#8208;guanidino&#8208;substituted sialic acid were effective inhibitors moderately or highly resistant to cleavage by influenza sialidases (also called neuraminidases). The sialosides containing the 4&#8208;guanidino&#8208;substituted sialic acid represent a new class of sialidase substrate analog&#8208;based inhibitors. We took advantage of this unique property to create a ligand&#8208;based approach for efficiently isolating influenza virions from egg allantoic fluid with high purity. Together, these compounds are versatile probes and ligands for developing new approaches to detect, profile, isolate, and characterize influenza viruses via neuraminidases on their surface.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Catenane&#8208;Branched Dendrimers with Tunable Dimension for Reversible Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To tackle the challenge of the precise construction of catenane&#8208;based mechanically interlocked macromolecules with well&#8208;defined topological arrangements, starting from a novel [2]catenane building block with dendrimer growth sites, catenane&#8208;branched dendrimers have been efficiently constructed via an efficient and controllable divergent approach. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, the third&#8208;generation dendrimer which consists of twenty&#8208;one [2]catenane branches is the most complicated discrete [2]catenane oligomer synthesized to date. Interestingly, the switchable co&#8208;conformation transformations of [2]catenane branches triggered by sodium ions and cryptands lead to an integrated and amplified expansion&#8208;contraction motion of the resultant dendrimers, achieving reversible size regulation at the nanoscale. The unique recognition sites of the resultant catenane&#8208;branched dendrimers also facilitate the reversible binding of drug and dye guests. This work not only addresses the synthetic challenge of highly branched catenane dendrimers but also provides a new platform for dynamic supramolecular functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Absolute Asymmetric Synthesis of a Homochiral Polymer from an Achiral Monomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A compelling hypothesis for the origin of homochirality that led to the origin of life is that a chiral informational polymer, formed somehow from achiral monomers, biased the early chemical events, leading to the exclusive synthesis of chiral building blocks of life. However, the formation of a chiral polymer from achiral monomers continues to be a mystery. We exploited the ability of achiral molecules to rarely crystallize in chiral space groups to design achiral monomers for topochemical polymerization to obtain chiral polymers. One of such achiral monomers synthesized, viz. a tripeptide monomer containing alkene and azide at its termini, crystallized in a chiral space group, forming a conglomerate as revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Upon heating at a temperature above 70 &#959;C, each enantiomorphic crystal underwent a regiospecific and stereospecific topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition reaction in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion to give a triazoline&#8208;linked homochiral helical polymer. We characterized several homochiral polymer crystals at atomic resolution either by SCXRD or by 3D electron diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ/Operando Probing of Dynamic Phase Structures of Alumina&#8208;Supported Ultrasmall Copper&#8208;Gold Alloy Nanoparticles Under Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supported ultrasmall copper&#8208;gold alloy nanoparticles are active heterogenous catalysts. In situ TEM tracking under oxygen at different temperatures reveals atomic&#8208;scale dynamic phase structures, whereas combined operando synchrotron HE&#8208;XRD and DRIFTS characterizations uncover ensemble&#8208;averaged ordering/disordering phase structures and oscillatory surface adsorbates, showing implications for designing highly stable ultrasmall alloy catalysts.








Abstract
The ability to control phase structures and surface sites of ultrasmall alloy nanoparticles under reaction conditions is essential for preparing catalysts by design. This is, however, challenging due to limited understanding of the atomic&#8208;scale phases and their correlation with the ensemble&#8208;averaged structures and activities of catalysts during catalytic reactions. We reveal here a dynamic structural stability of alumina&#8208;supported ultrasmall and equiatomic copper&#8208;gold alloy nanoparticles under reaction conditions as a model system in the in situ/operando study. In situ atomic&#8208;scale morphological tracking under oxygen reveals temperature&#8208;dependent dynamic crystalline&#8208;amorphous dual&#8208;phase structures, showing dynamic stability over an elevated temperature range. This atomic&#8208;scale dynamic phase stability coincides with a &#8220;conversion plateau&#8221; observed for carbon monoxide oxidation on the catalyst. It is substantiated by the stable lattice ordering/disordering structures and surface sites with oscillatory characteristics shown by operando ensemble&#8208;average structural tracking of the catalyst during the oxidation reaction. The understanding of the atomic&#8208;scale dynamic phase structures in correlation with the ensemble&#8208;average dynamic ordering/disordering phase structures and surface sites provides fresh insights into the unique synergy of the supported alloy nanoparticles. This understanding has implications for the design and structural tuning of active and stable ultrasmall alloy catalysts under elevated temperatures.

         <title>Patch&#8208;Clamp&#8208;Like Micropipette Electrode with Exterior and Interior Interfaces for Simultaneous Monitoring of Extracellular and Intracellular Serotonin Across Neuron</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We created a patch&#8208;clamp&#8208;like micropipette electrode with double sensing interfaces, together with surface serotonin binding protein modification and protein engineering, a potentiometric serotonin electrochemical sensor with broadened linear range was created for both intracellular and extracellular serotonin recording with excellent selectivity, reversibility and biocompatibility. Our findings revealed serotonin transporter reversed function to release 5&#8208;HT before intracellular exocytosis enhanced during seizures.








Abstract
Simultaneous monitoring of intracellular and extracellular serotonin (5&#8208;HT) across five orders of magnitude is crucial for understanding 5&#8208;HT&#8208;related diseases. Here, we created a patch&#8208;clamp&#8208;like micropipette electrode with double sensing interfaces, in which gold nanoparticles were coated onto exterior surface and conductive hydrogel was in situ polymerized by designed monomer to form interior interface. Furthermore, we engineered serotonin binding protein (SerBP) as recognition element to develop open&#8208;circuit potentiometric 5&#8208;HT sensor and modulated SerBP to enhance dissociation constant toward 5&#8208;HT through key residue mutation to broaden the linear ranges by five orders of magnitude for both intracellular and extracellular 5&#8208;HT recording. Meanwhile, the designed noninsertion mode together with zero potential detection caused minimal cell damage, thus significantly prolonged the recording duration. Using this powerful tool, we first discovered 5&#8208;HT transporter reversed function to release 5&#8208;HT before intracellular exocytosis enhanced, and together, through the release&#8211;reuptake&#8211;metabolism cycle, dynamically regulate the concentration of 5&#8208;HT with the development of seizure.

Abstract
The synthesis of atomically precise, structurally well&#8208;defined polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;stabilized silver clusters with accessible silver surfaces remains a significant challenge. Here, we report an alkynyl&#8208;functionalized silver&#8211;POM hybrid nanocluster, [(n&#8208;Bu)4&#160;N]7[(C6H9)6(PW11O39)2Ag13] ((PW11)2&#8208;Ag13), which comprises of a distinctive homovalent three&#8208;layer {Ag13}13+ cluster. This architecture yields a lower HOMO&#160;&#8722;&#160;LUMO energy gap of 1.93&#160;eV, compared to the precursor [PW11O39]7&#8722; (2.74&#160;eV). Structural characterization and theoretical calculations confirm that the lacunary [PW11O39]7&#8722; and alkynyl units direct the formation of the atomically precise {Ag13}13+ cluster, preventing undesirable silver aggregation while maintaining exposed silver surfaces that are crucial for catalytic activity. The synergistic redox capabilities of the POM and silver components enhance the redox reactivity of (PW11)2&#8208;Ag13, promoting efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via a Fenton&#8208;like mechanism. Additionally, biological evaluations further reveal that (PW11)2&#8208;Ag13 exhibits significantly superior antitumor activity than [PW11O39]7&#8722;, primarily through ROS&#8208;induced apoptosis facilitated by the active silver cluster sites. These findings highlight the potential of silver cluster&#8208;POM hybrids as promising candidates for anticancer therapeutic applications.

&lt;/b&gt;, promoting efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via a Fenton-like mechanism. Additionally, biological evaluations further reveal that &lt;b&gt;(PW&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Ag&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; exhibits significantly superior antitumor activity than [PW&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;7&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, primarily through ROS-induced apoptosis facilitated by the active silver cluster sites. These findings highlight the potential of silver cluster-POM hybrids as promising candidates for anticancer therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermodynamics of Water Displacement from Binding Sites and its Contributions to Supramolecular and Biomolecular Affinity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The affinity between a guest and a macrocyclic host depends strongly on the water encapsulated inside the host cavity, with free&#8208;energy variations on the order of 20&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 being possible even in the absence of direct host&#8208;guest interactions. This conclusion&#8211;which contrasts alternative views&#8211;can be drawn from molecular dynamics simulations for the binding of a guest with pseudo&#8208;hard&#8208;sphere potential and cucurbit[8]uril host models with varying polarity and polarizability.








Abstract
The role of water displacement in noncovalent binding has been debated in the fields of supramolecular chemistry and drug design. We use molecular dynamics simulations of idealized host&#8208;guest systems to address the long&#8208;standing controversy of whether water is merely a bystander or an actual driver of noncovalent binding in aqueous solution. To isolate hydration effects, we consider a pseudo&#8208;hard&#8208;sphere guest binding to a series of cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;based macrocyclic host models whose energetic interactions with water vary widely. The computed free energy cost of displacing water from binding sites ranges from 0 to +37&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1, strongly influencing binding affinities. However, neither water density nor excess chemical potential reliably indicates the thermodynamic favorability of cavity water. These results support the concept that &#8220;unfavorable&#8221; binding site water contributes to high&#8208;affinity binding and resolve the paradox of stable but thermodynamically unfavorable cavity water. This work provides insights into the nature of the hydrophobic effect in molecular recognition and offers a framework for understanding the role of water in binding across various host&#8208;guest and protein&#8208;ligand systems.

         <title>Synthesis of Versatile DNA&#8208;Conjugated Aldehydes by Controlled Oxidation of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled oxidation strategy enables efficient in situ generation of aldehyde&#8208;functionalized DNAs from DNA&#8208;conjugated amines using O2/laccase/TEMPO. This approach facilitates reversible amine&#8211;aldehyde transformations for DNA bioconjugation, and provides access to chemically diverse DNA&#8208;encoded libraries, broadening the toolbox for chemical biology and material science.








Abstract
Aldehyde&#8208;functionalized oligonucleotides have found diverse applications in chemical biology and material science. However, due to the electrophilic nature of aldehydes, incorporating aldehyde functionalities directly into DNA is challenging, particularly for highly reactive alkyl aldehydes. Inspired by natural oxidases, we herein developed a controlled oxidation strategy to generate aldehyde&#8208;functionalized DNAs from synthetically accessible DNA&#8208;conjugated amines in situ. A broad range of DNA&#8208;conjugated alkyl and aryl aldehydes were efficiently produced from the corresponding amines using O2/laccase/TEMPO, with feasible micromole&#8208;scale preparation. Moreover, combining oxidative cleavage of DNA&#8208;conjugated secondary and tertiary amines with reductive amination enabled switchable amine&#8211;aldehyde transformation and reversible solid&#8208;phase bioconjugation of DNA probes. Furthermore, the reactivity &#8220;umpolung&#8221; from nucleophilic amines to electrophilic aldehydes highlights its potential for synthesizing chemically diverse DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs). In summary, the presented controlled oxidation strategy expands the current toolbox to introduce aldehyde functionalities into DNAs within a chemical biological context.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Y(N5)3&#183;N2 Pentazolate with Perovskite Topology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Yttrium pentazolate, Y(N5)3&#183;N2, with an exceptionally high nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio of 17:1 and perovskite topology, was synthesized from yttrium and nitrogen at 125&#160;GPa and 3000&#160;K in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell.








Abstract
The discovery and stabilization of the cyclo&#8208;N5&#8315; anion have introduced a class of pentazolate compounds with significant potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials (HEDMs). This potential could be further enhanced by increasing the pentazolate&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio. Here, we report the high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature synthesis and characterization of a novel yttrium pentazolate, Y(N5)3&#183;N2, which exhibits an exceptionally high nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio of 17:1. Y(N5)3&#183;N2 was synthesized from yttrium and nitrogen by laser heating to 3000&#160;K at 125&#160;GPa in a diamond anvil cell. Its crystal structure, a 3D nitrogen&#8208;inclusion metal&#8208;pentazolate framework, was solved and refined in situ using synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. This structure demonstrates a perovskite topology, as pentazolate ring centers form octahedra connected via vertices, neutral nitrogen dimers are located at the centers of the octahedra, and yttrium atoms occupy distorted cuboctahedra within the octahedral 3D framework. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate the experimental findings and provide further insights into the stability and properties of the synthesized compound. Y(N5)3&#183;N2 is the first example of stabilizing three pentazolate anions per metal cation, surpassing the previously achieved 1:1 ratio. Additionally, we propose a centroid&#8208;based structure typification for solvent&#8208;free inorganic pentazolates, serving as an important step for further structural classification of pentazolates and other polynitrides.

         <title>Robust Ionic Gel Elastomers Derived from Molecularly Entangled Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We fabricate novel ionic gel elastomers by inducing the entanglements of polymer chains via molecularly entangled nodes. Utilizing the dissociation of entangled nodes under external stimuli, facilitating polymer chain sliding and resulting in energy dissipation and stress distribution, yields the more remarkable mechanical strength and toughness compared to the reported ionogels crosslinked via covalent and supramolecular strategies.








Abstract
In various types of intelligent devices, such as bionic robots, flexible polymeric elastomeric materials are essential for their operation, alongside the rigid skeleton. Conventional polymeric elastomeric materials, however, encounter a compromise between intelligence and mechanical robustness. Here, we construct ionic gel&#8208;based elastomers that harmoniously merge high intelligence with superior mechanical attributes by employing molecularly entangled nodes that facilitate polymer chain entanglement. The entangled nodes&#8217; dynamic interplay enables stress&#8208;induced dissociation, promoting polymer chain slippage that effectively dissipates energy and disperses stress. Consequently, these ionic gel&#8208;based elastomers exhibit a tensile strength of 33.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5&#160;MPa and a strain capacity of 4000&#160;&#177;&#160;280%, maintaining stable performance over 7000 cycles, while also possessing the ability to detect minor material defects, thereby advancing the versatility and reliability of intelligent devices.

         <title>From Binary to Higher&#8208;Order Organic Cocrystals: Design Principles and Performance Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From binary to higher&#8208;order organic cocrystals: strategic design principles, precision synthesis, and multifunctional applications. The emergence of ternary and higher&#8208;order cocrystalline systems, comprising three or more components, has revolutionized the paradigm of material design by significantly expanding both structural diversity and functional potential. These advanced architectures not only exhibit enhanced design versatility through synergistic molecular engineering but also enable unprecedented modulation of physicochemical properties, thereby introducing novel optoelectronic, mechanical, and stimuli&#8208;responsive functionalities.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;From binary to higher-order organic cocrystals: strategic design principles, precision synthesis, and multifunctional applications. The emergence of ternary and higher-order cocrystalline systems, comprising three or more components, has revolutionized the paradigm of material design by significantly expanding both structural diversity and functional potential. These advanced architectures not only exhibit enhanced design versatility through synergistic molecular engineering but also enable unprecedented modulation of physicochemical properties, thereby introducing novel optoelectronic, mechanical, and stimuli-responsive functionalities.

         <title>Enhanced Cycling Performance of Li&#8208;Rich Oxide Cathode via a Vaccine Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface spinel&#8208;like layer serves as a vaccine inoculated in the initial layered structure. During initial 70 cycles, the Mg located in Li slab gradually migrates to the bulk and act as a pillar against further structural collapse, by this way the layered structure merges with the spinel&#8208;like layer into a partially disorder phase. This process is like the vaccine taking its function. With the help of the in situ formed partially disorder phase, deep cycling stability is finely enhanced, with no capacity fade after 500 cycles.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;component incorporation and its inoculated gradient disorder structure can greatly modify the properties of materials. However, the contribution of the inoculated surface gradient disorder structure on the Li&#8208;rich cathodeswith distinctive integrated structure of LiMO2 (M&#160;=&#160;Ni, Mn, Co) and Li2MnO3 has been overlooked. Here, we reveal a vaccine effect of surface gradient disorder structure, demonstrating its significant improvement on the cycling performance of inoculated Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2. The inoculated Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 exhibits an initial coulombic efficiency of 85% and maintains ultra&#8208;high stability with 100% capacity retention after 500 cycles. Furthermore, it delivers a capacity of 154.5 mAh g&#8722;1 with 84.2% retention after 900 cycles at current density of 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Through a combination of electrochemical analysis and theoretical simulations via the basic Nernst equations, we demonstrate that the inoculated gradient disorder structure changes the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters governing the lattice oxygen redox process, which follows three sequential steps O2&#8722;&#8594;O22&#8722;&#8594;O2&#8722;&#8594;O2. This structural modification reconstructs the lattice oxygen redox, specially enhancing the electrode potential of the O2&#8722;&#8594;O2 step and reducing the reaction rate of O2&#8722;&#8594;O22&#8722;&#8594;O2&#8722; of Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2. These findings bring a novel perspective on the conventional foreign element incorporation strategy, providing valuable insights to support the continued development of Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A Monolithium Monohydrogen Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monohydrogen metalloporphyrin was synthesized by reacting lithium vapor with a thin film of tetraphenylporphyrin under UHV conditions. The resulting LiHTPP complex is thermally stable and isolable by vacuum sublimation. Spectroscopic and theoretical analyses reveal insights into its nonplanar structure, energetics, and mechanism of formation and reactivity, shedding light on porphyrin metalation pathways and functional material design.








Abstract
Porphyrins and their metal complexes play essential roles in biological and industrial processes, functioning as key components in catalysis, photodynamic therapy, and organic (opto&#8208;)electronic materials. Despite their significance, the intermediate states involved in metal incorporation into porphyrins remain poorly understood and are rarely observed as stable compounds. Here, we report the solvent&#8208;free synthesis of the first neutral alkali metal monohydrogen porphyrin, which was selectively obtained by reaction of lithium vapor with thin films of tetraphenylporphyrin (H2TPP) under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions. The resulting monolithium monohydrogen tetraphenylporphyrin (LiHTPP) exhibits remarkable thermal stability and can be sublimated under UHV at 485&#160;K without disproportionation, enabling its isolation. LiHTPP reacts with additional lithium to form dilithium tetraphenylporphyrin (Li2TPP), as confirmed through product analysis and reaction monitoring via photoelectron spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Complementary theoretical simulations provide deeper insight into the chemical structure of this non&#8208;planar complex and the energetics of its formation. This study advances the understanding of monohydrogen metalloporphyrins and their role in metalation pathways, introducing a novel synthetic route for stable intermediates. The study also underscores the potential of monohydrogen metalloporphyrins for developing catalysts and electronic materials with tunable properties.

         <title>Recyclable Quasi&#8208;Homogeneous Carbon Nitride Colloidal Catalyst for Sustainable Photocatalytic H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a versatile and scalable strategy for constructing recyclable g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based colloidal photocatalysts, bridging the gap between the high efficiency of homogeneous systems and the practicality of heterogeneous catalysis. By grafting polar sulfonylcyanide groups and incorporating K+ ions, the hydrophilicity of g&#8208;C3N4 is enhanced, enabling quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide for sustainable chemical applications.








Abstract
Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) photocatalysts have attracted growing interest for the eco&#8208;friendly, solar&#8208;driven synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, the catalytic efficiency remains limited by poor accessibility of reactive sites due to the hydrophobic nature and aggregation tendency of conventional g&#8208;C3N4. Here, we report a hydrophilic g&#8208;C3N4 colloidal photocatalyst, synthesized via potassium ion (K&#8314;) incorporation and surface grafting with sulfonylcyanide groups, which enables quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalytic H2O2 production (7,886&#160;&#181;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;), surpassing most reported g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based heterogeneous systems. The sulfonylcyanide groups facilitate O2 adsorption and reduction, while synergistically promoting charge separation in conjunction with K&#8314; ions. This work demonstrates the potential of hydrophilic g&#8208;C3N4 colloids in quasi&#8208;homogeneous catalysis and presents a versatile strategy for designing advanced g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts for sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;Modified NiFe OER Catalyst Achieving Ultrastable Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis via Dynamic Alkaline Microenvironment Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of quaternary ammonium cations significantly enhanced the transport of OH&#8722; at the AEM&#8208;anode catalyst interface, forming a locally alkaline&#8208;enriched microenvironment around the metal active sites, effectively inhibiting chemical corrosion, and simultaneously improving catalytic performance through pH regulation.








Abstract
The development of efficient nonprecious metal electrocatalysts for industrial anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEM&#8208;WE) remains challenging, primarily due to sluggish OH&#8722; transfer from the anion exchange membrane (AEM) to catalytic sites, causing H+ accumulation and performance degradation. Herein, we developed a zwitterion&#8208;modified NiFe catalyst (z&#8208;NiFe) through gradient soaking, facilitates rapid OH&#8722; transfer across the AEM&#8208;electrocatalyst interface, effectively neutralizing the generated H+ and enhancing catalytic performance. In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and OH&#8722; conductivity measurements reveal an alkaline&#8208;enriched surface environment, which inhibits H+ accumulation&#8208;induced chemical corrosion and enhances water oxidation performances. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis demonstrates that zwitterions stabilize adsorbed oxygen during catalysis, and reduce the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The z&#8208;NiFe shows an ultralow Tafel slope (28.5&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) and high activity (190&#160;mV overpotential at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) in 1&#160;M KOH. When integrated into an AEM&#8208;WE system, the z&#8208;NiFe&#8208;catalyzed AEM&#8208;WE device exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.76&#160;V at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and record&#8208;breaking durability over 14000&#160;h, with a voltage degradation rate of 12.3 &#181;V h&#8722;1, representing a significant advancement in AEM&#8208;WE technology.

&lt;p&gt;The development of efficient nonprecious metal electrocatalysts for industrial anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEM-WE) remains challenging, primarily due to sluggish OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; transfer from the anion exchange membrane (AEM) to catalytic sites, causing H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation and performance degradation. Herein, we developed a zwitterion-modified NiFe catalyst (z-NiFe) through gradient soaking, facilitates rapid OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; transfer across the AEM-electrocatalyst interface, effectively neutralizing the generated H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and enhancing catalytic performance. In-situ Raman spectroscopy and OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity measurements reveal an alkaline-enriched surface environment, which inhibits H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation-induced chemical corrosion and enhances water oxidation performances. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis demonstrates that zwitterions stabilize adsorbed oxygen during catalysis, and reduce the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The z-NiFe shows an ultralow Tafel slope (28.5&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and high activity (190&#160;mV overpotential at 1000&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in 1&#160;M KOH. When integrated into an AEM-WE system, the z-NiFe-catalyzed AEM-WE device exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.76&#160;V at 1000&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and record-breaking durability over 14000&#160;h, with a voltage degradation rate of 12.3 &#181;V h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, representing a significant advancement in AEM-WE technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A 19F&#8208;Labeled Probe for the Chiral Discrimination of Thiols and Thioethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel platinum&#8208;based 19F&#8208;labeled probe for the swift detection and chiral discrimination of sulfur&#8208;containing analytes. It generates distinctive 19F NMR signals corresponding to enantiomeric analytes. This method is applicable to both thiols and previously challenging thioethers, showcasing extensive potential applications in drug development, quality control, and screening of asymmetric reactions.








Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;containing compounds are pivotal in cellular processes such as redox balance and signal transduction. Traditionally, these compounds, especially thiols, are detected using fluorescence probes. However, these probes fall short in targeting thioethers due to their lower reactivity. Moreover, the chiral discrimination of thiols and thioethers typically relies on chromatographic methods, where separation&#8208;free, in situ strategies are highly desirable. To address this, we have developed a novel 19F&#8208;labeled chiral platinum probe capable of distinguishing both thiols and thioethers. This technique generates distinct 19F NMR signals that correspond to the stereoconfiguration of the analytes, enabling direct determination of their enantiocomposition. This method holds potential for integration into high&#8208;throughput workflows, boosting pharmaceutical and biological research by facilitating rapid, efficient chiral analysis of crucial compounds.

         <title>A Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Graphenic Buckybowl for Photocatalysis and Assembly with Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A nitrogen&#8208;containing graphenic buckybowl (3N&#8208;HBC) has been synthesized through pentagonal cyclization at the bay positions of hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (p&#8208;HBC) using a Pd&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative cycloamination as a key step. The incorporation of three pyrrole rings to the periphery of the bowl endows it with strong electron&#8208;rich character, showing three reversible oxidations in cyclic voltammetry (CV), and thus could be progressively oxidized into cationic radical and high&#8208;charged species upon gradual addition of the oxidant. Interestingly, the cationic radical was also generated by acids, which could be significantly accelerated by light, whether under an air or inert atmosphere. 3N&#8208;HBC exhibits interesting properties that arise from its electron&#8208;rich character and the unique curved geometry. 3N&#8208;HBC proved to be a superior organic photocatalyst for the conversion of 2&#8208;isocyanobiphenyl to phenanthridine derivatives at 1.0 mol% catalytic loading under blue LEDs irradiation. Furthermore, the electron&#8208;donating nature and curved &#960;&#8208;surface of 3N&#8208;HBC enable its association with fullerenes (C60 and C70) in solution and solid states. This work also demonstrates that nanographene sheets can be bent to &#960;&#8208;bowls through introduction of few pentagons containing small&#8208;sized heteroatom to their bay regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Internally BN&#8208;Doped Coronene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the first synthesis of internally BN&#8208;doped coronenes (B2N2&#8208;C, H&#8208;B2N2&#8208;C, 2H&#8208;B2N2&#8208;C) with two covalent B&#8208;N units embedded on the central axis of coronene. The B&#8208;N doping leads to unique electronic structures with distinct charge distribution, conjugation, aromaticity, and photophysical properties. The structures were successfully identified by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray scattering. B2N2&#8208;C without sidechains retains the structure of coronene but exhibits stronger &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, higher electronic coupling, and a narrowed solid&#8208;state band gap. Driven by the B&#8208;N dipole&#8208;dipole interaction, all B2N2&#8208;coronene derivatives exhibit more ordered assembly with excimer emission in solution, which is absent in coronene. Notably, two stable polymorphs emerge in single crystals of 2H&#8208;B2N2&#8208;C with two hexyl chains: a kinetically stable rod phase and a thermodynamically stable plate phase, where variations in processing conditions direct the formation of different phases.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Receptor oligomerization plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular behaviors and functionalities. Stimuli&#8208;responsive artificial circuits are often programmed to rewire cell signaling by fine&#8208;tuning receptor interactions through targeted stimulation. Notably, the integration of tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive systems capable of locally altering cancer cell phenotypes or transforming anti&#8208;tumor responses of immune cells offers a novel and promising strategy for enhancing the therapeutic effectiveness and safety of cancer treatments. In this paper, we introduce an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;inducible receptor oligomerization (ATIRO) approach to facilitate the clustering of CD3 and CD8 of T cell and the engagement of CD3 and tumor marker of T cells and targeted cancer cells, to prompt anti&#8208;tumor immunity. ATIRO enables the specific in&#8208;situ activation of T cells by the high&#8208;level ATP presented in TME, thereby effectively suppressing tumor growth in vivo. ATIRO presents a versatile and readily adaptable strategy for the in&#8208;situ reconfiguration of T cell immunity, holding significant potential for advancing cancer therapeutic interventions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Feasible electrolysis&#8208;paired tandem synthesis represents an elaborately organized and high&#8208;efficiency strategy balancing energy consumption and value&#8208;added synthesis. Herein, we developed an exotic electrolysis&#8208;paired tandem synthesis system driven by a metalloenzyme&#8208;like bifunctional single&#8208;molecular heterostructure catalyst (MimNiPc/CNT), which enables the modular synchronous synthesis of amides and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides through cathodic CO&#8208;relayed aminocarbonylation and anodic iodine&#8208;mediated keto&#8208;amidation tandem reactions, respectively. Notably, the established MimNiPc/CNT is not only effective for parallel electrolysis&#8208;paired tandem reactions with various substrates, but also adaptable for both divergent and sequential electrolysis&#8208;paired tandem reactions, producing value&#8208;added amide and &#945;&#8208;ketoamide compounds with isolated yields up to ~90%. Detailed isotope labelling and mass spectrometry tracking experiments meticulously unveiled the reaction mechanisms, the processes at both electrodes can be refined into sequential electrocatalysis and chemocatalysis steps. Our work also demonstrates the flexibility and scalability of this "two birds with one stone" synthetic protocol, providing an experimental reference for precise synthesis.</dc:description>

The natural product is synthesized in 17 steps, with the reactions being performed on decagram-scale up to an advanced intermediate, establishing the scalability of this approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>High&#8208;energy excited states with slow rates for internal conversion to the lowest&#8208;energy excited state are prone to be intercepted before they dissipate energy to the medium.

         <title>Design of fluorine&#8208;free weakly coordinating electrolyte solvents with enhanced oxidative stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High concentrations of conducting salt in electrolyte formulations enhance the agglomeration of ionic species, which has been demonstrated to yield anion&#8208;derived electrode&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphases and improved reversibility in several battery configurations. However, industrial application of these electrolytes may be limited due to high costs of electrolyte conducting salts. Here, weakly solvating electrolyte solvents with tailored coordination strength have been established as an approach to achieve ionic agglomeration at moderate conducting salt concentrations and without per&#8208;fluorinated diluents. However, the inevitable presence of uncoordinated solvent molecules in this electrolyte concept renders them susceptible to oxidative decomposition. Although previous efforts demonstrated fluorination as an effective design strategy to tailor the oxidative stability of weakly solvating electrolytes, the per&#8208;fluorinated solvents are toxic and harmful to the environment. Herein, the incorporation of silicon is evaluated as an eco&#8208;friendly approach to dispel electron density of the oxygen lone pair. Though steric demand of substituents is already sufficient to tailor the coordination strength, negative hyperconjugation effectively expands the oxidative stability limit of weakly solvating electrolytes. Combining ion agglomeration and intrinsic oxidative stability, the herein introduced weakly solvating electrolyte enables a notable improvement of reversibility under eco&#8208;friendly conditions, presenting a valid alternative to fluorinated electrolyte solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>A&#160;Universal Metal Ion&#8208;targeting Coordination Strategy for Precise Synthesis of Heteronuclear Dual&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteronuclear dual&#8208;atoms catalysts (DACs) represent an emerging frontier in heterogeneous catalysis due to maximum atom utilization and synergistic catalysis, yet their precise synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we propose a universal &#8216;metal ion targeting coordination&#8217; (MITC) strategy to construct a series of heteronuclear DACs. This approach utilizes the bipyridyl (bpy) ligands to coordinate a primary metal (M1), forming an artificial monooxygenase (bpy)M1(&#956;2&#8208;OH) structure, where electron&#8208;enriched oxygen atoms serve as anchoring sites for a secondary metal (M2). The oxygen bridged M1&#8208;O&#8208;M2 configurations in the resulting (bpy)M1(&#956;2&#8208;OH)M2 precursors enable precise synthesis of heteronuclear DACs during the subsequent pyrolysis. Benefiting&#160;from geometric and electronic structure merits, heteronuclear DACs can efficiently catalyze oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) through a more desirable dissociative mechanism, thus circumventing the inherent OH*&#8208;OOH* linear scaling relations.&#160;Notably, the FeCo DAC exhibits exceptional ORR performance, with an onset and half&#8208;wave potential of 1.03 V and 0.93 V, respectively. The excellent ORR activity of FeCo DAC is further validated in anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), delivering a peak power density over 1.3&#8201;W&#8201;cm&#8208;2 and a current density of 79.2 mA cm&#8208;2 at 0.9 ViR&#8208;free under H2&#8208;O2 conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dictating Zn2+ Transport Kinetics via Versatile Ionic Covalent Organic Framework for Robust Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a promising platform in regulating ion transport and stabilizing electrode/electrolyte interfaces owing to their tailorable porosity and versatile moiety. Compared to widely employed neutral COFs, ionic COFs (iCOFs) harness strong electrostatic interactions to selectively interact with target ions, thereby helping accelerate ion&#8208;pair dissociation. Furthermore, the charged backbones of iCOFs induce interlayer electrostatic repulsion, driving spontaneous exfoliation and hence promoting ion transport kinetics. Capitalizing upon these advantages, we in situ engineer a low&#8208;crystallinity iCOF interfacial membrane over Zn anode. The guanidium moieties within the framework immobilize water molecules through H&#8208;bond interactions, effectively suppressing parasitic side reactions. Concurrently, Coulombic interactions between the positively charged backbone and SO42&#8722; facilitate Zn2+ dissociation, enabling stable ion transport and uniform Zn deposition. Benefiting from the improved electrochemical stability of modified Zn anode, the as&#8208;assembled Zn metal pouch cell delivers a reversible capacity of ~0.35 Ah g&#8722;1 with a 98.72% capacity retention over prolonged cycling. This work establishes a paradigm for leveraging iCOFs to regulate Zn2+ transport kinetics toward next&#8208;generation energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Twisting Chiral Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Macrocycles into a Microhelix with Boosted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and assembly of chiral macrocycles remain an underexplored frontier in supramolecular science. In this study, we synthesized a pair of enantiomeric macrocyclic molecules (CP1) through the condensation of chiral cyclohexanediamine with tetraphenylethylene (TPE) dialdehyde. These molecules exhibited remarkable circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties at the supramolecular level. Through supramolecular assembly in mixed solvent systems, we achieved a rare micron&#8208;scale helical structure, exhibiting a high dissymmetry factor (glum) of 0.32&#8212;one of the highest values reported to date for macrocyclic assemblies. Furthermore, by designing a chiral macrocycle with phenyl spacers (CP2), we revealed that the confinement of macrocycles and restricted internal molecular rotation are critical for achieving high glum values and helical structure formation. This work not only advances the design of chiral macrocycles but also provides new insights into the relationship between molecular structure and supramolecular assembly, paving the way for the development of advanced chiral materials with potential applications in optics, sensing, and nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Crystalline and Oriented Thin Films of Fully Conjugated 3D&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fully conjugated three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a newly emerged class of materials that expands reticular chemistry to extended electron delocalization for optoelectronic applications. To overcome the limitations of sp3&#8208;connected 3D frameworks, the pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral motif cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh) has gained attention for forming fully conjugated 3D COFs. We report on a novel COTh building block, featuring functional formyl groups directly attached to the core's conjugated thiophenes. The modulation synthesis approach with mono&#8208;functionalized inhibitors enables the formation of COTh&#8208;1P COF, which exhibited remarkable crystallinity and permanent porosity. By following this approach and by optimizing the synthesis conditions to the solvothermal growth of thin films, we fabricated the first preferentially oriented conjugated 3D COF films on various substrates without pre&#8208;functionalization. With these thin films, optical pump terahertz probe studies allowed us, for the first time with 3D&#8208;fully conjugated COFs, to provide insights into the excited state and charge&#8208;carrier dynamics of these unique organic frameworks. Low effective masses are discovered for valence and conduction bands by density functional theory simulations. The ability to create crystalline and oriented films of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D COTh&#8208;based COFs on non&#8208;modified substrates is expected to open the way for integration of such frameworks into diverse optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Mesoionic Imine&#8208;Carbodiimde (MII&#8208;CDI) Adducts: 1,3 H&#8208;Shift, N(I) Compounds and Guanidinate&#8208;Type Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we report our recent findings on the synthesis and reactivity of a novel 1,2,3&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;imine type mesoionic imine&#8208;carbodiimide (MII&#8208;CDI) adduct. Unlike reported NHC&#8208;CDI adducts, formed by the reactions of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) with CDI, these zwitterionic compounds undergo a spontaneous 1,3 H&#8208;shift, resulting in guanidine&#8208;type compounds. The mechanism of this 1,3&#8208;H shift has been investigated through quantum chemical calculations. The MII&#8208;CDI adduct serves as a valuable synthon for the synthesis of mesoionic carbene&#8208;acyclic diamino carbene (MIC&#8208;ADC)&#8208;based nitreone (N(I)) compounds. We have conducted a detailed investigation into the electronic properties, chemical reactivity, and electrochemical behaviour of these nitreone (N(I)) compounds. Additionally, the potential of these MII&#8208;CDI adducts as guanidinate ligands is explored. Our investigations here display the distinct reactivities of MII in contrast to their N&#8208;heterocyclic imine (NHI) congeners.</dc:description>

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Ammonia Synthesis via Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction Using Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Dual&#8208;Atomic Cu Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potential application prospects of green electricity&#8208;driven electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO&#8323;RR) technology for the production of valuable ammonia have garnered widespread attention. However, designing electrocatalysts with remarkable activity and stability for the NO&#8323;RR to realize gram&#8208;level ammonia production remains a significant hurdle in terms of practical application. In nature, the synergistic effect of the dual&#8208;sites copper of nitrite reductase promotes the substrate adsorption and protonation, achieving efficient conversion of nitrite. Herein, enzyme&#8208;inspired Cu dual&#8208;atomic sites are constructed on polymeric carbon nitride (PCN&#8208;Cu&#8208;DAC). Systematic investigations indicate the dual&#8208;atomic Cu sites in the catalyst exhibits stronger proton transfer and synergistic nitrate adsorption interaction, thereby reducing the energy barrier for *NO protonation. Studies have shown that the PCN&#8208;Cu&#8208;DAC catalyst presents a remarkable ammonia (NH&#8323;) yield (467 mg h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1 cat. and 102 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2) and achieves an 11 g d&#8208;1 NH3&#160;yield at 6 A of current for 360 h. This work demonstrates the concept of mimicking natural nitrite reductase toward the continuous reduction of nitrate wastewater and promotes the production of NH3.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Adapted Active Site Self&#8208;Evolving Reconfiguration Boosting Catalytic Effect on Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The facile synthesis of highly substrate&#8208;adapted catalysts with dynamic active site adaptability remains a persistent challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, breaking through conventional catalyst preparation route of design&#8211;synthesis&#8211;evaluation iteration, we demonstrate an active site self&#8208;evolving reconfiguration strategy for spontaneous construction an adaptive multimolecular activation catalyst, such as for acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation. Specifically, a metastable Cu single atom (Cu1) precursor as structural seed reconstructs to an exceptional acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation catalyst under moderate operational conditions, which undergoes a copper active site reconfiguration employing reactants themselves as inducing medium. This self&#8208;evolving reconfiguration creates cooperative Cu1 and Cu nanocluster (Cun) ensemble sites with a dynamic active configuration, which is unavailable by conventional thermal reduction methodology, for adaptive multi&#8208;substrate H2 and acetylene activation. Hence, the resulting catalyst achieves full acetylene conversion with 96% ethylene selectivity and robust durability (&gt;30 h) at a record&#8208;low temperature of 120 &#176;C, superior to reported copper&#8208;based analogues. Such spontaneous active site self&#8208;evolving reconfiguration offers a new possibility for intelligent catalyst engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strong and Tough Thermosetting Epoxy Resin for Recyclable High&#8208;Performance Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epoxy&#8208;based carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced composites (EP&#8208;CFRCs) are appealing for engineering applications due to their exceptional specific strength and modulus. Nevertheless, the intrinsic brittleness and limited recyclability of highly cross&#8208;linked epoxy matrices pose significant challenges to their sustainable development. Herein, we present an approach combining dynamic ester bonds with semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer networks (SIPNs) to overcome these challenges. This strategy leverages the crosslinked epoxy network to resist deformation, while hydrogen bonds and entangled SIPNs to facilitate energy dissipation, enhancing both strength and toughness. The resultant epoxy matrix exhibits superior tensile strength of 123 MPa and record&#8208;breaking impact strength of 52.3 kJ m&#8208;2, effectively overcoming the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between strength and toughness in thermosets. This balanced performance renders it a promising matrix for high&#8208;performance EP&#8208;CFRCs, which display a tensile strength of 718&#8239;MPa and a bending deflection of 0.59&#8239;mm. Moreover, the embedded tertiary amines accelerate transesterification reactions, enabling closed&#8208;loop recycling of EP&#8208;CFRCs in water. The recycled carbon fibers and the degraded matrix can be reused in new composites and adhesives. This work presents a simple yet effective strategy for designing epoxy resin&#8208;based composites that overcome the limitations of traditional matrices and support the development of recyclable advanced materials for diverse industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying the Role of Pt Active Species in CO&#8208;Sensitive Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum (Pt) has been widely employed in photocatalytic H2 production. However, the influence of CO on proton reduction to H2 over Pt active species remains unknown. Herein, using Pt/Nb2O5 as a model catalyst, the role of Pt active species in CO&#8208;sensitive photocatalytic H2 evolution is evaluated. Our results reveal that Pt4+ species exhibits superior activity in H2 production when the CO&#8208;to&#8208;Pt molar ratio is low (nCO/nPt &#8804; 1.3), but their photocatalytic performance is suppressed at a high nCO/nPt ratio (&gt; 1000). By contrast, increasing the loading amount of Pt suppresses Pt4+ species formation and the low valence state Pt species shows inferior activity for H2 production, which is almost unaffected by the nCO/nPt ratio. The CO&#8208;TPD results, in situ FTIR spectra, and DFT calculations indicate that the role of adsorbed CO molecules is to impede the interaction between H2O and Pt4+ species and prevent the generation of *H species for H2 production. Significantly improving the H2 production rate by purging with argon suggests the importance of inhibiting the adsorption of CO on Pt4+ species. This study sheds light on the generation and transformation of active H species in CO&#8208;participated photocatalytic systems, which is missing in previous works.</dc:description>

         <title>Complex Donuts: Small Variations in DNA Sequence Dictate Pathway Complexity in DNA Nanotoroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of higher&#8208;order structures in natural biopolymers like polypeptides and nucleic acids is governed by sequence specificity and monomer chemistry. Nucleic acids can assemble into programmable nanostructures through base&#8208;pairing interactions, but their chemical diversity is limited to four nucleobases. DNA amphiphiles address this by introducing orthogonal interactions through non&#8208;nucleosidic modifications. These amphiphiles self&#8208;assemble into diverse morphologies, such as spheres, fibers, or nanosheets, with closely packed, parallel DNA strands on their exterior. This unusual arrangement creates emergent properties absent in simple DNA strands. Here, we show that the precise sequence of single&#8208;stranded DNA, independent of base&#8208;pairing, can program the self&#8208;assembled morphology of DNA amphiphiles. Remarkably, small sequence variations induce the formation of non&#8208;equilibrium DNA nanotoroids, rather than conventional morphologies. The nanotoroids form as on&#8208;pathway structures via a competitive mechanism, only when a toroid&#8208;selective DNA sequence is used. They can be stabilized non&#8208;covalently by a small molecule cross&#8208;linker or co&#8208;assembly with a secondary DNA amphiphile. Molecular dynamics demonstrated the dependence of toroid formation on the structure of the end&#8208;p stacking unit. This work introduces a new class of DNA&#8208;based nanotoroid materials with assembly properties controlled by unique sequences, akin to proteins, for applications in cell delivery, nano&#8208;filtration, nanoreactors, and materials templation.</dc:description>

         <title>Microscale Tattooing of Hydrogels and Cells: Benzoxaborole&#8208;Driven Microcontact Printing (&#181;CP) on Glycosylated Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microcontact printing (&#181;CP) is a widely used technique for microscale surface patterning. In this study, we present a polymer&#8208;supported &#181;CP method for the patterning of (bioactive) glycosylated surfaces under hydrated conditions. Patterning is achieved by direct contact with a grooved polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp, whose surface was grafted with a dopamine&#8208;containing polymer. The polymer brushes offer an anchor for the boronic acid derivative 6&#8208;aminobenzo[c][1,2]oxaborol&#8208;1(3H)&#8208;ol (ABOB), used as an ink for surface functionalization, to introduce patterns to three different surfaces as substrates: (1) monosaccharide&#8208;modified hydrogel surfaces possessing aldose (glucose, fucose, galactose) or ketose (fructose, sorbose) functions; (2) glycolsylated surfaces of polymeric microspheres; and (3) the membranes of mammalian cells, such as human primary gastric cells and others. During &#181;CP, ABOB patterns transferred to the target surface through the formation of carbohydrate&#8208;ABOB complexes at fully hydrated, neutral pH conditions. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed the successful transfer of ABOB patterns to glycosylated surfaces, with clear "tattoo&#8208;like" signatures observed on hydrogels, glycosylated particle surfaces and cellular interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Assembly of B(III)&#8208;Coordinated Fluorophores with Quantitatively Predictable Photoinduced Electron Transfer for Chemosensing and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), a foundational mechanism for constructing stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent probes, faces persistent challenges including the lack of generalizable quantitative models, limited systematic case studies, signal interference, and synthetic complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a boron&#8208;centric PeT molecular engineering strategy that harnesses the unique tetrahedral coordination geometry of B(III) centers. This approach leverages the programmable nature of boron coordination chemistry to precisely tailor &#8211;dye electronic energy levels and photophysical properties. Using dipyrromethane as a core scaffold and modulating boronic acid coordination with diverse nucleophiles (such as alcohols, phenols, and carboxylic acids), we developed a modular, multicomponent one&#8208;pot synthesis platform for efficient assembly of B&#8208;PeT dyes. Extending this strategy to pyrrolyldipyrrin and dipyrrolyldipyrrin scaffolds achieved the synthesis of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) B&#8208;PeT dyes. A library of 75 B(III)&#8208;derivatives was synthesized and characterized to enable systematic elucidation and predictive modeling of structure&#8208;PeT activity relationships, providing mechanistic insights to guide mitigation of PeT signal interference. The engineered B&#8208;PeT probes exhibit superior performance in photoactivated imaging and lysosomal pH sensing, highlighting their translational potential. Our work establishes boron coordination chemistry as a modular toolkit for rational PeT probe design, offering scalable molecular platforms for next&#8208;generation sensors with enhanced functionality and synthetic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting CO2 Fixation into Dimethyl Carbonate via Multiple Active Sites Constituted by VO&#8208;Ce&#8208;O Vacancy Clusters on Single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell CeO2&#160;Nano&#8208;sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thermodynamic stability and intrinsic kinetic inertia of CO2 present a critical challenge for its effective activation in the synthesis of high&#8208;value dimethyl carbonate (DMC). In this work, we report the fabrication of novel O&#8208;Ce&#8208;O vacancy clusters (VO&#8208;Ce&#8208;O) incorporated into CeO2&#160;nano&#8208;sheets with a near single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell thickness to construct atomically adjacent multiple active sites on their surfaces. These active sites significantly enhance the activation of both CO2 and CH3OH. Impressively, the as&#8208;prepared CeO2&#160;with&#160;VO&#8208;Ce&#8208;O&#160;catalyst exhibits an excellent DMC yield of 31.2 mmol/g, surpassing previously reported Ce&#8208;based catalysts under equivalent reaction conditions. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that oxygen vacancy increases the reducibility of lattice oxygen, facilitating CO2 activation, while cerium vacancies weaken the *CH3O adsorption, promoting the coupling reaction between *CH3O and *CO2 to form the intermediate (*CH3OC(O)2). Notably, the formation of vacancy clusters reduces the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;controlled step (*CH3OC(O)2 dissociation to *CH3OCO), thereby boosting the DMC yield.&#160;Our new findings provide valuable insights into surface engineering and active site modulation of cerium&#8208;based catalysts, offering a viable pathway for green resource utilization of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Structure Modulation of Nb2O5 by Ru Single Atoms Enabling Efficient Hydrogen Storage of Magnesium Hydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a promising solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage material due to its high capacity and low cost, but its high dehydrogenation temperature and poor kinetic limits its applications. Although catalytic modification of MgH2 has been extensively studied, existing efforts focus on optimizing hydrogen transfer, with limited exploration of electron transfer and transport. This study investigated the enhancement of electron transfer and transport rates during MgH2 de/hydrogenation by introducing a single&#8208;atom catalyst composed of Ru single atoms on a Nb2O5 substrate. The Ru0.028@Nb2O5 single&#8208;atom catalyst reduced the peak dehydrogenation temperature of MgH2 from 429 to 214 &#176;C, and the activation energies for de/hydrogenation were reduced by 53.7% and 83.9%, respectively. Furthermore, the 15wt%&#8208;Ru0.028@Nb2O5&#8208;MgH2 composite maintained 97.4% capacity after 100 cycles. Based on excellent performance and theoretical calculations, it was demonstrated that the electronic structure modulation of Nb2O5 by Ru single atoms enhanced the electron transfer and transport capacities, and the synergistic effects of single&#8208;atom Ru (dominant role), multivalent Nb, and oxygen vacancies resulted in remarkable catalytic activity. This study offers a new strategy for improving electron transfer and transport by modulating the electronic structure of catalysts, thereby increasing&#8232;catalytic activity during the solid&#8208;state pyrolysis reaction of hydrogen storage materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Biosensing of Drug&#8208;Induced Cell&#8208;Heterogeneous Injuries with an Ultrahigh Turn&#8208;On Ratio</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence probes of reactive oxygen species in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region, i.e., 800 nm and beyond, are desired for in vivo biosensing, diagnosis and pharmacology. However, the NIR dyes are typically prone to oxidative destruction, and the probes based on these dyes exhibit a poor fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratio and a low detection sensitivity. EC5 is a bright and stable NIR fluorochromic scaffold and yet has not been exploited for probe design. Despite the structural analogy of EC5 to xanthene dyes, the classic spiro&#8208;cyclization at the central methine carbon was surprisingly not applicable to EC5. Here, we report the rational development of a novel probe design strategy for EC5 dye, i.e., asymmetric conjugative addition at the vinylogous&#8208;methine carbon. EC5&#8208;H3via this approach is a robust probe for highly oxidative species. Its merits include an ultrahigh turn&#8208;on ratio of ca. 200&#8208;fold, and high resistance of the detection product toward ONOO&#8208;&#8208;mediated destruction. The feasibility of EC5&#8208;H3 for practical applications was showcased by in vivo biosensing of APAP&#8208;induced oxidative injuries to the liver. The high turn&#8208;on ratio and high brightness of the probe allow tissue injuries to be imaged with confocal microscopy to reveal the heterogeneity in oxidative injuries to different liver cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Activation of Acceptor&#8208;Acceptor Bicyclobutanes Enabled by Lewis Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the advent of various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies, the utilization of donor&#8208;acceptor bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) as a three&#8208;atom component in (3+X) cycloaddition reactions has emerged as a highly efficient platform for constructing saturated bicyclic scaffolds that can serve as arene bioisosteres. However, the application of Lewis base catalysis in such reactions remains underexplored, and the strategy for the cycloaddition of acceptor&#8211;acceptor BCBs remains unknown. Herein, we report the first formal (4+2) cycloaddition of acceptor&#8211;acceptor BCBs, which serve as a four&#8722;atom component, for the selective synthesis of pharmaceutically valuable oxa&#8208;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (oxa&#8208;BCHeps) enabled by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. BCBs and carbonyl compounds, such as aldehydes and ketones, with various functional groups, are well&#8208;tolerated under mild conditions, yielding oxa&#8208;BCHeps with up to 87% yield, competing with at least 5 side reactions.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Owing to the advent of various state-of-the-art strategies, the utilization of donor-acceptor bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) as a three-atom component in (3+X) cycloaddition reactions has emerged as a highly efficient platform for constructing saturated bicyclic scaffolds that can serve as arene bioisosteres. However, the application of Lewis base catalysis in such reactions remains underexplored, and the strategy for the cycloaddition of acceptor&#8211;acceptor BCBs remains unknown. Herein, we report the first formal (4+2) cycloaddition of acceptor&#8211;acceptor BCBs, which serve as a four&#8722;atom component, for the selective synthesis of pharmaceutically valuable oxa-bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (oxa-BCHeps) enabled by N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. BCBs and carbonyl compounds, such as aldehydes and ketones, with various functional groups, are well-tolerated under mild conditions, yielding oxa-BCHeps with up to 87% yield, competing with at least 5 side reactions. The versatility of this synthetic method is further demonstrated through derivatization of the (4+2) cycloadducts and late-stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals. The reaction mechanism and the origins of the chemoselectivity were investigated by means of density functional theory calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
