         <title>Crystallization Regulation by Self&#8208;Assembling Liquid Crystal Template Enables Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is found that the disordered growth&#160;of&#160;bottom&#160;perovskite film deteriorates the buried interface&#160;of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), so developing a new material&#160;to modify the buried interface for regulating&#160;the crystal growth and defect passivation is&#160;an effective approach for improving the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Here,&#160;we developed a new ionic liquid crystal (ILC, 1&#8208;Dodecyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) as both crystal regulator and defect passivator to modify the buried interface&#160;of PSCs. The high lattice matching between this ILC and perovskite promotes&#160;preferential growth of perovskite film along [001] direction,&#160;while the oriented&#160;ILC with mesomorphic phase&#160;has a strong chemical interaction with perovskite to passivate the interface defect,&#160;as a result, the modified&#160;buried interface exhibits suppressed defects, improved band alignment, reduced nonradiative recombination losses, and enhanced charge extraction. The ILC&#8208;modified&#160;PSC delivers a power conversion&#160;efficiency of 24.92%&#160;and&#160;maintains&#160;94% of the original value after storage in ambient&#160;for 3000&#8201;h.</dc:description>

         <title>Directional Defect Management in Perovskites by In Situ Decom&#8208;position of Organic Metal Chalcogenides for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directional defects management in polycrystalline perovskite film with inorganic passivator is highly demanded while yet realized for fabricating efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we develop a directional passivation strategy employing a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material, Cu&#8208;(4&#8208;mercaptophenol) (Cu&#8208;HBT), as a passivator precursor. Cu&#8208;HBT combines the merits of the targeted modification from organic passivator and excellent stability offered by inorganic passivator. Featuring with dense organic functional motifs on its surfaces, Cu&#8208;HBT has the capability to &#8220;find&#8221; and fasten to the Pb defect sites in perovskites through coordination interactions during a spin&#8208;coating process. During subsequent annealing treatment, the organic functional motifs cleave from Cu&#8208;HBT and convert in&#8208;situ into p&#8208;type semiconductors, Cu2S and PbS. The resultant Cu2S and PbS not only serve as stable inorganic passivators on the perovskite surface, significantly enhancing cell stability, but also facilitate efficient charge extraction and transport, resulting in an impressive efficiency of up to 23.5%. This work contributes a new defect management strategy by directionally yielding the stable inorganic passivators for highly efficient and stable PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Team for the Low&#8208;Temperature Bulk Depolymerization of Polymethacrylates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Depolymerization has been on my mind since my PhD and I started seriously thinking about how to approach this topic during my postdoctoral studies&#8230; [We] then decided to initiate a collaboration with Lewis [Manring], as he was the world expert in this area&#8212;a topic that had not been revisited since the 1990s&#8230;&#8221; Find out more about the collaborative work in the Anastasaki group.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by Athina Anastasaki of the Laboratory of Polymeric Materials at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. They recently published an article developing a low&#8208;temperature and solvent&#8208;free method to depolymerize polymers made by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The key to the success of the approach was an efficient end&#8208;group transformation of the polymers to macromonomer, which allowed up to 90&#8201;% monomer regeneration at low temperatures. &#8220;Solvent&#8208;Free Chemical Recycling of Polymethacrylates Made by ATRP and RAFT Polymerization: High&#8208;Yielding Depolymerization at Low Temperatures&#8221;, R.

         <title>Complete Glucose Electrooxidation Enabled by Coordinatively Unsaturated Copper Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose plays a vital role in biomass conversion, renewable energy, and biosensors, but significant challenges remain to achieve high selectivity and high activity simultaneously. In this study, we present a novel approach for achieving complete glucose electrooxidation utilizing Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;organic framework (Cu&#8208;MHOF) featuring coordinatively unsaturated Cu active sites. In contrast to traditional Cu(OH)2 catalysts, the Cu&#8208;MHOF exhibits a remarkable 40&#8208;fold increase in electrocatalytic activity for glucose oxidation, enabling exclusive oxidation of glucose into formate and carbonate as the final products. The critical role of open metal sites in enhancing the adsorption affinity of glucose and key intermediates was confirmed by control experiments and DFT simulations. Subsequently, a miniaturized nonenzymatic glucose sensor was developed showing superior performance with a high sensitivity of 214.7 &#181;A mM&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2, a wide detection range from 0.1 &#181;M to 22 mM, and a low detection limit of 0.086 &#181;M. Our work provides a novel molecule&#8208;level strategy for designing catalytically active sites and could inspire the development of novel MOFs for next&#8208;generation electrochemical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;efficiency Electroreduction of O2 into H2O2 over ZnCo Bimetallic Triazole Frameworks Promoted by Ligand Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as electrocatalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;&#160;ORR) are highly promising for H2O2&#160;production, but suffer from the intrinsic activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. Herein, we report a ZnCo bimetal&#8208;triazole framework (ZnCo&#8208;MTF) as high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8208;&#160;ORR electrocatalysts. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the coordination between 1,2,3&#8208;triazole and Co increases the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy on the Co&#8208;N bond, promoting the activation of Co center. Besides, the adjacent Zn&#8208;Co sites on 1,2,3&#8208;triazole enable an asymmetric "side&#8208;on" adsorption mode of O2, favoring the reduction of O2&#160;molecules and desorption of OOH* intermediate. By virtue of the unique ligand effect, the ZnCo&#8208;MTF exhibits a 2e&#8208;&#160;ORR selectivity of ~100%, onset potential of 0.614 V and H2O2&#160;production rate of 5.55 mol gcat&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1, superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art zeolite imidazole frameworks. Our work paves the way for the design of 2e&#8208;&#160;ORR electrocatalysts with desirable coordination and electronic structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Oscillation and Motion of Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Water Emulsion Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interplay of interfacial tensions on droplets results in a range of self&#8208;powered motions that mimic those of living systems and serve as a tunable model to understand their complex non&#8208;equilibrium behavior. Spontaneous shape deformations and oscillations are crucial features observed in nature but difficult to incorporate in synthetic artificial systems. Here, we report sessile oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions that exhibit rapid oscillating behavior. The oscillations depend on the nature and concentration of the surfactant, the chemical composition of the oil, and the wettability of the solid substrate. The rapid changes in the contact angle per oscillation are observed using side&#8208;view optical microscopy. We propose that the changes in the interfacial tension of the oil droplets is due to the partitioning of the surfactant into the oil phase and the movement of self&#8208;emulsified oil out of the parent droplets giving rise to the rhythmic variation in droplet contact&#8208;line. The ability to control and understand droplet oscillation can help model similar oscillations in out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium systems in nature and reproduce biomimetic behavior in artificial systems for various applications, such as microfluidic lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and adaptive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleation and Crystallization in 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskites using Formamidinium&#8208;based Organic Semiconductor Spacers for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based semiconductor spacers, namely TTFA and BTFA, respectively, were successfully developed for two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper perovskite solar cells. The nucleation and crystallization kinetics of 2D perovskite films were systematically investigated and understood using in situ optical microscopy and in situ grazing incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements. The device based on (TTFA)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n=5) achieved a record efficiency of 19.41&#8201;%.







Abstract
The conjugated organic semiconductor spacers have drawn wide attention in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites and formamidinium (FA) has been widely used as A&#8208;site cation in high&#8208;performance 3D perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the FA&#8208;based semiconductor spacers have rarely been investigated in 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) perovskites. Here, we developed two FA&#8208;based spacers containing thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (TT) and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene (BT) units, namely TTFA and BTFA, respectively, for 2D RP PSCs. The nucleation and crystallization kinetics of TTFA&#8208;Pb and BTFA&#8208;Pb from sol&#8208;gel to film were investigated using in situ optical microscopy and in situ grazing incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. It is found that the TTFA spacer could reduce the energy barrier of nucleation and induces crystal vertical orientation of 2D perovskite by forming larger clusters in precursor solution, resulting in much improved film quality. Benefiting from the enlarged crystal grains, reduced exciton binding energy, and decreased electron&#8208;phonon coupling coefficient, the photovoltaic device based on (TTFA)2MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n=5) achieved a champion efficiency of 19.41&#8201;%, which is a record for 2D RP PSCs with FA&#8208;based spacers. Our work provides deep understanding of the nucleation and crystallization process of 2D RP perovskite films and highlights the great potential of FA&#8208;based semiconductor spacers in highly efficient 2D PSCs.

         <title>Inhibiting Ion Migration Through Chemical Polymerization and Chemical Chelation Toward Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymerizable organic molecule monomer, N&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;2&#8208;propan&#8208;2&#8208;ylpent&#8208;4&#8208;enamide (Apronal), is introduced into the perovskite precursor to form a polymer (P&#8208;Apronal) through thermal crosslinking, which can effectively interact with shallow defects, leading to enhance crystallinity and reduced lattice strain, especially inhibiting the migration of I&#8722;, thus resulting in enhanced long&#8208;term stability and performance of devices.







Abstract
The migration of ions is known to be associated with various detrimental phenomena, including current density&#8208;voltage hysteresis, phase segregation, etc., which significantly limit the stability and performance of perovskite solar cells, impeding their progress toward commercial applications. To address these challenges, we propose incorporating a polymerizable organic small molecule monomer, N&#8208;carbamoyl&#8208;2&#8208;propan&#8208;2&#8208;ylpent&#8208;4&#8208;enamide (Apronal), into the perovskite film to form a crosslinked polymer (P&#8208;Apronal) through thermal crosslinking. The carbonyl and amino groups in Apronal effectively interact with shallow defects, such as uncoordinated Pb2+ and iodide vacancies, leading to the formation of high&#8208;quality films with enhanced crystallinity and reduced lattice strain. Furthermore, the introduction of P&#8208;Apronal improves energy level alignment, and facilitates charge carrier extraction and transport, resulting in a champion efficiency of 25.09&#8201;%. Importantly, P&#8208;Apronal can effectively suppress the migration of I&#8722; ions and improve the long&#8208;term stability of the devices. The present strategy sets forth a path to attain long&#8208;term stability and enhanced efficiency in perovskite solar cells.

         <dc:description>
A hierarchical porous hyper&#8208;crosslinked organometallic polymer containing Ir&#8208;abnormal NHC&#8208;based single&#8208;site molecular catalyst centers was designed and developed for CO2 hydrogenation&#8208;to&#8208;formate salt production in water that delivered an extremely high single&#8208;run TON of 50816, and excellent reusability with a cumulative TON of 285400 in 10&#8197;cycles with just 1.6&#8201;% activity loss/cycle.







Abstract
In recent times, heterogenization of homogeneous molecular catalysts onto various porous solid support structures has attracted significant research focus as a method for combining the advantages of both homogeneous as well as heterogeneous catalysis. The design of highly efficient, structurally robust and reusable heterogenized single&#8208;site catalysts for the CO2 hydrogenation reaction is a critical challenge that needs to be accomplished to implement a sustainable and practical CO2&#8208;looped renewable energy cycle. This study demonstrated a heterogenized catalyst [Ir&#8208;HCP&#8208;(B/TPM)] containing a molecular Ir&#8208;abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (Ir&#8208;aNHC) catalyst self&#8208;supported by hierarchical porous hyper&#8208;crosslinked polymer (HCP), in catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to inorganic formate (HCO2&#8722;) salt that is a prospective candidate for direct formate fuel cells (DFFC). By employing this unique and first approach of utilizing a directly knitted HCP&#8208;based organometallic single&#8208;site catalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCO2&#8722; in aqueous medium, extremely high activity with a single&#8208;run turnover number (TON) up to 50816 was achieved which is the highest so far considering all the heterogeneous catalysts for this reaction in water. Additionally, the catalyst featured excellent reusability furnishing a cumulative TON of 285400 in 10&#8197;cycles with just 1.6&#8201;% loss in activity per cycle. Overall, the new catalyst displayed attributes that are important for developing tangible catalysts for practical applications.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Fully Non&#8208;fused Ring Acceptor Enables Efficient Organic Photovoltaic Modules for Multi&#8208;Scene Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully non&#8208;fused ring acceptor, GS60, is synthesized to improve photostability and reduce material costs in Organic Solar Cells. By blending with non&#8208;fused ring polymer, PTVT&#8722;T, the obtained active layers possess favorable morphology and suppressive charge recombination. Encouragingly, manufactured large&#8208;area organic photovoltaic modules exhibit outstanding photostability and power conversion efficiency under various light conditions.







Abstract
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, with highly tunable light&#8208;response ranges, offer significant potential for use in driving low&#8208;power consumption off&#8208;grid electronics in multi&#8208;scenarios. However, development of photoactive layer materials that can meet simultaneously the requirements of diverse irradiation conditions is a still challenging task. Herein, a low&#8208;cost fully non&#8208;fused acceptor (denoted as GS60) featuring well&#8208;matched absorption spectra with solar, scattered light and artificial light radiation was designed and synthesized. Systematic characterizations revealed that GS60 possessed outstanding photoelectron properties and ideal morphology, which resulted in reduced voltage loss and suppressed charge recombination. By blending with a non&#8208;fused ring polymer PTVT&#8722;T, the as&#8208;obtained GS60 based OPV cells achieved a good power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.1&#8201;%, a high value for the cells based on non&#8208;fused ring bulk heterojunction. Besides, manufactured large&#8208;area OPV modules based on PTVT&#8722;T:GS60 yielded PCEs of 11.2&#8201;%, 11.8&#8201;%, 12.1&#8201;%, 23.1&#8201;%, and 20.3&#8201;% under irradiation of AM 1.5G, natural light of cloudy weather, natural light in shadow, laser and indoor, respectively. The PTVT&#8722;T:GS60 devices exhibited considerable potential in terms of improving photostability and reducing material cost. Overall, this work provides novel insight into the molecular design of low&#8208;cost non&#8208;fused ring acceptors, and extended potential of medium band gap acceptors based OPV cells used in various application scenarios.

&lt;p&gt;Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, with highly tunable light-response ranges, offer significant potential for use in driving low-power consumption off-grid electronics in multi-scenarios. However, development of photoactive layer materials that can meet simultaneously the requirements of diverse irradiation conditions is a still challenging task. Herein, a low-cost fully non-fused acceptor (denoted as GS60) featuring well-matched absorption spectra with solar, scattered light and artificial light radiation was designed and synthesized. Systematic characterizations revealed that GS60 possessed outstanding photoelectron properties and ideal morphology, which resulted in reduced voltage loss and suppressed charge recombination. By blending with a non-fused ring polymer PTVT&#8722;T, the as-obtained GS60 based OPV cells achieved a good power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.1&#8201;%, a high value for the cells based on non-fused ring bulk heterojunction. Besides, manufactured large-area OPV modules based on PTVT&#8722;T:GS60 yielded PCEs of 11.2&#8201;%, 11.8&#8201;%, 12.1&#8201;%, 23.1&#8201;%, and 20.3&#8201;% under irradiation of AM 1.5G, natural light of cloudy weather, natural light in shadow, laser and indoor, respectively. The PTVT&#8722;T:GS60 devices exhibited considerable potential in terms of improving photostability and reducing material cost. Overall, this work provides novel insight into the molecular design of low-cost non-fused ring acceptors, and extended potential of medium band gap acceptors based OPV cells used in various application scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ortho&#8208;Alkoxy&#8208;benzamide Directed Formation of a Single Crystalline Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Crosslinked Organic Framework and Its Boron Trifluoride Uptake and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;crystalline ortho&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;benzamide directed hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework (HCOF&#8208;50) has been synthesized for BF3 adsorption and demonstrates a record&#8208;high capacity of 14.2&#8197;mmol/g. The formed HCOF&#8208;50&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BF3 complex showed controlled BF3&#8208;releasing for more controlled cationic vinyl ether polymerization.







Abstract
Boron trifluoride (BF3) is a highly corrosive gas widely used in industry. Confining BF3 in porous materials ensures safe and convenient handling and prevents its degradation. Hence, it is highly desired to develop porous materials with high adsorption capacity, high stability, and resistance to BF3 corrosion. Herein, we designed and synthesized a Lewis basic single&#8208;crystalline hydrogen&#8208;bond crosslinked organic framework (HCOF&#8208;50) for BF3 storage and its application in catalysis. Specifically, we introduced self&#8208;complementary ortho&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;benzamide hydrogen&#8208;bonding moieties to direct the formation of highly organized hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks, which were subsequently photo&#8208;crosslinked to generate HCOFs. The HCOF&#8208;50 features Lewis basic thioether linkages and electron&#8208;rich pore surfaces for BF3 uptake. As a result, HCOF&#8208;50 shows a record&#8208;high 14.2&#8197;mmol/g BF3 uptake capacity. The BF3 uptake in HCOF&#8208;50 is reversible, leading to the slow release of BF3. We leveraged this property to reduce the undesirable chain transfer and termination in the cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers. Polymers with higher molecular weights and lower polydispersity were generated compared to those synthesized using BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O. The elucidation of the structure&#8211;property relationship, as provided by the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, combined with the high BF3 uptake capacity and controlled sorption, highlights the molecular understanding of framework&#8208;guest interactions in addressing contemporary challenges.

         <title>Tunable Chirality of Self&#8208;Assembled Dipeptide Mediated by Bipyridine Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular peptide assemblies have been widely used for the development of biomedical, catalytical, and optical materials with chiral nanostructures in view of the intrinsic chirality of peptides. However, the assembly pathway and chiral transformation behavior of various peptides remain largely elusive especially for the transient assemblies under out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions. Herein, N&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;protected phenylalanine&#8208;tyrosine dipeptide (Fmoc&#8208;FY) was used as a peptide assembly platform which was discovered that the assembly proceeds multistep evolution. The original spheres caused by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) can nucleate and elongate to the formation of right&#8208;handed helices which were metastable and easily converted to micro&#8208;ribbons. Interestingly, bipyridine derivative can be introduced to effectively control the assembly pathway and induce the formation of thermodynamically stable right&#8208;handed or left&#8208;handed helices at different stoichiometric ratios. In addition, the chiral assembly can also be regulated by ultrasound or enzyme catalysis. This minimalistic system not only broaden the nucleation&#8208;elongation mechanisms of protein aggregates but also promotes the controllable design and development of chiral biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Azonia&#8208;Naphthalene: A Cationic Hydrophilic Building Block for Stable N&#8208;Type Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Conjugated polymers that can efficiently transport both ionic and electronic charges have broad applications in next&#8208;generation optoelectronic, bioelectronic, and energy storage devices. To date, almost all the conjugated polymers have hydrophobic backbones, which impedes efficient ion diffusion/transport in aqueous media. Here, we design and synthesize a novel hydrophilic polymer building block, 4a&#8208;azonia&#8208;naphthalene (AN), drawing inspiration from biological systems. Because of the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of AN, the AN&#8208;based polymers show typical n&#8208;type charge transport behaviors. We find that cationic aromatics exhibit strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, leading to smaller &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance, interesting ion diffusion behavior, and good morphology stability. Additionally, AN enhances the hydrophilicity and ionic&#8208;electronic coupling of the polymer, which can help to improve ion diffusion/injection speed, and operational stability of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). The integration of cationic building blocks will undoubtedly enrich the material library for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Photo&#8208;Responsive Diphenylacetylene Enables PET In&#8208;Situ Upcycling with Reverse Enhanced UV&#8208;Resistance and Strength</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel in&#8208;situ chemical upcycling strategy for plastic waste is proposed by the customized diphenylacetylene monomer with dual photo&#8208;response. That is, diphenylacetylene reactive monomers are in&#8208;situ inserted into the macromolecular chain of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics/fibers through one&#8208;pot transesterification of slight&#8208;depolymerization and re&#8208;polymerization. On the one hand, the diphenylacetylene group absorbs short&#8208;wave high&#8208;energy UV rays and then releases long&#8208;wave low&#8208;energy harmless fluorescence. On the other hand, the UV&#8208;induced photo&#8208;crosslinking reaction among diphenylacetylene groups produces extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, resulting in a red&#8208;shift (due to decreased HOMO&#8208;LUMO separation) in the UV absorption band and locked crosslink points between PET chains. Therefore, with increasing UV exposure time, the upcycled PET plastics exhibit reverse enhanced UV resistance and mechanical strength (superior to original performance), instead of serious UV&#8208;photodegradation and damaged performance. This upcycling strategy at oligomer&#8208;scale not only provides a new idea for traditional plastic recycling, but also solves the common problem of gradual degradation of polymer performance during use.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Formal [4+1] Cyclization of Benzyl Alcohols and Benzaldimines: Facile Access to Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The carbon&#8208;to&#8208;silicon switch in formation of bioactive sila&#8208;heterocycles with a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center has garnered significant interest in drug discovery. However, metal&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of such scaffolds is still in its infancy. Herein, a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal [4+1] cyclization of benzyl alcohols and benzaldimines has been realized by enantioselective difunctionalization of a secondary silane reagent, affording chiral&#8208;at&#8208;silicon cyclic silyl ethers and sila&#8208;isoindolines, respectively. Mechanistic studies reveal a dual role of the rhodium&#8208;hydride catalyst. The coupling system proceeds via rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;determining dehydrogenative OH silylation of the benzyl alcohol or hydrosilylation of the imine to give an enantioenriched silyl ether or silazane intermediate, respectively. The same rhodium catalyst also enables subsequent intramolecular cyclative C&#8722;H silylation directed by the pendent Si&#8722;H group. Experimental and DFT studies have been conducted to explore the mechanism of the OH bond silylation of benzyl alcohol, where the Si&#8208;O reductive elimination from a Rh(III) hydride intermediate has been established as an enantiodetermining step.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncovering a CF3&#160;Effect on X&#8208;ray Absorption Energies of [Cu(CF3)4]&#8208;&#160;and Related Cu Compounds Using Resonant Diffraction Anomalous Fine Structure (DAFS) Measurements</title>

         <dc:description>Understanding the electronic structures of high&#8208;valent metal complexes aids the advancement of metal&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling methodologies. A prototypical complex with formally high valency is [Cu(CF3)4]&#8208;&#160;(1), which has a formal Cu(III) oxidation state but whose physical analysis has led some to a Cu(I) assignment in an inverted ligand field model. Recent examinations of&#160;1&#160;by X&#8208;ray spectroscopies have led previous authors to contradictory conclusions, motivating the re&#8208;examination of its X&#8208;ray absorption profile here by a complementary method, resonant diffraction anomalous fine structure (DAFS). From analysis of DAFS measurements for a series of seven mononuclear Cu complexes including&#160;1, here it is shown that there is a systematic trifluoromethyl effect on X&#8208;ray absorption that blue shifts the resonant Cu K&#8208;edge energy by 2&#8208;3 eV per CF3, completely accounting for observed changes in DAFS profiles between formally Cu(III) complexes like&#160;1&#160;and formally Cu(I) complexes like (Ph3P)3CuCF3&#160;(3). Thus, in agreement with the inverted ligand field model, the data presented herein imply that&#160;1&#160;is best described as containing a Cu(I) ion with dn&#160;count approaching 10.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dynamic Magnetic Driving Tandem Chip Enables Rapid Isolation and Multiplexed Profiling of Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The protein phenotypes of extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring. However,  the technical challenges in rapid isolation and multiplexed molecular detection of EVs have limited their clinical practice. Herein, we developed a dynamic magnetic driving tandem chip to achieve streamlined rapid isolation and multiplexed profiling of surface protein biomarkers of EVs. Driven by magnetic force, the magnetic nanomixers not only act as tiny stir bars to promote mass transfer and enhance reaction efficiency of EVs, but also transport on communicating vessels of tandem chip continuously and expedite the assay workflow. We designed cyclic surface enhancement of Raman scattering (SERS) tags to bind with target EVs and then release them by exonuclease I, eliminating steric hindrance and amplifying the SERS signal of multiple protein biomarkers on EVs. Due to the excellent assay performance, six breast cancer biomarkers were detected simultaneously on EVs using only 10 &#956;L plasma within 1.5 h. The unweighted SUM signature offers great accuracy in discriminating breast cancer patients from healthy donors. Overall, the dynamic magnetic driving tandem chip offers a new avenue to advance the clinical application of EV&#8208;based liquid biopsy.</dc:description>

         <title>Distinguishing Protein Chemical Topologies Using Supercharging Ion Mobility Spectrometry&#8208;Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A technique combining ion mobility spectrometry&#8208;mass spectrometry (IMS&#8208;MS) and supercharging electrospray ionization (ESI) has been demonstrated to differentiate protein chemical topology effectively. Incorporating as many charges as possible into proteins via supercharging ESI allows the protein chains to be largely unfolded and stretched, revealing their hidden chemical topology. Different chemical topologies result in differing geometrical sizes of the unfolded proteins due to constraints in torsional rotations in cyclic domains. By introducing new topological indices, such as the chain&#8208;length&#8208;normalized collision cross&#8208;section (CCS) and the maximum charge state in the extensively unfolded state, we were able to successfully differentiate various protein chemical topologies, including linear chains, ring&#8208;containing topologies (lasso, tadpole, multicyclics, etc.), and mechanically interlocked rings, like catenanes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sulfur Monoxide Surrogate Designed for the Synthesis of Sulfoxides and Sulfinamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur monoxide (SO) is a highly reactive species that cannot be isolated in bulk. However, SO can play a pivotal role as a fundamental building block in organic synthesis. Reported herein is the design and application of a sulfinylhydrazine reagent as an easily prepared sulfur monoxide surrogate. We show facile thermal SO transfer from this reagent to dienes where a reaction using a mechanistic probe suggests the generation of singlet SO. Combined with Grignard reagents and appropriate carbon or nitrogen electrophiles, the reagent serves as an effective &#8220;SO&#8221; donor to enable the one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component synthesis of sulfoxides and sulfinamides.</dc:description>

         <title>A Phosphine&#8208;Amine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework with Staggered Stacking Structure for Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;plane ionic conduction over two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials is desirable for flexible electronics. Exfoliating 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) towards a few layers is highly anticipated, whereas most examples remain robust via &#960;&#8208;stacking against the interlayered dislocation. Herein, we synthesize a phosphine&#8208;amine&#8208;linked 2D COF by a nucleophilic substitution reaction of phosphazene with amines. The synthesized COF is crystalline, and stacks in an AB&#8208;staggered fashion, wherein the AB dual layers are interlocked by embedding P&#8208;Cl bonds from one to another layer, and the non&#8208;interlocked layers are readily delaminated. Therefore, in&#8208;situ post&#8208;quaternization over phosphazene can improve the ionization of backbones, accompanied by layered exfoliation. The ultrathin nanosheets can decouple lithium salts for fast solid&#8208;state ion transport, achieving a high conductivity and low activation energy. Our findings explore the P&#8208;N substitution reaction for COF crystallization and demonstrate that the staggered stacking 2D COFs are readily exfoliated for designing solid electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Nitrogen Binding Sites in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient N2/O2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous materials with d3 electronic configuration open metal sites have been proved to be effective adsorbents for N2 capture and N2/O2 separation. However, the reported materials remain challenging to address the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity. Herein, we report a robust MOF, MIL&#8208;102Cr, that features two binding sites, can synergistically afford strong interactions for N2 capture. The synergistic adsorption site exhibits a benchmark Qst of 45.0 kJ mol&#8208;1 for N2 among the Cr&#8208;based MOFs, a record&#8208;high volumetric N2 uptake (31.38 cm3 cm&#8208;3), and highest N2/O2 selectivity (13.11) at 298 K and 1.0 bar. Breakthrough experiments reveal that MIL&#8208;102Cr can efficiently capture N2 from a 79/21 N2/O2 mixture, providing a record 99.99% pure O2 productivity of 0.75 mmol g&#8208;1. In situ infrared spectroscopy and computational modelling studies revealed that a synergistic adsorption effect by open Cr(III) and fluorine sites was accountable for the strong interactions between the MOF and N2.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Induced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Deaminative Arylation of Amino Acid Derivatives Assisted by Phenol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of value&#8208;added conversions of naturally abundant amino acids has received considerable attention from the synthetic community. Compared with the well&#8208;established asymmetric decarboxylative transformation, the asymmetric deaminative transformation of amino acids still remains a formidable challenge, mainly due to the lack of effective strategies for the C&#8208;N bond activation and the potential incompatibility with chiral catalysts. Here, we disclose a photoinduced Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric deaminative coupling reaction of amino acids with arylboronic acids. This new protocol provides a series of significant chiral phenylacetamides in generally good yields and excellent stereoselectivity under mild and green conditions (42&#8208;85% yields, up to 97% ee). Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations were performed to reveal the crucial role of additional phenols in improving catalytic efficiency and enantiocontrol.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;allylarylsilyl)aryl triflates has been developed to give highly fused tetrahydrophenanthrosilole derivatives via unprecedented 1,5&#8208;C&#8211;Pd/C&#8211;Si bond exchange. The reaction pathways can be switched toward 4&#8208;membered ring&#8208;forming C(sp2)&#8211;H alkylation by tuning the reaction conditions to give completely different products, fused dihydrodibenzosilepin derivatives, from the same starting materials.

         <title>Diadenosine Tetraphosphate (Ap4A) Serves as a 5&#8217; RNA Cap in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent expansion of the field of RNA chemical modifications has changed our understanding of post&#8208;transcriptional gene regulation. Apart from internal nucleobase modifications, 7&#8208;methylguanosine was long thought to be the only eukaryotic RNA cap. However, the discovery of non&#8208;canonical RNA caps in eukaryotes revealed a new niche of previously undetected RNA chemical modifications. We are the first to report the existence of a new non&#8208;canonical RNA cap &#8208; diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) &#8208; in human and rat cell lines. Ap4A is the most abundant dinucleoside polyphosphate in eukaryotic cells and can be incorporated into RNA by RNA polymerases as a non&#8208;canonical initiating nucleotide (NCIN). Using liquid chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry (LC&#8208;MS), we show that the amount of capped Ap4A&#8208;RNA is independent of the cellular concentration of Ap4A. A decapping enzyme screen identifies two enzymes cleaving Ap4A&#8208;RNA &#8208; NUDT2 and DXO, both of which also cleave other substrate RNAs in vitro. We further assess the translatability and immunogenicity of Ap4A&#8208;RNA and show that although it is not translated, Ap4A&#8208;RNA is recognized as self by the cell and does not elicit an immune response, making it a natural component of the transcriptome. Our findings open a previously unexplored area of eukaryotic RNA regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoconvergent 1,4&#8208;Hydrosilylation of Conjugated Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoconvergent transformation of E/Z mixtures of olefins to products with a single steric configuration is of great practical importance but hard to achieve. Herein, we report an iron&#8208;catalyzed stereoconvergent 1,4&#8208;hydrosilylation reactions of E/Z mixtures of readily available conjugated dienes for the synthesis of Z&#8208;allylsilanes with high regioselectivity and exclusive stereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reactions most likely proceed through a two&#8208;electron redox mechanism. The stereoselectivity of the reactions is ultimately determined by the crowded reaction cavity of the &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand&#8211;modified iron catalyst, which forces the conjugated diene to coordinate with the iron center in a cis conformation, which in turn results in generation of an anti&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl iron intermediate. The mechanism of this stereoconvergent transformation differs from previously reported mechanisms of other related reactions involving radicals or metal&#8208;hydride species.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Tunable Phase Behavior and Intrinsic Fluorescence in Dynamically Interacting Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A conceptual framework of understanding of biological condensed phases is emerging, derived from biological, biomimetic, and synthetic sequences. However, de novo peptide condensate design remains a challenge due to incomplete understanding of the structural and interaction complexity. We designed peptide modules based on a simple repeat motif composed of tripeptide spacers (GSG, SGS, GLG) interspersed with adhesive amino acids (R/H and Y). We show, using sequence editing and a combination of computation and experiment, that n&#8594;&#960;* interactions in GLG backbones are a dominant factor in providing sufficient backbone structure, which in turn regulates the water interface, collectively promoting liquid droplet formation. Moreover, these R(GLG)Y and H(GLG)Y condensates unexpectedly display sequence&#8208;dependent emission that is a consequence of their non&#8208;covalent network interactions, and readily observable by confocal microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Bicyclic Guanidine Promoted Mechanistically Divergent Depolymerization and Recycling of a Biobased Polycarbonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We here report the organocatalytic and temperature&#8208;controlled depolymerization of biobased poly(limonene carbonate) providing access to its trans&#8208;configured cyclic carbonate as the major product. The base TBD (1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) offers a unique opportunity to break down polycarbonates via end&#8208;group activation or main chain scission pathways as supported by various controls and computational analysis. These energetically competitive processes represent an unprecedented divergent approach to polycarbonate recycling. The trans limonene carbonate can be converted back to its polycarbonate via ring&#8208;opening polymerization using the same organocatalyst in the presence of an alcohol initiator, offering thus a potential circular and practical route for polycarbonate recycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Mediator Duality of 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene in Electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Bond Formation with Alkyl Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene acts as a substrate and a mediator in an electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond&#8208;forming reaction with alkyl bromides. The reaction conditions avoid competing alkyl radical homocoupling and allows for the accommodation of alkyl bromides with oxidatively sensitive and acidic functional groups that are difficult to incorporate using alternative C(sp3) precursors.







Abstract
Electrochemical approaches to form C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds have focused on coupling C(sp3) electrophiles that form stabilized carbon&#8208;centered radicals upon reduction or oxidation. Whereas alkyl bromides are desirable C(sp3) coupling partners owing to their availability and cost&#8208;effectiveness, their tendency to undergo radical&#8208;radical homocoupling makes them challenging substrates for electroreductive cross&#8208;coupling. Herein, we disclose a metal&#8208;free regioselective cross&#8208;coupling of 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene, a useful precursor to aromatic nitriles, and alkyl bromides. Alkyl bromide reduction is mediated directly by 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene radical anions, leading to negligible homocoupling and high cross&#8208;selectivity to form 1,4&#8208;alkyl cyanobenzenes. The cross&#8208;coupling scheme is compatible with oxidatively sensitive and acidic functional groups such as amines and alcohols, which have proven difficult to incorporate in alternative electrochemical approaches using carboxylic acids as C(sp3) precursors.

     alt="Substrate-Mediator Duality of 1,4-Dicyanobenzene in Electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Bond Formation with Alkyl Bromides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1,4-Dicyanobenzene acts as a substrate and a mediator in an electrochemical C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bond-forming reaction with alkyl bromides. The reaction conditions avoid competing alkyl radical homocoupling and allows for the accommodation of alkyl bromides with oxidatively sensitive and acidic functional groups that are difficult to incorporate using alternative C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) precursors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical approaches to form C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bonds have focused on coupling C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) electrophiles that form stabilized carbon-centered radicals upon reduction or oxidation. Whereas alkyl bromides are desirable C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) coupling partners owing to their availability and cost-effectiveness, their tendency to undergo radical-radical homocoupling makes them challenging substrates for electroreductive cross-coupling. Herein, we disclose a metal-free regioselective cross-coupling of 1,4-dicyanobenzene, a useful precursor to aromatic nitriles, and alkyl bromides. Alkyl bromide reduction is mediated directly by 1,4-dicyanobenzene radical anions, leading to negligible homocoupling and high cross-selectivity to form 1,4-alkyl cyanobenzenes. The cross-coupling scheme is compatible with oxidatively sensitive and acidic functional groups such as amines and alcohols, which have proven difficult to incorporate in alternative electrochemical approaches using carboxylic acids as C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) precursors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supracluster Assembly of Archimedean Cages with 72 Hydrogen Bonds for the Aldol Addition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al&#8722;O clusters&#8208;based supraclusters presenting multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonded porous assemblies can offer outstanding catalysis ability both in the homogeneous and heterogeneous phases. The supracluster proposed here will build a bridge between &#8220;supramolecule&#8221; and &#8220;supraparticle&#8221;, and provide new perspectives for synthesizing zeolite&#8208;like materials.







Abstract
Clusters that can be experimentally precisely characterized and theoretically accurately calculated are essential to understanding the relationship between material structure and function. Here, we propose the concept of &#8220;supraclusters&#8221;, which aim to connect &#8220;supramolecules&#8221; and &#8220;suprananoparticles&#8221; as well as reveal the unique assembly behavior of &#8220;supraclusters&#8221; with nanoparticle size at the molecular level. The implementation of supraclusters is full of challenges due to the difficulty in satisfying the ordered connectivity of clusters due to their abundant and dispersed hydrogen bonding sites. By solvothermal synthesis under a high catechol (H2CATs) content, we successfully isolated a series of triangular {Al6M3} cluster compounds possessing brucite&#8208;like structural features. Interestingly, eight {Al6M3} clusters form 72&#8208;fold strong hydrogen bonding truncatedhexahedron Archimedean {Al6M3}8 supracluster cage (abbreviated as H&#8208;tcu). Surprisingly, the solution stability of the H&#8208;tcu was further proved by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) characterization. Therefore, it is not difficult to explain the reason for assembly of H&#8208;tcu into edge&#8208;directed and vertex&#8208;directed isomers. These porous supraclusters can be obtained by scale&#8208;up synthesis and exhibit a noticeable catalysis effect towards the condensation of acetone and p&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde. As an intermediate state of supramolecule and suprananoparticle, the supracluster assembly can enrich the cluster chemistry and bring new structural types.

         <title>Precision Sequence&#8208;Defined Polymers: From Sequencing to Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent advances in sequence&#8208;defined synthetic polymers (SDPs), focusing on newly developed sequencing methods including tandem mass spectrometry (MS) based on bond&#8208;selective cleavage and biased ionization, and primary MS based on cascade degradation. Their biological functions are also highlighted, and future perspectives of SDPs outlined.







Abstract
Precise sequence&#8208;defined polymers (SDPs) with uniform chain&#8208;to&#8208;chain structure including chain length, unit sequence, and end functionalities represent the pinnacle of sophistication in the realm of polymer science. For example, the absolute control over the unit sequence of SDPs allows for the bottom&#8208;up design of polymers with hierarchical microstructures and functions. Accompanied with the development of synthetic techniques towards precision SDPs, the decoding of SDP sequences and construction of advanced functions irreplaceable by other synthetic materials is of central importance. In this Minireview, we focus on recent advances in SDP sequencing techniques including tandem mass spectrometry (MS), chemically assisted primary MS, as well as other non&#8208;destructive sequencing methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD), and nanopore sequencing. Additionally, we delve into the promising prospects of SDP functions in the area of cutting&#8208;edge biological research. Topics of exploration include gene delivery systems, the development of hybrid materials combining SDPs and nucleic acids, protein recognition and regulation, as well as the interplay between chirality and biological functions. A brief outlook towards the future directions of SDPs is also presented.

         <title>High&#8208;Spin and Reactive Fe13 Cluster with Exposed Metal Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high nuclearity Fe13 cluster with metal&#8208;metal interactions was prepared from a WFe3S3 precursor. This compound displays a large room temperature spin value and undergoes core structural rearrangement upon multielectron group transfer chemistry.







Abstract
Atomically defined large metal clusters have applications in new reaction development and preparation of materials with tailored properties. Expanding the synthetic toolbox for reactive high nuclearity metal complexes, we report a new class of Fe clusters, Tp*4W4Fe13S12, displaying a Fe13 core with M&#8722;M bonds that has precedent only in main group and late metal chemistry. M13 clusters with closed shell electron configurations can show significant stability and have been classified as superatoms. In contrast, Tp*4W4Fe13S12 displays a large spin ground state of S=13. This compound performs small molecule activations involving the transfer of up to 12 electrons resulting in significant cluster rearrangements.

         <title>Construction of Low&#8208;Coordination Cu&#8722;C2 Single&#8208;Atoms Electrocatalyst Facilitating the Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the special structure of 1,3,5&#8208;triynylbenzene, Cu single atom catalysts with a Cu&#8722;C2 coordination structure were prepared for the first time and showed excellent performance in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (e&#8208;CO2RR) process. Comprehensive experiments and calculations confirmed that the Cu&#8722;C2 structure not only endowed the Cu single atoms center with more positive charge, but also promoted the formation of H&#8901;, which improved the electrocatalytic performance of CO2RR to CH4.







Abstract
Constructing Cu single&#8208;atoms (SAs) catalysts is considered as one of the most effective strategies to enhance the performance of electrochemical reduction of CO2 (e&#8208;CO2RR) towards CH4, however there are challenges with activity, selectivity, and a cumbersome fabrication process. Herein, by virtue of the meta&#8208;position structure of alkynyl in 1,3,5&#8208;triethynylbenzene and the interaction between Cu and &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;, a Cu SAs electrocatalyst (Cu&#8722;SAs/HGDY), containing low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8722;C2 active sites, was synthesized through a simple and efficient one&#8208;step method. Notably, this represents the first achievement of preparing Cu SAs catalysts with Cu&#8722;C2 coordination structure, which exhibited high CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 selectivity (72.1&#8201;%) with a high CH4 partial current density of 230.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and a turnover frequency as high as 2756&#8197;h&#8722;1, dramatically outperforming currently reported catalysts. Comprehensive experiments and calculations verified the low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8722;C2 structure not only endowed the Cu SAs center more positive electricity but also promoted the formation of H&#8226;, which contributed to the outstanding e&#8208;CO2RR to CH4 electrocatalytic performance of Cu&#8722;SAs/HGDY. Our work provides a novel H&#8901;&#8208;transferring mechanism for e&#8208;CO2RR to CH4 and offers a protocol for the preparation of two&#8208;coordinated Cu SAs catalysts.

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Micro&#8208;Hydrophobic Effect Regulates Benzene Methylation in Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water is a ubiquitous component in heterogeneous catalysis over zeolites and can significantly influence the catalyst performance. However, the detailed mechanism insights into zeolite&#8208;catalyzed reactions under microscale aqueous environment remain elusive. Here, using multiple dimensional solid&#8208;state NMR experiments coupled with ultrahigh magic angle&#160;spinning technique and theoretical simulations, we establish a fundamental understanding of the role of water in benzene methylation over ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite under water vapor conditions. We show that water competes with benzene for the active sites of zeolite and facilitates the bimolecular reaction mechanism. The growth of water clusters induces micro&#8208;hydrophobic effect in zeolite pores, which reorients benzene molecules and drives their interactions with surface methoxy species (SMS) on zeolite. We identify the formation and evolution of active benzene&#8208;SMS complexes in microscale aqueous environment and demonstrate that their accumulation in zeolite pores boosts benzene conversion and methylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometrically Compelled Silicon(II)/Silicon(IV) Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interaction Enables the Enamination of Nitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrido&#8208;benzosiloles bearing a side arm of the silylenyl group are prepared, all featuring the unique silicon(II)&#8594;silicon(IV) donor&#8208;acceptor interaction that facilitates the enamination of &#945;&#8208;H&#8208;bearing nitriles to afford the edge&#8208;fused Si&#8208;heterotricycles.







Abstract
Discovering new bonding scenarios and subsequently exploring the reactivity contribute substantially to advance the main group element chemistry. Herein, we report on the isolation and characterization of an intriguing class of the hydrido&#8208;benzosiloles 2&#8211;4. These compounds exhibit a side arm of the amidinatosilylenyl group, featuring unidirectional silicon(II)/silicon(IV) donor&#8208;acceptor interaction on account of the geometric constraint. Furthermore, the reactions involving 2&#8211;4 with nitriles yield the tricyclic compounds that edge&#8208;fused of the Si&#8208;heteroimidazolidine&#8208;CN2Si2, silole&#8208;C4Si, and phenyl&#8208;C6&#8208;rings (5&#8211;13). These compounds are manifesting a unique reaction that the silicon(II)/silicon(IV) interaction enables the enamination of the &#945;&#8208;H&#8208;bearing nitriles. The reaction mechanism involved in H&#8208;shift under oxidative addition at silylene followed by hydrosilylation of a ketenimine intermediate was revealed by density function theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Toughening Brittle Bio&#8208;P3HB with Synthetic P3HB of Engineered Stereomicrostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The longstanding mechanical brittleness issue associated with stereoperfect biological or synthetic P3HB is solved through blending it with synthetic P3HB with specifically engineered stereomicrostructures, which not only drastically enhances the toughness by &gt;156&#215; and optical clarity but also largely maintains its otherwise desirably high elastic modulus, tensile strength, melting temperature.







Abstract
Poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB), a biologically produced, biodegradable natural polyester, exhibits excellent thermal and barrier properties but suffers from mechanical brittleness, largely limiting its applications. Here we report a mono&#8208;material product design strategy to toughen stereoperfect, brittle bio or synthetic P3HB by blending it with stereomicrostructurally engineered P3HB. Through tacticity ([mm] from 0 to 100&#8201;%) and molecular weight (Mn to 788&#8197;kDa) tuning, high&#8208;performance synthetic P3HB materials with tensile strength to &#8776;30&#8197;MPa, fracture strain to &#8776;800&#8201;%, and toughness to 126&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3 (&gt;110&#215; tougher than bio&#8208;P3HB) have been produced. Physical blending of the brittle P3HB with such P3HB in 10 to 90&#8197;wt&#8201;% dramatically enhances its ductility from &#8776;5&#8201;% to 95&#8211;450&#8201;% and optical clarity from 19&#8201;% to 85&#8201;% visible light transmittance while maintaining desirably high elastic modulus (&gt;1&#8197;GPa), tensile strength (&gt;35&#8197;MPa), and melting temperature (160&#8211;170&#8201;&#176;C). This P3HB&#8208;toughening&#8208;P3HB methodology departs from the traditional approach of incorporating chemically distinct components to toughen P3HB, which hinders chemical or mechanical recycling, highlighting the potential of the mono&#8208;material product design solely based on biodegradable P3HB to deliver P3HB materials with diverse performance properties.

         <title>Substrates and Cyclic Peptide Inhibitors of the Oligonucleotide&#8208;Activated Sirtuin 7
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Broad screening of the substrate specificity of SIRT7 revealed a strong preference for the cleavage of long&#8208;chain acyllysine modifications. The activity was substantially increased in the presence of oligonucleotides or nucleosome particles. Finally, random nonstandard peptide integrated discovery (RaPID) delivered a cyclopeptide with potency in the sub&#8208;micromolar range and selectivity for SIRT7, which binds and stabilizes SIRT7 in cells.







Abstract
The sirtuins are NAD+&#8208;dependent lysine deacylases, comprising seven isoforms (SIRT1&#8211;7) in humans, which are involved in the regulation of a plethora of biological processes, including gene expression and metabolism. The sirtuins share a common hydrolytic mechanism but display preferences for different &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;acyllysine substrates. SIRT7 deacetylates targets in nuclei and nucleoli but remains one of the lesser studied of the seven isoforms, in part due to a lack of chemical tools to specifically probe SIRT7 activity. Here we expressed SIRT7 and, using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, reveal SIRT7 to be a monomeric enzyme with a low degree of globular flexibility in solution. We developed a fluorogenic assay for investigation of the substrate preferences of SIRT7 and to evaluate compounds that modulate its activity. We report several mechanism&#8208;based SIRT7 inhibitors as well as de novo cyclic peptide inhibitors selected from mRNA&#8208;display library screening that exhibit selectivity for SIRT7 over other sirtuin isoforms, stabilize SIRT7 in cells, and cause an increase in the acetylation of H3&#8201;K18.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared emitting gold nanoclusters with reversible pH responsiveness have been developed by the incorporation of tertiary amine groups in the surface ligands. The amine groups change the highest occupied molecular orbital upon their pH&#8208;induced protonation and deprotonation, resulting in photoluminescence quenching.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores with pH&#8208;responsive properties suggest merits in biological analyses. This work establishes a general and effective method to obtain pH&#8208;responsive NIR emissive gold nanoclusters by introducing aliphatic tertiary amine (TA) groups into the ligands. Computational study suggests that the pH&#8208;responsive NIR emission is associated with electronic structure change upon protonation and deprotonation of TA groups. Photo&#8208;induced electron transfer between deprotonated TA groups and the surface Au&#8208;S motifs of gold nanoclusters can disrupt the radiative transitions and thereby decrease the photoluminescence intensity in basic environments (pH=7&#8211;11). By contrast, protonated TA groups curb the electron transfer and restore the photoluminescence intensity in acidic environments (pH=4&#8211;7). The pH&#8208;responsive NIR&#8208;emitting gold nanoclusters serve as a specific and sensitive probe for the lysosomes in the cells, offering non&#8208;invasive emissions without interferences from intracellular autofluorescence.

         <title>Localized Anion&#8208;Cation Aggregated Aqueous Electrolytes with Accelerated Kinetics for Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc metal batteries hold great promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage because of their high safety, rich material resources and low cost. However, the freeze of aqueous electrolytes hinders low&#8208;temperature operation of the batteries. Here, aqueous localized anion&#8208;cation aggregated electrolyte composed of Zn(BF4)2 as the salt and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the diluent, are developed to improve the low&#8208;temperature performance of the Zn anode. THF promotes the inclusion of BF4&#713; in the solvation sheath of Zn2+, facilitating the formation of ZnF2&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase. THF also affects the hydrogen bonding between neighboring H2O molecules, effectively lowering the freezing point. Therefore, the full cells of Zn||polyaniline (PANI) exhibit an ultralong cycle life of 8000 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.99% at &#8208;40 &#176;C. Impressively, the pouch cells display a high capacity retention of 86.2% after 500 cycles at &#8208;40 &#176;C, which demonstrates the great prospect of such electrolytes in cold regions. This work provides new insights for the design of low&#8208;temperature aqueous electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Length&#8208;dependent Magnetic Evolution of Anthenes on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanographenes with zigzag edges, for example, anthenes, exhibit a unique nonbonding &#960;&#8208;electron state, which can be described as a spin&#8208;polarized edge state that yields specific magnetic ground state. However, prior researches on the magnetism of anthenes with varying lengths on a surface is lacking. This study systematically fabricated anthenes with inherent zigzag carbon atoms of different lengths ranging from bisanthene to hexanthene. Their magnetic evolution on the Au(111) surface was analyzed through bond&#8208;resolved scanning probe techniques and density functional theory calculations. The analyses revealed a transition in magnetic properties associated with the length of the anthenes, arising from the imbalance between hybridization energy and the Coulomb repulsion between valence electrons. With the increasing length of the anthenes, the ground state transforms gradually from a closed&#8208;shell to an antiferromagnetic open&#8208;shell singlet, exhibiting a weak exchange coupling of 4 meV and a charge transfer&#8211;induced doublet. Therefore, this study formulated a chemically tunable platform to explore size&#8208;dependent &#960; magnetism at the atomic scale, providing a framework for research in organic spintronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial Distribution of Nitrogen Binding Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Selective Ethane Adsorption and One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The one&#8208;step purification of ethylene (C2H4) from mixtures containing ethane (C2H6) and acetylene (C2H2) is an industrially important yet challenging process. In this work, we present a site&#8208;engineering strategy aimed at manipulating the spatial distribution of binding sites within a confined pore space. We realized successfully by incorporating nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, such as indole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid (Ind), benzimidazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid (Bzz), and indazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid (Izo), into the robust MOF&#8208;808 platform via post&#8208;synthetic modification. The resulting functionalized materials, namely MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Ind, MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Bzz, and MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Izo, demonstrated significantly improved selectivity for C2H2 and C2H6 over C2H4. MOF&#8208;808&#8208;Bzz with two uniformly distributed nitrogen binding sites gave the optimal geometry for selective ethane trapping through multiple strong C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bonds, leading to the highest C2H2/C2H4 and C2H6/C2H4 combined selectivities among known MOFs. Column breakthrough experiments validated its ability to purify C2H4 from ternary C2H2/C2H4/C2H6 mixtures in a single step.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics on Electrosynthesis and Assembly of Conjugated Metallopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to edge&#8208;on and face&#8208;on orientations, end&#8208;on uniaxial conjugated polymers have the theoretical possibility of providing a macroscopic crystalline film. However, their fabrication is insurmountable due to sluggishly thermodynamic equilibrium states. Herein, we report the programmatic pathway to fabricate nanoarchitectonics on end&#8208;on uniaxial conjugated metallopolymers by surface&#8208;initiated simultaneous electrosynthesis and assembly. Self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) with bottom&#8208;up oriented electroactive molecules as a temple allows orientation, stacking, and reactive addition of monomers triggered by switching alternative redox reactions as well as crystallization of small molecules. Repeating the same reaction can repair the unreactive site on the SAM and dynamically and statistically ensure maximum iterative coverage with ideal linear coefficients between optical or electrical responses and iterative times. The resulting nanoarchitectonics on uniaxially assembled end&#8208;on polymers over centimeter&#8208;sized areas have a subnanometer&#8208;uniform morphology and exhibit ultrahigh modulus as well as an inorganic indium tin oxides and the highest conductance among conjugated molecular monolayers. Their memristive devices provide quantitative electrical and optical responses as a function of molecular length, bias, and iterative junctions. Precise processing of nanoarchitectonics as an electrically assisted assembly or printing technique can present sophisticated optoelectric functions and dimensional batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch consistency for micro&#8208;sized organic materials and electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Engineering of BiVO4 for Photochemical Sensing of H2S Gas at Ultra&#8208;low Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a photochemical BiVO4 sensing material, which possesses a large proportion of (110) and (011) facets combined with the additional (111) facets, for the selective detection of ultra&#8208;low concentration hydrogen sulfide (H2S) driven by visible light. Specifically, the obtained octadecahedron BiVO4 (Octa&#8208;BiVO4) performs a high response value (67) and short response time (47.4 s) to 100 ppm H2S with good stability for nearly 100 days, as well as undisturbedness by moist air. With the combination of experimental and theoretical calculation results, the adsorption and carrier transfer behaviors of H2S molecules on the Octa&#8208;BiVO4 crystal surface are investigated. By adjusting the ratio of different crystal facets and controlling the facets with characteristic adsorption, we achieve improved anisotropic photoinduced carrier separation and high selectivity for a specific gas. Furthermore, this facial facet engineering can be extended to the synthesis of other sensing materials, offering huge opportunities for fundamental research and technological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Driven Quasi&#8208;Topological Transformation Exposing Highly Active Nitrogen Cation Sites for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the exposure of highly&#8208;active nitrogen cation sites has been accomplished by photo&#8208;driven quasi&#8208;topological transformation of a 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;dione&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF), which contributes to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis during the 2&#8208;electron O2 photoreduction. The exposed nitrogen cation sites with photo&#8208;enhanced Lewis acidity not only act as the electron&#8208;transfer motor to adjust the inherent charge distribution, powering continuous and stable charge separation, and broadening visible&#8208;light adsorption, but also providing a large number of active sites for O2 adsorption. The optimal catalyst shows a high H2O2 production rate of 11965 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation and a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 12.9 % at 400 nm, better than most of the previously reported COF photocatalysts. This work provides new insights for designing photo&#8208;switchable nitrogen cation sites as catalytic centers toward efficient solar to chemical energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Decomposition of Perfluorocarbons for over 1000 Hours via Active Site Regeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ga assists the defluorination of Al&#8722;F over a Ga/&#952;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst. Al&#8722;OH reacts with CF4 to form Al&#8722;F, resulting in fluorine poisoning on the Al active sites. Adsorption of F at the Al active site is strong and limits the regeneration of the Al&#8722;OH site. However, Ga exhibits weaker adsorption of F and the resulting Ga&#8722;F can easily hydrolyze to Ga&#8722;OH, which can assist the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites through a dehydration&#8208;like process.







Abstract
Tetrafluoromethane (CF4), the simplest perfluorocarbon (PFC), has the potential to exacerbate global warming. Catalytic hydrolysis is a viable method to degrade CF4, but fluorine poisoning severely restricts both the catalytic performance and catalyst lifetime. In this study, Ga is introduced to effectively assists the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites, leading to highly efficient CF4 decomposition at 600&#8201;&#176;C with a catalytic lifetime exceeding 1,000&#8197;hours. 27Al and 71Ga magic&#8208;angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MAS NMR) showed that the introduced Ga exists as tetracoordinated Ga sites (GaIV), which readily dissociate water to form Ga&#8722;OH. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and density function theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that Ga&#8722;OH assists the defluorination of poisoned Al active sites via a dehydration&#8208;like process. As a result, the Ga/Al2O3 catalyst achieved 100&#8201;% CF4 decomposition keeping an ultra&#8208;long catalytic lifetime and outperforming reported results. This work proposes a new approach for efficient and long&#8208;term CF4 decomposition by promoting the regeneration of active sites.

         <title>Counting d&#8208;Orbital Vacancies of Transition&#8208;Metal Catalysts for the Sulfur Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single electronic&#8208;structure descriptor is proposed by linking the d charge for transition metals to the reaction rate for the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR). This descriptor provides guidelines for the design of catalysts for the SRR as well as various processes and has great promise for driving lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries to practical applications.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) would allow the production of renewable high&#8208;capacity rechargeable lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries using sustainable and nontoxic elemental sulfur as a cathode material, but its slow reaction rate causes a serious shuttle effect and dramatically reduces the capacity. We found that a catalyst composed of Pd nanoparticles supported by ordered mesoporous carbon (Pd/OMC) had a high reaction rate in the SRR, and a Li&#8208;S battery assembled with this catalyst had a low shuttle constant of 0.031&#8197;h&#8722;1 and a high&#8208;rate performance with a specific capacity of 1527&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C which is close to the theoretical value. The high activity of Pd/OMC with a d&#8208;orbital vacancy of 0.87&#8197;e was predicted from a volcano relationship between the d charge for the metal and the adsorption activation entropy and reaction rate for the SRR by examining Pd, Au, Pt, Rh, and Ru transition&#8208;metal nanocatalysts. The strategy of using a single electronic structure descriptor to design high&#8208;efficiency SRR catalysts has suggested a way to produce practical Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Tuning Binding Strength of Multiple Intermediates towards Efficient pH&#8208;universal Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy Heterocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective and stable Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy heterocatalysts are synthesized for pH&#8208;universal electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The O&#8208;exposed Mo8O26 clusters covalently confined on NbNxOy nanodomains provide a distinctive interface configuration and appropriate electronic structure, which regulates the binding strength of multiple intermediates, thereby accelerating the entire HER kinetics.







Abstract
Developing efficient and robust hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts for scalable and sustainable hydrogen production through electrochemical water splitting is strategic and challenging. Herein, heterogeneous Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy supported on N&#8208;doped graphene (defined as Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy/NG) is synthesized by controllable hydrothermal reaction and nitridation process. The O&#8208;exposed Mo8O26 clusters covalently confined on NbNxOy nanodomains provide a distinctive interface configuration and appropriate electronic structure, where fully exposed multiple active sites give excellent HER performance beyond commercial Pt/C catalyst in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes. Theoretical studies reveal that the Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy interface with electronic reconstruction affords near&#8208;optimal hydrogen adsorption energy and enhanced initial H2O adsorption. Furthermore, the terminal O atoms in Mo8O26 clusters cooperate with Nb atoms to promote the initial H2O adsorption, and subsequently reduce the H2O dissociation energy, accelerating the entire HER kinetics.

         <title>Regioselective and Stereospecific &#946;&#8208;Arabinofuranosylation by Boron&#8208;Mediated Aglycon Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A variety of diols, triols, and unprotected sugar acceptors could be used for &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;/l&#8208;arabinofuranosylation in the presence of a boronic acid catalyst under mild conditions with predictable regioselectivity and complete &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity. This glycosylation method was applied successfully to the synthesis of trisaccharide structures of arabinogalactan fragments.







Abstract
Regio&#8208; and stereoselective formation of the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;furanosidic linkage has been in great demand for efficient synthesis of biologically active natural glycosides. In this study, we developed a regioselective and &#946;&#8208;stereospecific d&#8208;/l&#8208;arabinofuranosylation promoted by a boronic acid catalyst under mild conditions. The glycosylations proceeded smoothly for a variety of diols, triols, and unprotected sugar acceptors to give the corresponding &#946;&#8208;arabinofuranosides (&#946;&#8208;Arbf) in high yields with complete &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity and high regioselectivity. The regioselectivity was completely reversed depending on the optical isomerism of the donor used and was predictable a priori using predictive models. Mechanistic studies based on DFT calculations revealed that the present glycosylation occurs through a highly dissociative concerted SNi mechanism. The usefulness of the glycosylation method was demonstrated by the chemical synthesis of trisaccharide structures of arabinogalactan fragments.

         <title>Activatable Type I Photosensitizer with Quenched Photosensitization Pre and Post Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered as one of the most momentous strategies to ablate cancer cells. However, the phototoxicity of photosensitizers pre and post PDT, and the tumor hypoxia environment, are the two major problems that limit the application of PDT. In this paper, we report an activatable type&#8197;I photosensitizer TPFN&#8208;AzoCF3, which could respond to cycling normoxia&#8208;hypoxia and undergo redox cycles in a fully reversible manner.







Abstract
The phototoxicity of photosensitizers (PSs) pre and post photodynamic therapy (PDT), and the hypoxic tumor microenvironment are two major problems limiting the application of PDT. While activatable PSs can successfully address the PS phototoxicity pre PDT, and type&#8197;I PS can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) effectively in hypoxic environment, very limited approaches are available for addressing the phototoxicity post PDT. There is virtually no solution available to address all these issues using a single design. Herein, we propose a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept on&#8208;demand switchable photosensitizer with quenched photosensitization pre and post PDT, which could be activated only in tumor hypoxic environment. Particularly, a hypoxia&#8208;normoxia cycling responsive type&#8197;I PS TPFN&#8208;AzoCF3 was designed to demonstrate the concept, which was further formulated into TPFN&#8208;AzoCF3 nanoparticles (NPs) using DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;2000 as the encapsulation matrix. The NPs could be activated only in hypoxic tumors to generate type&#8197;I ROS during PDT treatment, but remain non&#8208;toxic in normal tissues, pre or after PDT, thus minimizing side effects and improving the therapeutic effect. With promising results in in vitro and in vivo tumor treatment, this presented strategy will pave the way for the design of more on&#8208;demand switchable photosensitizers with minimized side effects in the future.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Role of Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Tethered Benzimidazolium Cation in Promoting CO2/Pure Water Co&#8208;Electrolysis to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through investigating the organic cation effect on CO2 electroreduction, benzimidazolium cation (Beim+) was found to synergistically enhance CO2 to C2+ product (mainly C2H4) conversion over Cu electrode. As a result, the use of Beim+&#8208;containing alkaline ionomer yielded a high C2H4 partial current density of 331&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 from CO2/pure water co&#8208;electrolysis.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), as a promising route to realize negative carbon emissions, is known to be strongly affected by electrolyte cations (i.e., cation effect). In contrast to the widely&#8208;studied alkali cations in liquid electrolytes, the effect of organic cations grafted on alkaline polyelectrolytes (APE) remains unexplored, although APE has already become an essential component of CO2 electrolyzers. Herein, by studying the organic cation effect on CO2RR, we find that benzimidazolium cation (Beim+) significantly outperforms other commonly&#8208;used nitrogenous cations (R4N+) in promoting C2+ (mainly C2H4) production over copper electrode. Cyclic voltammetry and in situ spectroscopy studies reveal that the Beim+ can synergistically boost the CO2 to *CO conversion and reduce the proton supply at the electrocatalytic interface, thus facilitating the *CO dimerization toward C2+ formation. By utilizing the homemade APE ionomer, we further realize efficient C2H4 production at an industrial&#8208;scale current density of 331&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 from CO2/pure water co&#8208;electrolysis, thanks to the dual&#8208;role of Beim+ in synergistic catalysis and ionic conduction. This study provides a new avenue to boost CO2RR through the structural design of polyelectrolytes.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Photoreduction via Regulating Charge Transfer Ability in a One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>

One&#8208;dimensional pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (1D PyTTA&#8208;COF) have been applied for CO2 photoreduction for the first time. The stabilization of the aromatic backbone by interchain interaction in 1D PyTTA&#8208;COF improved exciton dissociation and attenuated the thermal relaxation processes of excited photoelectrons, aiding the movement of photoelectrons across the imine linkage to catalytic sites for CO2 conversion.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold potential for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. However, high energy barrier of imine linkage impede the in&#8208;plane photoelectron transfer process, resulting in inadequate efficiency of CO2 photoreduction. Herein, we present a dimensionality induced local electronic modulation strategy through the construction of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (PyTTA&#8208;COF). The dual&#8208;chain&#8208;like edge architectures of 1D PyTTA&#8208;COF enable the stabilization of aromatic backbones, thus reducing energy loss during exciton dissociation and thermal relaxation, which provides energetic photoelectron to traverse the energy barrier of imine linkages. As a result, the 1D PyTTA&#8208;COF exhibits significantly enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation when coordinated with metal cobalt ion, yielding a remarkable CO evolution of 1003&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 over an 8&#8208;hour period, which surpasses that of the corresponding 2D counterpart by a factor of 59. These findings present a valuable approach to address in&#8208;plane charge transfer limitations in imine&#8208;based COFs.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Depolymerization of Plastic Waste Enabled by Plastic&#8208;Catalyst Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autogenous heterogeneous catalyst layer was discovered on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) surfaces during the generally believed homogeneous catalytic depolymerization process. The construction of plastic&#8208;catalyst solid&#8208;solid interfaces by interfacial engineering approaches enables vapor phase depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) at low temperatures with a trace amount of earth abundant metal, Zn.







Abstract
Depolymerization of condensation polymers by chemolysis often suffers from the large usage of solvents and homogeneous catalysts such as acids, bases, and metal salts. The catalytic efficiency of heterogeneous catalysts is largely constrained by the poor interfacial contact between solid catalysts and solid plastics below melting points. We report here our discovery of autogenous heterogeneous catalyst layer on polyethylene terephthalate surfaces during the generally believed homogeneous catalytic depolymerization process. Inspired by the &#8220;contact mass&#8221; concept in industrial chlorosilane production, we further demonstrate that the construction of plastic&#8208;catalyst solid&#8208;solid interfaces enables solvent&#8208;free depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate by vapor phase methanolysis at relatively low temperatures. Trace amounts of earth&#8208;abundant element (zinc) introduced by electrostatic adsorption is sufficient for catalyzing the depolymerization. The concept of plastic&#8208;catalyst contact mass interfacial catalysis might inspire new pathways for tackling plastic waste problems.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Real&#8208;Space Visualization of Aromatic P3N3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structurally elusive cyclotriphosphazene (P3N3, 1), an inorganic aromatic analogue of benzene, has been synthesized by scanning probe manipulation and visually inspected by high&#8208;resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM).







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis is at the verge of emerging as the method of choice for the generation and visualization of unstable or unconventional molecules, which could not be obtained via traditional synthetic methods. A case in point is the on&#8208;surface synthesis of the structurally elusive cyclotriphosphazene (P3N3), an inorganic aromatic analogue of benzene. Here, we report the preparation of this fleetingly existing species on Cu(111) and Au(111) surfaces at 5.2&#8197;K through molecular manipulation with unprecedented precision, i.e., voltage pulse&#8208;induced sextuple dechlorination of an ultra&#8208;small (about 6&#8197;&#197;) hexachlorophosphazene P3N3Cl6 precursor by the tip of a scanning probe microscope. Real&#8208;space atomic&#8208;level imaging of cyclotriphosphazene reveals its planar D3h&#8208;symmetric ring structure. Furthermore, this demasking strategy has been expanded to generate cyclotriphosphazene from a hexaazide precursor P3N21 via a different stimulation method (photolysis) for complementary measurements by matrix isolation infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on Cobalt(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Allylic Alkylation Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
A cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective allylic alkylation of tertiary allylic carbonates with 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds is described. The alkylated products are obtained in high yields and with excellent selectivity towards the kinetic branched regioisomer. Mechanistic insights by combining experimental and computational investigations support a Co(I)/Co(III) catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Here, we report the development of cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed regioselective allylic alkylation reactions of tertiary allyl carbonates with 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. A family of well&#8208;defined tetrahedral cobalt(I) complexes bearing commercially available bidentate bis(phosphine) ligands [(P,P)Co(PPh3)Cl] are synthesized and explored as catalysts in allylic alkylation reactions. The catalyst [(dppp)Co(PPh3)Cl] (dppp=1,3&#8208;Bis(diphenylphosphino)propane) enables the alkylation of a large variety of tertiary allyl carbonates with high yields and excellent regioselectivity for the branched product. Remarkably, this methodology is selective for the activation of tertiary allyl carbonates even in the presence of secondary allyl carbonates. This contrasts with the selectivity observed in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylations enabled by visible light photocatalysis. Mechanistic insights by means of experimental and computational investigations support a Co(I)/Co(III) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Organic Whispering&#8208;Gallery&#8208;Mode Hetero&#8208;Microrings for High&#8208;Security Photonic Barcodes</title>

         <dc:description>
Whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) hetero&#8208;microrings were realized through a surface tension&#8208;assisted heterogeneous self&#8208;assembly strategy via the regulation of charge&#8208;transfer interactions along circular boundaries. This remarkably promotes the security level and encoding capacity of the barcodes. The results may be useful to fabricate organic hierarchical hybrid WGM heterostructures for optical information recording and security labels.







Abstract
Whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) microcavities featuring distinguishable sharp peaks in a broadband exhibit enormous advantages in the field of miniaturized photonic barcodes. However, such kind of barcodes developed hitherto are primarily based on microcavities wherein multiple gain medias were blended into a single matrix, thus resulting in the limited and indistinguishable coding elements. Here, a surface tension assisted heterogeneous assembly strategy is proposed to construct the spatially resolved WGM hetero&#8208;microrings with multiple spatial colors along its circular direction. Through precisely regulating the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) strength, full&#8208;color microrings covering the entire visible range were effectively acquired, which exhibit a series of sharp and recognizable peaks and allow for the effective construction of high&#8208;quality photonic barcodes. Notably, the spatially resolved WGM hetero&#8208;microrings with multiple coding elements were finally acquired through heterogeneous nucleation and growth controlled by the directional diffusion between the hetero&#8208;emulsion droplets, thus remarkably promoting the security strength and coding capacity of the barcodes. The results would be useful to fabricate new types of organic hierarchical hybrid WGM heterostructures for optical information recording and security labels.

         <title>A Bidentate Antimony Pnictogen Bonding Host System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidentate pnictogen&#8208;bonding host system based on Sb(C2F5)2 functions was constructed and its host&#8211;guest chemistry tested towards a variety of substrates including Me2O and its higher homologues, halide ions and N&#8208;heterocyclic bases. The new host system shows cooperativity of the two C&#8801;C&#8722;Sb(C2F5)2 functions during adduct formation. The complexes were analyzed both experimentally (XRD, NMR) and by computational methods (DFT, QTAIM, IQA).







Abstract
A bidentate pnictogen bonding host&#8208;system based on 1,8&#8208;diethynylanthracene was synthesized by a selective tin&#8208;antimony exchange reaction and investigated regarding its ability to act as a Lewis acidic host component for the complexation of Lewis basic or anionic guests. In this work, the novel C&#8801;C&#8722;Sb(C2F5)2 unit was established to study the potential of antimony(III) sites as representatives for the scarcely explored pnictogen bonding donors. The capability of this partly fluorinated host system was investigated towards halide anions (Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;), dimethyl chalcogenides Me2Y (Y=O, S, Se, Te), and nitrogen heterocycles (pyridine, pyrimidine). Insights into the adduct formation behavior as well as the bonding situation of such E&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sb&#8722;CF moieties were obtained in solution by means of NMR spectroscopy, in the solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction, by elemental analyses, and by computational methods (DFT, QTAIM, IQA), respectively.

In this work, the novel C&#8801;C&#8722;Sb(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit was established to study the potential of antimony(III) sites as representatives for the scarcely explored pnictogen bonding donors. The capability of this partly fluorinated host system was investigated towards halide anions (Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), dimethyl chalcogenides Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Y (Y=O, S, Se, Te), and nitrogen heterocycles (pyridine, pyrimidine). Insights into the adduct formation behavior as well as the bonding situation of such E&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sb&#8722;C&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt; moieties were obtained in solution by means of NMR spectroscopy, in the solid state by X-ray diffraction, by elemental analyses, and by computational methods (DFT, QTAIM, IQA), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrodeoxygenation of Oxygen&#8208;Containing Aromatic Plastic Wastes to Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic system comprised of Ru&#8208;ReOx/SiO2 and HZSM&#8208;5 was developed for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of various oxygen&#8208;containing aromatic plastic wastes (PC, PET, PBT, and PPO) to cycloalkanes as liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), with high yields up to 99&#8201;% and a theoretical hydrogen storage capacity of ca. 5.74&#8197;wt%.







Abstract
To address the global plastic pollution issues and the challenges of hydrogen storage and transportation, we report a system, based on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of oxygen&#8208;containing aromatic plastic wastes, from which organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) can be derived. We developed a catalytic system comprised of Ru&#8208;ReOx/SiO2+HZSM&#8208;5 for direct HDO of polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyphenylene oxide (PPO), and their mixtures, to cycloalkanes as LOHCs, with high yields up to 99&#8201;%, under mild reaction conditions. The theoretical hydrogen storage capacity reaches ca. 5.74&#8197;wt%. The reaction pathway involves depolymerization of PC into C15 aromatics and C15 monophenols by direct hydrogenolysis of the C&#8722;O bond between the benzene ring and ester group, and subsequent parallel hydrogenation of C15 aromatics and HDO of C15 monophenols. HDO of cyclic alcohol is the rate&#8208;determining step. The active site is Ru metallic nanoparticles with partially covered ReOx species. The excellent performance is attributed to the synergetic effect of oxophilic ReOx species and Ru metallic sites for C&#8722;O hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation, and the promotion effect of HZSM&#8208;5 for dehydration of cyclic alcohol. The highly efficient and stable dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes over Pt/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 confirms that HDO products can act as LOHCs.

         <title>Rational Design of Porous Ionic Liquids for Coupling Natural Gas Purification with Waste Gas Conversion</title>

Abstract
Removal of trace impurities for natural gas purification coupled with waste gas conversion is highly desired in industry. We here report a type of porous ionic liquids (PILs) that can realize the continuous flow separation of CH4/CO2/H2S and the conversion of the captured H2S to useful products. The PILs are synthesized through a step&#8208;by&#8208;step surface modification of ionic liquids (ILs) onto UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH nanocrystals. The introduction of free tertiary amine groups on the nanocrystal surface endows these PILs with an exceptional ability to enrich H2S from CO2 and CH4 with impressive selectivity, while the permanent pores of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH act as containers to store an exceptionally higher amount of the selectively captured H2S than the corresponding nonporous ILs. Simultaneously, the tertiary amines as dual functional moieties offer effective catalytic sites for the conversion of the H2S stored in PILs into 3&#8208;mercaptoisobutyric acid, a key intermediate required for the synthesis of Captopril (an antihypertensive drug). Molecular dynamics, density functional theory calculations and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations help understand both the mechanisms of separation and catalysis performance, confirming that the tertiary amines as well as the permanent pores in UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH play vital roles in the whole procedure.

         <title>Poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline)&#8208;Ladder&#8208;Type Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework for Fast Proton Storage
</title>

A perinone&#8208;based poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline)&#8208;ladder&#8208;type two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) has been developed for a fast proton storage in both a mild aqueous Zn&#8208;ion electrolyte and strong acid. The largely reduced electron density on the C&#8722;O&#8722; groups after discharge results in the unique proton affinity of the COF electrode and an excellent rate capability of up to 200&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Electrochemical proton storage plays an essential role in designing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;rate energy storage devices, e.g., aqueous batteries. Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;COFs) are promising electrode materials, but their competitive proton and metal&#8208;ion insertion mechanisms remain elusive, and proton storage in COFs is rarely explored. Here, we report a perinone&#8208;based poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL)&#8208;ladder&#8208;type 2D c&#8208;COF for fast proton storage in both a mild aqueous Zn&#8208;ion electrolyte and strong acid. We unveil that the discharged C&#8722;O&#8722; groups exhibit largely reduced basicity due to the considerable &#960;&#8208;delocalization in perinone, thus affording the 2D c&#8208;COF a unique affinity for protons with fast kinetics. As a consequence, the 2D c&#8208;COF electrode presents an outstanding rate capability of up to 200&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (over 2500&#8197;C), surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conjugated polymers, COFs, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks. Our work reports the first example of pure proton storage among COFs and highlights the great potential of BBL&#8208;ladder&#8208;type 2D conjugated polymers in future energy devices.

         <title>Iodotrimethylsilane as a Reactive Ligand for Surface Etching and Passivation of Perovskite Nanocrystals toward Efficient Pure&#8208;red to Deep&#8208;red LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;phase ligand exchange strategy is used to resurface perovskite nanocrystal surfaces with a chemically active, short and conductive ligand, Iodotrimethylsilane (TMIS), which also functions as a surface passivant. Excellent conductivity and photostability allowed us to fabricate compact, high&#8208;mobility and trap&#8208;free perovskite NC films with high PLQY (&gt;90%). As a result, we achieve CsPbI3 NC&#8208;based PeLEDs with an EQE of ~23%.







Abstract
Resurfacing perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with tight&#8208;binding and conductive ligands to resolve the dynamic ligands&#8212;surface interaction is the fundamental issue for their applications in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Although various types of surface ligands have been proposed, these ligands either exhibit weak Lewis acid/base interactions or need high polar solvents for dissolution and passivation, resulting in a compromise in the efficiency and stability of PeLEDs. Herein, we report a chemically reactive agent (Iodotrimethylsilane, TMIS) to address the trade&#8208;off among conductivity, solubility and passivation using all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 NCs. The liquid TMIS ensures good solubility in non&#8208;polar solvents and reacts with oleate ligands and produces in situ HI for surface etching and passivation, enabling strong&#8208;binding ligands on the NCs surface. We report, as a result, red PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;23&#8201;%, which is 11.2&#8208;fold higher than the control, and is among the highest CsPbI3 PeLEDs. We further demonstrate the universality of this ligand strategy in the pure bromide system (CsPbBr3), and report EQE of &#8776;20&#8201;% at 640, 652, and 664&#8197;nm. This represents the first demonstration of a chemically reactive ligand strategy that applies to different systems and works effectively in red PeLEDs spanning emission from pure&#8208;red to deep&#8208;red.

Excellent conductivity and photostability allowed us to fabricate compact, high-mobility and trap-free perovskite NC films with high PLQY (&amp;gt;90%). As a result, we achieve CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NC-based PeLEDs with an EQE of ~23%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resurfacing perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with tight-binding and conductive ligands to resolve the dynamic ligands&#8212;surface interaction is the fundamental issue for their applications in perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Although various types of surface ligands have been proposed, these ligands either exhibit weak Lewis acid/base interactions or need high polar solvents for dissolution and passivation, resulting in a compromise in the efficiency and stability of PeLEDs. Herein, we report a chemically reactive agent (Iodotrimethylsilane, TMIS) to address the trade-off among conductivity, solubility and passivation using all-inorganic CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NCs. The liquid TMIS ensures good solubility in non-polar solvents and reacts with oleate ligands and produces in situ HI for surface etching and passivation, enabling strong-binding ligands on the NCs surface. We report, as a result, red PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;23&#8201;%, which is 11.2-fold higher than the control, and is among the highest CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PeLEDs. We further demonstrate the universality of this ligand strategy in the pure bromide system (CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and report EQE of &#8776;20&#8201;% at 640, 652, and 664&#8197;nm. This represents the first demonstration of a chemically reactive ligand strategy that applies to different systems and works effectively in red PeLEDs spanning emission from pure-red to deep-red.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Concentrated Ionic Fluids: Is There a Difference Between Chloride&#8208;Based Brines and Deep Eutectic Solvents?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductivity, viscosity, water, and chloride content were measured for brines and aqueous DESs. Low viscosity brines favour copper etching due to higher mass transport. Low water content DESs promote etching for silver and nickel.







Abstract
Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) have been lauded as novel solvents, but is there really a difference between them and concentrated aqueous brines? They provide a method of adjusting the activity of water and chloride ions which can affect mass transport, speciation and reactivity. This study proposes a continuum of properties across concentrated ionic fluids and uses metal processing as an example. Charge transport is shown to be governed by fluidity and there is no discontinuity between molar conductivity and fluidity irrespective of cation, charge density or ionic radius. Diffusion coefficients of iron(III) and copper(II) chloride in numerous concentrated ionic fluids show the same linear correlation between diffusion coefficient and fluidity. These oxidising agents were used to etch copper, silver and nickel and while the etching rate increased with fluidity for copper, etching of silver and nickel only occurred at high chloride and low water activity as passivation occurred when water activity increased. Overall, brines provide a high chloride content at a lower viscosity than DESs, but unlike DESs, brines are unable to prevent passivation due to their high water content. The results show how selective etching of mixed metal waste streams can be achieved by tuning chloride and water activity.

         <title>Insertion of (Bioactive) Equatorial Ligands into Platinum(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the incorporation of equatorial ligands into platinum(IV) complexes, enabling the synthesis of otherwise unavailable complexes. Attachment of albumin&#8208;targeting maleimide moieties led to increased tumor accumulation and anticancer activity compared to oxaliplatin. The presented strategy will allow the development of new types of targeted multi&#8208;action platinum(IV) complexes.







Abstract
Platinum(IV) prodrugs are highly interesting alternatives to platinum(II) anticancer therapeutics due to their increased tumor selectivity and reduced side effects. In contrast to the established theory, we recently observed that the equatorial ligand(s) of e.g. oxaliplatin(IV) complexes can be hydrolyzed with formation of [(DACH)Pt(OHeq)2(OAcax)2]. In the work presented here, we investigated the reactivity and synthetic usability of this complex to be exploited as a precursor for the development of novel platinum(IV) complexes, not able to be synthesized by conventional protocols. Indeed, we could substitute the equatorial hydroxido ligand(s) e.g. by one or two monodentate biotin ligands (which would be oxidized under standard methods). The formed complexes turned out to be very stable with slow ligand release after reduction, ideal for long&#8208;circulating tumor&#8208;targeting strategies. Therefore, two platinum(IV) complexes with equatorial maleimides, capable of exploiting serum albumin as a natural nanocarrier, were synthesized as well. The complexes showed massively prolonged plasma half&#8208;life and distinctly improved anticancer activity in vivo compared to oxaliplatin. Taken together, the newly developed synthetic platform allows the simple and specific insertion of equatorial ligands into platinum(IV) complexes. This will enable the attachment of three different (bioactive) moieties generating targeted triple&#8208;action platinum(IV) prodrugs within one single platinum complex.

         <title>Bacterial Cytochrome P450 Catalyzed Post&#8208;translational Macrocyclization of Ribosomal Peptides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
P450 enzymes are highly effective catalysts, yet little research has been conducted on their ability to modify ribosomal peptides. Now uncharted bacterial cytochrome P450s responsible for the macrocyclization of ribosomal peptides have been discovered by sequence&#8208; and 3D&#8208;structure&#8208;based genome mining. These P450s exhibit diverse catalytic capabilities, catalyzing aromatic crosslinking by forming C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bonds.







Abstract
Ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are a fascinating group of natural products that exhibit diverse structural features and bioactivities. P450&#8208;catalyzed RiPPs stand out as a unique but underexplored family. Herein, we introduce a rule&#8208;based genome mining strategy that harnesses the intrinsic biosynthetic principles of RiPPs, including the co&#8208;occurrence and co&#8208;conservation of precursors and P450s and interactions between them, successfully facilitating the identification of diverse P450&#8208;catalyzed RiPPs. Intensive BGC characterization revealed four new P450s, KstB, ScnB, MciB, and SgrB, that can catalyze the formation of Trp&#8208;Trp&#8208;Tyr (one C&#8722;C and two C&#8722;N bonds), Tyr&#8208;Trp (C&#8722;C bond), Trp&#8208;Trp (C&#8722;N bond), and His&#8208;His (ether bond) crosslinks, respectively, within three or four residues. KstB, ScnB, and MciB could accept non&#8208;native precursors, suggesting they could be promising starting templates for bioengineering to construct macrocycles. Our study highlights the potential of P450s to expand the chemical diversity of strained macrocyclic peptides and the range of biocatalytic tools available for peptide macrocyclization.

         <title>Correlation of Broad Absorption Band with Small Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Gap in Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new non&#8208;fullerene acceptors were developed by tailoring the side&#8208;group conjugation length. They show simultaneously broadened short&#8208;wavelength absorption band and reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. The relevant solar cells deliver a high efficiency of 18.5&#8201;% as processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvent, among the highest value for solar cells processed by green solvent and based on new acceptor structures.







Abstract
Organic photovoltaics (OPV) are one of the most effective ways to harvest renewable solar energy, with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices soaring above 19&#8201;% when processed with halogenated solvents. The superior photocurrent of OPV over other emerging photovoltaics offers more opportunities to further improve the efficiency. Tailoring the absorption band of photoactive materials is an effective way to further enhance OPV photocurrent. However, the field has mostly been focusing on improving the near&#8208;infrared region photo&#8208;response, with the absorption shoulders in short&#8208;wavelength region (SWR) usually being neglected. Herein, by developing a series of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with varied side&#8208;group conjugations, we observe an enhanced SWR absorption band with increased side&#8208;group conjugation length. The underpinning factors of how molecular structures and geometries improve SWR absorption are clearly elucidated through theoretical modelling and crystallography. Moreover, a clear relationship between the enhanced SWR absorption and reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap is established, both of which are favorable for the OPV performance and can be tailored by rational structure design of NFAs. Finally, the rationally designed NFA, BO&#8208;TTBr, affords a decent PCE of 18.5&#8201;% when processed with a non&#8208;halogenated green solvent.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation Activity&#8208;Stability Maps for Perovskite Oxides Containing 3d, 4d and 5d Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;stability maps toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are experimentally created for a family of 66&#8197;SrTixRuyIrzO3 perovskite oxides. The effects of hybridization of mixed transition metal 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d and oxygen 2p orbitals on catalytic activity, stability and mechanism are discussed.







Abstract
Improving catalytic activity without loss of catalytic stability is one of the core goals in search of low&#8208;iridium&#8208;content oxygen evolution electrocatalysts under acidic conditions. Here, we synthesize a family of 66&#8197;SrBO3 perovskite oxides (B=Ti, Ru, Ir) with different Ti&#8201;:&#8201;Ru&#8201;:&#8201;Ir atomic ratios and construct catalytic activity&#8208;stability maps over composition variation. The maps classify the multicomponent perovskites into chemical groups with distinct catalytic activity and stability for acidic oxygen evolution reaction, and highlights a chemical region where high catalytic activity and stability are achieved simultaneously at a relatively low iridium level. By quantifying the extent of hybridization of mixed transition metal 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d and oxygen 2p orbitals for multicomponent perovskites, we demonstrate this complex interplay between 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d metals and oxygen atoms in governing the trends in both activity and stability as well as in determining the catalytic mechanism involving lattice oxygen or not.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis with Anomalous Chloride Promoted Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anomalous Cl&#8722;&#8208;promoted oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism with a typical catalyst, nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH), is proposed. First, both Fe leaching and active lattice oxygen are suppressed by the adsorption of Cl&#8722; on desired Fe sites, which improves the catalyst's long&#8208;term stability. Second, more high&#8208;valency OER&#8208;active Ni sites are created, thus increasing the activity.







Abstract
A highly selective and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is the bottleneck for direct seawater splitting because of side reactions primarily caused by chloride ions (Cl&#8722;). Most studies about OER catalysts in seawater focus on the repulsion of the Cl&#8722; to reduce its negative effects. Herein, we demonstrate that the absorption of Cl&#8722; on the specific site of a popular OER electrocatalyst, nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH), does not have a significant negative impact; rather, it is beneficial for its activity and stability enhancement in natural seawater. A set of in situ characterization techniques reveals that the adsorption of Cl&#8722; on the desired Fe site suppresses Fe leaching, and creates more OER&#8208;active Ni sites, improving the catalyst's long&#8208;term stability and activity simultaneously. Therefore, we achieve direct alkaline seawater electrolysis for the very first time on a commercial&#8208;scale alkaline electrolyser (AE, 120&#8197;cm2 electrode area) using the NiFe LDH anode. The new alkaline seawater electrolyser exhibits a reduction in electricity consumption by 20.7&#8201;% compared to the alkaline purified water&#8208;based AE using commercial Ni catalyst, achieving excellent durability for 100&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>A DNA Origami&#8208;based Bactericide for Efficient Healing of Infected Wounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide with precisely organized bacterial membrane breaker (DNAzymes, G4/hemin) and abundantly loaded broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic (levofloxacin) was constructed for the efficient healing of infected wounds under the guidance of DNA aptamer targeting bacterial peptidoglycan.







Abstract
Bacteria infection is a significant obstacle in the clinical treatment of exposed wounds facing widespread pathogens. Herein, we report a DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide for efficient anti&#8208;infection therapy of infected wounds in vivo. In our design, abundant DNAzymes (G4/hemin) can be precisely organized on the DNA origami for controllable generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to break bacterial membranes. After the destruction of the membrane, broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic levofloxacin (LEV, loaded in the DNA origami through interaction with DNA duplex) can be easily delivered into the bacteria for successful sterilization. With the incorporation of DNA aptamer targeting bacterial peptidoglycan, the DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide can achieve targeted and combined antibacterial therapy for efficiently promoting the healing of infected wounds. This tailored DNA origami&#8208;based nanoplatform provides a new strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases in vivo.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Electron Buffer Layer on ZnOx&#8722;Fe5C2&#8722;Fe3O4 Boosts Ethanol Synthesis from CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon&#8208;based electron buffer layer was employed to neutralize the excessive electrons transferred from ZnOx to Fe species. A suitable CO adsorption strength and C&#8722;C coupling barrier was achieved as a consequence of the Fe&#8208;based active sites, yielding a high ethanol yield of 366.6&#8197;gEtOH&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 from CO2+H2. The result differs from the common ZnFe bimetallic catalyst for which hydrocarbons dominate.







Abstract
The conversion of CO2 into ethanol with renewable H2 has attracted tremendous attention due to its integrated functions of carbon elimination and chemical synthesis, but remains challenging. The electronic properties of a catalyst are essential to determine the adsorption strength and configuration of the key intermediates, therefore altering the reaction network for targeted synthesis. Herein, we describe a catalytic system in which a carbon buffer layer is employed to tailor the electronic properties of the ternary ZnOx&#8722;Fe5C2&#8722;Fe3O4, in which the electron&#8208;transfer pathway (ZnOx&#8594;Fe species or carbon layer) ensures the appropriate adsorption strength of &#8722;CO* on the catalytic interface, facilitating C&#8722;C coupling between &#8722;CHx* and &#8722;CO* for ethanol synthesis. Benefiting from this unique electron&#8208;transfer buffering effect, an extremely high ethanol yield of 366.6&#8197;gEtOH&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (with CO of 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% co&#8208;feeding) is achieved from CO2 hydrogenation. This work provides a powerful electronic modulation strategy for catalyst design in terms of highly oriented synthesis.

         <title>Chiral Deep Eutectic Solvents Enable Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Achiral Luminophores</title>

The solvation of an achiral fluorescent dye in a chiral deep eutectic solvent enables the generation of full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Herein, chiral deep eutectic solvents (DES) are prepared by lauric acid as hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and chiral menthol as hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA). When achiral fluorescent molecules are dopedin the menthol&#8208;based chiral DES, they emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with handedness controlled by the molecular chirality (l or d) of menthol. Remarkably, the strategy is universal and a series of achiral fluorescent molecules can be endowed with CPL activity, showing a full&#8208;color and white CPL upon appropriate mixing, which paves the way to prepare white CPL materials. Interestingly, CPL appears only in a certain temperature range in the DES. Variable&#8208;temperature spectra and other characterization methods reveal that the H&#8208;bond network in the chiral DES plays an important role in inducing CPL. This work unveils how the interior structure as well as the hydrogen&#8208;bond network of a chiral DES can transfer its chirality to achiral luminophores for the first time and realizes a full&#8208;color and white CPL in a DES.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins on Au(111)</title>

N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) monolayers have been self&#8208;assembled on Au(111) and characterized with high thermal stability and a large impact on work&#8208;function values, demonstrating the crucial influence of the carbon&#8208;metal &#963;&#8208;bond on monolayer properties







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) have been prepared on Au(111) and their thermal stability, adsorption geometry, and molecular order were characterized by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, polarized X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The strong &#963;&#8208;bond character of NHO anchoring to Au induced high geometrical flexibility that enabled a flat&#8208;lying adsorption geometry via coordination to a gold adatom. The flat&#8208;lying adsorption geometry was utilized to further increase the surface interaction of the NHO monolayer by backbone functionalization with methyl groups that induced high thermal stability and a large impact on work&#8208;function values, which outperformed that of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. STM measurements, supported by DFT modeling, identified that the NHOs were self&#8208;assembled in dimers, trimers, and tetramers constructed of two, three, and four complexes of NHO&#8722;Au&#8208;adatom. This self&#8208;assembly pattern was correlated to strong NHO&#8722;Au interactions and steric hindrance between adsorbates, demonstrating the crucial influence of the carbon&#8208;metal &#963;&#8208;bond on monolayer properties.

         <title>Manipulating Lone&#8208;Pair&#8208;Driven Luminescence in 0D Tin Halides by Pressure&#8208;Tuned Stereochemical Activity from Static to Dynamic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pressure&#8208;driven stereochemical activity transformation of the lone pair from static to dynamic was achieved in 0D 5&#8197;s2 metal halides, corresponding to the self&#8208;trapped exciton emission switching from a red broadband triplet emission to a sky&#8208;blue narrowband singlet emission.







Abstract
The excellent luminescence properties and structural dynamics driven by the stereoactivity of the lone pair in a variety of low&#8208;dimensional ns2 metal halides have attracted growing investigations for optoelectronic applications. However, the structural and photophysical aspects of the excited state associated with the lone pair expression are currently open questions. Herein, zero&#8208;dimensional Sn&#8208;based halides with static stereoactive 5&#8197;s2 lone pairs are selected as a model system to understand the correlations between the distinctive lone pair expression and the excited&#8208;state structural relaxation and charge carrier dynamics by continuous lattice manipulation. Lattice compression drives 5&#8197;s2 lone pair active switching and self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) redistribution by suppressing excited&#8208;state structural deformation of the isolated SnBr42&#8722; units. Our results demonstrate that the static expression of the 5&#8197;s2 lone pair results in a red broadband triplet STE emission with a large Stokes shift, while its dynamic expression creates a sky&#8208;blue narrowband emission dominated by the radiative recombination of singlet STEs. Our findings and the photophysical mechanism proposed highlight the stereochemical effects of lone pair expression in controlling light emission properties and offer constructive guidelines for tuning the optoelectronic properties in diverse ns2 metal halides.

         <title>A GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist for Guiding MOF Discovery

         <dc:description>
The power of using artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;human collaboration to advance reticular chemistry is shown. Through iterative learning, the GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist indicates instructions while evolving based on the feedback from a human researcher. It results in the innovative discovery of a series of isoreticular metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and suggests an approach for using large language models in experimental scientific research.







Abstract
We present a new framework integrating the AI model GPT&#8208;4 into the iterative process of reticular chemistry experimentation, leveraging a cooperative workflow of interaction between AI and a human researcher. This GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist is an integrated system composed of three phases. Each of these utilizes GPT&#8208;4 in various capacities, wherein GPT&#8208;4 provides detailed instructions for chemical experimentation and the human provides feedback on the experimental outcomes, including both success and failures, for the in&#8208;context learning of AI in the next iteration. This iterative human&#8208;AI interaction enabled GPT&#8208;4 to learn from the outcomes, much like an experienced chemist, by a prompt&#8208;learning strategy. Importantly, the system is based on natural language for both development and operation, eliminating the need for coding skills, and thus, make it accessible to all chemists. Our collaboration with GPT&#8208;4 Reticular Chemist guided the discovery of an isoreticular series of MOFs, with each synthesis fine&#8208;tuned through iterative feedback and expert suggestions. This workflow presents a potential for broader applications in scientific research by harnessing the capability of large language models like GPT&#8208;4 to enhance the feasibility and efficiency of research activities.

         <title>Fabrication of Pillar&#8208;Cage Fluorinated Anion Pillared Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via a Pillar Embedding Strategy and Efficient Separation of SO2 through Multi&#8208;Site Trapping</title>

Pillar&#8208;cage fluorinated metal&#8208;organic frameworks were fabricated via a pillar embedding strategy and applied in the efficient separation of SO2 through multi&#8208;site trapping.







Abstract
Flue gas desulfurization is crucial for both human health and ecological environments. However, developing efficient SO2 adsorbents that can break the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity is still challenging. In this work, a new type of fluorinated anion&#8208;pillared metal&#8211;organic frameworks (APMOFs) with a pillar&#8208;cage structure is fabricated through pillar&#8208;embedding into a highly porous and robust framework. This type of APMOFs comprises smaller tetrahedral cages and larger icosahedral cages interconnected by embedded [NbOF5]2&#8722; and [TaOF5]2&#8722; anions acting as pillars. The APMOFs exhibits high porosity and density of fluorinated anions, ensuring exceptional SO2 adsorption capacity and ultrahigh selectivity for SO2/CO2 and SO2/N2 gas mixtures. Furthermore, these two structures demonstrate excellent stability towards water, acid/alkali, and SO2 adsorption. Cycle dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm the excellent separation performance of SO2/CO2 gas mixtures and their cyclic stability. SO2&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the preferred adsorption domains for SO2 molecules. The multiple&#8208;site host&#8211;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions facilitate selective recognition and dense packing of SO2 in this hybrid porous material. This work will be instructive for designing porous materials for flue gas desulfurization and other gas&#8208;purification processes.

This type of APMOFs comprises smaller tetrahedral cages and larger icosahedral cages interconnected by embedded [NbOF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [TaOF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions acting as pillars. The APMOFs exhibits high porosity and density of fluorinated anions, ensuring exceptional SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity and ultrahigh selectivity for SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas mixtures. Furthermore, these two structures demonstrate excellent stability towards water, acid/alkali, and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption. Cycle dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm the excellent separation performance of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas mixtures and their cyclic stability. SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-loaded single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the preferred adsorption domains for SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. The multiple-site host&#8211;guest and guest-guest interactions facilitate selective recognition and dense packing of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in this hybrid porous material. This work will be instructive for designing porous materials for flue gas desulfurization and other gas-purification processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achiral Dichroic Dyes&#8208;mediated Circularly Polarized Emission Regulated by Orientational Order Parameter through Cholesteric Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy was developed for regulating circularly polarized luminescence performance by increasing the order parameter value of achiral dichroic dye in cholesteric liquid crystal media without changing the helical superstructure. Additionally, the circularly polarized luminescence and fluorescence intensity response (contrast ratio) was also improved as the order parameter value increased under the DC electric field. Efficient encryption could be achieved by modulating the structure of achiral dichroic dyes in cholesteric liquid crystals.







Abstract
It is noteworthy that cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) platforms have been witnessed in high&#8208;performance circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) behaviors through the highly organized chiral co&#8208;assembled arrangement of achiral dyes. However, most CPL&#8208;active design strategies are closely relative to the helix co&#8208;assembly structure of CLC rather than achiral dyes. Herein, we developed an intriguing regulation strategy for CPL&#8208;active CLC materials. They were regulated using the orientational order parameter (SF) of achiral dichroic dyes as an incisive probe for the order arrangement degree of achiral dyes in CLC media. The I&#8208;shaped phenothiazine derivative PHECN dye (SF=0.30) emitted a strong CPL signal (|glum|=0.47). In contrast, the T&#8208;shaped derivative (PHEBen) dye (SF=0.09) showed a weak circular polarization level (|glum|=0.07) at similar CLC textures. Most interestingly, this kind of dichroic PHECN dye with a higher SF could greatly improve the contrast ratio of CPL (&#916;glum=0.47) and emission intensity (&#916;FL=46.0&#8201;%) at direct&#8208;current electric field compared with the T&#8208;shaped PHEBen (&#916;glum=0.07 and &#916;FL=1.0&#8201;%) in CLC. This work demonstrates that an induced CPL emission can be mediated using achiral dichroic dye, which will open a new avenue for developing excellent CPL&#8208;active display materials.

         <title>Tetraphenylporphyrin&#8208;based Chelating Ligand Additive as a Molecular Sieving Interfacial Barrier toward Durable Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a versatile &#8220;molecular sieve&#8208;like&#8221; interfacial barrier to efficiently expel free water molecules from IHP. Benefiting from the well&#8208;tailored ligand chelation engineering and the non&#8208;consumable nature of TPPS, the as&#8208;developed Zn||MnO2 full battery with TPPS exhibited enhanced reversible capacity and extended cyclability with negligible H2 evolution compared with cells using pristine ZnSO4 electrolyte.







Abstract
The sustained water consumption and uncontrollable dendrite growth strongly hamper the practical applications of rechargeable zinc (Zn) metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate that trace amount of chelate ligand additive can serve as a &#8220;molecular sieve&#8208;like&#8221; interfacial barrier and achieve highly efficient Zn plating/stripping. As verified by theoretical modeling and experimental investigations, the benzenesulfonic acid groups on the additive molecular not only facilitates its water solubility and selective adsorption on the Zn anode, but also effectively accelerates the de&#8208;solvation kinetics of Zn2+. Meanwhile, the central porphyrin ring on the chelate ligand effectively expels free water molecules from Zn2+ via chemical binding against hydrogen evolution, and reversibly releases the captured Zn2+ to endow a dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. By virtue of this non&#8208;consumable additive, high average Zn plating/stripping efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% over 2100&#8197;cycles together with extended lifespan and suppressed water decomposition in the Zn||MnO2 full battery were achieved, thus opening a new avenue for developing highly durable ZMBs.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Supramolecular Polymerization of a Bis&#8208;Urea Macrocycle into a Brick&#8208;Like Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dendronized bis&#8208;urea macrocycle forms in bulk columnar liquid&#8208;crystalline phases, while in chlorinated solvents it self&#8208;assembles into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets with a brick&#8208;like organization. This exotic 2D assembly is enabled by solvent effects and a sophisticated hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern, where each monomer interacts with four vicinal macrocycles only through urea&#8208;urea interactions.







Abstract
We report on a dendronized bis&#8208;urea macrocycle 1 self&#8208;assembling via a cooperative mechanism into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets formed solely by alternated urea&#8208;urea hydrogen bonding interactions. The pure macrocycle self&#8208;assembles in bulk into one&#8208;dimensional liquid&#8208;crystalline columnar phases. In contrast, its self&#8208;assembly mode drastically changes in CHCl3 or tetrachloroethane, leading to 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks. Theoretical calculations, complemented by previously reported crystalline structures, indicate that the 2D assembly is formed by a brick&#8208;like hydrogen bonding pattern between bis&#8208;urea macrocycles. This assembly is promoted by the swelling of the trisdodecyloxyphenyl groups upon solvation, which frustrates, due to steric effects, the formation of the thermodynamically more stable columnar macrocycle stacks. This work proposes a new design strategy to access 2D supramolecular polymers by means of a single non&#8208;covalent interaction motif, which is of great interest for materials development.

         <title>Green Solvent Processable, Asymmetric Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Layer Material for Efficient and Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hole transport layer material (BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O) for perovskite solar cells is designed, introducing an asymmetric polar oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain. It is capable of achieving high crystallinity even when processed from green solvents. The n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells based on chlorobenzene&#8208; or 3&#8208;methylcyclohexanone&#8208;processed BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O without dopant delivered world&#8208;record power conversion efficiencies of 24.11&#8201;% (certified of 23.82&#8201;%) and 23.53&#8201;%, respectively. The corresponding scaled modules (15.64&#8197;cm2) also deliver high PCEs over 20&#8201;%.







Abstract
The use of dopant&#8208;free hole transport layers (HTLs) is critical in stabilizing n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). However, these HTL materials are often processed with toxic solvents, which is not ideal for industrial production. Upon substituting them with green solvents, a trade&#8208;off emerges between maintaining the high crystallinity of the HTL materials and ensuring high solubility in the new solvents. In this paper, we designed a novel, linear, organic small molecule, BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O, by introducing an asymmetric polar oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain. This method not only overcomes the solubility limitations in green solvents but also enables stacking the conjugated main chains in two patterns, which further enhances crystallinity and hole mobility. As a result, the n&#8208;i&#8208;p pero&#8208;SCs based on chlorobenzene&#8208; or green (natural compound) solvent 3&#8208;methylcyclohexanone&#8208;processed BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O HTL that without any dopant delivered world&#8208;recorded power conversion efficiencies of 24.11&#8201;% (certified of 23.82&#8201;%) and 23.53&#8201;%, respectively. The devices also demonstrated remarkable operational and high&#8208;temperature stabilities, maintaining over 84&#8201;% and 79.5&#8201;% of their initial efficiency for 2000&#8197;h, respectively.

     alt="Green Solvent Processable, Asymmetric Dopant-Free Hole Transport Layer Material for Efficient and Stable n-i-p Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hole transport layer material (BDT-C8-3O) for perovskite solar cells is designed, introducing an asymmetric polar oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain. It is capable of achieving high crystallinity even when processed from green solvents. The &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; perovskite solar cells based on chlorobenzene- or 3-methylcyclohexanone-processed BDT-C8-3O without dopant delivered world-record power conversion efficiencies of 24.11&#8201;% (certified of 23.82&#8201;%) and 23.53&#8201;%, respectively. The corresponding scaled modules (15.64&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) also deliver high PCEs over 20&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of dopant-free hole transport layers (HTLs) is critical in stabilizing &lt;i&gt;n-i-p&lt;/i&gt; perovskite solar cells (pero-SCs). However, these HTL materials are often processed with toxic solvents, which is not ideal for industrial production. Upon substituting them with green solvents, a trade-off emerges between maintaining the high crystallinity of the HTL materials and ensuring high solubility in the new solvents. In this paper, we designed a novel, linear, organic small molecule, BDT-C8-3O, by introducing an asymmetric polar oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain. This method not only overcomes the solubility limitations in green solvents but also enables stacking the conjugated main chains in two patterns, which further enhances crystallinity and hole mobility. As a result, the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; pero-SCs based on chlorobenzene- or green (natural compound) solvent 3-methylcyclohexanone-processed BDT-C8-3O HTL that without any dopant delivered world-recorded power conversion efficiencies of 24.11&#8201;% (certified of 23.82&#8201;%) and 23.53&#8201;%, respectively. The devices also demonstrated remarkable operational and high-temperature stabilities, maintaining over 84&#8201;% and 79.5&#8201;% of their initial efficiency for 2000&#8197;h, respectively. Encouragingly, dopant-free BDT-C8-3O HTL exhibits significant advantages in large-area fabrication, achieving state-of-the-art PCEs exceeding 20&#8201;% for 5&#215;5&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; modules (active area: 15.64&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), even when processed using green solvents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improving Low&#8208;temperature Performance and Stability of Na2Ti6O13 Anodes by the Ti&#8722;O Spring Effect through Nb&#8208;doping</title>

Integrated effects of migration channels broadening, charge density re&#8208;distribution, and oxygen vacancies modulation are achieved via high valence state ion&#8208;doping in case of Nb5+. The modified samples optimized excellent long&#8208;cycle stability, and superior low&#8208;temperature performance in the full cell. Importantly, it is demonstrated for the first time that high&#8208;valent transition metal preferentially replaces the Ti3 site of NTO, effectively improving electrical conductivity and ion diffusion rate. More interestingly, the &#8220;spring effect&#8221; of chemical bonding, which is twisted&#8208;recovered&#8208;twisted with the motion of Na+, is investigated for the first time by in situ Raman, and the stabilizing effect of Nb enables the more regular and reversible &#8220;spring effect&#8221;.







Abstract
Na2Ti6O13 (NTO) with high safety has been regarded as a promising anode candidate for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. In the present study, integrated modification of migration channels broadening, charge density re&#8208;distribution, and oxygen vacancies regulation are realized in case of Nb&#8208;doping and have obtained significantly enhanced cycling performance with 92&#8201;% reversible capacity retained after 3000&#8197;cycles at 3000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, unexpected low&#8208;temperature performance with a high discharge capacity of 143&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C is also achieved in the full cell. Theoretical investigation suggests that Nb preferentially replaces Ti3 sites, which effectively improves structural stability and lowers the diffusion energy barrier. What's more important, both the in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and in situ Raman furtherly confirm the robust spring effect of the Ti&#8722;O bond, making special charge compensation mechanism and respective regulation strategy to conquer the sluggish transport kinetics and low conductivity, which plays a key role in promoting electrochemical performance.

         <title>Multivariate Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Tunable Permanent Porosities for Capture of a Mustard Gas Simulant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isoreticular multivariate hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MTV&#8208;HOFs) from pyrene&#8208;based derivatives bearing &#8722;H, &#8722;CH3, &#8722;NH2 and &#8722;F groups were synthesized by a shape&#8208;fitted, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking self&#8208;assembly strategy. These single&#8208;crystalline materials are composed of tectons with as many as 4 different functionalities, which exhibit tunable hydrophobicity, and were shown to be capable of capturing a mustard gas simulant (CEES).







Abstract
Precise synthesis of topologically predictable and discrete molecular crystals with permanent porosities remains a long&#8208;term challenge. Here, we report the first successful synthesis of a series of 11 isoreticular multivariate hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MTV&#8208;HOFs) from pyrene&#8208;based derivatives bearing &#8722;H, &#8722;CH3, &#8722;NH2 and &#8722;F groups achieved by a shape&#8208;fitted, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking self&#8208;assembly strategy. These MTV&#8208;HOFs are single&#8208;crystalline materials composed of tecton, as verified by single&#8208;crystal diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, Raman spectra, water sorption isotherms and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These MTV&#8208;HOFs exhibit tunable hydrophobicity with water uptake starting from 50 to 80&#8201;% relative humidity, by adjusting the combinations and ratios of functional groups. As a proof of application, the resulting MTV&#8208;HOFs were shown to be capable of capturing a mustard gas simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES) from moisture. The location of different functional groups within the pores of the MTV&#8208;HOFs leads to a synergistic effect, which resulted in a superior CEES/H2O selectivity (up to 94&#8201;%) compared to that of the HOFs with only pure component and enhanced breakthrough performance (up to 4000&#8197;min/g) when compared to benchmark MOF materials. This work is an important advance in the synthesis of MTV&#8208;HOFs, and provides a platform for the development of porous molecular materials for numerous applications.

         <dc:description>
A stereocontrolled degradable polymer was synthesized via living cascade enyne metathesis polymerization from highly stereodefined N,O&#8208;acetal&#8208;containing enyne monomers, which were prepared by Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of alkoxyallene and ring&#8208;closing metathesis.







Abstract
A stereocontrolled degradable polymer was synthesized via living cascade enyne metathesis polymerization. Highly stereodefined N,O&#8208;acetal&#8208;containing enyne monomers were prepared using the Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of alkoxyallenes and ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The resulting chiral polymer exhibited a narrow dispersity window. Block copolymers were prepared not only by sequentially adding nondegradable and degradable monomers but also by using enantiomerically different monomers to produce stereocontrolled blocks. Owing to the hydrolyzable N,O&#8208;acetal moiety in the backbone structure, the resulting polymer could degrade under acidic conditions generated using various acid concentrations to control the degradation. Additionally, the aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction modified the polymer without losing the stereochemistry.

         <title>A Coformer Approach for Supramolecular Polymerization at High Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A barbiturate &#960;&#8208;conjugated compound is poorly soluble in nonpolar solvent because of its organization through its hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs into a crystalline polymorph prior to supramolecular polymerization. Mixing a &#8220;supramolecular coformer&#8221; compound with the parent compound provide highly soluble co&#8208;aggregates, enabling supramolecular polymerization at high concentrations.







Abstract
Insolubility of functional molecules caused by polymorphism sometimes poses limitations for their solution&#8208;based processing. Such a situation can also occur in the preparation processes of supramolecular polymers formed in a solution. An effective strategy to address this issue is to prepare amorphous solid states by introducing a &#8220;coformer&#8221; molecule capable of inhibiting the formation of an insoluble polymorph through co&#8208;aggregation.

&lt;p&gt;A barbiturate &#960;-conjugated compound is poorly soluble in nonpolar solvent because of its organization through its hydrogen-bonding motifs into a crystalline polymorph prior to supramolecular polymerization. Mixing a &#8220;supramolecular coformer&#8221; compound with the parent compound provide highly soluble co-aggregates, enabling supramolecular polymerization at high concentrations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insolubility of functional molecules caused by polymorphism sometimes poses limitations for their solution-based processing. Such a situation can also occur in the preparation processes of supramolecular polymers formed in a solution. An effective strategy to address this issue is to prepare amorphous solid states by introducing a &#8220;coformer&#8221; molecule capable of inhibiting the formation of an insoluble polymorph through co-aggregation. Herein, inspired by the coformer approach, we demonstrated a solubility enhancement of a barbiturate &#960;-conjugated compound that can supramolecularly polymerize through six-membered hydrogen-bonded rosettes. Our newly synthesized supramolecular coformer molecule features a sterically demanding methyl group in the &#960;-conjugated unit of the parent molecule. Although the parent molecule exhibits low solubility in nonpolar solvents due to the formation of a crystalline polymorph comprising a tape-like hydrogen-bonded array prior to the supramolecular polymerization, mixing with the coformer compound enhanced the solubility by inhibiting mesoscopic organization of the tapes. The two monomers were then co-polymerized into desired helicoidal supramolecular polymers through the formation of heteromeric rosettes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioconvergent Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkylation of Tertiary Allylic C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;chiral phosphoramidite&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular enantioconvergent alkylation of racemic tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds provides facile access to a range of enantioenriched allylic compounds featuring quaternary carbon stereocenters. The deracemization has been accomplished through a rate&#8208;limiting cleavage of racemic tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds to generate &#963;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd species, and the obtained E/Z&#8208;selectivity of &#963;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd species markedly regulates the diastereoselectivity via a nucleophile coordination&#8208;enabled SN2&#8242;&#8208;allylation pathway.







Abstract
Enantioconvergent catalysis enables the conversion of racemic molecules into a single enantiomer in perfect yield and is considered an ideal approach for asymmetric synthesis. Despite remarkable advances in this field, enantioconvergent transformations of inert tertiary C&#8722;H bonds remain largely unexplored due to the high bond dissociation energy and the surrounding steric repulsion that pose unparalleled constraints on bond cleavage and formation. Here, we report an enantioconvergent Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkylation of racemic tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds of &#945;&#8208;alkenes, providing a unique approach to access a broad range of enantioenriched &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds featuring quaternary carbon stereocenters. Mechanistic studies reveal that a stereoablative event occurs through the rate&#8208;limiting cleavage of tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds to generate &#963;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd species, and the achieved E/Z&#8208;selectivity of &#963;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd species effectively regulates the diastereoselectivity via a nucleophile coordination&#8208;enabled SN2&#8242;&#8208;allylation pathway.

         <title>Enhanced Metal&#8208;Support Interactions Boost the Electrocatalytic Water Splitting of Supported Ruthenium Nanoparticles on a Ni3N/NiO Heterojunction at Industrial Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of a Ni3N/NiO heterostructure in Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO results in a highly electroactive surface that ensures high electroactivity and alleviates the overbinding effect. The construction of a high&#8208;density triple&#8208;phase interface is achieved, with highly active catalytic sites for electrochemical water splitting, involving hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER).







Abstract
Developing highly efficient and stable hydrogen production catalysts for electrochemical water splitting (EWS) at industrial current densities remains a great challenge. Herein, we proposed a heterostructure&#8208;induced&#8208;strategy to optimize the metal&#8208;support interaction (MSI) and the EWS activity of Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations firstly predicted that the Ni3N/NiO&#8208;heterostructures can improve the structural stability, electronic distributions, and orbital coupling of Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO compared to Ru&#8208;Ni3N and Ru&#8208;NiO, which accordingly decreases energy barriers and increases the electroactivity for EWS. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO catalyst with a 2D Ni3N/NiO&#8208;heterostructures nanosheet array, uniformly dispersed Ru nanoparticles, and strong MSI, was successfully constructed in the experiment, which exhibited excellent HER and OER activity with overpotentials of 190&#8197;mV and 385&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Furthermore, the Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO&#8208;based EWS device can realize an industrial current density (1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 1.74&#8197;V and 1.80&#8197;V under alkaline pure water and seawater conditions, respectively. Additionally, it also achieves a high durability of 1000&#8197;h (@ 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in alkaline pure water.

Narrowband green and red fluorescent emitters by fusing naphthalene with multi&#8208;resonance BN&#8208;doped frameworks manifest near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields and narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima of 31&#8197;nm. The resulting electroluminescent devices achieve high external quantum efficiency, low efficiency roll&#8208;off and long operational lifetimes.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using conventional fluorescent emitters are currently attracting considerable interests due to outstanding stability and abundant raw materials. To construct high&#8208;performance narrowband fluorophores to satisfy requirements of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays, a strategy fusing multi&#8208;resonance BN&#8208;doped moieties to naphthalene is proposed to construct two novel narrowband fluorophores. Green Na&#8722;sBN and red Na&#8722;dBN, manifest narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima of 31&#8197;nm, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields and molecular horizontal dipole ratios above 90&#8201;%. Their OLEDs exhibit the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances including high external quantum efficiencies (EQE), ultra&#8208;low efficiency roll&#8208;off and long operational lifetimes. The Na&#8722;sBN&#8208;based device achieves EQE as high as 28.8&#8201;% and remains 19.8&#8201;% even at luminance of 100,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, and Na&#8722;dBN&#8208;based device acquires a record&#8208;high EQE of 25.2&#8201;% among all red OLEDs using pure fluorescent emitters.

Spin crossover metal&#8211;organic frameworks containing clusters as secondary building units are firstly realized, in which the clusters can be further removed via the post&#8208;synthetic modification.







Abstract
Spin crossover (SCO) materials with new architectures will expand and enrich the research in the SCO field. Here, we report two metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) containing tetradentate organic ligands and hexatopic linkers [Ag8X8(CN)6]6&#8722; (X=Br and I), which represents the first SCO MOF with clusters as building blocks. The silver halide cluster can be further removed after reacting with lithium tetracyanoquinodimethan (LiTCNQ). Such post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is realized via single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation from urk to nbo topology. Accordingly, the spin state and fluorescence properties are greatly modified by cluster deconstruction. Therefore, these achievements will provide new ideas for the design of new SCO systems and the development of PSM methods.

Here, we report two metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) containing tetradentate organic ligands and hexatopic linkers [Ag&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (X=Br and I), which represents the first SCO MOF with clusters as building blocks. The silver halide cluster can be further removed after reacting with lithium tetracyanoquinodimethan (LiTCNQ). Such post-synthetic modification (PSM) is realized via single-crystal to single-crystal (SCSC) transformation from &lt;b&gt;urk&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;nbo&lt;/b&gt; topology. Accordingly, the spin state and fluorescence properties are greatly modified by cluster deconstruction. Therefore, these achievements will provide new ideas for the design of new SCO systems and the development of PSM methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Modulation of Intramolecular Aggregation&#8208;induced Electrochemiluminescence by Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based Supramolecular Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based supramolecular architectures are systematically studied. Their strong ECL emission is attributed to the following three factors: (i) restricted free rotation of the benzene ring, (ii) intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in the conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor architecture, and (iii) electrostatic interactions between Zn2+ and the electrode surface.







Abstract
The precisely modulated synthesis of programmable light&#8208;emitting materials remains a challenge. To address this challenge, we construct four tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based supramolecular architectures (SA, SB, SC, and SD), revealing that they exhibit higher electrochemiluminescence (ECL) intensities and efficiencies than the tetraphenylethylene monomer and can be classified as highly efficient and precisely modulated intramolecular aggregation&#8211;induced electrochemiluminescence (PI&#8208;AIECL) systems. The best&#8208;performing system (SD) shows a high ECL cathodic efficiency exceeding that of the benchmark tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) chloride in aqueous solution by nearly six&#8208;fold. The electrochemical characterization of these architectures in an organic solvent provides deeper mechanistic insights, revealing that SD features the lowest electrochemical band gap. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the band gap of the guest ligand in the SD structure is the smallest and most closely matched to that of the host scaffold. Finally, the SD system is used to realize ECL&#8208;based cysteine detection (detection limit=14.4&#8197;nM) in real samples. Thus, this study not only provides a precisely modulated supramolecular strategy allowing chromophores to be controllably regulated on a molecular scale, but also inspires the programmable synthesis of high&#8208;performance aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence emitters.

         <title>Enantioselective High&#8208;Throughput Assay Showcased for the Identification of (R)&#8208; as well as (S)&#8208;Selective Unspecific Peroxygenases for C&#8722;H Oxidation</title>

         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput assay was established to assess stereoselectivity, stereopreference, and activity in peroxygenase&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation. The assay accurately predicts the ee value of the product with &#177;11&#8201;% accuracy. It enabled the discovery of novel wild&#8208;type fungal peroxygenases with remarkable enantioselectivity for both (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;alcohols. Homology models and docking studies supported the observed stereopreferences.







Abstract
Identifying (bio)catalysts displaying high enantio&#8208;/stereoselectivity is a fundamental prerequisite for the advancement of asymmetric catalysis. Herein, a high&#8208;throughput, stereoselective screening assay is reported that gives information on enantioselectivity, stereopreference and activity as showcased for peroxygenase&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation. The assay is based on spectrophotometric analysis of the simultaneous formation of NAD(P)H from the alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzed enantioselective oxidation of the sec&#8208;alcohol product formed in the peroxygenase reaction. The assay was applied to investigate a library comprising 44 unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) containing 25 UPOs not reported yet. Thereby, previously non&#8208;described wild&#8208;type UPOs displaying (S)&#8208; as well as (R)&#8208;stereoselectivity for the hydroxylation of representative model substrates were identified, reaching up to 98&#8201;% ee for the (R)&#8208; and 94&#8201;% ee for the (S)&#8208;enantiomer. Homology models with concomitant docking studies indicated the structural reason for the observed complementary stereopreference.

         <title>A Negatively Curved &#960;&#8208;Expanded Pyracylene Comprising a Tropylium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negatively curved pyracylene scaffolds with an incorporated 7&#8208;membered ring were synthesized by progressive &#960;&#8208;expansion. The embedded tropone unit allowed facile generation of the aromatic tropylium cation, which displays considerable stability, near&#8208;infrared absorption, and characteristic structural features in the solid state.







Abstract
We disclose &#960;&#8208;expanded pyracylenes and their cationic species comprising 7&#8208;membered rings. The compounds were synthesized by stepwise oxidative cyclodehydrogenation to monitor the effect of successive cyclization on the structural and optoelectronic properties. As shown by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the complete cyclization leads to a boat&#8208;shaped scaffold featuring negative curvature provided by the 7&#8208;membered ring. The embedded tropone unit enabled the convenient generation of a stabilized tropylium cation, showing bathochromically shifted absorption bands reaching into the near&#8208;infrared region beyond 1000&#8197;nm. The altered structural features, supported by theoretical calculations, point towards the positively charged 7&#8208;membered ring having aromatic character.

         <title>Photocatalytic Enantioselective Hydrosulfonylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyls with Sulfonyl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient enantioselective hydrosulfonylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls has been established, utilizing readily accessible sulfonyl chlorides, and facilitated by visible light irradiation in conjunction with chiral Ni&#8208;catalysis. This protocol enables the production of a diverse range of &#945;&#8208;chiral sulfones with remarkable enantioselectivity.







Abstract
This research explores the enantioselective hydrosulfonylation of various &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds via the use of visible light and redox&#8208;active chiral Ni&#8208;catalysis, facilitating the synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;chiral sulfones with remarkable enantioselectivity (exceeding 99&#8201;% ee). A significant challenge entails enhancing the reactivity between chiral metal&#8208;coordinated carbonyl compounds and moderate electrophilic sulfonyl radicals, aiming to minimize the background reactions. The success of our approach stems from two distinctive attributes: 1) the Cl&#8208;atom abstraction employed for sulfonyl radical generation from sulfonyl chlorides, and 2) the single&#8208;electron reduction to produce a key enolate radical Ni&#8208;complex. The latter process appears to enhance the feasibility of the sulfonyl radical's addition to the electron&#8208;rich enolate radical. An in&#8208;depth investigation into the reaction mechanism, supported by both experimental observations and theoretical analysis, offers insight into the intricate reaction process. Moreover, the versatility of our methodology is highlighted through its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules, demonstrating its practicality as a strategy for producing &#945;&#8208;chiral sulfones.

         <title>Nickel(II) Analogues of Phosphorescent Platinum(II) Complexes with Picosecond Excited&#8208;State Decay</title>

Square planar Ni(II) complexes are potential alternatives to well&#8208;established isoelectronic Pt(II) and Au(III) luminophores. We identify the excited&#8208;state decay channels in two prototypical Ni(II) complexes and elucidate why the initially populated excited states decay within 1&#8197;ps. Clear guidelines for how to access long&#8208;lived and potentially luminescent excited states in square planar Ni(II) complexes emerge from this work.







Abstract
Square&#8208;planar NiII complexes are interesting as cheaper and more sustainable alternatives to PtII luminophores widely used in lighting and photocatalysis. We investigated the excited&#8208;state behavior of two NiII complexes, which are isostructural with two luminescent PtII complexes. The initially excited singlet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (1MLCT) excited states in the NiII complexes decay to metal&#8208;centered (3MC) excited states within less than 1 picosecond, followed by non&#8208;radiative relaxation of the 3MC states to the electronic ground state within 9&#8211;21&#8197;ps. This contrasts with the population of an emissive triplet ligand&#8208;centered (3LC) excited state upon excitation of the PtII analogues. Structural distortions of the NiII complexes are responsible for this discrepant behavior and lead to dark 3MC states far lower in energy than the luminescent 3LC states of PtII compounds. Our findings suggest that if these structural distortions could be restricted by more rigid coordination environments and stronger ligand fields, the excited&#8208;state relaxation in four&#8208;coordinate NiII complexes could be decelerated such that luminescent 3LC or 3MLCT excited states become accessible. These insights are relevant to make NiII fit for photophysical and photochemical applications that relied on PtII until now.

         <title>Long&#8208;Persistent Circularly Polarized Luminescence from a Host&#8208;Guest System Regulated by the Multiple Roles of a Gold(I)&#8208;Carbene Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping a monovalent Au&#8208;carbene complex into a boron&#8208;embedded molecular host has resulted in a host&#8211;guest system showing long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL), thus illustrating that third&#8208;row transition metals can be used to achieve LPL. The introduction of a chiral unit on the guest molecule provides a simple approach to obtain circularly polarized LPL multifunctional materials.







Abstract
The promotion of intersystem crossing (ISC) is critical for achieving a high&#8208;efficiency long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) from organic materials. However, the use of a transition&#8208;metal complex for LPL materials has not been explored because it can also shorten the emission lifetime by accelerating the phosphorescence decay. Here, we report a new class of LPL materials by doping a monovalent Au&#8208;carbene complex into a boron&#8208;embedded molecular host. The donor&#8208;acceptor systems exhibit photoluminescence with both high efficiencies (&gt;57&#8201;%) and long lifetimes (ca. 40&#8197;ms) at room temperature. It is revealed that the Au atom promotes the population of low&#8208;lying triplet excited states of the host aggregate (T1*) which can be converted into the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state, thereby resulting in afterglow luminescence. Moreover, the use of a chirality unit on the guest molecule results in the LPL being circularly polarized. This work illustrates that transition&#8208;metal complexes can be used for developing organic afterglow systems by exquisite control over the excited state mechanism.

         <title>An Oxysulfide Photocatalyst Evolving Hydrogen with an Apparent Quantum Efficiency of 30&#8201;% under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystalline, plate&#8208;like Gd2Ti2O5S2 particles with atomically ordered surfaces loaded with ultrafine composite cocatalyst particles evolve H2 from an aqueous methanol solution with a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) of 30&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting is a simple means of converting solar energy into storable hydrogen energy. Narrow&#8208;band gap oxysulfide photocatalysts have attracted much attention in this regard owing to the significant visible&#8208;light absorption and relatively high stability of these compounds. However, existing materials suffer from low efficiencies due to difficulties in synthesizing these oxysulfides with suitable degrees of crystallinity and particle sizes, and in constructing effective reaction sites. The present work demonstrates the production of a Gd2Ti2O5S2 (&#955;&lt;650&#8197;nm) photocatalyst capable of efficiently driving photocatalytic reactions. Single&#8208;crystalline, plate&#8208;like Gd2Ti2O5S2 particles with atomically ordered surfaces were synthesized by flux and chemical etching methods. Ultrafine Pt&#8208;IrO2 cocatalyst particles that promoted hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) evolution reactions were subsequently loaded on the Gd2Ti2O5S2 while ensuring an intimate contact by employing a microwave&#8208;heating technique. The optimized Gd2Ti2O5S2 was found to evolve H2 from an aqueous methanol solution with a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 30&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm. This material was also stable during O2 evolution in the presence of a sacrificial reagent. The results presented herein demonstrates a highly efficient narrow&#8208;band gap oxysulfide photocatalyst with potential applications in practical solar hydrogen production.

         <title>A Porphyrin Iron(III) &#960;&#8208;Dication Species and its Relevance in Catalyst Design for the Umpolung of Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key intermediate in bioinspired umpolung of nucleophiles is an iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication. We identify that the meso&#8208;substituent of the porphyrin controls its accessibility and report the detailed study of an iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication with the meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin ligand. We investigate the dynamics of the system and extensively characterize the species, providing crucial information for future catalyst design. Finally, we correlate the meso&#8208;substituent nature to catalytic chlorination reactivity.







Abstract
Isoporphyrins have recently been identified as remarkable species capable of turning the nucleophile attached to the porphyrin ring into an electrophile, thereby providing umpolung of reactivity (Inorg. Chem. 2022, 61, 8105&#8211;8111). They are generated by nucleophilic attack on an iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication, a class of species that has received scant attention. Here, we explore the effect of the porphyrin meso&#8208;substituent and report a iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication bearing the meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) ligand. We provide an extensive study of the species by UV/Vis absorption, 2H&#8197;NMR, EPR, applied field M&#246;ssbauer, and resonance Raman spectroscopy. We further explore the system's highly dynamic and tunable properties and address the nature of the axial ligands as well as the conformation of the porphyrin ring. The insights presented are essential for the rational design of catalysts for the umpolung of nucleophiles. Such catalytic avenues could for example provide a novel method for electrophilic chlorinations. We further examine the importance of electronic tuning of the porphyrin by nature of the meso&#8208;substituent as a factor in catalyst design.

         <title>Dearomative Ring&#8208;Fused Azafulleroids and Carbazole&#8208;Derived Metallofullerenes: Reactivity Dictated by Encapsulation in a Fullerene Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>

Divergent reactivities of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diazidobiphenyls toward C60 and Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80 have been disclosed. In the case of C60, a dearomative cascade reaction results in the formation of azafulleroids fused with a 7&#8208;6&#8208;5&#8208;membered ring system, whereas Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80 undergoes a C&#8722;H insertion pathway, with the generation of carbazole&#8208;derived [6,6]&#8208; and [5,6]&#8208;azametallofulleroids and an unusual 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole&#8208;derived metallofullerene.







Abstract
Herein, we report divergent additions of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diazidobiphenyls to C60 and Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80. In stark contrast to that of the previously reported bis&#8208;azide additions, the unexpected cascade reaction leads to the dearomative formation of azafulleroids 2 fused with a 7&#8208;6&#8208;5&#8208;membered ring system in the case of C60. In contrast, the corresponding reaction with Sc3N@Ih&#8208;C80 switches to the C&#8722;H insertion pathway, thereby resulting in multiple isomers, including a carbazole&#8208;derived [6,6]&#8208;azametallofulleroid 3 and a [5,6]&#8208;azametallofulleroid 4 and an unusual 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;c]carbazole&#8208;derived metallofullerene 5, whose molecular structures have been unambiguously determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Among them, the addition type of 5 is observed for the first time in all reported additions of azides to fullerenes. Furthermore, unexpected isomerizations from 3 to 5 and from 4 to 5 have been discovered, providing the first examples of the isomerization of an azafulleroid to a carbazole&#8208;derived fullerene rather than an aziridinofullerene. In particular, the isomerism of the [5,6]&#8208;isomer 4 to the [5,6]&#8208;isomer 5 is unprecedented in fullerene chemistry, contradicting the present understanding that isomerization generally occurs between [5,6]&#8208; and [6,6]&#8208;isomers. Control experiments have been carried out to rationalize the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, representative azafulleroids have been applied in organic solar cells, thereby resulting in improved power conversion efficiencies.

         <title>The Molecular Basis of Catalysis by SDR Family Members Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Reductase FabG and Enoyl&#8208;ACP Reductase FabI in Type&#8208;II Fatty Acid Biosynthesis</title>

The distinct substrate allosteric recognition and reduction catalytic mechanisms of ketoacyl&#8208;ACP reductase FabG and enoyl&#8208;ACP reductase FabI in Type&#8208;II fatty acid biosynthesis are reported. The enzymes use alternative catalytic tunnels and core catalytic triads to recognize different ACP, NAD(P)H and fatty acid substrates for asymmetric reduction catalysis.







Abstract
The short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily members acyl&#8208;ACP reductases FabG and FabI are indispensable core enzymatic modules and catalytic orientation controllers in type&#8208;II fatty acid biosynthesis. Herein, we report their distinct substrate allosteric recognition and enantioselective reduction mechanisms. FabG achieves allosteric regulation of ACP and NADPH through ACP binding across two adjacent FabG monomers, while FabI follows an irreversible compulsory order of substrate binding in that NADH binding must precede that of ACP on a discrete FabI monomer. Moreover, FabG and FabI utilize a backdoor residue Phe187 or a &#8220;rheostat&#8221; &#945;8 helix for acyl chain length selection, and their corresponding triad residues Ser142 or Tyr145 recognize the keto&#8208; or enoyl&#8208;acyl substrates, respectively, facilitating initiation of nucleophilic attack by NAD(P)H. The other two triad residues (Tyr and Lys) mediate subsequent proton transfer and (R)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208; or saturated acyl&#8208;ACP production.

         <title>An NIR Fluorescence Turn&#8208;on and MRl Bimodal Probe for Concurrent Real&#8208;time in vivo Sensing and Labeling of &#946;&#8208;Galactosidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimodal imaging probe, Gal&#8208;Cy&#8208;Gd&#8208;1, has been developed to monitor &#946;&#8208;gal activity in real&#8208;time and to provide valuable assistance for precise tumour removal during surgery in vivo using NIR fluorescence and MRI. Activation of &#946;&#8208;gal results in an increase in the NIR fluorescence intensity, allowing sensitive covalent labeling of adjacent target enzymes or proteins to promote probe accumulation at the tumour site, facilitating high&#8208;resolution MRI.







Abstract
To realize sensing and labeling biomarkers is quite challenging in terms of designing multimodal imaging probes. In this study, we developed a novel &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal) activated bimodal imaging probe that combines near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to enable real&#8208;time visualization of activity in living organisms. Upon &#946;&#8208;gal activation, Gal&#8208;Cy&#8208;Gd&#8208;1 exhibits a remarkable 42&#8208;fold increase in NIR fluorescence intensity at 717&#8197;nm, allowing covalent labeling of adjacent target enzymes or proteins and avoiding molecular escape to promote probe accumulation at the tumor site. This fluorescence reaction enhances the longitudinal relaxivity by approximately 1.9 times, facilitating high&#8208;resolution MRI. The unique features of Gal&#8208;Cy&#8208;Gd&#8208;1 enable real&#8208;time and precise visualization of &#946;&#8208;gal activity in live tumor cells and mice. The probe's utilization aids in identifying in situ ovarian tumors, offering valuable assistance in the precise removal of tumor tissue during surgical procedures in mice. The fusion of NIR fluorescence and MRI activation through self&#8208;immobilizing target enzymes or proteins provides a robust approach for visualizing &#946;&#8208;gal activity. Moreover, this approach sets the groundwork for developing other activatable bimodal probes, allowing real&#8208;time in vivo imaging of enzyme activity and localization.

         <title>Metamorphosis of a Commodity Plastic like PVC to Efficient Catalytic Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complementary concept of polymeric waste valorization (upcycling) through metamorphosis in &#8220;green&#8221; media of an out&#8208;of&#8208;use piece of a daily life commodity plastic like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to &#8220;valorized&#8221; PVC single&#8208;chain nanoparticles&#8212;useful as recyclable / metalloenzyme&#8208;mimetic catalyst for Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed organic transformations&#8212;is reported.







Abstract
We perform the conversion of a commodity plastic of common use in pipes, window frames, medical devices, flexible hoses, etc. like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs). SCNPs are versatile, protein&#8208;mimetic soft nano&#8208;objects of growing interest for catalysis, sensing, and nanomedicine, among other uses. We demonstrate that the metamorphosis process &#8208;as induced through metal&#8208;free click chemistry&#8208; leads to well&#8208;defined, uniform SCNPs that are stable during storage in the solid state for months. All the conversion process (from PVC isolation to PVC&#8208;SCNPs synthesis) can be run in a green, dipolar aprotic solvent and involving, when required, a simple mixture of ethanol and water (1/1&#8197;vol.) as non&#8208;solvent. The resulting PVC&#8208;SCNPs are investigated as recyclable, metalloenzyme&#8208;mimetic catalysts for several representative Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed organic reactions. The method could be valid for the metamorphosis and valorization of other commodity plastics in which it is feasible to install azide functional groups in their linear polymer chains.

         <title>Biogenetic Chiral Deep Eutectic Solvents that Produce Self&#8208;Assembled Chiroptical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transfer of chirality from chiral deep eutectic solvents (DESs) to achiral solutes has been used to control self&#8208;assembly. The DESs were prepared using choline chloride or cyclodextrin as hydrogen bonding acceptors and natural chiral acids as donors, with chirality amplification in the presence of minimal amounts of entrapped chiral acids occurring through the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the solutes during aggregation.







Abstract
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) show particular properties compared to ionic liquids and other traditional organic solvents. Controlled synthesis of chiral materials in DESs is unprecedented due to the complex interplays between DESs and solutes. In this work, all bio&#8208;derived chiral DESs were prepared using choline chloride or cyclodextrin as hydrogen bonding acceptors and natural chiral acids as donors, which performed as chiral matrices for the rational synthesis of chiroptical materials by taking advantage of the efficient chirality transfer between the DESs and solutes. In a very selective manner, building units with molecular pockets could facilitate strong binding affinity towards chiral acid components of DESs disregarding the presence of competitive hydrogen bonding acceptors. Chirality transfer from DESs to nanoassemblies leads to chirality amplification in the presence of minimal amounts of entrapped chiral acids, thanks to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of solutes during aggregation. This work utilizes chiral DESs to control supramolecular chirality, and illustrates the structural basis for the fabrication of DES&#8208;based chiral materials.

         <title>Controllable Topological Transformations of 818 Molecular Metalla&#8208;knots by Oxidation of Thiazole&#8208;Based Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric dipyridyl ligand containing a thiazole moiety and two tetracene&#8208;based bimetallic building blocks have been used to synthesize two 818 molecular metalla&#8208;knots in high yields. Post&#8208;synthetic oxidation of the thiazole&#8208;based ligand under mild conditions resulted in the transformation of the 818 molecular metalla&#8208;knots into simple tetranuclear macrocycles.







Abstract
By exploiting coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, high yields of two 818 molecular metalla&#8208;knots could be obtained using a thiazole&#8208;moiety&#8208;containing asymmetric dipyridyl ligand 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylethynyl)benzo[d]thiazole (L1), as confirmed using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, electrospray ionization&#8208;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight/mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;TOF/MS), and detailed liquid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. To modulate the self&#8208;assembled structures, m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) was utilized to oxidize thiazole&#8208;based ligand L1 to N&#8208;thiazole&#8208;oxide&#8208;based ligand 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ylethynyl)benzo[d]thiazole 3&#8208;oxide (L2), which enabled the selective construction of the corresponding tetranuclear macrocycles. Notably, two molecular metalla&#8208;knots could be topologically transformed from 818 knots to simple monocycles because the L1 alkyne bond was inert toward m&#8208;CPBA, as confirmed by liquid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, ESI&#8208;TOF/MS, and elemental analysis.

         <title>Supramolecular Barrel&#8208;Rosette Ion Channel Based on 3,5&#8208;Diaminobenzoic Acid for Cation&#8208;Anion Symport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis((R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;mandelic acid)&#8208;linked 3,5&#8208;diaminobenzoic acid&#8208;based supramolecular barrel&#8208;rosette ion channels have been synthesized that possess a distinctive combination of hydrogen&#8208;bond forming and lone&#8208;pair donating groups within the channel cavity. This allows them to function as cation&#8208;anion symporters, with profound selectivity towards KClO4.







Abstract
The structural tropology and functions of natural cation&#8208;anion symporting channels have been continuously investigated due to their crucial role in regulating various physiological functions. To understand the physiological functions of the natural symporter channels, it is vital to develop small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based biomimicking systems that can provide mechanistic insights into the ion&#8208;binding sites and the ion&#8208;translocation pathways. Herein, we report a series of bis((R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;mandelic acid)&#8208;linked 3,5&#8208;diaminobenzoic acid based self&#8208;assembled ion channels with distinctive ion transport ability. Ion transport experiment across the lipid bilayer membrane revealed that compound 1&#8201;b exhibits the highest transport activity among the series, and it has interesting selective co&#8208;transporting functions, i.e., facilitates K+/ClO4&#8722; symport. Electrophysiology experiments confirmed the formation of supramolecular ion channels with an average diameter of 6.2&#177;1&#8197;&#197; and single channel conductance of 57.3&#177;1.9&#8197;pS. Selectivity studies of channel 1&#8201;b in a bilayer lipid membrane demonstrated a permeability ratio of 
, 
, and 
 indicating the higher selectivity of the channel towards KClO4 over KCl salt. A hexameric assembly of a trimeric rosette of 1&#8201;b was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations with different salts to understand the supramolecular channel formation and ion selectivity pattern.

         <title>Photoswitchable and Reversible Fluorescent Eutectogels for Conformal Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the glowing sucker octopus, a reversible fluorescent eutectogel is prepared by incorporating anthracene groups as the photoswitchable fluorescent unit for conformal encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting, which can be reversibly written/erased with patterns by non&#8208;contact stimulation and conformally deform with arbitrary substrates. The developed eutectogel provides a promising strategy for the future development of advanced intelligent anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.







Abstract
Smart fluorescent materials that can respond to environmental stimuli are of great importance in the fields of information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, traditional fluorescent materials usually face problems such as lack of tunable fluorescence and insufficient surface&#8208;adaptive adhesion, hindering their practical applications. Herein, inspired by the glowing sucker octopus, we present a novel strategy to fabricate a reversible fluorescent eutectogel with high transparency, adhesive and self&#8208;healing performance for conformal information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Using anthracene as luminescent unit, the eutectogel exhibits photoswitchable fluorescence and can therefore be reversibly written/erased with patterns by non&#8208;contact stimulation. Additionally, different from mechanically irreversible adhesion via glue, the eutectogel can adhere to various irregular substrates over a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 65&#8201;&#176;C) and conformally deform more than 1000&#8197;times without peeling off. Furthermore, by exploiting surface&#8208;adaptive adhesion, high transparency and good stretchability of the eutectogel, dual encryption can be achieved under UV and stretching conditions to further improve the security level. This study should provide a promising strategy for the future development of advanced intelligent anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Hydrodeoxygenation of Oxygen&#8208;Containing Aromatic Plastic Wastes to Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 46/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of various oxygen&#8208;containing aromatic plastic wastes (PC, PET, PBT, and PPO) to cycloalkanes as liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) is reported by Sibao Liu, Guozhu Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202310505). The collected oxyen&#8208;containing aromatic plastic wastes such as bottles, key boards, cloth fibers, etc., are first sorted and washed by machine to ensure that these plastic wastes are pure enough to be chemically recycled. Then the sorted plastic wastes or their mixture are processed by HDO reaction over a catalytic system comprised of Ru&#8208;ReOx/SiO2 and HZSM&#8208;5.

         <title>Inside Cover: Synthesis of Levulinic Acids From Muconic Acids in Hot Water (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 46/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple heating of muconic acid in water at high temperature in an autoclave under autogenic pressure provides levulinic acid in high yield, as described by Bert U.&#8197;W. Maes et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202309597). The method can also be applied to make substituted levulinic acids from the corresponding muconic acids. Lignin oil rich in propylguaiacol obtained from pine sawdust has been successfully transformed into 3&#8208;propyllevulinic acid.

         <dc:description>
A highly efficient &#946;&#8208;arabinofuranosylation utilizing boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) is presented by Kazunobu Toshima, Daisuke Takahashi, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202307015). The glycosylations proceeded smoothly for a variety of diols, triols, and unprotected sugar acceptors under mild conditions with predictable regioselectivity and complete &#946;&#8208;stereoselectivity. Furthermore, the cover image shows that the regioselectivity in the BMAD reaction could be reversed by examining the reaction conditions and catalyst.

Whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) microcavities featuring distinguishable sharp peaks in a broadband exhibit enormous advantages in the field of miniaturized photonic barcodes. In their Research Article (e202310263), Zhenhua Gao, Yong Sheng Zhao et&#8197;al. have developed a surface tension assisted heterogeneous assembly strategy to construct WGM hetero&#8208;microrings through regulating the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions along circular boundaries, which remarkably promotes the security level and encoding capacity of the barcodes.

Bioelectrocatalytic synthesis represents an exciting merger of selective biocatalysis and green electrochemical methods for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. In this review we introduce the key concepts and vital applications of both enzymatic and microbial electrosynthetic systems.







Abstract
Bioelectrocatalytic synthesis is the conversion of electrical energy into value&#8208;added products using biocatalysts. These methods merge the specificity and selectivity of biocatalysis and energy&#8208;related electrocatalysis to address challenges in the sustainable synthesis of pharmaceuticals, commodity chemicals, fuels, feedstocks and fertilizers. However, the specialized experimental setups and domain knowledge for bioelectrocatalysis pose a significant barrier to adoption. This review introduces key concepts of bioelectrosynthetic systems. We provide a tutorial on the methods of biocatalyst utilization, the setup of bioelectrosynthetic cells, and the analytical methods for assessing bioelectrocatalysts. Key applications of bioelectrosynthesis in ammonia production and small&#8208;molecule synthesis are outlined for both enzymatic and microbial systems. This review serves as a necessary introduction and resource for the non&#8208;specialist interested in bioelectrosynthetic research.

         <title>Toward Sustainable Metal&#8208;Iodine Batteries: Materials, Electrochemistry and Design Strategies</title>

         <dc:description>
This review summarizes three types of iodine cathodes with their reaction mechanisms and highlights progress of various metal anodes and optimization strategies in metal&#8208;iodine batteries. The possibility of alternate metal anodes and their design strategy is enlightened. To build sustainable batteries, the key electrochemical parameters of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal&#8208;iodine batteries are compared and analyzed to solve critical issues.







Abstract
Due to the natural abundance of iodine, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainability, metal&#8208;iodine batteries are competitive for the next&#8208;generation energy storage systems with high energy density, and large power density. However, the inherent properties of iodine such as electronic insulation and shuttle behavior of soluble iodine species affect negatively rate performance, cyclability, and self&#8208;discharge behavior of metal&#8208;iodine batteries, while the dendrite growth and metal corrosion on the anode side brings potential safety hazards and inferior durability. These problems of metal&#8208;iodine system still exist and need to be solved urgently. Herein, we summarize the research progress of metal&#8208;iodine batteries in the past decades. Firstly, the classification, design strategy and reaction mechanism of iodine electrode are briefly outlined. Secondly, the current development and protection strategy of conventional metal anodes in metal&#8208;iodine batteries are highlighted, and some potential anode materials and their design strategies are proposed. Thirdly, the key electrochemical parameters of state&#8208;of&#8208;art metal&#8208;iodine batteries are compared and analyzed to solve critical issues for realizing next&#8208;generation iodine&#8208;based energy storage systems. Therefore, the aim of this review is to promote the development of metal&#8208;iodine batteries and provide guidelines for their design.

         <title>Oligomerized Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview discusses developments in oligomerized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (OFREAs), which combine the advantages of small&#8208;molecule acceptors (well&#8208;defined structures and batch reproducibility) and polymer acceptors (good film formation, low diffusion coefficient, and excellent stability). OFREAs have a great potential to achieve highly efficient and stable organic solar cells.







Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted wide research attention in the past decades. Very recently, oligomerized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (OFREAs) have emerged as a promising alternative to small&#8208;molecular/polymeric acceptor&#8208;based OSCs due to their unique advantages such as well&#8208;defined structures, batch reproducibility, good film formation, low diffusion coefficient, and excellent stability. So far, rapid advances have been made in the development of OFREAs consisting of directly/rigidly/flexibly linked oligomers and fused ones. In this Minireview, we systematically summarized the recent research progress of OFREAs, including structural diversity, synthesis approach, molecular conformation and packing, and long&#8208;term stability. Finally, we conclude with future perspectives on the challenges to be addressed and potential research directions. We believe that this Minireview will encourage the development of novel OFREAs for OSC applications.

         <title>Engineering of Therapeutic and Detoxifying Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Therapeutic enzymes have immense potential for treating human diseases, but their clinical application is hindered by the need for substantial improvement through protein engineering. Advanced techniques like design and directed evolution can enhance therapeutic enzymes, leading to biocatalysts with new therapeutic activities and high selectivity.







Abstract
Therapeutic enzymes present excellent opportunities for the treatment of human disease, modulation of metabolic pathways and system detoxification. However, current use of enzyme therapy in the clinic is limited as naturally occurring enzymes are seldom optimal for such applications and require substantial improvement by protein engineering. Engineering strategies such as design and directed evolution that have been successfully implemented for industrial biocatalysis can significantly advance the field of therapeutic enzymes, leading to biocatalysts with new&#8208;to&#8208;nature therapeutic activities, high selectivity, and suitability for medical applications. This minireview highlights case studies of how state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and emerging methods in protein engineering are explored for the generation of therapeutic enzymes and discusses gaps and future opportunities in the field of enzyme therapy.

         <title>Materials Space&#8208;Tectonics: Atomic&#8208;level Compositional and Spatial Control Methodologies for Synthesis of Future Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent examples of material synthesis based on designing building blocks (i.e., tectons) and their hybridization. It provides practical guidelines for successfully implementing materials syntheses and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of practical applications. Lastly, the potential integration of materials space&#8208;tectonics with emerging technologies, such as materials informatics, is discussed.







Abstract
Reactions occurring at surfaces and interfaces necessitate the creation of well&#8208;designed surface and interfacial structures. To achieve a combination of bulk material (i.e., framework) and void spaces, a meticulous process of &#8220;nano&#8208;architecting&#8221; of the available space is necessary. Conventional porous materials such as mesoporous silica, zeolites, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks lack advanced cooperative functionalities owing to their largely monotonous pore geometries and limited conductivities. To overcome these limitations and develop functional structures with surface&#8208;specific functions, the novel materials space&#8208;tectonics methodology has been proposed for future materials synthesis. This review summarizes recent examples of materials synthesis based on designing building blocks (i.e., tectons) and their hybridization, along with practical guidelines for implementing materials syntheses and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of practical applications.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Cylindrocyclophanes A and F and Merocyclophanes A and D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cylindrocyclophanes A and F and merocyclophanes A and D were synthesized by a chemoenzymatic approach. The synthesis features an enzymatic Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, reagent&#8208;controlled lithiation&#8211;borylation chemistry, cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration, and Ni&#8208; or Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8211;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
Incorporating enzymatic reactions into natural product synthesis can significantly improve synthetic efficiency and selectivity. In contrast to the increasing applications of biocatalytic functional&#8208;group interconversions, the use of enzymatic C&#8722;C bond formation reactions in natural product synthesis is underexplored. Herein, we report a concise and efficient approach for the synthesis of [7.7]paracyclophane natural products, a family of polyketides with diverse biological activities. By using enzymatic Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, cylindrocyclophanes A and F and merocyclophanes A and D were synthesized in six to eight steps in the longest linear sequence. This study demonstrates the power of combining enzymatic reactions with contemporary synthetic methodologies and provides opportunities for the structure&#8211;activity relationship studies of [7.7]paracyclophane natural products.

         <title>Display Selection of a Hybrid Foldamer&#8211;Peptide Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reciprocal stapling of two helices, an aromatic foldamer helix and a peptide &#945;&#8208;helix, was observed in the conformation of a hybrid foldamer&#8211;peptide macrocycle when bound to the protein target against which it was selected. This intriguing shape and the possible contribution of the foldamer to protein binding highlight potential benefits of inserting a foldamer segment in display selection of macrocyclic peptides.







Abstract
Expanding the chemical diversity of peptide macrocycle libraries for display selection is desirable to improve their potential to bind biomolecular targets. We now have implemented a considerable expansion through a large aromatic helical foldamer inclusion. A foldamer was first identified that undergoes flexizyme&#8208;mediated tRNA acylation and that is capable of initiating ribosomal translation with yields sufficiently high to perform an mRNA display selection of macrocyclic foldamer&#8211;peptide hybrids. A hybrid macrocyclic nanomolar binder to the C&#8208;lobe of the E6AP HECT domain was selected that showed a highly converged peptide sequence. A crystal structure and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that both the peptide and foldamer are helical in an intriguing reciprocal stapling fashion. The strong residue convergence could be rationalized based on their involvement in specific interactions with the target protein. The foldamer stabilizes the peptide helix through stapling and through contacts with key residues. These results altogether represent a significant extension of the chemical space amenable to display selection and highlight possible benefits of inserting an aromatic foldamer into a peptide macrocycle for the purpose of protein recognition.

         <title>Synthesis of Levulinic Acids From Muconic Acids in Hot Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrolysis of biorenewable muconic acids or their corresponding lactones in high temperature water allows the selective synthesis of levulinic acids. This enables direct access to novel substituted levulinic acids from biomass, creating novel opportunities for industrial applications. 3&#8208;Propyllevulinic acid was used to synthesize a novel plasticizer which performed equally well as a commercial, petrochemical phthalate&#8208;based benchmark.







Abstract
Levulinic acid is a key biorenewable platform molecule. Its current chemical production from sugars is plagued by limited yields, char formation and difficult separations. An alternative and selective route starting from muconic acid via simple heating in water at high temperature (180&#8201;&#176;C) has been developed. Muconic acid can be obtained from sugars or catechol fermentation. Chemical oxidation of catechol is another possibility which advantageously can also be applied on substituted catechols, hereby providing substituted muconic acids. When applying the disclosed hydrothermal protocol on these substrates hitherto unknown substituted levulinic acids were accessed. In particular, 3&#8208;propyllevulinic acid has been synthesized from 4&#8208;propylcatechol, prepared from pine wood. This propylated derivative has been used for the synthesis of a 3&#8208;propyllevulinate diester, i.e. butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl bis(4&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;propylpentanoate), via esterification with 1,4&#8208;butanediol. The diester showed superior performance as plasticizer in comparison to the corresponding levulinate diester in both PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and PLA (polylactic acid). It plasticizes equally effective as the notorious commercial phthalate&#8208;based benchmark DEHP (di&#8208;2&#8208;ethylhexyl phthalate) in PVC.

         <title>Residual&#8208;Chemical&#8208;Shift&#8208;Anisotropy&#8208;Based Enantiodifferentiation in Lyotropic Liquid Crystalline Phases Based on Helically Chiral Polyacetylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The residual chemical shift anisotropy can be acquired from enantiomers employing biphasic helically chiral polyacetylene liquid crystal from a single 1D carbon spectrum. The chiral environment of the liquid crystal facilitates diastereomorphous interactions of enantiomers and leads to two different sets of RCSAs. On the basis of two chiral molecules, it has been demonstrated that enantiodiscrimination is feasible







Abstract
Anisotropic NMR spectroscopy, revealing residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and residual chemical shift anisotropies (RCSAs) has emerged as a powerful tool to determine the configurations of synthetic and complex natural compounds. The deduction of the absolute in addition to the relative configuration is one of the primary goals in the field. Therefore, the investigation of the enantiodiscriminating capabilities of chiral alignment media becomes essential. While RDCs and RCSAs are now used for the determination of the relative configuration routinely, RCSAs have not been measured in chiral alignment media such as chiral liquid crystals. Herein, we present this application by measuring RCSAs for chiral analytes such as indanol and isopinocampheol in the lyotropic liquid crystalline phase of an L&#8208;valine derived helically chiral polyacetylenes. We have also demonstrated that a single 1D 13C&#8722;{1H} NMR spectrum suffices to get the RCSAs circumventing the necessity to acquire two spectra at two alignment conditions.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite With Heat Switching Birefringence</title>

A hybrid halide perovskite (C2N3H4)2PbCl4 exhibits heat switching birefringence which may be beneficial to the further development of stimuli&#8208;responsive polarization optical devices.







Abstract
Birefringent crystals that can switch light polarization have important applications in optoelectronics. In the last decades, birefringence is mostly optimized by chemical strategies. Recently, switching birefringence by physical means has attracted much attention. Here, this work reports the observation of heat switching birefringence in a 2D layered hybrid halide perovskite (C2N3H4)2PbCl4 ((C2N3H4)+=1,2,4&#8208;triazolium). This heat switching birefringence leads to a significant change in the interference color for the crystal plate under the illumination of orthogonal polarized light. Structure analyses reveal a heat dependent structure transition in (C2N3H4)2PbCl4, whose birefringence is switched by the change in the distortion degree of PbCl6 octahedron. This discovery may be beneficial to the further development of stimuli&#8208;responsive polarization optical devices.

Structure analyses reveal a heat dependent structure transition in (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, whose birefringence is switched by the change in the distortion degree of PbCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedron. This discovery may be beneficial to the further development of stimuli-responsive polarization optical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Azopolyesters with Intrinsic Crystallinity and Photoswitchable Reversible Solid&#8208;to&#8208;Liquid Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene&#8208;based polyesters (azopolyesters) from copolymerization of azobenzene&#8208;based epoxides with cyclic anhydrides possess remarkable intrinsic crystallinity and novel photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition abilities, owing to photoinduced trans&#8208;cis isomerizations of azobenzenes being inlaid with soft alkyl side&#8208;chain. This represents a new design strategy for the synthesis of reversible adhesives.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce a variety of azopolyesters (azobenzene&#8208;based polyesters) with remarkable intrinsic crystallinity and photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition abilities from copolymerization of azobenzene&#8208;based epoxides with cyclic anhydrides. The length of the soft alkyl side&#8208;chain inlaid with azobenzenes and stereoregularity of main&#8208;chain of azopolymers have tremendous effects on crystallization properties of the resulting polyesters with melting temperature (Tm) in the range of 51&#8211;251&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, some of azopolyesters possess excellently photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition performance thanks to trans&#8208;cis photoisomerization of azobenzenes. Trans&#8208;azopolyesters are yellow solids with Tms or glass transition temperatures (Tgs) above room temperature, whereas cis&#8208;polymers are red liquids with Tgs below &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. These azopolyesters could be applied as novel light&#8208;switchable adhesives for quartz/quartz, wood/wood and quartz/wood adhesion, with the strength in the range of 0.73&#8211;0.89&#8197;MPa for trans&#8208;polymers. Conversely, the adhesion strength of liquefied cis&#8208;azopolyesters generated from the irradiation of trans&#8208;polymers by UV light was about 0.1&#8197;MPa, which shows light enable to control the adhesion process with high spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Boosted Kinetic and Selective Molecular Sieving of C6 Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine can improve the hydrophobic profile of leaning pillararenes, leading to a significant kinetic selectivity for benzene over cyclohexane (20&#8201;:&#8201;1).







Abstract
Porous molecular sorbents have excellent selectivity towards hydrocarbon separation with energy saving techniques. However, to realize commercialization, molecular sieving processes should be faster and more efficient compared to extended frameworks. In this work, we show that utilizing fluorine to improve the hydrophobic profile of leaning pillararenes affords a substantial kinetic selective adsorption of benzene over cyclohexane (20&#8201;:&#8201;1 for benzene). The crystal structure shows a porous macrocycle that acts as a perfect match for benzene in both the intrinsic and extrinsic cavities with strong interactions in the solid state. The fluorinated leaning pillararene surpasses all reported organic molecular sieves and is comparable to the extended metal&#8211;organic frameworks that were previously employed for this separation such as UIO&#8208;66. Most importantly, this sieving system outperformed the well&#8208;known zeolitic imidazolate frameworks under low pressure, which opens the door to new generations of molecular sieves that can compete with extended frameworks for more sustainable hydrocarbon separation.

         <title>StereoPHIP: Stereoselective Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of parahydrogen to a prochiral enol pyruvate ester with chiral catalysts followed by polarization transfer to 13C affords highly 13C&#8208;hyperpolarized (over 20&#8201;%) L&#8208; and D&#8208;lactate derivatives with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) followed by polarization transfer to 13C is a rapidly developing technique for the generation of 13C&#8208;hyperpolarized substrates. Chirality plays an essential role in living systems and differential metabolism of enantiomeric pairs of metabolic substrates is well documented. Inspired by asymmetric hydrogenation, here we report stereoPHIP, which involves the addition of parahydrogen to a prochiral substrate with a chiral catalyst followed by polarization transfer to 13C spins. We demonstrate that parahydrogen could be rapidly added to the prochiral precursor to both enantiomers of lactic acid (D and L), with both the (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers of a chiral rhodium(I) catalyst to afford highly 13C&#8208;hyperpolarized (over 20&#8201;%) L&#8208; and D&#8208;lactate ester derivatives, respectively, with excellent stereoselectivity. We also show that the hyperpolarized 1H signal decays obtained with the (R,R) and (S,S) catalysts were markedly different. StereoPHIP expands the scope of conventional PHIP to the production of 13C hyperpolarized chiral substrates with high stereoselectivity.

         <title>When Is a Bond Broken? The Polarizability Perspective.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Static polarizability maxima along bond dissociation coordinates represent the onset of electron density localization and thus can used to be define when is a chemical bond broken.







Abstract
The question of when a chemical bond can be said to be broken is of fundamental chemical interest but has not been widely studied. Herein we propose that the maxima of static polarizability along bond dissociation coordinates naturally define cutoff points for bond rupture, as they represent the onset of localization of shared electron density into constituent fragments. Examples of computed polarizability maxima over the course of bond cleavage in main&#8208;group and transition metal compounds are provided, across covalent, dative and charge&#8208;shift bonds. The behavior along reaction paths is also considered. Overall, the static polarizability is found to be a sensitive reporter of electronic structure reorganization associated with bond stretching, and thus can serve as a metric for describing bond cleavage (or diagnose the absence of a chemical bond).

N=8 armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) were successfully synthesized in solution utilizing a custom arylated polynaphthalene precursor. The resulting 8&#8208;AGNR exhibits a noteworthy near&#8208;infrared absorption profile which signifies an exceptionally low optical band gap of 0.52&#8197;eV and demonstrates a record high dc charge&#8208;carrier mobility of up to 270&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Structurally defined graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have emerged as promising candidates for nanoelectronic devices. Low band gap (&lt;1&#8197;eV) GNRs are particularly important when considering the Schottky barrier in device performance. Here, we demonstrate the first solution synthesis of 8&#8208;AGNRs through a carefully designed arylated polynaphthalene precursor. The efficiency of the oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of the tailor&#8208;made polymer precursor into 8&#8208;AGNRs was validated by FT&#8208;IR, Raman, and UV/Vis&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption spectroscopy, and further supported by the synthesis of naphtho[1,2,3,4&#8208;ghi]perylene derivatives (1 and 2) as subunits of 8&#8208;AGNR, with a width of 0.86&#8197;nm as suggested by the X&#8208;ray single crystal analysis. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and solid&#8208;state NMR analyses provided further structural support for 8&#8208;AGNR. The resulting 8&#8208;AGNR exhibited a remarkable NIR absorption extending up to &#8764;2400&#8197;nm, corresponding to an optical band gap as low as &#8764;0.52&#8197;eV. Moreover, optical&#8208;pump TeraHertz&#8208;probe spectroscopy revealed charge&#8208;carrier mobility in the dc limit of &#8764;270&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for the 8&#8208;AGNR.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Activating Biomimetic Polyoxomolybdate for Boosting Oxygen Evolution in Neutral Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>

Electron&#8208;transfer photochromism is used to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, providing an innovative design concept for the development of non&#8208;precious metal OER catalysts in artificial photosynthesis devices.







Abstract
Inspired by the metal&#8208;oxo cluster structural feature and charge separation behaviour of the oxygen evolving center (OEC) in photosystem II (PS&#8208;II) under photoirradiation, a new crystalline photochromic polyoxomolybdate, MV2[&#946;&#8208;Mo8O26] (1, MV=methyl viologen cation), is designed as a biomimetic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst in neutral electrolytes. After photoinduced electron transfer (PIET) with colour change from colourless to grey, it remains in an ultra&#8208;stable charge&#8208;separated state over a year under ambient conditions. The observed overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope decrease by 49&#8197;mV and 62.8&#8197;mV&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dec&#8722;1 after coloration, respectively. The outstanding OER performance of the coloured state in neutral electrolytes even outperforms the commercial RuO2 benchmark. Experimental and theoretical studies show that oxygen holes within polyanions after irradiation serve as sites for enhancing direct O&#8722;O coupling, thus effectively promoting OER. This is the first successful application of electron&#8208;transfer photochromism to realize OER activity gain.

A gold&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking process is presented herein by employing a ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis. This process is harnessed to develop a novel gold&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of alkenes with iodoarenes by leveraging the interplay of chain&#8208;walking and &#960;&#8208;activation reactivity mode.







Abstract
The successful realization of gold&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking reactions, facilitated by ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis, has been reported for the first time. This breakthrough has led to the development of gold&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of alkenes with iodoarenes by leveraging the interplay of chain&#8208;walking and &#960;&#8208;activation reactivity mode. The reaction mechanism has been elucidated through comprehensive experimental and computational studies.

         <title>Photoredox Cascade Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Production with Biomass Photoreforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photoredox cascade photocatalyst consisting of dual&#8208;dye sensitized Pt&#8208;TiO2 nanoparticle photocatalyst and 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) molecular catalyst was constructed. The system produced H2 efficiently under blue&#8208;light to simultaneously generate one&#8208;electron oxidized TEMPO+ that oxidized various biomass substrates ranging from water&#8208;soluble glycerol to insoluble cellulose.







Abstract
Biomass photoreforming is a promising method to provide both a clean energy resource in the form of hydrogen (H2) and valuable chemicals as the results of water reduction and biomass oxidation. To overcome the poor contact between heterogeneous photocatalysts and biomass substrates, we fabricated a new photoredox cascade catalyst by combining a homogeneous catalyst, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO), and a heterogeneous dual&#8208;dye sensitized photocatalyst (DDSP) composed of two Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridine photosensitizers (RuP6 and RuCP6) and Pt&#8208;loaded TiO2 nanoparticles. During blue&#8208;light irradiation (&#955;=460&#177;15&#8197;nm; 80&#8197;mW), the DDSP photocatalytically reduced aqueous protons to form H2 and simultaneously oxidized TEMPO&#8226; radicals to generate catalytically active TEMPO+. It oxidized biomass substrates (water&#8208;soluble glycerol and insoluble cellulose) to regenerate TEMPO&#8226;. In the presence of N&#8208;methyl imidazole as a proton transfer mediator, the photocatalytic H2 production activities for glycerol and cellulose reforming reached 2670 and 1590&#8197;&#956;mol H2 (gTiO2)&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively, which were comparable to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art heterogeneous photocatalysts.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of P&#8208;Stereogenic Phosphanyl Hydrazine Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first asymmetric synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphanyl hydrazines via nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of primary phosphines to azo compounds. We anticipate that the remarkable versatility of these P&#8208;stereogenic secondary aminophosphines will facilitate the facile synthesis of both previously known and novel P&#8208;stereogenic compounds.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric methods for the synthesis of synthetically versatile P&#8208;stereogenic building blocks offer an efficient and practical approach for the diversity&#8208;oriented preparation of P&#8208;chiral phosphorus compounds. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic secondary aminophosphine&#8208;boranes by the asymmetric addition of primary phosphines to azo compounds. We further demonstrate that the P&#8722;H and P&#8722;N bonds on these phosphanyl hydrazine building blocks can be reacted sequentially and stereospecifically to access various P&#8208;stereogenic compounds with structural diversity.

We anticipate that the remarkable versatility of these P-stereogenic secondary aminophosphines will facilitate the facile synthesis of both previously known and novel P-stereogenic compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic asymmetric methods for the synthesis of synthetically versatile P-stereogenic building blocks offer an efficient and practical approach for the diversity-oriented preparation of P-chiral phosphorus compounds. Herein, we report the first nickel-catalyzed synthesis of P-stereogenic secondary aminophosphine-boranes by the asymmetric addition of primary phosphines to azo compounds. We further demonstrate that the P&#8722;H and P&#8722;N bonds on these phosphanyl hydrazine building blocks can be reacted sequentially and stereospecifically to access various P-stereogenic compounds with structural diversity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Distribution&#8208;Directed Regioselective Substitution Strategy for Highly Stable Olympicenyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;distribution&#8208;directed protection&#8211;oxidation&#8211;protection (P&#8722;O&#8722;P) strategy was developed for olympicenyl radical, which resulted in a series of highly stable &#960;&#8208;radicals. The substitution on the periphery exerted a substantial influence on the crystal packing, leading to the first stable field&#8208;effect transistor based on graphenic radicals.







Abstract
The synthesis of bench&#8208;stable conjugated &#960;&#8208;radicals is challenging owing to the lack of modular approaches, which greatly hampers their practical material screens and applications. Here, we demonstrate a spin&#8208;distribution&#8208;directed regioselective substitution strategy to introduce substituents into the specific positions of an olympicenyl radical in a stepwise manner, resulting in a series of highly stable radical species. The substituents can also adjust the crystal packing by means of steric and electronic factors, enabling the changing from a &#960;&#8208;dimer to a pseudo&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional chain. The first single crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor device based on a graphenic radical is fabricated in air, showing a hole mobility of up to 0.021&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and excellent device stability. This approach may be generalized to diverse spin&#8208;delocalized open&#8208;shell organic radicals.

         <title>Infinite Twisted Polycatenanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 46, November 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise approach was developed to construct figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight polycatenanes using preorganized double helicates as templates and crosslinking them with silver ions or ethynylene units. Employing Ag(I) ions or ethynylene units as linkers resulted in single&#8208;crystalline 1D coordination poly[n]catenanes and assembling gel fibers, respectively.







Abstract
Poly[n]catenanes have exceptional mechanical bonding properties that give them tremendous potential for use in the development of molecular machines and soft materials. Synthesizing these compounds has, however, proven to be a formidable challenge. Herein, we describe a concise method for the construction of twisted polycatenanes. Our approach involves using preorganized double helicates as templates, linked crosswise in a linear fashion by either silver ions or triple bonds. By using this approach, we successfully synthesized twisted polycatenanes with both coordination and covalent bonding employing Ag(I) ions and ethynylene units, respectively, as the linkages and leveraging the same Ag(I)&#8208;templated double helicate in both cases. Synthesis with Ag(I) ions formed a single&#8208;crystalline one&#8208;dimensional (1D) coordination poly[n]catenane, and synthesis using ethynylene units generated 1D fibers which self&#8208;assembled with solvents to form a gel. Our results confirm the potential of multi&#8208;stranded metallohelicates for creating sophisticated mechanically interlocked molecules and polymers, which could pave the way for exploration in the realms of molecular nanotopology and materials design.

         <title>Scalable Total Synthesis of Acremolactone B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acremolactone B is a pyridine&#8208;containing azaphilone&#8208;type polyketide with herbicidal activity. We developed an aza&#8208;6&#960; electrocyclization&#8722;aromatization strategy to construct the tetrasubstituted pyridine ring and achieved the first total synthesis of this molecule on a gram scale. A bicyclic intermediate was expeditiously prepared by using [2 + 2] photocycloaddition and chemoselective Baeyer&#8722;Villiger oxidation, which was further elaborated to a densely substituted aza&#8208;triene. An electrocyclization&#8722;aromatization cascade was exploited to forge the tetracyclic core of the natural product, and the side chain was introduced through diastereoselective acylation and reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking a Dual&#8208;channel Pathway in CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol over Single&#8208;site Zirconium on Amorphous Silica</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting CO2 into methanol on a large scale is of great significance in the sustainable methanol economy. Zirconia are considered to be an essential support in Cu&#8208;based catalysts due to its excellent properties on CO2 adsorption and activation. However, the evolution of Zr species during the reaction and the effect of their structure on the reaction pathways remain unclear. Herein, single&#8208;site Zr species in amorphous SiO2 matrix are created by enhancing Zr&#8208;Si interaction in Cu/ZrO2&#8208;SiO2 catalysts. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that the coordination environment of single&#8208;site Zr is sensitive to the atmosphere and reaction conditions. We demonstrate that the CO2 adsorption prefers on the interface of Cu and single&#8208;site Zr rather than ZrO2 nanoparticles. Methanol synthesis in reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (RWGS)+CO&#8208;hydro pathway is verified only over single&#8208;dispersed Zr site, while ordinary formate pathway occurs on ZrO2 nanoparticles. Thus, it expands a non&#8208;competitive parallel pathway as a supplement to the dominant formate pathway, resulting in the enhancement of Cu activity sixfold and twofold based on Cu/SiO2 and Cu/ZrO2 catalysts, respectively. The establishment of this dual&#8208;channel pathway by single&#8208;site Zr species in this work open new horizons for understanding atomically dispersed oxides in catalysis science.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu3BiS3:  Two&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Induces Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Phonon Scattering Enabling Ultralow Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of compounds with low thermal conductivity and the understanding of their microscopic mechanisms are of great challenges and scientific significance. Herein, we report a unique ternary sulfide compound, Cu3BiS3, in which all Cu atoms are coordinated within a two&#8208;dimensional [CuS3] triangle plane. This local coordination leads to efficient out&#8208;of&#8208;plane phonon scattering and an ultralow thermal conductivity. Through DFT phonon spectrum calculations and analyses, we reveal that the lowest vibration frequency decreases from 2 THz for high&#8208;dimensional [CuS4] tetrahedral coordinated Cu atoms in CuBiS2 (CN = 4, with an average Cu&#8211;S bond distance of 2.328 &#197;) to 1.5 THz for low&#8208;dimensional [CuS3] triangular coordinated Cu atoms in Cu3BiS3 (CN = 3, with a shorter Cu&#8211;S bond distance of 2.285 &#197;). This is due to the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane thermal vibration of the Cu atoms in the latter. Consequently,Cu3BiS3 exhibits one of the lowest values of &#954;lat (0.32 W/m K) among its peer, with a 36% reduction compared to CuBiS2 (0.50 W/m K). This groundbreaking discovery highlights the significant role of 2D local coordination in reducing thermal conductivity through characteristic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane phonon scattering, while also contributing to a large Gr&#252;neisen parameter (2.06) in Cu3BiS3.</dc:description>

         <title>Locally Ordered Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts manifest nearly 100% atom utilization efficiency, well&#8208;defined active sites, and high selectivity. However, their practical applications are hindered by a low atom loading density, uncontrollable location, and ambiguous interaction with the support, thereby posing challenges to maximizing their electrocatalytic performance. To address these limitations, the ability to arrange randomly dispersed single atoms into locally ordered single&#8208;atom catalysts (LO&#8208;SACs) substantially influences the electronic effect between reactive sites and the support, the synergistic interaction among neighboring single atoms, the bonding energy of intermediates with reactive sites and the complexity of the mechanism. As such, it dramatically promotes reaction kinetics, reduces the energy barrier of the reaction, improves the performance of the catalyst and simplifies the reaction mechanism.  In this review, firstly, we introduce a variety of compelling characteristics of LO&#8208;SACs as electrocatalysts. Subsequently, the synthetic strategies, characterization methods and applications of LO&#8208;SACs in electrocatalysis are discussed. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges are elaborated to encourage further exploration in this rapidly evolving field.</dc:description>

         <title>Aryne&#8208;Enabled C&#8722;N Arylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal&#8208;free C&#8722;N arylation of easily accessible tertiary anilines enabled by bifunctional arynes is described. The reaction proceeds via a tandem nucleophilic attack of anilines to arynes, followed by a Smiles&#8208;Truce rearrangement to furnish synthetically valuable and densely substituted biaryls. This protocol was further utilized for heterocyclic scaffolds, providing access to medium size azaheterocycles via n+2 carbon insertion.







Abstract
Anilines are potentially high&#8208;value arylating agents, but are limited by the low reactivity of the strong C&#8722;N bond. We show that the reactive intermediate benzyne can be used to both activate anilines, and set&#8208;up an aryl transfer reaction in a single step. The reaction does not require any transition metal catalysts or stoichiometric organometallics, and establishes a metal&#8208;free route to valuable biaryl products by functionalizing the aniline C&#8722;N bond.

         <title>Effects of Iron Species on Low Temperature CO2 Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;species will likely be present in large&#8208;scale systems, e.g. from steel components or contaminated electrolytes, so their role in low temperature CO2 electrolyzers must be understood. While they reportedly accelerate degradation of the polymer membrane and the CO2 reduction catalyst, they also enhance the oxygen evolution activity of catalysts. We use this duplicity to stress the need for holistic research of complex electrochemical systems.







Abstract
Electrochemical energy conversion devices are considered key in reducing CO2 emissions and significant efforts are being applied to accelerate device development. Unlike other technologies, low temperature electrolyzers have the ability to directly convert CO2 into a range of value&#8208;added chemicals. To make them commercially viable, however, device efficiency and durability must be increased. Although their design is similar to more mature water electrolyzers and fuel cells, new cell concepts and components are needed. Due to the complexity of the system, singular component optimization is common. As a result, the component interplay is often overlooked. The influence of Fe&#8208;species clearly shows that the cell must be considered holistically during optimization, to avoid future issues due to component interference or cross&#8208;contamination. Fe&#8208;impurities are ubiquitous, and their influence on single components is well&#8208;researched. The activity of non&#8208;noble anodes has been increased through the deliberate addition of iron. At the same time, however, Fe&#8208;species accelerate cathode and membrane degradation. Here, we interpret literature on single components to gain an understanding of how Fe&#8208;species influence low temperature CO2 electrolyzers holistically. The role of Fe&#8208;species serves to highlight the need for considerations regarding component interplay in general.

         <title>Constructing Intrapenetrated Hierarchical Zeolites with Highly Complete Framework via Protozeolite Seeding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;crystalline intrapenetrated hierarchical zeolite with highly complete framework was synthesized via protozeolite seeding. The protozeolite provided abundant nucleation sites for surrounding precursors to be crystallized, followed by oriented coalescence of crystallites resulting in the formation of intrapenetrated mesopores. The as&#8208;prepared zeolite presented excellent performance in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene reaction.







Abstract
Creation of intrapenetrated mesopores with open highway from external surface into the interior of zeolite crystals are highly desirable that can significantly improve the molecular transport and active sites accessibility of microporous zeolites to afford enhanced catalytic properties. Here, different from traditional zeolite&#8208;seeded methods that generally produced isolated mesopores in zeolites, nanosized amorphous protozeolites with embryo structure of zeolites were used as seeds for the construction of single&#8208;crystalline hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites with intrapenetrated mesopores (mesopore volume of 0.51&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and highly complete framework. In this strategy, in contrast to the conventional synthesis, only a small amount of organic structure directing agents and a low crystallization temperature were adopted to promise the protozeolites as the dominant growth directing sites to induce crystallization. The protozeolite nanoseeds provided abundant nucleation sites for surrounding precursors to be crystallized, followed by oriented coalescence of crystallites resulting in the formation of intrapenetrated mesopores. The as&#8208;prepared hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibited ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 443.9&#8197;hours and a high propylene selectivity of 47.92&#8201;% at a WHSV of 2&#8197;h&#8722;1 in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene reaction. This work provides a facile protozeolite&#8208;seeded strategy for the synthesis of intrapenetrated hierarchical zeolites that are highly effective for catalytic applications.

&lt;p&gt;Creation of intrapenetrated mesopores with open highway from external surface into the interior of zeolite crystals are highly desirable that can significantly improve the molecular transport and active sites accessibility of microporous zeolites to afford enhanced catalytic properties. Here, different from traditional zeolite-seeded methods that generally produced isolated mesopores in zeolites, nanosized amorphous protozeolites with embryo structure of zeolites were used as seeds for the construction of single-crystalline hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites with intrapenetrated mesopores (mesopore volume of 0.51&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and highly complete framework. In this strategy, in contrast to the conventional synthesis, only a small amount of organic structure directing agents and a low crystallization temperature were adopted to promise the protozeolites as the dominant growth directing sites to induce crystallization. The protozeolite nanoseeds provided abundant nucleation sites for surrounding precursors to be crystallized, followed by oriented coalescence of crystallites resulting in the formation of intrapenetrated mesopores. The as-prepared hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites exhibited ultra-long lifetime of 443.9&#8197;hours and a high propylene selectivity of 47.92&#8201;% at a WHSV of 2&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the methanol-to-propylene reaction. This work provides a facile protozeolite-seeded strategy for the synthesis of intrapenetrated hierarchical zeolites that are highly effective for catalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Biocatalytic group transfer reactions can efficiently generate highly complex molecules under mild and environmentally friendly conditions. This Minireview highlights inspiring examples of the development of non&#8208;natural donor reagents to power such enzymatic transformations, while discussing the design aspects behind the choice of reagent.







Abstract
iocatalysis has become a major driver in the innovation of preparative chemistry. Enzyme discovery, engineering and computational design have matured to reliable strategies in the development of biocatalytic processes. By comparison, substrate engineering has received much less attention. In this Minireview, we highlight the idea that the design of synthetic reagents may be an equally fruitful and complementary approach to develop novel enzyme&#8208;catalysed group transfer chemistry. This Minireview discusses key examples from the literature that illustrate how synthetic substrates can be devised to improve the efficiency, scalability and sustainability, as well as the scope of such reactions. We also provide an opinion as to how this concept might be further developed in the future, aspiring to replicate the evolutionary success story of natural group transfer reagents, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM).

         <dc:description>
Two exotic 6&#8208;cantilever small molecular platforms, characteristic of quite different molecular configurations of propeller and quasi&#8208;plane, are established by extremely two&#8208;dimensional conjugated extension on different elementary units (triptycene vs. triphenylene), demonstrating two pioneered yet highly promising molecular innovation platforms for organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Two exotic 6&#8208;cantilever small molecular platforms, characteristic of quite different molecular configurations of propeller and quasi&#8208;plane, are established by extremely two&#8208;dimensional conjugated extension. When applied in small molecular acceptors, the only two cases of CH25 and CH26 that could contain six terminals and such broad conjugated backbones have been afforded thus far, rendering featured absorptions, small reorganization and exciton binding energies. Moreover, their distinctive but completely different molecular geometries result in sharply contrasting nanoscale film morphologies. Finally, CH26 contributes to the best device efficiency of 15.41&#8201;% among acceptors with six terminals, demonstrating two pioneered yet highly promising 6&#8208;cantilever molecular innovation platforms.

         <title>Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Versatile Fluorescent and Chemiluminescent Dyes Based on the Dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran Scaffold: From Design to Imaging and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the molecular design strategies, recognition mechanisms, and both in vitro and in vivo bio&#8208;applications (especially for diagnosis and therapy of tumors) of activatable dyes based on the dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran (DCM) scaffold.







Abstract
Activatable fluorescent and chemiluminescent dyes with near&#8208;infrared emission have indispensable roles in the fields of bioimaging, molecular prodrugs, and phototheranostic agents. As one of the most popular fluorophore scaffolds, the dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran scaffold has been applied to fabricate a large number of versatile activatable optical dyes for analytes detection and diseases diagnosis and treatment by virtue of its high photostability, large Stokes shift, considerable two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section, and structural modifiability. This review discusses the molecular design strategies, recognition mechanisms, and both in vitro and in vivo bio&#8208;applications (especially for diagnosis and therapy of tumors) of activatable dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran dyes. The final section describes the current shortcomings and future development prospects of this topic.

         <title>An Extended NIR&#8208;II Superior Imaging Window from 1500 to 1900&#8197;nm for High&#8208;Resolution In Vivo Multiplexed Imaging Based on Lanthanide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a series of novel lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles in the whole near&#8208;infrared region (NIR) beyond 1700&#8197;nm. Inspired by the scattering and water absorption, we then defined the NIR&#8208;II long&#8208;wavelength (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8197;nm&#8211;1900&#8197;nm) window for high&#8208;resolution multiplexed imaging of lymph, blood vessels and intestines.







Abstract
High&#8208;resolution in vivo optical multiplexing in second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) is vital to biomedical research. Presently, limited by bio&#8208;tissue scattering, only luminescent probes located at NIR&#8208;IIb (1500&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) window can provide high&#8208;resolution in vivo multiplexed imaging. However, the number of available luminescent probes in this narrow NIR&#8208;IIb region is limited, which hampers the available multiplexed channels of in vivo imaging. To overcome the above challenges, through theoretical simulation we expanded the conventional NIR&#8208;IIb window to NIR&#8208;II long&#8208;wavelength (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8211;1900&#8197;nm) window on the basis of photon&#8208;scattering and water&#8208;absorption. We developed a series of novel lanthanide luminescent nanoprobes with emission wavelengths from 1852&#8197;nm to 2842&#8197;nm. NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L nanoprobes enabled high&#8208;resolution in vivo dynamic multiplexed imaging on blood vessels and intestines, and provided multi&#8208;channels imaging on lymph tubes, tumors and intestines. The proposed NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L probes without mutual interference are powerful tools for high&#8208;contrast in vivo multiplexed detection, which holds promise for revealing physiological process in living body.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Cyanoacetates Enabled by Chiral Amide Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;(heteroaryl)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl cyanoacetates was achieved by Cu&#8208;catalyzed arylation of &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted cyanoacetates under the assistance of two types chiral ligands, (S)&#8208;nobin&#8208;embodied picolinamides and L&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8208;derived amides. The reaction afforded the coupling products bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center tethered with convertible functional groups in good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The (S)&#8208;nobin&#8208;embodied picolinamide and L&#8208;hydroxyproline&#8208;derived amide are effective ligands for Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective coupling reaction of (hetero)aryl iodides with &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted cyanoacetates. This arylation reaction gave &#945;&#8208;(heteroaryl)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl cyanoacetates in good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% ee). A variety of functionalized (hetero)aryl and alkyl groups could be introduced to the quaternary center and therefore provided a valuable tool for preparing enantioenriched compounds with an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center tethered with convertible functional groups. The size of both &#945;&#8208;alkyl and ester groups was proven as the key factor for asymmetric induction.

This arylation reaction gave &#945;-(heteroaryl)-&#945;-alkyl cyanoacetates in good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 95&#8201;% ee). A variety of functionalized (hetero)aryl and alkyl groups could be introduced to the quaternary center and therefore provided a valuable tool for preparing enantioenriched compounds with an all-carbon quaternary center tethered with convertible functional groups. The size of both &#945;-alkyl and ester groups was proven as the key factor for asymmetric induction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Copper by Reactive Ionic Liquid and Native Hydrogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic exchange of the hydrogen between the CO2 absorbed cation and the anion of a functional ionic liquid modulates the electroreduction of CO2 over copper as examined by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. The microenvironment created by the ionic liquid enables conversion products beyond CO with reduced potential requirements, increased current, and product selectivity.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) on copper (Cu) shows promise for higher&#8208;value products beyond CO. However, challenges such as the limited CO2 solubility, high overpotentials, and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolytes hinder the practical realization. We propose a functionalized ionic liquid (IL) which generates ion&#8208;CO2 adducts and a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) upon CO2 absorption to modulate CO2RR on Cu in a non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte. As revealed by transient voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and in situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) complemented with image charge augmented quantum&#8208;mechanical/molecular mechanics (IC&#8208;QM/MM) computations, a unique microenvironment is constructed. In this microenvironment, the catalytic activity is primarily governed by the IL and HBD concentrations; former controlling the double layer thickness and the latter modulating the local proton availability. This translates to ample CO2 availability, reduced overpotential, and suppressed HER where C4 products are obtained. This study deepens the understanding of electrolyte effects in CO2RR and the role of IL ions towards electrocatalytic microenvironment design.

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Bismuth&#8208;Catalyzed Transfer Hydrogenation of Azoarenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a combined experimental and computational study of the bismuth&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes. With the protocol using p&#8208;trifluoromethylphenol and pinacolborane, we identified the role of protic and hydridic hydrogens through kinetic analysis and reactivity studies. The possibility of Bi&#8208;ligand cooperativity was assessed through isotope labeling experiments. This work validates the notion of Bi(I)/Bi(III) redox cycling.







Abstract
Organobismuth&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation has recently been disclosed as an example of low&#8208;valent Bi redox catalysis. However, its mechanistic details have remained speculative. Herein, we report experimental and computational studies that provide mechanistic insights into a Bi&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes using p&#8208;trifluoromethylphenol (4) and pinacolborane (5) as hydrogen sources. A kinetic analysis elucidated the rate orders in all components in the catalytic reaction and determined that 1&#8201;a (2,6&#8208;bis[N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)iminomethyl]phenylbismuth) is the resting state. In the transfer hydrogenation of azobenzene using 1&#8201;a and 4, an equilibrium between 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;a&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[OAr]2 (Ar=p&#8208;CF3&#8722;C6H4) is observed, and its thermodynamic parameters are established through variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies. Additionally, pKa&#8208;gated reactivity is observed, validating the proton&#8208;coupled nature of the transformation. The ensuing 1&#8201;a&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[OAr]2 is crystallographically characterized, and shown to be rapidly reduced to 1&#8201;a in the presence of 5. DFT calculations indicate a rate&#8208;limiting transition state in which the initial N&#8722;H bond is formed via concerted proton transfer upon nucleophilic addition of 1&#8201;a to a hydrogen&#8208;bonded adduct of azobenzene and 4. These studies guided the discovery of a second&#8208;generation Bi catalyst, the rate&#8208;limiting transition state of which is lower in energy, leading to catalytic transfer hydrogenation at lower catalyst loadings and at cryogenic temperature.

         <title>Synthetic High&#8208;Density Lipoprotein&#8208;Based Nanomedicine to Silence SOCS1 in Tumor Microenvironment and Trigger Antitumor Immunity against Glioma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanomedicine was designed to modulate the tumor microenvironment (TME) against glioma (GBM). Upon intravenous injection, the nanomedicine penetrated the blood&#8211;brain barrier and accumulated within the TME of GBM&#8208;bearing mice, which subsequently abolished the negative feedback regulation function of SOCS1 on dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation, elicited strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, and inhibited tumor growth.







Abstract
Immunotherapies have shed light on the treatment of many cancers, but have not improved the outcomes of glioma (GBM). Here, we demonstrated that suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) was associated with the GBM&#8208;associated immunosuppression and developed a multifunctional nanomedicine, which silenced SOCS1 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of GBM and triggered strong antitumor immunity against GBM. Synthetic high&#8208;density lipoprotein (sHDL) was selected as the nanocarrier and a peptide was used to facilitate the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) penetration. The nanocarrier was loaded with a small interfering RNA (siRNA), a peptide, and an adjuvant to trigger antitumor immunity. The nanomedicine concentrated on the TME in vivo, further promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation, triggering strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, and inhibiting tumor growth. Our work provides an alternative strategy to simultaneously target and modulate the TME in GBM patients and points to an avenue for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapeutics.

         <title>Chiral Auxiliary Approach for Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereoselective gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of 1,5&#8208;enynes and alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes with chiral auxiliaries has been developed, affording, after hydrolysis, synthetically challenging enantioenriched ketones. This chiral auxiliary approach is an alternative to the use of complex chiral catalysts in gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclizations.







Abstract
Two different classes of stereoselective cyclizations have been developed using a chiral auxiliary approach with commercially available [JohnPhosAu(MeCN)SbF6] as catalyst. First, a stereoselective cascade cyclization of 1,5&#8208;enynes was achieved using the Oppolzer camphorsultam as chiral auxiliary. In this case, a one&#8208;pot cyclization&#8208;hydrolysis sequence was developed to directly afford enantioenriched spirocyclic ketones. Then, the stereoselective alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes was mediated by an Evans&#8208;type oxazolidinone. A reduction&#8208;hydrolysis sequence was selected to remove the auxiliary to give enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;tetralones. DFT studies confirmed that the steric clash between the chiral auxiliary and alkene accounts for the experimentally observed diastereoselective cyclization through the Si face.

         <title>Optimized Crystal Framework by Asymmetric Core Isomerization in Selenium&#8208;Substituted Acceptor for Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic strategies of the regional selenium isomerization and asymmetric crystal engineering are applied to synthesize isomeric small molecular acceptors. Benefiting from optimized crystal packing, favourable morphology and ordered molecular arrangement, A&#8208;OSeF&#8208;based binary organic solar cells yield a champion efficiency of 18.5&#8201;% and low energy loss among selenium&#8208;containing acceptors.







Abstract
Both the regional isomerization and selenium&#8208;substitution of the small molecular acceptors (SMAs) play significant roles in developing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs), while their synergistic effects remain elusive. Herein, we developed three isomeric SMAs (S&#8208;CSeF, A&#8208;ISeF, and A&#8208;OSeF) via subtly manipulating the mono&#8208;selenium substituted position (central, inner, or outer) and type of heteroaromatic ring on the central core by synergistic strategies for efficient OSCs, respectively. Crystallography of asymmetric A&#8208;OSeF presents a closer intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and more ordered 3&#8208;dimensional network packing and efficient charge&#8208;hopping pathways. With the successive out&#8208;shift of the mono&#8208;selenium substituted position, the neat films give a slightly wider band gap and gradually higher crystallinity and electron mobility. The PM1&#8201;:&#8201;A&#8208;OSeF afford favourable fibrous phase separation morphology with more ordered molecular packing and efficient charge transportation compared to the other two counterparts. Consequently, the A&#8208;OSeF&#8208;based devices achieve a champion efficiency of 18.5&#8201;%, which represents the record value for the reported selenium&#8208;containing SMAs in binary OSCs. Our developed precise molecular engineering of the position and type of selenium&#8208;based heteroaromatic ring of SMAs provides a promising synergistic approach to optimizing crystal stacking and boosting top&#8208;ranked selenium&#8208;containing SMAs&#8208;based OSCs.

Benefiting from optimized crystal packing, favourable morphology and ordered molecular arrangement, A-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;SeF-based binary organic solar cells yield a champion efficiency of 18.5&#8201;% and low energy loss among selenium-containing acceptors.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Enantioselective Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Radical&#8208;Radical Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective radical&#8208;radical coupling using combined photoredox/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis was developed. The coupling of a ketyl radical and an sp3&#8208;carbon radical allows access to &#945;&#8208;chiral ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields and enantioselectivities. Computational investigations reveal the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene controls the double&#8208;facial selectivity of the ketyl radical and the alkyl radicals, respectively.







Abstract
An enantioselective carbene&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;radical coupling of acyl imidazoles and racemic Hantzsch esters is disclosed. This method involves the coupling of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;derived ketyl radical and a secondary sp3&#8208;carbon radical and allows access to chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl aliphatic ketones in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields and enantioselectivities without any competitive epimerization. The utility of this protocol is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various pharmaceutical compounds and is further demonstrated by the transformation of the enantioenriched products to biologically relevant molecules. Computational investigations reveal the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene controls the double&#8208;facial selectivity of the ketyl radical and the alkyl radicals, respectively.

         <title>A Journey from Benzoborirene to Benzoborole&#8208;Supported 1,2&#8208;Diimine and Antiaromatic Borolediide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regioselective double insertion of isocyanide into benzoborirene affords 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2,3&#8208;diiminoboroles, which represent a novel type of redox active 1,2&#8208;diimine with a benzoborole backbone. The singly and doubly reduced species have been fully characterized, demonstrating antiaromaticity of the borolediide. Detailed quantum chemical calculations provide a rationale for the observed regioselectivity.







Abstract
The reaction of benzoborirene with one equivalent of isocyanides leads to benzene&#8208;fused boretes bearing one imine function, while the reaction with two equivalents of isocyanide affords 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2,3&#8208;diiminoboroles with perfect regioselectivity. The isocyanide double insertion products represent a novel type of 1,2&#8208;diimine with a benzoborole backbone. The reduction chemistry of the benzoborole&#8208;supported 1,2&#8208;diimine was investigated. Single&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduction allow for the isolation and full characterization of a radical anion and a dianion, respectively. In stark contrast to the ordinary boroles, which should turn aromatic by accepting two electrons, the antiaromatic character of the benzoborole backbone is highlighted upon reduction, thus presenting a rare example of antiaromatic borole dianion. Detailed quantum chemical calculations provide a rationale for the observed regioselectivity and the electronic structure of the reduced borole diimine species.

         <title>Clustering Six Electrons within &#8220;Dawson&#8208;Like&#8221; Polyoxometalate: An Open Route toward Its Post&#8208;functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The super&#8208;reduction of Dawson&#8208;like polyoxometalate (POM) [H2AsW18O60]7&#8722; in water involves a disproportionation process generating POM with a metal&#8208;metal bonded triad as evidenced by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and multi&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance investigations. Then, the resulting six&#8208;electron reduced POM was used as a precursor to construct the largest POM containing W4+ reported to date.







Abstract
Super&#8208;reduction of polyoxometalates (POMs) in solution is of fundamental interest for designing innovative energy storage systems. In this article, we show that the &#8220;Dawson&#8208;like&#8221; POM can undergo a disproportionation process during its massive electron uptake, leading to species containing three metal&#8208;metal bonds as evidenced by X&#8208;ray diffraction, multi&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H and 183W NMR), extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), UV/Vis, and voltammetry techniques. This result indicates that electron storing within metal&#8208;metal bonds is not a unique property of Keggin&#8208;type POM as postulated since the 70s. Besides, we demonstrate that the presence of an electron&#8208;rich triad in the &#8220;Dawson&#8208;like&#8221; POM allows its post&#8208;functionalization with additional tungstate ions, generating a chiral molecule that is also the largest WIV&#8208;containing POMs known to date.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CH4 and H2O2 under Non&#8208;sacrificial Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free photocatalyst achieves high electronic selectivity for CH4 and facile separation of H2O2 in non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions with only CO2 and H2O. This exceptional performance is attributed to a long&#8208;lived oxygen&#8208;centered radical in the excited electron acceptor, promoting the formation of a stabilized five&#8208;member&#8208;ring cyclic intermediate with lower energy, leading to an 90&#8201;% selectivity for the eight&#8208;electron product CH4.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 requires photosensitizers and sacrificial agents to provide sufficient electrons and protons through metal&#8208;based photocatalysts, and the separation of CH4 from by&#8208;product O2 has poor applications. Herein, we successfully synthesize a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst of a novel electron&#8208;acceptor 4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrenetetrone (PT), to our best knowledge, this is the first time that metal&#8208;free catalyst achieves non&#8208;sacrificial photocatalytic CO2 to CH4 and easily separable H2O2. This photocatalyst offers CH4 product of 10.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions (room temperature, and only water), which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the reported metal&#8208;free photocatalysts. Comprehensive in situ characterizations and calculations reveal a multi&#8208;step reaction mechanism, in which the long&#8208;lived oxygen&#8208;centered radical in the excited PT provides as a site for CO2 activation, resulting in a stabilized cyclic carbonate intermediate with a lower formation energy. This key intermediate is thermodynamically crucial for the subsequent reduction to CH4 product with the electronic selectivity of up to 90&#8201;%. The work provides fresh insights on the economic viability of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to easily separable CH4 in non&#8208;sacrificial and metal&#8208;free conditions.

Comprehensive in situ characterizations and calculations reveal a multi-step reaction mechanism, in which the long-lived oxygen-centered radical in the excited PT provides as a site for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation, resulting in a stabilized cyclic carbonate intermediate with a lower formation energy. This key intermediate is thermodynamically crucial for the subsequent reduction to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; product with the electronic selectivity of up to 90&#8201;%. The work provides fresh insights on the economic viability of photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to easily separable CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in non-sacrificial and metal-free conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Syngas Conversion Enabled by Bimetallic Gold/Zinc Sites in Partially Reductived Gold/Zinc Oxide Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For AuZn/ZnO nanoarrays, a bimetallic synergistic effect reduces the activation energy barrier of CO2 molecules and accelerates electron transfer. The dual metal active sites effectively electrocatalyze CO2 and H2O conversion to syngas with a tunable syngas CO/H2 ratios from 0.25 to 2.50.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas (gaseous mixture of CO and H2) is a promising way to curb excessive CO2 emission and the greenhouse gas effect. Herein, we present a bimetallic AuZn@ZnO (AuZn/ZnO) catalyst with high efficiency and durability for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and H2O, which enables a high Faradaic efficiency of 66.4&#8201;% for CO and 26.5&#8201;% for H2 and 3&#8197;h stability of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The CO/H2 ratios show a wide range from 0.25 to 2.50 over a narrow potential window (&#8722;0.7&#8197;V to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. RHE). In situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations reveals that the bimetallic synergistic effect between Au and Zn sites lowers the activation energy barrier of CO2 molecules and facilitates electronic transfer, further highlighting the potential to control CO/H2 ratios for efficient syngas production using the coexisting Au sites and Zn sites.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Assembly Meets Anion Coordination Chemistry: Framework Shaping and Polarity Tuning for Xenon/Krypton Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The marriage between hydrogen bonding and the coordination chemistry of halide anions offers a promising strategy to construct crystalline microporous frameworks with adaptive cavities and fine&#8208;tunable surface polarity for efficient Xe/Kr separation. The activated frameworks show preferential binding towards Xe because of the enhanced polarizability and the pore confinement effect.







Abstract
Hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) frameworks built from charged components or metallotectons offer diverse guest&#8208;framework interactions for target&#8208;specific separations. We present here a study to systematically explore the coordination chemistry of monovalent halide anions, i.e., F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, and I&#8722;, with the aim to develop hybrid H&#8208;bond synthons that enable the controllable construction of microporous H&#8208;bonded frameworks exhibiting fine&#8208;tunable surface polarity within the adaptive cavities for realistic xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation. The spherical halide anions, especially Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, and I&#8722;, are found to readily participate in the charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonding assembly with well&#8208;defined coordination behaviors, resulting in robust frameworks bearing open halide anions within the distinctive 1D pore channels. The activated frameworks show preferential binding towards Xe (IAST Xe/Kr selectivity ca. 10.5) because of the enhanced polarizability and the pore confinement effect. Specifically, dynamic column Xe/Kr separation with a record&#8208;high separation factor (SF=7.0) among H&#8208;bonded frameworks was achieved, facilitating an efficient Xe/Kr separation in dilute, CO2&#8208;containing gas streams exactly mimicking the off&#8208;gas of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) reprocessing.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis of Imidazole&#8208;Linked Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust imidazole&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D covalent organic framework was synthesized via the one&#8208;pot Debus&#8208;Radziszewski multicomponent reaction. The material showed excellent two electron oxygen&#8208;reduction activity and when it was used as cathode catalyst and assembled into the electrolyzer, the devices showed high electrochemical production rate of H2O2 up to 326.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The semiconducting properties and applications of three dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are greatly hampered because of their long&#8208;ranged non&#8208;conjugated skeletons and relatively unstable linkages. Here, a robust imidazole&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D covalent organic framework (BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7) is synthesized through the one&#8208;pot multicomponent Debus&#8208;Radziszewski reaction of the saddle&#8208;shaped aldehyde&#8208;substituted cyclooctatetrathiophene, pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone, and ammonium acetate. The semiconducting BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7, as a metal&#8208;free catalyst, shows excellent two electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in alkaline medium with high hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) selectivity of 83.4&#8201;%. When the BUCT&#8208;COF&#8208;7 as cathode catalyst is assembled into the electrolyzer, the devices showed high electrochemical production rate of H2O2 up to 326.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. The accumulative amount of H2O2 could totally degrade the dye methylene blue via Fenton reaction for wastewater treatment. This is the first report about intrinsic 3D COFs for efficient electrochemical synthesis of H2O2, revealing the promising applications of fully conjugated 3D COFs in the environment&#8208;related field.

         <title>Modulating Coordination of Iron Atom Clusters on N,P,S Triply&#8208;Doped Hollow Carbon Support towards Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general diffusion&#8208;controlled strategy is proposed to synthesize metal atom&#8208;clusters with engineered coordination in N,P,S triply&#8208;doped hollow carbon. The optimum FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC shows remarkably enhanced catalytic activity for oxygen reduction, compared with the benchmark analogue of N&#8208;coordinated iron single&#8208;atoms in N&#8208;doped carbon (FeSAs/N&#8722;C), which presents a paradigm for the regulation and optimization of atomically dispersed catalysts.







Abstract
Constructing atom&#8208;clusters (ACs) with in situ modulation of coordination environment and simultaneously hollowing carbon support are critical yet challenging for improving electrocatalytic efficiency of atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs). Herein, a general diffusion&#8208;controlled strategy based on spatial confining and Kirkendall effect is proposed to construct metallic ACs in N,P,S triply&#8208;doped hollow carbon matrix (MACs/NPS&#8722;HC, M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu). Thereinto, FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC with the best catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is thoroughly investigated. Unlike the benchmark sample of symmetrical N&#8208;surrounded iron single&#8208;atoms in N&#8208;doped carbon (FeSAs/N&#8722;C), FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC comprises bi&#8208;/tri&#8208;atomic Fe centers with engineered S/N coordination. Theoretical calculation reveals that proper Fe gathering and coordination modulation could mildly delocalize the electron distribution and optimize the free energy pathways of ORR. In addition, the triple doping and hollow structure of carbon matrix could further regulate the local environment and allow sufficient exposure of active sites, resulting in more enhanced ORR kinetics on FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC. The zinc&#8208;air battery assembled with FeACs/NPS&#8722;HC as cathodic catalyst exhibits all&#8208;round superiority to Pt/C and most Fe&#8208;based ADCs. This work provides an exemplary method for establishing atomic&#8208;cluster catalysts with engineered S&#8208;dominated coordination and hollowed carbon matrix, which paves a new avenue for the fabrication and optimization of advanced ADCs.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalently Stapled H+/Cl&#8722; Ion Channels Activatable by Visible Light for Targeted Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully constructed the first example of non&#8208;covalently stapled self&#8208;assembled artificial channels activatable by 442&#8197;nm visible light, enabling the co&#8208;transport of H+/Cl&#8722; across the membrane with H+/Cl&#8722; transport selectivity of 6.0. Upon photoirradiation of the caged C4F&#8208;L for 10&#8197;min, 90&#8201;% of ion transport efficiency can be restored, giving rise to a 10.5&#8208;fold enhancement in cytotoxicity against human colorectal cancer cells.







Abstract
The development of stimuli&#8208;responsive artificial H+/Cl&#8722; ion channels, capable of specifically disturbing the intracellular ion homeostasis of cancer cells, presents an intriguing opportunity for achieving high selectivity in cancer therapy. Herein, we describe a novel family of non&#8208;covalently stapled self&#8208;assembled artificial channels activatable by biocompatible visible light at 442&#8197;nm, which enables the co&#8208;transport of H+/Cl&#8722; across the membrane with H+/Cl&#8722; transport selectivity of 6.0. Upon photoirradiation of the caged C4F&#8208;L for 10&#8197;min, 90&#8201;% of ion transport efficiency can be restored, giving rise to a 10.5&#8208;fold enhancement in cytotoxicity against human colorectal cancer cells (IC50=8.5&#8197;&#956;M). The mechanism underlying cancer cell death mediated by the H+/Cl&#8722; channels involves the activation of the caspase&#8197;9 apoptosis pathway as well as the scarcely reported disruption of the autophagic processes. In the absence of photoirradiation, C4F&#8208;L exhibits minimal toxicity towards normal intestine cells, even at a concentration of 200&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>Artificial Peptide&#8208;Protein Necrosomes Promote Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structural feature of natural necrosome, kinase&#8208;biomimetic D&#8208;retro&#8208;inverso peptides (DRI&#8208;peptides) are designed and able to strongly associate with kinases. This feature of the peptides facilitates formation of artificial peptide&#8208;protein necrosomes and thus selectively activating the necrotic signaling pathway to induce cellular necroptosis.







Abstract
The presence of disordered region or large interacting surface within proteins significantly challenges the development of targeted drugs, commonly known as the &#8220;undruggable&#8221; issue. Here, we report a heterogeneous peptide&#8208;protein assembling strategy to selectively phosphorylate proteins, thereby activating the necroptotic signaling pathway and promoting cell necroptosis. Inspired by the structures of natural necrosomes formed by receptor interacting protein kinases (RIPK) 1 and 3, the kinase&#8208;biomimetic peptides are rationally designed by incorporating natural or D&#8208;amino acids, or connecting D&#8208;amino acids in a retro&#8208;inverso (DRI) manner, leading to one RIPK3&#8208;biomimetic peptide PR3 and three RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides. Individual peptides undergo self&#8208;assembly into nanofibrils, whereas mixing RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides with PR3 accelerates and enhances assembly of PR3. In particular, RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptide DRI&#8208;PR1 exhibits reliable binding affinity with protein RIPK3, resulting in specific cytotoxicity to colon cancer cells that overexpress RIPK3. Mechanistic studies reveal the increased phosphorylation of RIPK3 induced by RIPK1&#8208;biomimetic peptides, elucidating the activation of the necroptotic signaling pathway responsible for cell death without an obvious increase in secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Our findings highlight the potential of peptide&#8208;protein hybrid aggregation as a promising approach to address the &#8220;undruggable&#8221; issue and provide alternative strategies for overcoming cancer resistance in the future.

         <title>Kinetic Delay in Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization by Redefining the Trade&#8208;Off Relationship between H&#8208;Bonds and Van der Waals/&#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proper molecular engineering can open new opportunities to create kinetically metastable states in monomers undergoing cooperative supramolecular polymerizations. This occurs by favoring dispersive interactions over H&#8208;bonds and thereby rebalancing the interplay between &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, Van der Waals, and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions.







Abstract
We here present how rebalancing the interplay between H&#8208;bonds and dispersive forces (Van der Waals/&#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking) may induce or not the generation of kinetic metastable states. In particular, we show that extending the aromatic content and favouring the interchain VdW interactions causes a delay into the cooperative supramolecular polymerization of a new family of toluene bis&#8208;amide derivatives by trapping the metastable inactive state.

         <dc:description>
White&#8208;light emission by sequential F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from thermally robust precision two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assemblies is unravelled. It is driven by stereocomplex crystallization between two complementary chromophore&#8208;conjugated polylactide stereoisomers in the presence of an external dye.







Abstract
Achieving predictable and programmable two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structures with specific functions from exclusively organic soft materials remains a scientific challenge. This article unravels stereocomplex crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly as a facile method for producing thermally robust discrete 2D&#8208;platelets of diamond shape from biodegradable semicrystalline polylactide (PLA) scaffolds. The method involves co&#8208;assembling two PLA stereoisomers, namely, PY&#8208;PDLA and NMI&#8208;PLLA, which form stereocomplex (SC)&#8208;crystals in isopropanol. By conjugating a well&#8208;known F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) donor and acceptor dye, namely, pyrene (PY) and naphthalene monoimide (NMI), respectively, to the chain termini of these two interacting stereoisomers, a thermally robust FRET process can be stimulated from the 2D array of the co&#8208;assembled dyes on the thermally resilient SC&#8208;PLA crystal surfaces. Uniquely, by decorating the surface of the SC&#8208;PLA crystals with an externally immobilized guest dye, Rhodamine&#8208;B, similar diamond&#8208;shaped structures could be produced that exhibit pure white&#8208;light emission through a surface&#8208;induced two&#8208;step cascade energy transfer process. The FRET response in these systems displays remarkable dependence on the intrinsic crystalline packing, which could be modulated by the chirality of the co&#8208;assembling PLA chains. This is supported by comparing the properties of similar 2D platelets generated from two homochiral PLLAs (PY&#8208;PLLA and NMI&#8208;PLLA) labeled with the same FRET pair.

         <title>The Construction of Highly Substituted Piperidines via Dearomative Functionalization Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise dearomative functionalization reaction of pyridines generates highly substituted piperidines, featuring diverse functional handles, with excellent site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity. The origin of the unprecedented selectivities and additional insights into the reaction mechanism are discussed based on combined experimental mechanistic studies and density functional theory computations.







Abstract
Nitrogen heterocycles play a vital role in pharmaceuticals and natural products, with the six&#8208;membered aromatic and aliphatic architectures being commonly used. While synthetic methods for aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles are well&#8208;established, the synthesis of their aliphatic functionalized analogues, particularly piperidine derivatives, poses a significant challenge. In that regard, we propose a stepwise dearomative functionalization reaction for the construction of highly decorated piperidine derivatives with diverse functional handles. We also discuss challenges related to site&#8208;selectivity, regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, and provide insights into the reaction mechanism through mechanistic studies and density functional theory computations.

&lt;p&gt;The stepwise dearomative functionalization reaction of pyridines generates highly substituted piperidines, featuring diverse functional handles, with excellent site-, regio-, and diastereoselectivity. The origin of the unprecedented selectivities and additional insights into the reaction mechanism are discussed based on combined experimental mechanistic studies and density functional theory computations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen heterocycles play a vital role in pharmaceuticals and natural products, with the six-membered aromatic and aliphatic architectures being commonly used. While synthetic methods for aromatic &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles are well-established, the synthesis of their aliphatic functionalized analogues, particularly piperidine derivatives, poses a significant challenge. In that regard, we propose a stepwise dearomative functionalization reaction for the construction of highly decorated piperidine derivatives with diverse functional handles. We also discuss challenges related to site-selectivity, regio- and diastereoselectivity, and provide insights into the reaction mechanism through mechanistic studies and density functional theory computations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lattice Distortion and H&#8208;passivation in Pure Carbon Electrocatalysts for Efficient and Stable Two&#8208;electron Oxygen Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a new understanding on the activation of 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of carbon materials, through H&#8208;passivated and distorted lattices, and demonstrated how carbon cloth can be offered via this strategy with excellent and stable 2e&#8722; ORR for the H2O2 production.







Abstract
The exploration of inexpensive and efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for chemical and energy industries. Carbon materials have been proved promising with different catalysts enabling 2 and 4e&#8722; ORR. Nevertheless, their ORR activity and selectivity is still complex and under debate in many cases. Many structures of these active carbon materials are also chemically unstable for practical implementations. Unlike the well&#8208;discussed structures, this work presents a strategy to promote efficient and stable 2e&#8722; ORR of carbon materials through the synergistic effect of lattice distortion and H&#8208;passivation (on the distorted structure). We show how these structures can be formed on carbon cloth, and how the reproducible chemical adsorption can be realized on these structures for efficient and stable H2O2 production. The work here gives not only new understandings on the 2e&#8722; ORR catalysis, but also the robust catalyst which can be directly used in industry.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Topochemical Synthesis of a Collagen&#8208;inspired Covalent Helical Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic covalent helical polymers in solid form are in high demand. By biomimicry, we designed a dipeptide monomer containing azide and alkyne that organize in head&#8208;to&#8208;tail as supramolecular helices in their crystals. Upon heating, the monomer undergoes SCSC TAAC polymerization to yield a covalent helical polymer. Single crystals of this fully organic polymer show high flexural strength, compressive strength and load&#8208;bearing capacity.







Abstract
There is much demand for crystalline covalent helical polymers. Inspired by the helical structure of collagen, we synthesized a covalent helical polymer wherein the repeating dipeptide Gly&#8208;Pro units are connected by triazole linkages. We synthesized an azide and alkyne&#8208;modified dipeptide monomer made up of the repeating amino acid sequence of collagen. In its crystals, the monomer molecules aligned in head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion with proximally placed azide and alkyne forming supramolecular helices. At 60&#8201;&#176;C, the monomer underwent single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) topochemical azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition polymerization, yielding a covalent helical polymer as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. Compared to the monomer crystals, the polymer single&#8208;crystals were very strong and showed three&#8208;fold increase in Young's modulus, which is higher than collagen, many synthetic polymers and other materials. The crystals of this covalent helical polymer could bear loads as high as 1.5&#8197;million times of their own weight without deformation. These crystals could also withstand high compression force and did not disintegrate even at an applied force of 98&#8197;kN. Such light&#8208;weight strong materials are in demand for various technological applications.

         <dc:description>We present the first solvent&#8208;free, mechanochemical protocol for a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Tsuji&#8208;Trost allylation. This approach features exceptionally low catalyst loadings (0.5 mol%), short reaction times (&lt; 90 min), and a simple setup, eliminating the need for air or moisture precautions, making the process highly efficient and environmentally benign. We introduce solid, nontoxic, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle allyl trimethylammonium salts as valuable alternative to volatile or hazardous reagents. Our approach enables the allylation of various O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and C&#8208;nucleophiles in yields up to 99 % even for structurally complex bioactive compounds, owing to its mild conditions and exceptional functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of proteinaceous biomolecules into functional materials with ordered structures that span length scales is common in nature yet remains a challenge with designer peptides under ambient conditions. This report demonstrates how charged side&#8208;chain chemistry affects the hierarchical co&#8208;assembly of a family of charge&#8208;complementary &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;forming peptide pairs known as CATCH(X+/Y&#8208;) at physiologic pH and ionic strength in water. In a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, the CATCH(6K+) (Ac&#8208;KQKFKFKFKQK&#8208;Am) and CATCH(6D&#8208;) (Ac&#8208;DQDFDFDFDQD&#8208;Am) pair formed either &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich microspheres or &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich gels with a micron&#8208;scale plate&#8208;like morphology, which were not observed with other CATCH(X+/Y&#8208;) pairs.

Replacing K with R, or mutating the N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal amino acids in CATCH(6K+) and CATCH(6D&#8208;) to Qs, increased observed co&#8208;assembly kinetics, which also disrupted hierarchical order.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric synthesis of small molecules comprising quaternary stereogenic carbon centers represents a challenging objective. Here regio&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of chiral 1,5&#8208;dienes featuring quaternary stereocenters is reported via nickel&#8208;promoted reductive homoallylic coupling. The developed methodology features an atypical preference for the formation of unusual branched regioisomers (rr &gt;20:1) in a sterically challenging allylic substitution event and furnishes the products with enantiomeric ratios of up to 94:6 and with high chemo&#8208; and E&#8208;selectivity. A range of experimental evidences suggest that zinc plays a dual role to generate electrophilic and nucleophilic Ni(II)&#8208;allyl intermediates empowering a unique formal bimetallic cross&#8208;electrophile manifold in two separate kinetic regimes.</dc:description>

         <title>Irreparable interphase chemistry degradation induced by temperature pulse in lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While it is widely recognized that the operating temperature significantly affects the energy density and cycle life of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the consequence of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase chemistry to sudden environmental temperature changes remains inadequately understood. Here, we systematically investigate the effects of a temperature pulse (T pulse) on the electrochemical performance of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC 811) pouch full cells. By utilizing advanced characterization tools, such as time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry, we reveal that the T pulse can lead to an irreversible degradation of cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase chemistry and architecture. Despite negligible immediate impacts on the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite anode, aggregated cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode chemical crossover gradually degrades the SEI by catalyzing electrolyte reduction decomposition and inducing metallic dead Li formation because of insufficient cathode passivation after the T pulse. Consequently, pouch cells subjected to the T pulse show an inferior cycle stability to those free of the T pulse. This work unveils the effects of sudden temperature changes on the interphase chemistry and cell performance, emphasizing the importance of a proper temperature management in assessing performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Electric Field Enhanced Ammoxidation of Aldehydes Using Supported Fe Clusters Under Ambient Oxygen Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous catalytic ammoxidation provides an eco&#8208;friendly route for the cyanide&#8208;free synthesis of nitrile compounds, which are important precursors for synthetic chemistry and pharmaceutical applications. However, in general such a process requires high pressures of molecular oxygen at elevated temperatures to accelerate the oxygen reduction and imine dehydrogenation steps, which is highly risky in practical applications. Here, we report an electric field enhanced ammoxidation system using a supported Fe clusters catalyst (Fe/NC), which enables efficient synthesis of nitriles from the corresponding aldehydes under ambient air pressure at room temperature (RT). A synergistic effect between the external electric field and the Fe/NC catalyst promotes the ammonia activation and the dehydrogenation of the generated imine intermediates and avoids the unwanted backwards reaction to aldehydes. This electric field enhanced ammoxidation system presents high efficiency and selectivity for the conversion of a series of aldehydes under mild conditions with high durability, rendering it an attractive process for the green synthesis of nitriles with fragile functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Driven Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Halogenation of Unsaturated Halide and Triflate Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A robust electrochemically driven nickel&#8208;catalyzed halogen exchange of unsaturated halides and triflates (Br to Cl, I to Cl, I to Br, and OTf to Cl) is reported. A combination of NiCl2&#183;glyme as pre&#8208;catalyst, 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine as ligand, NMP as solvent and electrochemistry, allowed the generation of nickel species that promotes reductive elimination of the desired product. This paired electrochemical halogenation is compatible with a range of unsaturated halides and triflates, including heterocycles dihaloarenes and alkenes with good functional group tolerance. Joint experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigations highlighted three catalytic events: i. oxidative addition of the aryl halide onto a Ni(0) species to deliver a Ni(II) intermediate; ii. halide metathesis at Ni(II); iii. electrochemical oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III) to enable the formation of the desired aryl halide upon reductive elimination. This methodology allows the replacement of heavy halogens (I or Br) or polar atoms (O) by the corresponding lighter and more lipophilic Cl group for blocking undesired reactivity or for modifying properties of drug and agrochemical candidates. While the scope of this study is limited by the selectivity of the oxidative addition toward activated (pseudo)halide derivatives, it paves the way for the development of more general electrochemically driven electrophile shuttle reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Pre&#8208;intercalation of Ammonium Ions in Layered   &#948;  &#8208;MnO2 Nanosheets for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered manganese dioxide is a promising cathode candidate for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. However, the narrow interlayer spacing, inferior intrinsic electronic conductivity and poor structural stability still limit its practical application. Herein, we report a two&#8208;step strategy to incorporate ammonium ions into manganese dioxide (named as AMO) nanosheets as a cathode for boosted Zn ion storage. K+&#8208;intercalated &#948;&#8208;MnO2 nanosheets (KMO) grown on carbon cloth are chosen as the self&#8208;involved precursor. Of note, ammonium ions could replace K+ ions via a facile hydrothermal reaction to enlarge the lattice space and form hydrogen&#8208;bond networks. Compared with KMO, the structural stability and the ion transfer kinetics of the layered AMO are enhanced. As expected, the obtained AMO cathode exhibits remarkable electrochemical properties in terms of high reversible capacity, decent rate performance and superior cycling stability over 10000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Guiding Zn Uniform Deposition with Polymer Additives for Long&#8208;lasting and Highly Utilized Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The parasitic side reaction on Zn anode is the key issue which hinders the development of aqueous Zn&#8208;based energy storage systems on power&#8208;grid applications. Here, a polymer additive (PMCNA) engineered by copolymerizing 2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA) was employed to regulate the Zn deposition environment for satisfying side reaction inhibition performance during long&#8208;term cycling with high Zn utilization. The PMCNA can preferentially adsorb on Zn metal surface to form a uniform protective layer for effective water molecule repelling and side reaction resistance. In addition, the PMCNA can guide Zn nucleation and deposition along 002 plane for further side reaction and dendrite suppression. Consequently, the PMCNA additive can enable the Zn//Zn battery with an ultrahigh depth of discharge (DOD) of 90.0% for over 420 h, the Zn//active carbon (AC) capacitor with long cycling lifespan, and the Zn//PANI battery with  Zn utilization of 51.3% at low N/P ratio of 2.6.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles with Discrete DNA Valences for Precisely Controlled Transport at the Subcellular Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasmall luminescent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with excellent capabilities to cross biological barriers offer great promise in designing intelligent model nanomedicines for investigating structure&#8208;property relationships at the subcellular level. However, the strict surface controllability of ultrasmall AuNPs is challenging because of their small size. Herein, we report a facile in situ method for precisely controlling DNA aptamer valences on the surface of luminescent AuNPs with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window using a phosphorothioate&#8208;modified DNA aptamer, AS1411, as a template. The discrete DNA aptamer number of AS1411&#8208;functionalized AuNPs (AS1411&#8208;AuNPs, ~1.8 nm) with emission at 1030 nm was controlled in one aptamer (V1), two aptamers (V2), and four aptamers (V4). It was then discovered that not only the tumor&#8208;targeting efficiencies but also the subcellular transport of AS1411&#8208;AuNPs were precisely dependent on valences. A slight increase in valence from V1 to V2 increased tumor&#8208;targeting efficiencies and resulted in higher nucleus accumulation, whereas a further increase in valence (e.g., V4) significantly increased tumor&#8208;targeting efficiencies and led to higher cytomembrane accumulation. These results provide a basis for the strict surface control of nanomedicines in the precise regulation of in vivo transport at the subcellular level and their translation into clinical practice in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Photoisomerization of an Azobenzene&#8208;Based Triple Helicate with a Prolonged Thermal Relaxation Time</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The phosphate&#8208;coordination triple helicates A2L3 (A = anion) with azobenzene&#8208;spaced bis&#8208;bis(urea) ligands (L) have proven to undergo a rare in situ photoisomerization (without disassembly of the structure) rather than the typically known, stepwise &#8220;disassembly&#8208;isomerization&#8208;reassembly&#8221; process. This is enabled by the structural self&#8208;adaptability of the &#8220;aniono&#8221; assembly arising from multiple relatively weak and flexible hydrogen bonds between phosphate anion and bis(urea) units. Notably, the Z&#8594;E thermal relaxation rate of isomerized azobenzene unit is significantly decreased (up to 20&#8208;fold) for the triple helicates compared to free ligands. Moreover, the binding of chiral guest cations inside the cavity of Z&#8208;isomerized triple helicate can induce optically pure diastereomers, thus demonstrating a new strategy for making light&#8208;activated chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

Notably, the Z&#8594;E thermal relaxation rate of isomerized azobenzene unit is significantly decreased (up to 20-fold) for the triple helicates compared to free ligands. Moreover, the binding of chiral guest cations inside the cavity of Z-isomerized triple helicate can induce optically pure diastereomers, thus demonstrating a new strategy for making light-activated chiroptical materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrashort Phase&#8208;Matching Wavelength and Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Deep&#8208;UV&#8208;Transparent Oxyfluorides by Covalency Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of urgently&#8208;needed UV/deep&#8208;UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials has been hindered by contradictory requirements of the microstructure, in particular the need for a strong SHG response as well as a short phase&#8208;matching (PM) wavelength.&#160;We herein employ a &#8220;de&#8208;covalency&#8221; bandgap engineering strategy to adjust the optical linearity and nonlinearity. This has been achieved by assembling two types of transition&#8208;metal (TM) ([TaO2F4] and [TaF7]), affording the first tantalum&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV&#8208;transparent NLO materials, A5Ta3OF18 (A = K (KTOF), Rb (RTOF)). Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the highly ionic bonds and strong electropositivity of tantalum in the two oxyfluorides induce record short PM wavelengths (238 (KTOF) and 240 (RTOF) nm) for d0&#8208;TM&#8208;centered oxides, in addition to strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) responses (2.8 &#215; KH2PO4 (KTOF) and 2.6 &#215; KH2PO4 (RTOF)), and sufficient birefringences (0.092 (KTOF) and 0.085 (RTOF) at 546 nm). These results not only broaden the available strategies for achieving deep&#8208;UV NLO materials by exploiting the currently neglected d0&#8208;TMs, but also push the shortest PM wavelength into the short&#8208;wavelength UV region.</dc:description>

         <title>Increasing Reduction Potentials of Type 1 Copper Center and Catalytic Efficiency of Small Laccase from Streptomyces coelicolor through Secondary Coordination Sphere Mutations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The key to type 1 copper (T1Cu) function lies in the fine tuning of the CuII/I reduction potential (E&#176;&#180;T1Cu) to match its redox partners, enabling efficient electron transfer in a wide range of biological systems. While the secondary coordination sphere (SCS) effects have been used to tune E&#176;&#180;T1Cu in azurin over a wide range, these principles are yet to be generalized to other T1Cu&#8208;containing proteins to tune catalytic properties. To this end, we have examined the effects of Y229F, V290N and S292F mutations around the T1Cu of small laccase (SLAC) from Streptomyces coelicolor to match the E&#176;&#180;T1Cu to high reduction potential fungal laccases. Using ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, together with X&#8208;ray crystallography and spectroelectrochemistry, we have probed the influence of SCS mutations on the T1Cu and corresponding E&#176;&#180;T1Cu. While minimal and small increases are observed in Y229F and S292F&#8208;SLAC, the V290N mutant exhibits a major increase in E&#176;&#180;T1Cu. Moreover, the influence of these mutations on E&#176;&#180;T1Cu is additive, culminating in a triple mutant Y229F/V290N/S292F&#8208;SLAC with the highest E&#176;&#180;T1Cu of 556 mV vs. SHE reported to date. Further activity assays indicate that all mutants retain oxygen reduction reaction activity, and display improved catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM) relative to WT&#8208;SLAC.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photochemical Strategy for ortho&#8208;Aminophenol Synthesis via Dearomative&#8208;Rearomative Coupling Between Aryl Azides and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ortho&#8208;Aminophenols are aromatic derivatives featuring vicinal N&#8208; and O&#8208;based functionalities commonly found in the structures of many high&#8208;value materials. These molecules are generally prepared using multistep strategies that follow the rules of electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) chemistry. Despite their high fidelity, such approaches cannot target substrates featuring a &#8220;contra&#8208;SEAr&#8221; arrangement of N&#8208; and O&#8208;groups. Here we report an alternative strategy for the preparation of such ortho&#8208;aminophenols using aryl azides as the precursors. The process utilizes low&#8208;energy photoexcitation to trigger the decomposition of aryl azides into singlet nitrenes that undergo a dearomative&#8208;rearomative sequence. This allows the incorporation of alcoholic nucleophiles into a seven&#8208;membered ring azepine intermediate via temporary disruption of aromaticity, followed by electrophile&#8208;induced re&#8208;aromatization. The net retrosynthetic logic is that the alcohol displaces the azide in turn moves to its ortho position and furthermore is converted into an amide. The synthetic value and complementarity of this strategy has been demonstrated by the coupling of aryl azides with complex, drug&#8208;like alcohols and phenols as well as amines, thiols and thiophenols, which provides a general platform for the fast and selective heterofunctionalization of aromatics.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Catalysis of Gold Nanoclusters: Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling by Cooperation of Superatomic Core and Molecularly Modified Staples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) have attracted significant attention as nano&#8208;catalysts, revealing a superatomic core and gold&#8208;thiolate staples as distinct structural units. Here, we demonstrate the unprecedented dual catalytic activity of thiolate&#8208;protected [Au25(SR)18]&#8722; nanoclusters, involving both photosensitized 1O2 generation by the Au13 superatomic core and catalytic carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation facilitated by Au2(SR)3 staples. This synergistic combination of two different catalytic units enables efficient cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of terminal alkynes and tertiary aliphatic amines to afford propargylamines in high yields of up to 93%. Mixed&#8208;ligand AuNCs bearing both thiolate and alkynyl ligands revealed the intermediacy of the alkynyl&#8208;exchanged AuNCs toward both photosensitization and C&#8211;C bond&#8208;forming catalytic cycles. Density functional theory calculations also supported the intermediacy of the alkynyl&#8208;exchanged AuNCs. Thus, the use of ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters has enabled the development of an exceptional multifunctional catalyst, wherein distinct nanocluster components facilitate cooperative photo&#8208; and chemo&#8208;catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Fluorine&#8208;rich Double Protective Layer on Zn Anode for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high thermodynamic instability and side reactions of Zn&#8208;metal anode (ZMA), especially at high current densities, greatly impede the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a fluorine&#8208;rich double protective layer strategy is proposed to obtain the high reversibility of AZIBs through the introduction of a versatile tetradecafluorononane&#8208;1,9&#8208;diol (TDFND) additive in aqueous electrolyte. TDFND molecule with large adsorption energy (&#8722;1.51 eV) preferentially absorbs on the Zn anode surface to form a Zn(OR)2&#8722; (R= &#8722;CH2&#8722;(CF2)7&#8722;CH2&#8722;) cross&#8208;linking complex network, which balances space electric field and controls the Zn2+ ion flux, thus enabling the uniform and compact deposition of Zn (002) crystal planes. Meanwhile, TDFND with low Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO, 0.10 eV) energy level is priorly decomposed to regulate the interfacial chemistry of ZMA by building a ZnF2&#8208;rich solid electrode/electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. It is found that a 14 nm&#8208;thick SEI layer delivers excellent structural integrity to suppress parasitic reactions by blocking the direct contact of active water and ZMA. Consequently, the Zn electrode exhibits a superior cycling life over 430 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% at 5 mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a 68 mAh pouch cell delivers 80.3% capacity retention for 1000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Out of the Box: Catalytic Versatility Across NAD(P)H&#8208;Dependent Oxidoreductases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric reduction of double bonds using NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent oxidoreductases has proven to be an efficient tool for the synthesis of important chiral molecules in research and on industrial scale. These enzymes are commercially available in screening kits for the reduction of C=O (ketones), C=C (activated alkenes), or C=N bonds (imines). Recent reports, however, indicate that the ability to accommodate multiple reductase activities on distinct C=X bonds occurs in different enzyme classes, either natively or after mutagenesis. This challenges the common perception of highly selective oxidoreductases for one type of electrophilic substrate. Consideration of this underexplored potential in enzyme screenings and protein engineering campaigns may contribute to the identification of complementary biocatalytic processes for the synthesis of chiral compounds. This review will contribute to a global understanding of the promiscuous behavior of NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent oxidoreductases on C=X bond reduction and inspire future discoveries with respect to unconventional biocatalytic routes in asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Diradicaloid Boron&#8208;Doped Molecular Carbons Achieved by Pentagon&#8208;Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular carbons (MCs) are molecular cutout of carbon materials. Doping heteroatom and constructing open&#8208;shell structure are two powerful approaches to achieve unexpected and unique properties of MCs. Herein, we disclose a new strategy to design open&#8208;shell boron&#8208;doped MCs (BMCs), namely pentagon&#8208;fusion of organoborane &#960;&#8208;system. We synthesized two diradicaloid BMC molecules that feature the C24B and C38B &#960;&#8208;skeletons containing a pentagonal ring, respectively. A thorough investigation reveals that such pentagon&#8208;fusion not only leads to their local antiaromaticity, but also incorporates an internal quinoidal substructure and thereby induces open&#8208;shell singlet diradical states. Moreover, their fully fused structures enable the efficient &#960; conjugation that is expanded over the whole frameworks. Consequently, some intriguing physical properties are achieved, such as narrow energy gaps, very broad light absorptions and superior photothermal capability, along with excellent photostability. Notably, the solid of the C38B molecule exhibits the absorption that covers the range of 300&#8210;1200 nm and the efficiency of 93.5% for solar&#8208;driven water evaporation, thus demonstrating the potential of diradicaloid BMCs as high&#8208;performance organic photothermal materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Superlattice&#8208;Triggered Electron&#8208;Entropy Stimulation and Selective Proton Grotthuss&#8208;Intercalation in Polymer&#8208;Intercalated &#948;&#8208;MnO2 for High&#8208;Performance Zn&#8722;MnO2 Battery</title>

         <dc:description>A great deal of attention has been paid on layered manganese dioxide (&#948;&#8208;MnO2) as promising cathode candidate for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery (ZIB) due to the excellent theoretical capacity, high working voltage and Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;intercalation mechanism. However, caused by the insertion of Zn2+, the strong coulomb interaction and sluggish diffusion kinetics have resulted in significant structure deformation, insufficient cycle stability and limited rate capability. And it is still far from satisfactory to accurately modulate H+ intercalation for superior electrochemical kinetics. Herein, the terrace&#8208;shape &#948;&#8208;MnO2 hybrid superlattice by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) pre&#8208;intercalation (PVP&#8208;MnO2) was proposed with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ZIBs performance. Local atomic structure characterization and theoretical calculations have been pioneering in confirming the hybrid superlattice&#8208;triggered synergy of electron entropy stimulation and selective H+ Grotthuss&#8208;like intercalation. Accordingly, PVP&#8208;MnO2 hybrid superlattice exhibits prominent specific capacity (317.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.125 A g&#8722;1), significant rate performance (106.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 12.5 A g&#8722;1), and remarkable cycle stability at high rate (~100% capacity retention after 20,000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1). Therefore, rational design of interlayer configuration paves the pathways to the development of MnO2 superlattice for advanced Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation and characterization of monomeric human RAD51: a novel tool for investigating homologous recombination in cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RAD51 is a key player in the homologous recombination pathway. Upon DNA damage, RAD51 is transported into the nucleus by BRCA2, where it can repair DNA double&#8208;strand breaks. Due to the structural complexity and dynamics, researchers have not yet clarified the mechanistic details of every step of RAD51 recruitment and DNA repair. RAD51 possesses an intrinsic tendency to form oligomeric structures, which make it challenging to conduct biochemical and biophysical investigations. Here, for the first time, we report on the isolation and characterization of a human monomeric RAD51 recombinant form, obtained through a double mutation, which preserves the protein&#8217;s integrity and functionality. We investigated different buffers to identify the most suitable condition needed to definitively stabilize the monomer. The monomer of human RAD51 provides the community with a unique biological tool for investigating RAD51&#8208;mediated homologous recombination, and paves the way for more reliable structural, mechanistic, and drug discovery studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulate Multiple Resonance Delayed Fluorescence via Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Excited State towards High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual steric and electronic effects of through&#8208;space charge transfer excited states have been exploited to concurrently shorten the delayed fluorescence lifetime and mitigate the aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching of multiple resonance B&#8722;N emitter. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the new emitter show high efficiencies, small efficiency roll&#8208;offs, and good operational stability.







Abstract
B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded multiple resonance (MR) type thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters usually suffer from slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching. Here, we report the design of a sandwich structure by placing the B&#8722;N MR core between two electron&#8208;donating moieties, inducing through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) states. The proper adjusting of the energy levels brings about a 10&#8208;fold higher RISC rate in comparison with the parent B&#8722;N molecule. In the meantime, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 91&#8201;% and a good color purity were maintained. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the new MR emitter achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.7&#8201;% and small roll&#8208;offs at high brightness. High device efficiencies were also obtained for a wide range of doping concentrations of up to 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% thanks to the steric shielding of the B&#8722;N core. A good operational stability with LT95 of 85.2&#8197;h has also been revealed. The dual steric and electronic effects resulting from the introduction of a TSCT state offer an effective molecular design to address the critical challenges of MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

Our study makes a stride in the discovery of acid&#8208;stable Co&#8722;Co dinuclear active sites (DASs) for PEM through single&#8208;atom tuning strategy. The XAFS elucidated the incorporation of Zr greatly facilitated the generation of Co&#8722;Co DASs layer with stretching of cobalt oxygen bond and S&#8722;Co&#8722;O heterogeneous grain boundaries interfaces (HGBIs), engineering attractive activity of ultra&#8208;low overpotential and 500&#8197;h superior durability in acid.







Abstract
Developing cost&#8208;effective and sustainable acidic water oxidation catalysts requires significant advances in material design and in&#8208;depth mechanism understanding for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. Herein, we developed a single atom regulatory strategy to construct Co&#8722;Co dinuclear active sites (DASs) catalysts that atomically dispersed zirconium doped Co9S8/Co3O4 heterostructure. The X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure elucidated the incorporation of Zr greatly facilitated the generation of Co&#8722;Co DASs layer with stretching of cobalt oxygen bond and S&#8722;Co&#8722;O heterogeneous grain boundaries interfaces, engineering attractive activity of significantly reduced overpotential of 75&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a breakthrough of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 high current density, and water splitting stability of 500&#8197;hours in acid, making it one of the best&#8208;performing acid&#8208;stable OER non&#8208;noble metal materials. The optimized catalyst with interatomic Co&#8722;Co distance (ca. 2.80&#8197;&#197;) followed oxo&#8208;oxo coupling mechanism that involved obvious oxygen bridges on dinuclear Co sites (1,090&#8197;cm&#8722;1), confirmed by in situ SR&#8208;FTIR, XAFS and theoretical simulations. Furthermore, a major breakthrough of 120,000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 high mass current density using the first reported noble metal&#8208;free cobalt anode catalyst of Co&#8722;Co DASs/ZCC in PEM&#8208;WE at 2.14&#8197;V was recorded.

Herein, we developed a single atom regulatory strategy to construct Co&#8722;Co dinuclear active sites (DASs) catalysts that atomically dispersed zirconium doped Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure. The X-ray absorption fine structure elucidated the incorporation of Zr greatly facilitated the generation of Co&#8722;Co DASs layer with stretching of cobalt oxygen bond and S&#8722;Co&#8722;O heterogeneous grain boundaries interfaces, engineering attractive activity of significantly reduced overpotential of 75&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a breakthrough of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; high current density, and water splitting stability of 500&#8197;hours in acid, making it one of the best-performing acid-stable OER non-noble metal materials. The optimized catalyst with interatomic Co&#8722;Co distance (ca. 2.80&#8197;&#197;) followed oxo-oxo coupling mechanism that involved obvious oxygen bridges on dinuclear Co sites (1,090&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), confirmed by in situ SR-FTIR, XAFS and theoretical simulations. Furthermore, a major breakthrough of 120,000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; high mass current density using the first reported noble metal-free cobalt anode catalyst of Co&#8722;Co DASs/ZCC in PEM-WE at 2.14&#8197;V was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unusual Thermal Quenching of Photoluminescence from an Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid [MnBr4]2&#8722;&#8208;based Halide Mediated by Crystalline&#8211;Crystalline Phase Transition</title>

         <dc:description>
An unusual temporary photoluminescence (PL) quenching effect is herein reported for the first time, namely the thermodynamic phase transition of (DMML)2MnBr4 (DMML=N,N&#8208;dimethylmorpholinium) couples highly with PL response. Notably, the intriguing phenomenon will make an important contribution to the further in&#8208;depth exploration of responsive photoluminescence and optical encryption.







Abstract
The ability to generate and manipulate photoluminescence (PL) behavior has been of primary importance for applications in information security. Excavating novel optical effects to create more possibilities for information encoding has become a continuous challenge. Herein, we present an unprecedented PL temporary quenching that highly couples with thermodynamic phase transition in a hybrid crystal (DMML)2MnBr4 (DMML=N,N&#8208;dimethylmorpholinium). Such unusual PL behavior originates from the anomalous variation of [MnBr4]2&#8722; tetrahedrons that leads to non&#8208;radiation recombination near the phase transition temperature of 340&#8197;K. Remarkably, the suitable detectable temperature, narrow response window, high sensitivity, and good cyclability of this PL temporary quenching will endow encryption applications with high concealment, operational flexibility, durability, and commercial popularization. Profited from these attributes, a fire&#8208;new optical encryption model is devised to demonstrate high confidential information security. This unprecedented optical effect would provide new insights and paradigms for the development of luminescent materials to enlighten future information encryption.

         <title>Streamlined Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Loop Mimicry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Backbone Matching (BM) evaluates virtual libraries of cyclic peptidomimetics containing an organic fragment, for interface loop mimicry in protein&#8208;protein interactions. It does so by comparing their backbone conformers with interface loops on the protein ligand. Hits for iNOS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SPSB2 and uPA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;uPAR were validated experimentally.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides comprising endocyclic organic fragments, &#8220;cyclo&#8208;organopeptides&#8221;, can be probes for perturbing protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Finding loop mimics is difficult because of high conformational variability amongst targets. Backbone Matching (BM), introduced here, helps solve this problem in the illustrative cases by facilitating efficient evaluation of virtual cyclo&#8208;organopeptide core&#8208;structure libraries. Thus, 86 rigid organic fragments were selected to build a library of 602 cyclo&#8208;organopeptides comprising Ala and organic parts: &#8220;cyclo&#8208;{&#8208;(Ala)n&#8208;organo&#8208;}&#8221;. The central hypothesis is &#8220;hit&#8221; library members have accessible low energy conformers corresponding to backbone structures of target protein loops, while library members which cannot attain this conformation are probably unworthy of further evaluation. BM thereby prioritizes candidate loop mimics, so that less than 10&#8197;cyclo&#8208;organopeptides are needed to be prepared to find leads for two illustrative PPIs: iNOS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SPSB2, and uPA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;uPAR.

         <title>Criteria for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting Revealed by Studying Carrier Dynamics in a Model Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3 Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoluminescence study of a model Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3 photocatalyst reveals that by suppressing photocarrier recombination and establishing a facile charge separation and extraction mechanism, a quantum efficiency of almost 100&#8201;% can be achieved even with a very short (sub&#8208;ns) intrinsic photocarrier lifetime, challenging the belief that a long carrier lifetime is a fundamental requirement.







Abstract
Overall water splitting (OWS) using semiconductor photocatalysts is a promising method for solar fuel production. Achieving a high quantum efficiency is one of the most important prerequisites for photocatalysts to realize high solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency. In a recent study (Nature 2020, 58, 411&#8211;414), a quantum efficiency of almost 100&#8201;% has been achieved in an aluminum&#8208;doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Al) photocatalyst. Herein, using the SrTiO3&#8201;:&#8201;Al as a model photocatalyst, we reveal the criteria for efficient photocatalytic water splitting by investigating the carrier dynamics through a comprehensive photoluminescence study. It is found that the Al doping suppresses the generation of Ti3+ recombination centers in SrTiO3, the surface band bending facilitates charge separation, and the in situ photo&#8208;deposited Rh/Cr2O3 and CoOOH co&#8208;catalysts render efficient charge extraction. By suppressing photocarrier recombination and establishing a facile charge separation and extraction mechanism, high quantum efficiency can be achieved even on photocatalysts with a very short (sub&#8208;ns) intrinsic photocarrier lifetime, challenging the belief that a long carrier lifetime is a fundamental requirement. Our findings could provide guidance on the design of OWS photocatalysts toward more efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

         <title>Synergetic Coupling of Redox&#8208;Active Sites on Organic Electrode Material for Robust and High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexanol hexaazatrinaphthalene, an organic electrode material with synergetic coupling effects of abundant redox&#8208;active sites and stable conjugated cores, via nine&#8208;electron transfer mechanism, delivers excellent rate capability, and robust cycling performance in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials (OEMs), valued for their sustainability and structural tunability, have been attracting increasing attention for wide application in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) and other rechargeable batteries. However, most OEMs are plagued with insufficient specific capacity or poor cycling stability. Therefore, it&#8242;s imperative to enhance their specific capacity and cycling stability through molecular design. Herein, we designed and synthesized a heteroaromatic molecule 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexanol hexaazatrinaphthalene (HATN&#8208;6OH) by the synergetic coupling of catechol (the precursor of ortho&#8208;quinone)/ortho&#8208;quinone functional groups and HATN conjugated core structures. The abundance of catechol/ortho&#8208;quinone and imine redox&#8208;active moieties delivers a high specific capacity of nine&#8208;electron transfer for SIBs. Most notably, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and intermolecular hydrogen bond forces among HATN&#8208;6OH molecules secure the stable long&#8208;term cycling performance of SIBs. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared HATN&#8208;6OH electrode exhibited a high specific capacity (554&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (202&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and stable long&#8208;term cycling performance (73&#8201;% after 3000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) in SIBs. Additionally, the nine&#8208;electron transfer mechanism is confirmed by systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculation, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), and Raman analysis. The achievement of the synergetic coupling of the redox&#8208;active sites on OEMs could be an important key to the enhancement of SIBs and other metal&#8208;ion batteries.

Consequently, the as-prepared HATN-6OH electrode exhibited a high specific capacity (554&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), excellent rate capability (202&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and stable long-term cycling performance (73&#8201;% after 3000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in SIBs. Additionally, the nine-electron transfer mechanism is confirmed by systematic density functional theory (DFT) calculation, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and Raman analysis. The achievement of the synergetic coupling of the redox-active sites on OEMs could be an important key to the enhancement of SIBs and other metal-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Electrolyte Cations Dependent Kinetics on CoOOH&#8208;Catalyzed Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrolyte cations dependent kinetics on CoOOH catalyzed oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is derived from cation intercalation, which can rationally tailor the formation energy of high&#8208;valent OER&#8208;active *O&#8722;Co(IV) species during OER process. This finding provides an informative picture to understand the complicated mechanism of electrolyte cation&#8208;targeted electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The electrolyte cations&#8208;dependent kinetics have been widely observed in many fields of electrocatalysis, however, the exact mechanism of the influence on catalytic performance is still a controversial topic of considerable discussion. Herein, combined with operando X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), we verify that the electrolyte cations could intercalate into the layer of pristine CoOOH catalyst during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, while the bigger cations lead to enlarged interlayer spacing and increased OER activity, following the order Cs+&gt;K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ Raman, in situ Ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopy, in situ XAS spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and theoretical calculations reveal that the intercalation of electrolyte cations efficiently modify the oxidation states of Co by enlarging the Co&#8722;O bonds, which in turn enhance the d&#8208;band center of Co, optimize the adsorption strength of oxygen intermediates, facilitate the formation of OER active Co(IV) species, and reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determing step (RDS), thereby enhancing the OER activity. This work not only provides an informative picture to understand the complicated dependence of OER kinetics on electrolyte cations, but also sheds light on understanding the mechanism of other electrolyte cation&#8208;targeted electrocatalysis.

         <title>Six&#8208;Electron&#8208;Redox Iodine Electrodes for High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six&#8208;electron redox chemistry of I2 electrodes is achieved via the synergistic effect of redox&#8208;ion charge&#8208;carriers and halide ions in aqueous electrolytes. The unique energy storage mechanism leads to high capacity and potential of I2 electrodes, contributing to enhanced energy density of corresponding aqueous batteries.







Abstract
Iodine (I2) shows great promising as the active material in aqueous batteries due to its distinctive merits of high abundance in ocean and low cost. However, in conventional aqueous I2&#8208;based batteries, the energy storage mechanism of I&#8722;/I2 conversion is only two&#8208;electron redox reaction, limiting their energy density. Herein, six&#8208;electron redox chemistry of I2 electrodes is achieved via the synergistic effect of redox&#8208;ion charge&#8208;carriers and halide ions in electrolytes. The redox&#8208;active Cu2+ ions in electrolytes induce the conversion between Cu2+ ions and I2 to CuI at low potential. Simultaneously, the Cl&#8722; ions in electrolytes activate the I2/ICl redox couple at high potential. As a result, in our case, I2&#8208;based battery system with six&#8208;electron redox is developed. Such energy storage mechanism with six&#8208;electron redox leads to high discharge potential and capacity, excellent rate capability, as well as stable cycling behavior of I2 electrodes. Impressively, six&#8208;electron&#8208;redox I2 cathodes can match various aqueous metal (e.g. Zn, Mn and Fe) anodes to construct metal||I2 hybrid batteries. These hybrid batteries not only deliver enhanced capacities, but also exhibit higher operate voltages, which contributes to superior energy densities. Therefore, this work broadens the horizon for the design of high&#8208;energy aqueous I2&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Exploitation of Catalytic Dyads by Short Peptide&#8208;Based Nanotubes&#160;for Enantioselective Covalent Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extant enzymes with precisely arranged multiple residues in their three&#8208;dimensional binding pockets are capable of exhibiting remarkable stereoselectivity towards a racemic mixture of substrates. However, how early protein folds that possibly featured short peptide fragments facilitated enantioselective catalytic transformations important for the emergence of homochirality still remains an intriguing open question. Herein, enantioselective hydrolysis was shown by short peptide&#8208;based nanotubes that could exploit multiple solvent&#8208;exposed residues to create chiral binding grooves to covalently interact and subsequently hydrolyse one enantiomer preferentially from a racemic pool. Single or double&#8208;site chiral mutations led to opposite but diminished and even complete loss of enantioselectivities suggesting the critical roles of the binding enthalpies from the precise localization of the active site residues, despite the short sequence lengths. This work underpins the enantioselective catalytic prowess of short peptide&#8208;based folds and argues their possible role in the emergence of homochiral chemical inventory.</dc:description>

         <title>Embedding Hydrogen Atom Transfer Moieties in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic C&#8211;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as efficient heterogeneous photocatalysts for a wide range of relatively simple organic reactions, whereas their application in complex organic transformations, like site&#8208;selective functionalization of unactivated C&#8211;H bonds, is underexplored, which can be mainly attributed to the lack of highly active organophotocatalytic cores. Herein through bonding oxygen atoms at the N&#8208;terminus of quinolines in nonsubstituted quinoline&#8208;linked COFs (NQ&#8208;COFs), we successfully realized the embedding of active hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) moieties into the skeleton of COFs. This novel designed COF (NQ&#8208;COFE5&#8208;O), serving as both an excellent photosensitizer and HAT catalyst, exhibited much higher efficiency in C&#8211;H functionalization than the corresponding NQ&#8208;COFE5. Specially, we evaluated the photocatalytic performance of NQ&#8208;COFE5&#8208;O on ten different substrates, including quinolines, benzothiazole, and benzoxazole, all of which were transferred to desired products in moderate to high yields (up to 93%). Furthermore, the as&#8208;synthesized NQ&#8208;COFE5&#8208;O displayed excellent photostability and could be reused with negligible loss of activity for five catalytic cycles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Bicyclo[3.2.1]octadiene compounds and derivatives exist in a number of natural products and bioactive compounds. Nevertheless, catalytic enantioselective protocols for the synthesis of these skeletons have not been disclosed. Herein we reported a palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular alkene&#8208;alkyne coupling of alkyne&#8208;tethered cyclopentenes, affording a library of enantionenriched bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (mostly &gt;99% ee). Moreover, the products could undergo an unusual iodination&#8208;induced 1,2&#8208;acyl migration, forming iodinated bicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes with three vicinal stereocenters. The enone and isolated olefin motifs embedded in the products provide useful handles for downstream elaboration.</dc:description>

         <title>Adapting Synthetic Models of Heme/Cu Sites to Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature, cytochrome&#160;c&#160;oxidases catalyze the 4e&#8211;&#160;oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the heme/Cu site, in which CuI&#160;is used to assist O2&#160;activation. Because of the&#160;thermodynamic barrier to&#160;generate&#160;CuI, synthetic Fe&#8208;porphyrin/Cu complexes usually show moderate electrocatalytic ORR activity. We herein report on a Co&#8208;corrole/Co complex&#160;1&#8208;Co&#160;for energy&#8208;efficient electrocatalytic ORR. By hanging a CoII&#160;ion over Co corrole,&#160;1&#8208;Co&#160;realizes electrocatalytic 4e&#8211;&#160;ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89 V versus RHE, which is outstanding among corrole&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Notably,&#160;1&#8208;Cooutperforms Co corrole hanged with CuII&#160;or ZnII. We revealed that&#160;the hanging CoII&#160;ion&#160;can provide an electron to improve O2&#160;binding&#160;thermodynamically and dynamically,&#160;a function represented by the&#160;biological CuI&#160;ion of the heme/Cu site.&#160;This work is significant to present a remarkable ORR electrocatalyst and to show the vital role of a second&#8208;sphere redox&#8208;active metal ion in promoting O2&#160;binding and activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells with Low&#8208;Optical&#8208;Loss Carbazolyl Interconnecting Layers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) and narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) perovskites with interconnecting layers (ICLs) to construct monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell is an effective way to achieve high power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, optical losses from ICLs need to be further reduced to leverage the full potential of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Here, metal oxide nanocrystal layers anchored with carbazolyl hole&#8208;selective&#8208;molecules (CHs), which exhibit much lower optical loss, is employed to replace poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT: PSS) as the hole transporting layers (HTLs) in lead&#8208;tin (Pb&#8208;Sn) perovskite sub&#8208;cells and ICLs in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Optically transparent indium tin oxide nanocrystals (ITO NCs) layers are employed to enhance anchoring of CHs, while a mixture of two CHs is adopted to tune the surface energy&#8208;levels of ITO NCs. The optimized mixed Pb&#8208;Sn NBG perovskite solar cells demonstrate a high PCE of 23.2%, with a high short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 33.5 mA cm&#8208;2. A high PCE of 28.1% is further obtained in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells, with the highest Jsc of 16.7 mA cm&#8208;2 to date. Encapsulated tandem solar cells maintain 90% of their reference point after 500 h of operation at the maximum power point (MPP) under 1&#8208;Sun illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;DNA&#160;Nanocomplexes Enhance&#160;Chemo&#8208;dynamic Therapy by Inhibiting Autophagy&#8208;Mediated Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: Chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy (CDT) based on the Fenton or Fenton&#8208;like reaction has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment. However, autophagy&#8208;mediated self&#8208;protection mechanisms of cancer cells pose a significant challenge to the efficacy of CDT. Herein, we developed metal&#8208;DNA nanocomplexes (DACs&#8208;Mn) to enhance CDT via DNAzyme inhibition of autophagy. Specifically, Mn&#8208;based catalyst in DACs&#8208;Mn was used to generate highly hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) that kill cancer cells, while the ATG5 DNAzyme incorporated into DACs&#8208;Mn inhibited the expression of autophagy&#8208;associated proteins, thereby improving the efficacy of CDT. By disrupting the self&#8208;protective pathway of cells under severe oxidative stress, this novel approach of DACs&#8208;Mn was found to synergistically enhance CDT in both in vitro and in vivo models, effectively amplifying tumor&#8208;specific oxidative damage. Notably, the Metal&#8208;DNA nanocomplexes can also induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), thereby inhibiting tumor metastasis. Specifically, in a bilateral tumor model in mice, the combined approach of CDT and autophagy inhibition followed by immune checkpoint blockade therapy shown significant potential as a novel and effective treatment modality for primary and metastatic tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Reaction Chemistry at Discrete Organometallic Fragments on Black Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular functionalization techniques are leveraged to anchor well&#8208;defined organometallic fragments on the surface of black phosphorus. The functionalized nanosheets feature a high density of metal sites, with discrete and robust M&#8722;P bonds that are stable to subsequent transformations. The Tolman electronic parameter and steric bulk of bP are also estimated relative to molecular phosphines.







Abstract
Black phosphorus (bP) is a two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals material unique in its potential to serve as a support for single&#8208;site catalysts due to its similarity to molecular phosphines, ligands quintessential in homogeneous catalysis. However, there is a scarcity of synthetic methods to install single metal centers on the bP lattice. Here, we demonstrate the functionalization of bP nanosheets with molecular Re and Mo complexes. A suite of characterization techniques, including infrared, X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy as well as scanning transmission electron microscopy corroborate that the functionalized nanosheets contain a high density of discrete metal centers directly bound to the bP surface. Moreover, the supported metal centers are chemically accessible and can undergo ligand exchange transformations without detaching from the surface. The steric and electronic properties of bP as a ligand are estimated with respect to molecular phosphines. Sterically, bP resembles tri(tolyl)phosphine when monodentate to a metal center, and bis(diphenylphosphino)propane when bidentate, whereas electronically bP is a &#963;&#8208;donor as strong as a trialkyl phosphine. This work is foundational in elucidating the nature of black phosphorus as a ligand and underscores the viability of using bP as a basis for single&#8208;site catalysts.

         <title>Polymer Multi&#8208;Block and Multi&#8208;Block+ Strategies for the Upcycling of Mixed Polyolefins and Other Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of multi&#8208;block copolymers with tunable microstructures were prepared and used as compatibilizer additives for upcycling mixtures of polyolefins with other plastics. Furthermore, a multi&#8208;block+ strategy based on a reactive telechelic block copolymer platform was demonstrated to enable block extension during in situ melt blending of mixed plastics, leading to better compatibilizing properties and 3D printing capability.







Abstract
Due to a continued rise in the production and use of plastic products, their end&#8208;of&#8208;life pollution has become a pressing global issue. One of the biggest challenges in plastics recycling is the separation of different polymers. Multi&#8208;block copolymers (MBCPs) represent an efficient strategy for the upcycling of mixed plastics via induced compatibilization, but this approach is limited by difficulties associated with synthesis and structural modification. In this contribution, several synthetic strategies are explored to prepare MBCPs with tunable microstructures, which were then used as compatibilizer additives to upcycle mixtures of polyolefins with other plastics. A multi&#8208;block+ strategy based on a reactive telechelic block copolymer platform was introduced, which enabled block extension during the in situ melt blending of mixed plastics, leading to better compatibilizing properties as well as better 3D printing capability. This strategy was also applicable to more complex ternary plastic blends. The polymer multi&#8208;block strategy enabled by versatile MBCPs synthesis and the multi&#8208;block+ strategy enabled by in situ block extension show exciting opportunities for the upcycling of mixed plastics.

         <title>Enhanced Gain in Organic Photodetectors Using the Polymer with Singlet Open&#8208;Shell Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of achieving high photoresponse and low dark or noise current with a fast response speed under a low bias in polymer photodetectors, this study demonstrates the potential of incorporating the polymer with singlet open&#8208;shell ground state in the active layer to enhance the performance of organic photodetectors.







Abstract
Photodetectors are critical components in intelligent optoelectronic systems, and photomultiplication&#8208;capable devices are essential for detecting weak optical signals. Despite significant advances, developing photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodetectors with high gain and low noise current simultaneously remains challenging. In this work, a new conjugated polymer PDN with singlet open&#8208;shell ground state is introduced in active layers for electron capture, and the corresponding PDN&#8208;based photodetectors exhibited an enhanced photoelectric gain and decreased dark current density at a low forward bias. At 1.5&#8197;V, the PDN&#8208;based ternary photodetector has the external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 2552.3&#8201;% and the specific detectivity of 1.4&#215;1014&#8197;Jones at 710&#8197;nm calculated by the measured noise current, with the gain 22&#8197;times higher than that of the control group. This study provides an approach for exploiting polymers with singlet open&#8208;shell ground state to enhance the gain of organic photodetectors.

         <title>Photosynthesis of Benzonitriles on BiOBr Nanosheets Promoted by Vacancy Associates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BiOBr photocatalysts with different surface vacancy associates were successfully synthesized. Vacancy associates of Br&#8722;Bi&#8722;Br triple atom vacancy (VBrBiBr) and oxygen vacancies can generate benzonitrile with high selectivity in the photocatalytic ammoxidation of benzyl alcohol by providing adsorption activation sites for NH3 and O2 and reaction sites for the multi&#8208;step formation of imine intermediates and oxidation to benzonitrile.







Abstract
Photocatalytic organic functionalization reactions represent a green, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainable synthesis route for value&#8208;added chemicals. However, heterogeneous photocatalysis is inefficient in directly activating ammonia molecules for the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added nitrogenous organic products when compared with oxygen activation in the formation of related oxygenated compounds. In this study, we report the heterogeneous photosynthesis of benzonitriles by the ammoxidation of benzyl alcohols (99&#8201;% conversion, 93&#8201;% selectivity) promoted using BiOBr nanosheets with surface vacancy associates. In contrast, the main reaction of catalysts with other types of vacancy sites is the oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde or benzoic acid. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations have demonstrated a specificity of vacancy type with respect to product selectivity, which arises from the adsorption and activation of NH3 and O2 that is required to promote subsequent C&#8722;N coupling and oxidation to nitrile. This study provides a better understanding of the role of vacancies as catalytic sites in heterogeneous photocatalysis.

         <title>Inside Cover: 2D Plasmonic Molecules via Hydrogen Bond Interaction between Polymer&#8208;Grafted Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D plasmonic molecules are constructed by hydrogen bond interaction between a donor&#8211;acceptor pair of polymer&#8208;grafted gold nanoparticles. As demonstrated in the Research Article (e202309798) by Yingying Cai and Philipp Vana, the weak yet multidentate hydrogen bonding allows a structural rearrangement from 3D to 2D when cast onto a substrate. Precise control of the coordination number is enabled by fine&#8208;tuning the interparticle interaction.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Aryl Shift and Double Alkyne Benzannulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
If the occupied position on the heterocyclic core is exceptionally electron&#8208;rich, alkyne benzannulation occurs at this position with concomitant 1,2&#8208;aryl shift. The resulting slightly curved N&#8208;doped nanographenes possess an unprecedented combination of six fused aromatic rings and strong emission of yellow light.







Abstract
The tandem intramolecular hydroarylation of alkynes accompanied by a 1,2&#8208;aryl shift is described. Harnessing the unique electron&#8208;rich character of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole scaffold, we demonstrate that the hydroarylation of alkynes proceeds at the already occupied positions&#8197;2 and 5 leading to a 1,2&#8208;aryl shift. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds only in the presence of cationic gold catalyst, and it leads to heretofore unknown &#960;&#8208;expanded, centrosymmetric pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles. The utility is verified in the preparation of 13&#8197;products that bear six conjugated rings. The observed compatibility with various functional groups allows for increased tunability with regard to the photophysical properties as well as providing sites for further functionalization. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism revealed that the formation of the six&#8208;membered rings accompanied with a 1,2&#8208;aryl shift is both kinetically and thermodynamically favourable over plausible formation of products containing 7&#8208;membered rings. Steady&#8208;state UV/Visible spectroscopy reveals that upon photoexcitation, the prepared S&#8208;shaped N&#8208;doped nanographenes undergo mostly radiative relaxation leading to large fluorescence quantum yields. Their optical properties are rationalized through time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations. We anticipate that this chemistry will empower the creation of new materials with various functionalities.
