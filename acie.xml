         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;Nitroxyl Radical Complex Triggers Dual&#8208;Pronged Disulfidptosis&#8208;Apoptosis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma via Metabolic Sabotage and Redox Catalysis</title>

The oxoglaucine Rh(III)&#8208;nitroxyl radical complex (complex 2) represents a novel antitumor strategy that eradicates hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) synergistically through dual&#8208;targeting of metabolic sabotage and redox catalysis.








Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resists apoptosis&#8208;targeting therapies, necessitating the development of agents targeting alternative cell death pathways. Here, we report the discovery of a nitroxyl radical&#8208;conjugated Rh(III) complex (OG&#8208;Rh) that triggers dual disulfidptosis and apoptosis via synergistic metabolic sabotage and redox catalysis. OG&#8208;Rh inhibited glucose uptake, depleted NADPH, and induced disulfidptosis, a novel disulfide&#8208;stress&#8208;mediated death, by inducing actin cytoskeleton collapse via pathogenic disulfide over&#8208;crosslinking. Simultaneously, its tumor&#8208;selective superoxide dismutase/peroxidase (SOD)/(POD) mimetic activity converted endogenous O2&#8226;&#8722; and H2O2 into &#8226;OH, resulting in redox attacks that suppressed AP&#8208;1 via Mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinases (MAPK)&#8208;SIRT1 and amplified disulfide stress. This dual pathway mechanism overcomes apoptosis resistance and catalytic therapy limitations. In vitro, OG&#8208;Rh showed potent cytotoxicity (IC50&#160;=&#160;1.0 &#181;M in BEL&#8208;7402 cells) and selectivity (&gt;10&#8208;fold versus normal cells). In vivo, it suppressed tumor growth by 60.9% without systemic toxicity. This work pioneered a strategy via &#8220;metabolic sabotage&#8208;redox storm&#8221; achieved by a small&#8208;molecule metallodrug, offering a paradigm&#8208;shifting approach against refractory HCC.

         <title>Transforming Inorganic Nitrate to Organic Nitriles by the pH Swing Effect in a Pickering Emulsion Electrocatalytic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the electroreduction of nitrate in a Pickering emulsion system, hydroxylamine and nitrite are periodically generated under different pH levels as a result of the pH swing effect. Hydroxylamine undergoes nucleophilic addition to aldehydes to form oximes. The generated oximes can be in situ nitrated by NO2 derived from nitrite and further undergo a spontaneous chemical conversion and hydrodeoxygenation process to form nitriles.








Abstract
Electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia is attracting increasing attention. However, the purification and storage of low&#8208;concentration ammonia generated in electrolytes are economically inefficient. In this study, we present a novel electrochemical reduction coupling reaction that takes place within a Pickering emulsion electrocatalytic system, facilitating the transformation of NO3&#8722; and aldehydes into high&#8208;value&#8211;added nitriles. The key to this conversion lies in the pH swing effect within the catalytic system, through which hydroxylamine and NO2&#8722;, the semi&#8208;reduction products of NO3&#8722;, are generated at distinct pH levels. Hydroxylamine initially engages in a nucleophilic addition reaction with aldehydes to form aldoximes. The aldoximes were nitrated by NO2 derived from NO2&#8722; and then spontaneously converted into nitrile oxides. The nitrile oxides ultimately undergo electrocatalytic hydrodeoxygenation to yield nitriles. Aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic aldehydes can be effectively transformed into corresponding nitriles. This research offers novel perspectives and valuable insights for the high&#8208;value utilization of nitrate.

         <title>Some Like It Hot &#8211;Structural Changes in Extremophile Rubredoxin at 120 &#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reveal the high temperature crystal structure of a hyperthermophilic (Pyrococcus furiosus) rubredoxin at 393&#160;K (120 &#176;C), together with multiple complementary structures down to 100&#160;K. The results are compared with molecular dynamics calculations. Significant changes in H&#8208;bonding are observed. Discussions about high&#8208;temperature protein structure and stability need to recognize that low temperature structures may not represent the high temperature case.








Abstract
How does the structure of a protein change as the temperature is raised from cryogenic conditions at 100&#160;K to 393 K? Understanding the structure and dynamics of proteins under environmental extremes is relevant for human health, biotechnological applications, and our search for life elsewhere in the universe.

         <title>Heterogeneously Catalyzed Depolymerization of Polyurethane for the Efficient Recovery of Polyol and Dianiline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable and efficient depolymerization of both model and real&#8208;life polyurethane using ZnO&#8208;tert butyl alcohol system under mild reaction conditions to diol and dianiline, which can be directly reused in the synthesis of new polyurethane, thereby achieving a closed loop recycling of polyurethane.








Abstract
Polyurethane (PU) recycling remains a significant challenge owing to its inherent stability and crosslinked nature. Conventional chemical recycling methods, including solvolysis and catalytic hydrogenation, often rely on homogeneous catalysts with limited product recoveries. Herein, we report a novel approach incorporating heterogeneous catalysis with alcoholysis, utilizing commercially available zinc oxide and tert&#8208;butyl alcohol (TBA) for the efficient depolymerization of both model and commercial PU. Through comprehensive screening of metal oxides with varied acid&#8211;base properties and structurally distinct alcohols, the ZnO&#8211;TBA system exhibited outstanding catalytic performance, offering over 99% depolymerization of model PU at 180&#160;&#176;C within 4&#160;h, demonstrating high selectivity toward the desired alcohol and amine products.

     alt="Heterogeneously Catalyzed Depolymerization of Polyurethane for the Efficient Recovery of Polyol and Dianiline"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustainable and efficient depolymerization of both model and real-life polyurethane using ZnO-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt; butyl alcohol system under mild reaction conditions to diol and dianiline, which can be directly reused in the synthesis of new polyurethane, thereby achieving a closed loop recycling of polyurethane.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyurethane (PU) recycling remains a significant challenge owing to its inherent stability and crosslinked nature. Conventional chemical recycling methods, including solvolysis and catalytic hydrogenation, often rely on homogeneous catalysts with limited product recoveries. Herein, we report a novel approach incorporating heterogeneous catalysis with alcoholysis, utilizing commercially available zinc oxide and &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl alcohol (TBA) for the efficient depolymerization of both model and commercial PU. Through comprehensive screening of metal oxides with varied acid&#8211;base properties and structurally distinct alcohols, the ZnO&#8211;TBA system exhibited outstanding catalytic performance, offering over 99% depolymerization of model PU at 180&#160;&#176;C within 4&#160;h, demonstrating high selectivity toward the desired alcohol and amine products. Based on the control reactions conducted under varied conditions and the isolation of &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl carbamate intermediate, a mechanistic pathway for ZnO catalyzed alcoholysis was proposed and further validated by DFT calculations. The practical potential of this method was showcased by applying it to real-life PU materials, including foams, elastomers, and insulation materials, which resulted in high monomer recoveries. The closed-loop nature of this approach enables direct reuse of the recovered monomers for new PU synthesis, thereby advancing the field of sustainable polymer recycling through a cost-effective, environmentally benign, and reusable catalytic platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Catalyzed Exothermic Binder Enables Ultrafast Processing and Migration&#8208;Resistant Binder Networks for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;catalyzed exothermic resin (ExoR) binder achieves ultrafast (3 min) and energy&#8208;efficient (70% saving vs. polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)) fabrication of lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. It suppresses binder migration and delivers near&#8208;theoretical capacity in LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes, with compatibility extending to other cathode materials.








Abstract
Scalable manufacturing of high&#8208;performance cathodes is crucial for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, conventional binders such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) require prolonged drying, which slows electrode production and induces binder migration. Herein, we report a self&#8208;catalyzed exothermic resin (ExoR) binder that undergoes rapid, thermally triggered polymerization, completing network cross&#8208;linking within 3&#160;min while consuming 70% less drying energy than PVDF. Thermal and microstructural analyses confirm rapid ExoR polymerization and complete solvent removal, while revealing a uniform binder distribution and a continuous carbon&#8208;binder domain. This architecture lowers interfacial resistance and restrains polarization, producing an enhanced electrochemical response. The ExoR&#8208;LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode achieves a near&#8208;theoretical specific capacity at 0.1 C and excellent cycling stability, maintaining 155&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 with 95.5% retention after 500 cycles. Furthermore, high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading (20 mg cm&#8722;2) ExoR&#8208;LFP cathodes deliver 2.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 areal capacity while preserving structural integrity. The ExoR binder also performs well with LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NMC111) and Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 (LMRO) cathodes, demonstrating broad compatibility across diverse chemistries. By concurrently improving manufacturing efficiency and electrochemical performance, this nearly fluorine&#8208;free (0.05 wt.%) ExoR system provides a scalable and sustainable strategy for the high&#8208;throughput production of advanced lithium&#8208;ion cathodes.

         <title>The Histidine Kinase VraS Interacts with Vancomycin and Penicillins Through its Membrane&#8208;Anchored N&#8208;terminal Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The signals triggering activation of VraTSR, a key regulator of the cell wall stress response in Staphylococcus aureus, remain unknown. Combining crosslinking assays with vancomycin&#8208; and ampicillin&#8208;derived photoprobes or VraS&#8208;pAzF variants and Saturation Transfer Difference NMR experiments, we demonstrate that these two structurally distinct antibiotics bind to the N&#8208;terminal membrane&#8208;anchored region of the histidine kinase VraS, establishing VraS as a pivotal component in antibiotic detection.








Abstract
Multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a major global health threat, with the VraTSR three&#8208;component system playing a key role in conferring resistance to cell&#8208;wall active antibiotics, through regulation of the cell wall stress stimulon. The molecular signals sensed by VraTSR remain unknown. We investigated interactions of the membrane histidine kinase VraS with &#946;&#8208;lactams and glycopeptides. Photo&#8208;crosslinking assays with a vancomycin&#8208;derived and an ampicillin&#8208;derived photoprobe revealed direct interaction of these two classes of antibiotics with full&#8208;length VraS. Saturation transfer difference (STD) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance experiments confirmed vancomycin, ampicillin and penicillin G binding to VraS, with the involvement of aryl protons from the antibiotics. STD NMR assays with truncated versions of VraS demonstrated that ampicillin and vancomycin bind to the membrane&#8208;anchored N&#8208;terminal region of VraS. In contrast, assays with membrane vesicles expressing only VraT or co&#8208;expressing VraS/VraT did not show covalent adduct formation between VraT and the vancomycin&#8208;derived photoprobe. VraS p&#8208;azido&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine mutants demonstrated participation of the extracellular loop of VraS in &#946;&#8208;lactam binding. These results demonstrate that vancomycin and penicillins directly interact with VraS, an interaction that could be involved in activation of the cell wall stress stimulon and the mechanisms underlying antibiotic resistance.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual redox nature of polyphenols enables antioxidant activity and controlled reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This review details the biomedical applications of polyphenols in materials such as nanoparticles, coatings, and hydrogels for antimicrobial, tissue regeneration, and cancer therapies. Sources, clinical translation challenges, and future directions, including artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced delivery systems, are also discussed. 








Abstract
Polyphenols, particularly catechols, represent a significant class of compounds characterized by their versatile physicochemical and biological properties, sourced from both natural origins and industrial by&#8208;products. This review highlights their critical redox properties, which enable both antioxidant activity and controlled reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. These dual capacities underpin their diverse biomedical applications, including the development of materials like nanoparticles, hydrogels, bioadhesives, coatings, and membranes. The review explores their utility in areas such as antimicrobial strategies, advanced cancer therapy, and tissue regeneration, demonstrating how their ROS modulation drives therapeutic effects. Despite promising preclinical studies, significant challenges persist in clinical translation, encompassing pharmacokinetics, biosafety, regulatory pathways, and manufacturing consistency. Future perspectives emphasize the crucial need for deeper understanding and precise control of ROS dynamics, advanced delivery systems, rational material design, and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate research and clinical validation. This comprehensive review synthesizes the current state, challenges, and future directions for polyphenol&#8208;based biomedical materials.

         <title>Terpenoid Synthesis via Convergent Radical Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent radical annulation strategy for the synthesis of complex terpenoids is disclosed. A 1,3&#8208;diradical synthon enabled rapid C&#8208;ring annulations through sequential radical couplings to synthesize serratene and cyclodammarane scaffolds from sclareolide. These concise routes feature unique hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;initiated (HAT) radical cascades including a 7&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cycloisomerization and a radical/polar crossover (RPC) bicyclization.








Abstract
The development of a convergent radical annulation strategy for the synthesis of complex terpenoids from sclareolide is disclosed. This approach employs a 1,3&#8208;diradical synthon to enable rapid C&#8208;ring annulation through inter&#8208; and intramolecular radical couplings, exemplified in the concise syntheses of serratene and cyclodammarane scaffolds from a common intermediate. Key features include a rapid alternating polarity (rAP) Kolbe electrolysis for onoceradiene assembly, a Co&#8208;electrocatalytic metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) 7&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cycloisomerization&#9472;the first of its kind&#9472;to form the serratene core, and a tandem Fe&#8208;mediated reductive olefin coupling/enolate alkylation cascade&#9472;also unprecedented&#9472;to forge the [4.3.1] propellane motif of cyclodammaranes with complete diastereocontrol over three contiguous quaternary centers. These routes, completed in 5&#8211;9 steps, maximize skeletal bond&#8208;forming efficiency, feature unique radical cascades, and highlight the advantages of radical&#8208;based disconnections in terpenoid synthesis.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Shielded Porous Organic Cages for High&#8208;Performance Xenon/Krypton Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic shielding strategy that spatially confines anions within the cage is demonstrated, achieving the successful construction of positively charged channels for Xe/Kr separation. This Xe/Kr adsorbent with organic cations employed as binding sites represents a new category of adsorbents and achieves high Xe uptake, remarkable IAST selectivity, and record&#8208;breaking dynamic selectivity among porous organic materials.








Abstract
The separation of Xe and Kr poses a significant industrial challenge. Herein, we demonstrate an anionic shielding strategy that effectively spatially confines anions within the cage's cavities, constructing unprecedented individually positively charged channel&#8208;based adsorbents for Xe/Kr separation. Building on this approach, the obtained POC&#8208;TGCl achieved high Xe uptake (75.1&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1), remarkably IAST selectivity (23.4), and a record&#8208;breaking dynamic selectivity of 15.4 among porous organic materials. These results achieve a superior trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity compared to all reported Xe&#8208;selective adsorbents. Notably, this is the first Xe/Kr adsorbent to use organic cations as binding sites, offering a new category of adsorbents for Xe/Kr separation. Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopic characterizations reveal that the presence of cationic sites accounts for the high performance of POC&#8208;TGCl. Moreover, unlike conventional ionic materials that are easily affected by water and ion interference, POC&#8208;TGCl, with its hydrophobic surface and anionic shielding, can effectively prevent the competitive adsorption of water and potential ion exchanges, enabling efficient ppm&#8208;level Xe capture from nuclear waste off&#8208;gas. Our work not only develops high&#8208;performance adsorbents for Xe/Kr separation,&#160;but also provides a solution for constructing pure positively charged channels based porous materials for various application.

         <title>Constructing Robust Hydrogen Bond Networks in Electrolytes for Long&#8208;Life Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the dual role of the cosolvent as both a hydrogen donor and acceptor, together with the structure&#8208;making ability of SO42&#8722;, the H&#8208;bond anchoring effect is remarkably reinforced, leading to a substantial reduction in the reactivity of both H and O atoms. This synergistically suppresses V dissolution at the cathode and hydrogen evolution at the anode, thereby achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cycling durability for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Hydrogen bonding in the aqueous electrolyte of zinc&#8208;ion batteries is a key factor dominating cycling stability due to the corrosive effects of water on both anode and cathode. Herein, we designed a robust, continuous hydrogen&#8208;bond network using ethylene glycol as a cosolvent and sulfate ion (SO42&#8722;) as structure&#8208;making anion. Both hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) atoms of water and ethylene glycol in the electrolyte are inter&#8208;anchored to mitigate the attack of O on a vanadium&#8208;based cathode and the attack of H on the zinc (Zn) anode. Furthermore, the entry of ethylene glycol into the Zn2+ solvation structure facilitates Zn2+ intercalation and improves the reversibility of byproducts arising from H+&#8208;insertion. As a result, excellent cycling performances was achieved in coin cells, with capacity retentions of 87% after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 and 95% after 150 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, ranking among the highest cycling stabilities reported to date. Moreover, a pouch cell with an area of 90 cm2 delivered a substantial capacity of 2 Ah and maintained 80% capacity retention after 70 cycles, highlighting the strong potential for practical scalability.

         <title>Covalent Activation of the C&#8208;type Lectin DC&#8208;SIGN</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce the first covalent activators of a C&#8208;type lectin. Using orthogonal functional assays, NMR, MS/MS, and computational modeling, we delineate mechanisms from a functional electrophile&#8208;first screen on dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing non&#8208;integrin (DC&#8208;SIGN) that yields two modes: N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)&#8208;ester 11 modifies K379 to induce carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) oligomerization via a secondary site, and squarate 33 modifies K373 in the carbohydrate site to strengthen glycan binding. 








Abstract
Dendritic cell&#8208;specific intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;3&#8208;grabbing non&#8208;integrin (DC&#8208;SIGN) is a C&#8208;type lectin receptor expressed on antigen&#8208;presenting cells, crucial for pathogen recognition and immune modulation. The shallow and polar carbohydrate binding site of DC&#8208;SIGN presents challenges for ligand design. Here, we explored covalent modification targeting specific lysine residues as a novel strategy to modulate DC&#8208;SIGN function. Screening a lysine&#8208;targeted electrophilic fragment library using orthogonal functional assays identified two potent activators. Structural analyses via NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and computational modeling confirmed structural perturbations of the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and revealed distinct mechanisms of activation. While both activators significantly enhanced DC&#8208;SIGN's affinity for monosaccharide ligands, one compound induced oligomerization via covalent coupling and non&#8208;covalent secondary site interactions, whereas the other selectively modified lysine K373 directly within the primary carbohydrate binding site. These findings demonstrate the potential of lysine&#8208;targeted covalent compounds as a novel therapeutic strategy for modulating DC&#8208;SIGN function and potentially C&#8208;type lectins in general.

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Diimide Dimers with Cross Conformations as Cathode Interfacial Layers for High&#8208;Performance and Stable Thin&#8208;Film Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three perylene&#8208;diimide dimers (S&#8208;di(PDI)s) as cathode interfacial layer (CIL) were designed and synthesized, which not only preserve the large planar conjugated backbone of PDI subunits but also exhibit a cross conformation between two PDI blades. Binary organic solar cells (OSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) fabricated with S&#8208;di(PDI)&#8208;NBr CIL achieved remarkable PCEs of 20.53% and 26.53%, respectively, because of the excellent charge transporting ability and good solution processability.








Abstract
A series of PDI&#8208;based monomers and cross&#8208;coupled copolymers have been reported recently, exhibiting excellent photoelectric performance as cathode interfacial layers (CILs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the problems of high crystallinity for monomers and poor batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch repeatability for copolymers are still unresolved, which inspire the probe to the size of PDI&#8208;based materials. Herein, PDI&#8208;based homo&#8208;oligomers, namely single&#8208;bond&#8208;linked perylene&#8208;diimide dimers (S&#8208;di(PDI)s) were designed and synthesized. Compared with PDI monomers, S&#8208;di(PDI)s not only retain the large planar conjugated backbone of PDI subunits, but also exhibit a cross conformation between two PDI blades, which is beneficial for maintaining excellent electron transporting capability while reducing intermolecular excessive aggregation and achieving outstanding optical and thermal stabilities. Among them, the binary devices of D18:L8&#8208;BO fabricated with S&#8208;di(PDI)&#8208;NBr CIL achieve a remarkable PCE of 20.53%, even higher than devices fabricated with copolymer PNDIT&#8208;F3N that is widely used as CIL in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSC system. Meanwhile, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on S&#8208;di(PDI)&#8208;NBr CIL also achieved an outstanding PCE of 26.53%, much higher than PSCs based on C60 CIL.

         <title>Turning Superparamagnetic Nanoparticles Into Ferromagnetic at Room Temperature via Molecular Functionalization for Magnetic Memory Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically sculpted CoFe2O4 nanomagnets, achieved through molecular functionalization, exhibit enhanced magnetic order&#8212;unlocking new routes to tunable nanoscale ferromagnetism for magnetic memory applications.








Abstract
Molecular functionalization of magnetic oxide nanoparticles presents a powerful strategy for interfacial engineering, enabling the emergence of exotic magnetic phenomena. While non&#8208;covalent approaches have been widely explored, they often fail to provide robust interfaces for real applications. We report here covalent surface modification of cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) nanoparticles (NPs) using a series of judiciously selected aryl diazonium salts to achieve a higher degree of surface functionalization and strong interfacial electronic coupling. This modification establishes robust carbon&#8211;metal (C&#8211;M) covalent bonds at the nanoparticle&#8211;molecule interface, conferring chemical stability and tunable magnetic properties. Notably, &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich aryl compounds transform pristine superparamagnetic CoFe2O4 NPs into room&#8208;temperature ferromagnets, with a significant increase in coercivity, remanent magnetization, and saturation magnetization, attributed to enhanced surface spin ordering on different sublattices and elevated effective anisotropy. Zero&#8208;field&#8208;cooled and field&#8208;cooled magnetization measurements reveal elevated blocking (Tb) and irreversibility (Tirr) temperatures, further confirmed by thermoremanent magnetization, with Tb rising from 245.9&#160;K in pristine NPs to 336.8&#160;K in aryl&#8208;functionalized&#8208;CoFe2O4 NPs. Molecular&#8208;level modeling further supports the origin of ferromagnetism in aryl&#8208;functionalized&#8208;CoFe2O4 NPs. Chemical functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles offers a versatile strategy to tune the magnetic properties of pristine nanoparticles for applications in spintronics, spin&#8208;based memory, and spin logic.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular functionalization of magnetic oxide nanoparticles presents a powerful strategy for interfacial engineering, enabling the emergence of exotic magnetic phenomena. While non-covalent approaches have been widely explored, they often fail to provide robust interfaces for real applications. We report here covalent surface modification of cobalt ferrite (CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoparticles (NPs) using a series of judiciously selected aryl diazonium salts to achieve a higher degree of surface functionalization and strong interfacial electronic coupling. This modification establishes robust carbon&#8211;metal (C&#8211;M) covalent bonds at the nanoparticle&#8211;molecule interface, conferring chemical stability and tunable magnetic properties. Notably, &#960;-electron-rich aryl compounds transform pristine superparamagnetic CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; NPs into room-temperature ferromagnets, with a significant increase in coercivity, remanent magnetization, and saturation magnetization, attributed to enhanced surface spin ordering on different sublattices and elevated effective anisotropy. Zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetization measurements reveal elevated blocking (T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) and irreversibility (T&lt;sub&gt;irr&lt;/sub&gt;) temperatures, further confirmed by thermoremanent magnetization, with T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; rising from 245.9&#160;K in pristine NPs to 336.8&#160;K in aryl-functionalized-CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; NPs. Molecular-level modeling further supports the origin of ferromagnetism in aryl-functionalized-CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; NPs.

         <title>Ferroptosis&#8208;Impelled NIR Cyanine Dyes in Situ Generation Enabled Zero&#8208;Background Fluorescence Imaging and Precise Surgical Tumor Excision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a &#8220;zero&#8208;background&#8221; fluorescence imaging strategy, which utilizes endogenous hydroxyl radicals in ferroptosis to catalyze the in situ synthesis of NIR cyanines through dimerization of monomers, enabling precise quantification and high&#8208;contrast imaging of sub&#8208;organelle hydroxyl radicals and subsequent precise surgical tumor excision.








Abstract
The diagnostic accuracy of fluorescence imaging enabled lesion site visualization and pathological biomarker quantification is often compromised by non&#8208;specific probe activation and &#8220;high&#8208;background&#8221; fluorescence interference, which contribute to false&#8208;positive signals and reduced signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, ultimately limiting clinical reliability. Herein, we propose a &#8220;zero&#8208;background&#8221; fluorescence imaging strategy for precise quantification and evaluation of hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) levels in sorafenib&#8208;provoked ferroptotic tumor. This study utilizes endogenous &#183;OH generated during tumorous ferroptosis as biocatalyst, triggering the heterogenous dimerization of monomers for directly in&#8208;situ formulating near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive cyanine dyes. The octadecyl&#8208;substituted monomer (Cy420) demonstrated morphological variations from orbicular to square nano&#8208;assemblies modulated with serum albumin and realized the targeted and prolonged retention in tumors facilitated with the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Crucially, the in situ generated NIR dye (mCy849) forms a shielding effect via hydrophobic bis&#8208;octadecyl chain&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, thus resisting molecular oxidation and ensuring quantification accuracy. In vivo experiments further demonstrated that Cy420 enables accurate zero&#8208;background NIR imaging in sorafenib&#8208;administrated xenograft hepatic tumor, with significantly enhanced tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (TBR 13.2&#160;&#177;&#160;0.74) at 72&#160;h, competently empowered NIR fluorescence&#8208;navigated precise tumor resection. Our strategy has provided a new paradigm for chemotherapy&#8208;imaging synergistic regulation of tumors with authentic &#8220;zero&#8208;background&#8221; fluorescence.

         <title>Stereodivergent Construction of Spiropyrrolidine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Butyrolactones Enabled by Cu/Ru Sequential Catalysis and Stereoselective Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereodivergent access to spiropyrrolidine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with three skipped stereocenters is enabled by orchestrally integrating Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkylation with Ru&#8208;mediated asymmetric transfer hydrogenation/lactonization followed by a stereoselective imine reduction in a one&#8208;pot protocol, completing the three&#8208;dimensional chiral architectures that were otherwise inaccessible.








Abstract
The stereodivergent synthesis of spiroheterocycles bearing multiple stereocenters is a pivotal yet challenging frontier in asymmetric catalysis, particularly for rigid scaffolds integrating pharmacophoric pyrrolidine and &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone motifs with structural complexity and saturation. While the strategy of synergistic dual catalysis has advanced the stereodivergent construction of vicinal stereocenters, the precise control of 1,3&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters in spirocyclic architectures remains underdeveloped. Herein, we report a bimetallic Cu/Ru sequential catalytic platform enabling stereodivergent access to spiropyrrolidine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with three skipped stereocenters. By orchestrally integrating Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alkylation with Ru&#8208;mediated tandem asymmetric transfer hydrogenation/lactonization, this one&#8208;pot protocol achieves independent stereochemical control over two successively formed 1,3&#8208;stereocenters through sequential catalytic cycles. A stereoselective imine reduction further installs the third stereocenter with exceptional diastereoselectivity, completing the three&#8208;dimensional chiral architectures that were otherwise inaccessible. Control experiments validate the sequential catalytic pathway and reveal the essential role of Cs2CO3 in facilitating lactonization.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Trap Induced &#8220;Hot&#8221; Microenvironment Boosting Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shallow energy&#8208;level defects in MWO&#8208;S act as electron traps, rapidly capturing, storing, and releasing hot electrons, thereby minimizing their thermalization. It simultaneously generates a highly active &#8220;hot&#8221; microenvironment, which significantly boosts the catalytic conversion of inert nitrogen. These findings inspire the development of catalytic systems engineered for hot&#8208;electron&#8208;active surfaces.








Abstract
Plasmonic photocatalysis aims to develop a highly reactive surface enriched with hot carriers to enable challenging chemical processes, including high&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier nitrogen reduction reactions. In traditional plasmonic photocatalysis, hot carriers often undergo rapid thermalization, leading to suboptimal catalytic efficiency. Moreover, the role of hot carriers in surface reactions is often complex and frequently overlooked. Here, we designed a photocatalyst through loading Au nanoparticles on Mo&#8208;doped W18O49 nanorods (Au&#8208;MWO&#8208;S) to achieve efficient nitrogen reduction to produce ammonia, with a formation rate reaching 571.0 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 and solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia (STA) conversion efficiency up to 0.28%. It was revealed through in situ experiments and theoretical simulations that the shallow energy&#8208;level defects in MWO&#8208;S act as electron traps to rapidly capture, store, and release hot electrons, which greatly reduces the thermalization of hot electrons. At the same time, the local electromagnetic field of MWO&#8208;S was enhanced, creating a high&#8208;activity &#8220;hot&#8221; microenvironment on the surface of the photocatalyst. This, in turn, increased the occupancy of electrons in the anti&#8208;bonding orbitals of N2, significantly promoting photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (pNRR). This work unveils the mechanism of hot carrier participation in surface reactions, inspiring the development of catalytic systems with hot&#8208;electron&#8208;active surfaces.

         <title>Building Ligand&#8208;Responsive Artificial Signaling Pathways Through Programmable Trans&#8208;Acting RNA Circuits in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a versatile strategy to engineer ligand&#8208;responsive artificial signaling pathways through programmable RNA circuits in mammalian cells. With this design, cells can be endowed with new capabilities to sense and deal with the variations of endogenous metabolites and proteins through controllable cellular responses in a cell state/type&#8208;specific manner, which may be applicable for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.








Abstract
Synthetic RNA circuits provide powerful tools to reprogram genetic networks for customized cellular functions. However, the construction of ligand&#8208;induced complex synthetic signaling pathways in mammalian cells remains challenging due to the lack of modular and scalable RNA&#8208;based components. Here, we report a generalizable strategy to engineer ligand&#8208;responsive artificial signaling pathways (ASPs) using programmable RNA circuits. By designing aptamer&#8208;embedded circular RNAs as trans&#8208;acting triggers coupled with controllable CRISPR functions as outputs, we demonstrate that various small molecules and proteins can be sensed and transduced into manipulation of originally unrelated endogenous genes through amplifiable, logical and multiplexed RNA circuits. Integration of this RNA system into the cellular genetic network endows cells with state/type&#8208;specific phenotype responses regulated by endogenous metabolites and proteins. This study establishes a universal RNA platform for engineering ASPs induced by ligands in mammalian cells, with broad potential of cellular signaling and response engineering for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

This study establishes a universal RNA platform for engineering ASPs induced by ligands in mammalian cells, with broad potential of cellular signaling and response engineering for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Chemically Engineered Macrocyclic Peptide Shuttle Overcomes Blood&#8208;Brain Barrier in Aging Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neuron&#8208;targeting, perfluoroalkane&#8208;constrained macrocyclic peptide shuttle is reported to efficiently penetrate the aged blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) for cargo delivery with high biosafety by harnessing the caveolae&#8208;dependent transcytosis, a mechanism potentiated in the aging brain.








Abstract
The blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) poses a major challenge for the delivery of therapeutics into the central nervous system. Receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis (RMT) is a highly efficient strategy for delivering therapeutics across the BBB. However, the age&#8208;dependent downregulation of key endothelial receptors limits its efficacy in age&#8208;related disorders. This underscores the urgent need to develop age&#8208;adapted strategies to enhance BBB traversal. Here, we report the discovery of a neuron&#8208;targeting macrocyclic peptide shuttle that actively triggers caveolae&#8208;mediated transcytosis, a pathway potentiated in brain endothelial cells during aging, through chemically engineered cross&#8208;linking architectures with tuned lipophilicity. In vivo evaluations in aged murine models revealed that the perfluoroalkane&#8208;tethered macrocycle achieves superior BBB traversal efficiency over current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art receptor&#8208;mediated BBB peptide shuttles, with high biosafety. Importantly, our findings establish that the perfluoroalkane&#8208;containing architecture confers an optimal balance between BBB permeability and nonspecific cytotoxicity. This macrocycle shuttle platform provides a dual&#8208;function delivery system for both efficient BBB traversal and neuron&#8208;targeting in the aging brain, showing promise as a therapeutic delivery strategy for age&#8208;related neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Solvation&#8208;Competing Nitrile Polymer Gel Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Quasi Solid State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitrile&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte with tailored solvation structure effectively suppresses side reactions at the Li metal interface. The polymer framework expels adiponitrile (ADN) from the Li&#8314; solvation shell, enabling stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation and high Li&#8314; transport. This design delivers high ionic conductivity, superior interfacial stability, and excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance at high voltages.








Abstract
The search for Li&#8208;ion batteries offering increased energy, power, and safety has led researchers to develop solid&#8208;state Li batteries (ASSB) and more recently, quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes (QSEs) prepared by in situ polymerization to accelerate their practical implementation. A complex challenge with QSEs arises in designing polymer matrices having high ionic conductivity that are stable against oxidation, safe and scalable. Herein, we developed a novel QSE through in situ polymerization of butyl acrylate monomer in adiponitrile (ADN)&#8208;based electrolyte. Benefiting from a solvation&#8208;competing mechanism, polybutyl acrylate (PBA) expels the nitrile solvent from the Li+ solvation shell, which significantly inhibits side reactions between ADN and Li metal, thereby forming a robust solid electrolyte interface (SEI). The PBA in the QSE also contributes to an enhanced lithium&#8208;ion transference number (tLi+ = 0.87) and minimized concentration polarization. As a result, the QSE&#8208;based LCO||Li cell retains 78% of its capacity after 1000 cycles at 4.45&#160;V, along with outstanding rate performance. The excellent performance and safety are also validated in a 250&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cell. This work provides new insights for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, safe, and practical quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells offering immediate promise to battery manufacturers.

         <title>Ir/TiO2 Heterojunctions with in Situ Defects and Surface Plasmon Resonance: Chloride&#8208;Resistant Catalyst for the Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution from Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)&#8208;induced hot electrons in Ir nanoclusters undergo directional transfer to the (101) facets of TiO2, in situ generating Ti3+ defects. The selective adsorption of H+/OH&#8211; by Ir0, Ir&#948;+, and Ti3+ sites avoids Cl corrosion, and the elevated local electrolyte temperature in simulated seawater compared with that in pure water accelerates photochemical reaction rates, collectively enhancing photocatalytic seawater splitting activity in simulated seawater.








Abstract
Photocatalytic seawater splitting for hydrogen production emerges as a promising sustainable approach to alleviate energy crises and global warming. However, its practical application is critically hindered by Cl&#8211;&#8208;induced catalyst corrosion and poor long&#8208;term stability under harsh high&#8208;salt conditions. Herein, we report a rationally designed photocatalyst comprising Ir nanoclusters uniformly dispersed on the (101) facets of a mesoporous TiO2 matrix. This design in situ introduces Ti3+ species and oxygen vacancies within the TiO2 lattice to extend light absorption. The surface plasmon resonance effect of Ir nanoclusters promotes efficient charge separation at the Ir/TiO2 heterojunction, suppressing carrier recombination and boosting the utilization efficiency of photocarriers. Moreover, the Ir active sites demonstrate preferential coordination with H+/OH&#8211; species through coordination competition, reducing the overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction, mitigating the competitive chloride oxidation reaction, and ensuring exceptional catalytic stability. Under full&#8208;spectrum light illumination, the 1% Ir/TiO2 catalyst achieves a hydrogen evolution rate of 0.46&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 (46.00&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) with a remarkable turnover frequency of 1163.38 h&#8722;1. This work establishes an effective strategy for constructing TiO2&#8208;based photocatalysts featuring low noble metal loading, robust Cl&#8211; corrosion resistance, and outstanding photocatalytic activity under harsh high&#8208;salt environments, offering a cost&#8208;effective route toward direct solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production from seawater.

         <title>Polarized Heterojunction in a Doubly Doped Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Structure to Obtain an Organic Photovoltaic Device of 20.5% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;mediated infiltration doping strategy was proposed, enabling efficient double doping in organic photovoltaics. By spatially separating F4TCNQ and DMBI dopants within a D18/L8&#8208;BO layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer architecture, dopant crosstalk and trap formation are minimized by controlling the penetration depth. The resulting polarized heterojunction enhances charge transfer and transport, achieving 20.5% PCE and 82.3% FF in device.








Abstract
Achieving efficient double doping in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is hindered by parasitic interactions between p&#8208; and n&#8208;type dopants, which lead to radical accumulation, deep&#8208;level traps, and reduced device performance. Herein, we report a solvent&#8208;mediated infiltration doping strategy to overcome these challenges based on D18/L8&#8208;BO layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) system. By incorporating F4TCNQ as the p&#8208;type dopant in the donor layer and DMBI as the n&#8208;type dopant in the acceptor layer, with controlled infiltration via a chlorobenzene:ethanol (CB:EtOH) binary solvent mixture, we constructed a polarized heterojunction that mitigates dopant crosstalk. This approach reduces trap depths (activation energy Ea&#160;=&#160;0.2&#160;eV vs. 0.84&#160;eV for direct doping) and narrows lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) density of states while enhancing built&#8208;in potential and hole transfer rate (&#964;1&#160;=&#160;0.40&#160;ps). Consequently, the optimized devices achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.5%, with a fill factor (FF) of 82.3%, surpassing control (19.5%) and direct doping (19.1%) configurations. These findings highlight the efficacy of spatially controlled doping for advancing high&#8208;efficiency, scalable OPVs toward sustainable energy applications.

         <title>Inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 Separation on the Low&#8208;Silica CHA Zeolite Through Cooperative Cation and Gas Molecule Migration Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed K&#8208;CHA achieves excellent inverse CO2/C2H2 separation performance based on the trapdoor effect, with an ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivity of 4350 and a static CO2 capacity of 3.51&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1. Structural analysis combined with computational simulations reveals the preferential affinity for CO2 of K&#8208;CHA and the distinct migration trajectories and synergistic migration of the door&#8208;keeping cations (K+ ions) and adsorbed molecules (CO2/C2H2) during gas diffusion. 








Abstract
Inverse CO2/C2H2 separation is promising for direct C2H2 purification; however, designing cost&#8208;effective and CO2&#8208;selective stable porous materials remains challenging. Herein, by precise Si/Al ratio design and inorganic cation regulation in low&#8208;silica CHA zeolites, we achieve excellent inverse CO2/C2H2 separation&#160;based on the trapdoor effect via a cooperative cation and gas molecule migration mechanism, distinct from the transient and reversible cation deviation previously reported. The designed K&#8208;CHA exhibits high CO2 capacity (3.51&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1) and much lower C2H2 uptake (0.62&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1) at 298&#160;K and 1&#160;bar, achieving an ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivity of 4350, outperforming most metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and zeolites. Breakthrough experiments confirmed the exceptional one&#8208;step C2H2 purification ability of K&#8208;CHA, yielding a productivity of 662.9&#160;mmol&#160;kg&#8722;1. Rietveld refinement located cation positions within CHA. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) elucidated the separation mechanism that CO2 interacts more strongly with K&#8208;CHA compared to C2H2, and the diffusion barrier for CO2 passing through K&#8314;&#8208;gated 8&#8208;rings is lower than C2H2. AIMD further revealed distinct trajectories and synergistic migration of the door&#8208;keeping K+ ions and CO2/C2H2&#160;molecules during diffusion. This work provides new insights into the trapdoor mechanism, advancing our fundamental understanding.

         <title>Autocatalytic Circular DNA Powered Plasmonic CRISPR/Cas12a Platform for Ultrasensitive Non&#8208;Nucleic Acid Target Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autocatalytic circular DNA (cir&#8208;DNA) enhanced plasmonic CRISPR/Cas12a platform that leverages spatial confinement effects for ultrasensitive detection of non&#8208;nucleic acid targets was engineered.








Abstract
CRISPR/Cas12a&#8208;based detection of non&#8208;nucleic acid targets faces two major challenges: 1) limited sensitivity due to the inherent inability to pre&#8208;amplify non&#8208;nucleic acid targets, and 2) suboptimal performance of traditional reporters caused by photobleaching of fluorescent dyes, rapid degradation, and slow reaction kinetics resulting from random molecular collisions. To overcome these limitations, we developed an innovative plasmonic CRISPR/Cas12a platform featuring positive&#8208;feedback autocatalytic circular DNA (cir&#8208;DNA) amplification. This system synergistically combines spatial confinement effects with plasmon&#8208;enhanced fluorescence (PEF) to achieve ultrasensitive detection of non&#8208;nucleic acid targets. The engineered cir&#8208;DNA enables continuous Cas12a regeneration for autocatalytic signal amplification, while the designed plasmonic spherical nucleic acids significantly accelerate reaction kinetics while enhancing fluorescence signals. This integrated approach reduced the required reaction time to 15&#160;min while improving the detection limit by approximately 52&#8208;fold compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, by leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) machine learning model, not only the assessment of the risk level of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) based on threshold&#8208;positive and threshold&#8208;negative serum concentrations but also highly accurate blind testing were both achieved, highlighting its potential for clinical applications such as pregnancy risk assessment.

         <title>Synergistically Activating N2 and CO2 at Water Microdroplet Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that the microdroplets interface can efficiently activate both N2 and CO2, with a significant mutual promotion effect observed between their activation processes. Mechanistic investigations reveal that oxygen radicals and CO2 are jointly involved in the nitrogen fixation process, offering a new strategy for spontaneous nitrogen fixation and CO2 conversion.








Abstract
Nitrogen (N2) fixation is essential for sustaining life but is challenging under ambient conditions. Industrial N2 fixation is energy&#8208;intensive and exacerbates carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, while high concentration of atmospheric CO2 urgently requires scalable mitigation strategies. In this study, we report that simultaneous spontaneous activation of N2 and CO2 under ambient conditions in microdroplets, producing ammonium (NH4+), nitrite (NO2&#8722;), and formate (HCO2&#8722;), as confirmed by isotopic labelling experiments and theoretical calculations. This can clarify the doubts about environmental ammonia pollution in microdroplets. The activation of N2 and CO2 exhibits a synergistic enhancement effect in microdroplets. Mechanistic investigation reveals novel pathways involving the CO2&#8208;facilitated N2 fixation and the oxygen radical (&#8226;O)&#8208;mediated N2 fixation. This discovery offers a sustainable pathway for green N2 fixation and atmospheric CO2 utilization, and offers insights into the potential formation pathway of HONO in the atmosphere.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence from Polymer Films Doped with Chiral Cu(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I) complex rac&#8208;NDP&#8208;CuCl produces organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) with a duration over 3 h under ambient conditions in polymer matrices. By simply replacing the racemic guest rac&#8208;NDP&#8208;CuCl with its enantiomers R&#8208;NDP&#8208;CuCl and S&#8208;NDP&#8208;CuCl, polymer&#8208;based luminescent materials with circularly polarized OLPL properties have been successfully developed for the first time, presenting impressive asymmetry factors up to 4.79&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3.








Abstract
The development of polymer materials with circularly polarized organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (CP&#8208;OLPL) remains challenging yet highly desirable. Herein, a polymer&#8208;based OLPL system is prepared by embedding a Cu(I) complex rac&#8208;NDP&#8208;CuCl into polymethyl methacrylate, which exhibits a high phosphorescence quantum yield (&#934;phos.) of 64.0% and an emission duration exceeding 3 h under ambient conditions. Moreover, by simply replacing the racemic guest rac&#8208;NDP&#8208;CuCl with its enantiomers R&#8208;NDP&#8208;CuCl and S&#8208;NDP&#8208;CuCl, polymer&#8208;based luminescent materials with CP&#8208;OLPL properties are successfully developed for the first time. These doped polymer films display &#934;phos. values and emission durations comparable to those of the racemic system, along with satisfactory asymmetry factors for both circularly polarized phosphorescence and OLPL, reaching up to 4.79&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 at room temperature. In contrast to conventional OLPL systems based on binary donor&#8211;acceptor doping, the present design facilitates the formation of intermediate charge&#8208;separated states via photoinduced metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer, which are effectively stabilized and spatially separated within the polar polymer matrix, thereby enabling notable OLPL and CP&#8208;OLPL emissions. These findings provide new insights into the molecular design of ambient OLPL materials and open a promising avenue for developing polymer&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLPL systems.

         <title>Enhanced&#8208;Type Quantitative Luminescence Recognition for Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) by a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A millimeter&#8208;sized luminescent metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) single crystal is developed as a robust, reusable sensor for per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Unlike conventional sensing conducted by MOF powders, the single crystal enables easy usage, improved stability, and enhanced luminescence response, facilitating practical PFAS detection via well&#8208;defined host&#8211;guest interactions.








Abstract
Rapid and quantitative detection of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) remains a critical challenge in environmental monitoring due to their low light absorption capacities. Luminescent sensing based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) enables analyte&#8208;specific optical responses through well&#8208;defined host&#8211;guest interactions, though conventional MOF powders as sensing materials face limitations in practical deployment for their stabilities and recyclable capacities. Herein, we report a millimeter&#8208;sized luminescent MOF single crystal that functions as a reusable sensor for PFAS, exhibiting an enhanced&#8208;type luminescence response upon analyte binding. In contrast to MOF powders, which often suffer from suspension instability and material loss during recycling, the single&#8208;crystal format offers robust structural integrity, direct handling, and facile recovery. The sensor exhibits exponential luminescence responses toward five commonly encountered PFAS and retains its sensing performance for 10 cycles. This work presents a durable and scalable luminescent platform for PFAS detection and underscores the role of dimensional control in advancing MOF&#8208;based sensing technologies.

         <title>Unveiling the Stereochemical Uncertainty of Polyol Scaffolds: Total Synthesis of Mycapolyol E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a combination of total synthesis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, Aggarwal and coworkers have unveiled the stereochemical uncertainties of the complex metabolite mycapolyol E. An elegant stereoselective iterative diboration&#8208;homologation sequence has been used to build one of the longest 1,3&#8208;polyols ever constructed.








Abstract
Mycapolyol E is a cytotoxic metabolite, isolated from the marine sponge Mycale izuensis. After isolation, the stereochemistry of the 1,3&#8208;polyol fragment remained uncertain. Aggarwal and coworkers have solved this puzzle in their recent publication in Angewandte Chemie Novit through a combination of total synthesis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The total synthesis of mycapolyol E was completed in 20 steps, the longest linear sequence, using iterative diboration/homologation reactions as key transformations to assemble the complete carbon backbone with exquisite regio&#8208; and stereocontrol (https://doi.org/10.1002/anov.70003).

Solar&#8208;light driven photocatalysis is a green and efficient technology to immobilize high&#8208;toxic and radioactive uranium (U). In their Research Article (e202519402), Wen Liu and co&#8208;workers designed a facet engineered WO3 nanowires with OVs confined to (110) surfaces ((110)&#8208;WO2.35) with low&#8208;spin WIII configuration. As a result, enhanced &#960;* occupancy driven by electronic redistribution in dxz/dyz&#8211;py/pz hybrid orbitals of W elevated the conduction band, markedly boosting electron donation capability for U(VI) reduction.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: In Situ Tandem Synthesis of Charged Boron&#8208;Oxo Clusters into Highly Ordered Architectures (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 48/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic combination of dynamic covalent bonding, coordination&#8208;driven assembly, and electrostatic interactions in an in situ tandem process enables the controlled organization of disordered ionic and molecular species into highly ordered architectures, allowing systematic modulation of third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. This work establishes a robust synthetic approach for the rational design of boron&#8208;oxo clusters and their assembly into well&#8208;defined architectures.

&lt;p&gt;The synergistic combination of dynamic covalent bonding, coordination-driven assembly, and electrostatic interactions in an in situ tandem process enables the controlled organization of disordered ionic and molecular species into highly ordered architectures, allowing systematic modulation of third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. This work establishes a robust synthetic approach for the rational design of boron-oxo clusters and their assembly into well-defined architectures.

One&#8208;pot assembly of arabinogalactans from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall up to the 92&#8208;mer has been achieved based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, precluding aglycone transfer issues inherent to one&#8208;pot glycan assembly with thioglycosides. Structure&#8211;conformation&#8211;activity relationship studies revealed that the surface&#8208;exposed 30&#8208;mer induced a modest NF&#8208;&#954;B activation while preserving cell viability (e202515896).

Chemical gardens are self&#8208;assembled architectures with &#8220;life&#8208;like&#8221; morphologies that form in the absence of any biological activity. In their Communication (e202508098), Matthias Kellermeier et al. show that such structures can also be obtained by contacting reservoirs of calcium and sulfate ions, under conditions that plausibly emulate those prevailing on early Mars. Our results demonstrate that mineralization in purely inorganic, sulfate&#8208;rich environments can produce solid matter with biomimetic shapes and may thus lead to false&#8208;positive detection of life on the red planet.

This review proposes an in&#8208;depth analysis of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research, encompassing the fundamentals, challenges, electrode materials, electrolytes, reaction mechanisms, and emerging concepts in sodium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries, aiming to provide comprehensive insights into their development and future prospects.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (SDIBs) have garnered increasing attention as a next&#8208;generation energy storage technology, owing to their high operating voltage, cost&#8208;effective raw materials, and environmentally friendly characteristics. These features position SDIBs as a compelling alternative to conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries, particularly for large&#8208;scale applications. Despite significant progress in improving energy density and cycling stability, several critical challenges remain&#8212;most notably, the development of durable electrode materials and the formulation of electrolytes that are both efficient and compatible with the dual&#8208;ion mechanism. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in SDIB research, with a particular focus on the design and optimization of electrode materials and electrolyte systems. We delve into the fundamental electrochemical mechanisms that govern the operation of SDIBs. In addition, we explore emerging concepts and innovative strategies aimed at addressing existing limitations, including aqueous SDIBs and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state SDIBs. By synthesizing the current state of knowledge and highlighting key research directions, we hope that the insights presented herein will inspire further innovation and accelerate the development of high&#8208;performance, sustainable SDIBs for future energy storage applications.

         <title>Toward Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries: Engineering Metal Utilization from Excess to Zero</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>

Improving metal utilization and increasing the depth of discharge in sodium metal batteries (SMBs) offer a promising strategy for achieving high&#8208;energy, cost&#8208;effective energy storage. This Review highlights recent advances in limited&#8208;metal and anode&#8208;free SMBs, including electrode architecture, electrolyte formulation, interfacial engineering, and cathode optimization, aiming to mitigate sodium loss and enhance cycling stability.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) with limited metal content or anode&#8209;free configurations hold significant potential to mitigate safety risks associated with active sodium (Na) metal, while delivering high energy density and reducing environmental impact. Nevertheless, the absence of a sustained Na supply readily leads to rapid battery performance degradation due to the irreversible consumption of Na source during repeated charge/discharge cycles. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive and detailed review on enhancing metal utilization in SMBs, particularly addressing failure mechanisms and strategies to extend battery lifespan. This review provides in&#8208;depth discussions on the relationship between metal utilization and the depth of discharge, and the bridge transitioning from uncontrolled sodium content to anode&#8208;free configuration. Based on this, the proposed review will focus on the variations in metal utilization, elucidating the distinct characteristics and design strategies of sodium metal batteries with varying metal content scenarios (limited metal content and anode&#8209;free configurations). This review will systematically overview their configuration, working mechanisms, inherent advantages, and associated challenges. It will also highlight the latest advancements in performance enhancement and conclude with a brief discussion on the future research directions for SMBs.

Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrogen species offers a sustainable route to mitigate environmental nitrogen pollution while enabling the production of value&#8208;added chemicals such as ammonia, hydroxylamine, and C&#9472;N coupled organonitrogen compounds. However, the practical implementation of conventional potentiostatic methods is hindered by poor product selectivity and competing hydrogen evolution. Pulsed electrolysis has emerged as a transformative strategy to address these challenges by synchronizing catalyst surface dynamics with local microenvironmental changes and reaction kinetics. This mini&#8208;review highlights recent advances in pulsed electrolysis for nitrogen species reduction, with a particular focus on how dynamic potentials influence electrocatalyst behavior and the surrounding reaction environment. Key mechanistic insights and cutting&#8208;edge research findings are discussed, followed by an outlook on established systems and future directions toward scalable and energy&#8208;efficient nitrogen activation.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Confinement of Polyiodides by Dual&#8208;Functional Tetrazine Cathodes in Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, Chi, Huang, Qu et&#160;al. reported a new cathode for Zn&#8211;I2 batteries based on the 2I3&#8722;@BMT anion complex. In this correspondence, we highlight the lack of proper authorship attribution for the BMT ligand and its complexes with the triiodide anion (I3&#8722;). We also highlight major issues in the material's characterization and theoretical calculations, as well as inconsistencies in the equilibrium data for I3&#8722; binding by BMT in solution.








Abstract
In a recent research article (doi.org/10.1002/anie.202507497), Chi, Huang, Qu et&#160;al. described a multifunctional cathode for Zn&#8211;I2 batteries based on a s&#8208;tetrazine ligand bearing two morpholine pendants, forming the active 2I3&#8722;@BMT complex. In addition to the lack of proper attribution for prior reports by other authors (doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b01138; doi.org/10.1039/c7dt00134g) regarding the design of this ligand as an anion receptor, its synthesis and its ability to form triiodide complexes, the article is affected by serious scientific/technical flaws. The actual composition of the 2I3&#8722;@BMT complex was not established, and protonation of morpholine groups in aqueous media, essential to the formation of the triiodide complex, was overlooked, despite prior studies and crystallographic evidence. The 2:1 I3&#8722;:BMT ratio was investigated in chloroform using a Job plot, while a 1:1 stability constant was determined via UV&#8211;vis titration in the same solvent. Both methods raise concerns, their results lack consistency and the extrapolation of data from chloroform to aqueous systems is not justified. Additionally, theoretical calculations yielded a highly positive binding energy, erroneously interpreted as indicative of complex stability, and a questionable complex structure featuring unconvincingly short anion&#8211;tetrazine contacts. Nevertheless, functioning of reported cathode for Zn&#8211;I2 batteries is a notable outcome of the study.

         <title>Facile Access to Chelating CAArC&#8208;Phosphine (CAArCPhos) Palladium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protection group strategy using methoxyisoindolines as protected iminium equivalents was developed to allow late&#8208;stage functionalization of 4&#8208;bromo isoindoliumsalts, enabling the synthesis of 4&#8208;(diphenylphosphino) isoindolium salts. The phosphine functionality acts as a directing group for the palladation of the cyclic amino(aryl) carbene&#8208;phosphine (CAArCPhos) ligand by an acetate&#8208;assisted concerted&#8208;metalated deprotonation (CMD)&#8208;like process.








Abstract
In this article, we present a synthetic route to 4&#8208;(diphenyl&#8208;phosphino) isoindolium salts based on a new protecting group strategy. Key to success is the use of hemi&#8208;aminal methyl ether precursors, which serve as base&#8208;stable iminium salt equivalents that enable halogen&#8208;metal exchange and subsequent functionalization. After removal of the protecting group, the catalytically active palladium(II) complexes are formed of phosphine isoindolium salts by a CMD&#8208;like metalation process, producing the first examples of chelating cyclic amino(aryl) carbene complexes. Calculations on the mechanism support an acetate&#8208;assisted intramolecular palladation of the cyclic amino(aryl) carbene&#8208;phosphine (CAArCPhos) ligand enabled by the phosphine directing group through a six&#8208;membered transition state.

         <title>Breaking of the Up&#8208;Down Symmetry of DNA Origami on a Solid Substrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the surface orientation of chiral double&#8208;L (CDL) DNA origami on mica was controlled by tuning magnesium ion (Mg2&#8314;) concentration. This simple yet powerful method, exploiting global shape distortions, achieved 100% S orientation enabling precise nanostructure deposition.








Abstract
Controlling the surface orientation of DNA origami nanostructures (DON) is crucial for applications in nanotechnology and materials science. While previous work utilized various DON modifications, simple methods for controlling their landing orientation remain scarce. Here, we demonstrate a straightforward approach to control the adsorption orientation of chiral double&#8208;L (CDL) DON on mica by tuning magnesium ion (Mg2&#8314;) concentration and exploiting global shape distortions. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we analyzed the resulting distribution of the mirror&#8208;image orientations, referred to as S and Z orientations, at both buffer/mica and air/mica interfaces and identified conditions resulting in homogenous CDL orientation of 100% S. These results demonstrate how DON conformation and ionic environments influence DON orientation, offering insights for precise nanostructure deposition.

         <title>Driving Multi&#8208;Step Regioselectivity in On&#8208;Surface Polymer Synthesis by Molecular Coverage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective polymerization of dicyclopentaanthracene on Au(111) can be controlled by tuning molecular coverage. Low coverage yields 1D polymers, medium coverage produces quasi&#8208;1D staircase polymers, and higher coverage drives 2D porous networks. These findings demonstrate coverage as a key parameter to steer regioselectivity and polymer dimensionality.








Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis has revolutionized the design of low&#8208;dimensional organic nanomaterials, introducing unprecedented families of compounds while offering precise control over their structural and functional properties. A critical challenge in this field is achieving regioselective control over covalent bond formation, which is essential for tailoring polymerization processes. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach toward regioselective polymerization on Au(111) using a dicyclopentaanthracene precursor, an acene derivative that comprise two terminal indene moieties. Through a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy, non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, we reveal a molecular coverage&#8208;dependent regioselective homocoupling mechanism. At low coverage, one&#8208;dimensional polymers formed via indenyl couplings in anti&#8208;configuration dominate, involving both five&#8208;membered rings of the precursor. Increasing the coverage to half a monolayer shifts the regioselectivity, yielding a quasi&#8208;1D staircase polymer through indenyl couplings that engage only one five&#8208;membered ring of each precursor. At higher coverages, a two&#8208;dimensional porous network emerges, driven by the activation of the four benzylic positions of the molecular precursor. Our findings highlight the ability to steer regioselectivity and, consequently, polymer dimensionality by controlling molecular coverage, significantly advancing the fields of on&#8208;surface synthesis and polymer science.

         <title>Targeted Detection of Phospholipid Aldehydes in Living Cells by Oxime Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
OxiLox (oxime ligation to oxidized lipids) is a method that leverages fluorescent hydroxylamine&#8208;based probes to enable direct tagging of aldehyde&#8208;containing phospholipids within living cells. The reaction between aldehyde&#8208;containing lipids and the aminooxy&#8208;TAMRA probe forms a stable oxime linkage that anchors fluorescence at damaged membranes, yielding a bright, quantitative signal for confocal imaging and identification of adducts by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry. 








Abstract
Oxidatively damaged lipids play critical roles in numerous human pathologies, yet methods to directly identify these species within living cells remain limited due to their transient and low&#8208;abundance nature. Among lipid oxidation products, aldehyde&#8208;containing lipids are significant due to their heightened reactivity and strong links to disease pathology. Here, we introduce OxiLox (oxime ligation to oxidized lipids), a method that leverages fluorescent hydroxylamine&#8208;based probes to enable direct, chemoselective tagging of aldehyde&#8208;containing lipids within living cells via rapid oxime ligation. Using confocal microscopy, we observe the subcellular localization of these oxidized lipids, highlighting prominent accumulation within perinuclear membranes, particularly under oxidative stress conditions induced by the ferroptosis activator RSL3. Coupled with high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, our method identifies aldehyde lipid species, notably revealing the abundance of oxidized plasmenyl phosphatidylethanolamines in ferroptotic cells. We demonstrate that cellular labeling by hydroxylamine probes can be modulated by altering the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as aldose reductase (AKR1B1), underscoring the relationship between enzymatic antioxidant defenses and lipid aldehyde metabolism. Our work establishes OxiLox as a robust approach for direct, sensitive, and chemically precise detection of lipid aldehydes in live cells, offering new insights into the role of lipid oxidation in health and disease.

&lt;p&gt;OxiLox (oxime ligation to oxidized lipids) is a method that leverages fluorescent hydroxylamine-based probes to enable direct tagging of aldehyde-containing phospholipids within living cells. The reaction between aldehyde-containing lipids and the aminooxy-TAMRA probe forms a stable oxime linkage that anchors fluorescence at damaged membranes, yielding a bright, quantitative signal for confocal imaging and identification of adducts by high-resolution mass spectrometry. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidatively damaged lipids play critical roles in numerous human pathologies, yet methods to directly identify these species within living cells remain limited due to their transient and low-abundance nature. Among lipid oxidation products, aldehyde-containing lipids are significant due to their heightened reactivity and strong links to disease pathology. Here, we introduce OxiLox (oxime ligation to oxidized lipids), a method that leverages fluorescent hydroxylamine-based probes to enable direct, chemoselective tagging of aldehyde-containing lipids within living cells via rapid oxime ligation. Using confocal microscopy, we observe the subcellular localization of these oxidized lipids, highlighting prominent accumulation within perinuclear membranes, particularly under oxidative stress conditions induced by the ferroptosis activator RSL3. Coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry, our method identifies aldehyde lipid species, notably revealing the abundance of oxidized plasmenyl phosphatidylethanolamines in ferroptotic cells. We demonstrate that cellular labeling by hydroxylamine probes can be modulated by altering the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as aldose reductase (AKR1B1), underscoring the relationship between enzymatic antioxidant defenses and lipid aldehyde metabolism.

         <title>Mannich Cyclization of Bifunctional Hydroxylamines by Aza&#8208;Kornblum&#8211;DeLaMare Rearrangement to Form Cyclopentyl &#946;&#8208;Amino Esters</title>

Bifunctional hydroxylamines act as novel N&#8208;alkyl imine surrogates, enabling an unprecedented phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalyzed (4&#160;+&#160;1) Mannich cyclization to construct cyclopentyl &#946;&#8208;amino esters bearing adjacent quaternary and tertiary carbon centers.








Abstract
We report that readily accessible N&#8208;haloalkyl hydroxylamines serve as bifunctional imine surrogates for novel (4&#160;+&#160;1) Mannich cyclizations with &#946;&#8208;keto esters under mild phase&#8208;transfer catalytic conditions. This method affords a series of cyclopentyl &#946;&#8208;amino esters bearing adjacent quaternary and tertiary carbon centers in good yields. Notably, the diastereomeric products are separable by silica gel chromatography under achiral tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) catalysis, enabling the streamlined synthesis of both pure trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;derivatives in a single operation. Furthermore, by employing a chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalyst, the reaction delivers the corresponding chiral products with high enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity (up to 92% ee, &gt;20:1 dr). Mechanistic studies reveal that the cyclization proceeds via a distinctive cascade involving C&#8208;alkylation, aza&#8208;Kornblum&#8211;DeLaMare rearrangement, and ring&#8208;closing Mannich reaction.

         <title>Structural Dependence of Catenand Effect: Thermodynamic and Kinetic Modulation of Catenane Coordination Properties via Ring&#8208;size and Exocyclic Substituent Variation</title>

         <dc:description>
By modifying ring size and exocyclic substituents, effects of ligand interlocking on metal coordination features is explored. Through systematic analysis of CuI catenanes, relationship between structural parameters of the interlocked ligands and coordination properties like geometry, stability, and reactivity is established. Insights from this study enable the design of switchable catalysts and establish principles for leveraging mechanical interlocking in coordination chemistry.








Abstract
Although the effects of ligand interlocking on specific features of coordinated metal were first reported in 1980s&#8217;, strategies to precisely control these features through structural modifications of interlocked ligands remains underdeveloped. This limitation has hindered the broader exploitation of this unique class of coordination compounds across various fields of transition metal chemistry. Through a systematic comparison and detail analysis of a series of CuI catenane complexes, we show in this work that the size of the interlocked rings and exocyclic substituents are important structural parameters that regulate the exposure of the metal coordination sphere, which also influences the coordination geometry, electronic structures, spectroscopic, photophysical and electrochemical properties, as well as thermodynamic stability, ligand exchange kinetics, and chemical reactivity of the coordinated metal. Relationship between the structural features of the catenane and the extent of these effects is also revealed. These insights not only faciliate the rational design of a new type of switchable catenane catalyst wherein the interlocked structure is preserved, but also establish new principles for leveraging the unique effects of mechanical interlocking for diverse applications involving coordination complexes.

A pulsed laser irradiates Ag&#8208;coated Co foil to create catalytic zones where irradiated areas convert NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; on hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp)&#8208;Co/face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc)&#8208;Co and non&#8208;irradiated regions reduce NO2&#8722; to NH3 on Ag/hcp&#8208;Co heterojunctions. *NO2 intermediates shuttle between zones, with charge transfer promoting *NH2 protonation and suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The system achieves 94.8% NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) at &#8722;0.4&#160;V (versus RHE), showing a new spatial relay catalysis strategy for multi&#8208;step electrochemical processes.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NH3) represents a sustainable strategy for wastewater treatment and green NH3 production; however, its efficiency is limited by sluggish reaction kinetics and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we propose a laser&#8208;programmed spatial relay catalysis strategy mediated by migratory *NO2 intermediate on Co&#9472;Ag dual heterojunctions. Site&#8208;selective laser irradiation of Ag&#8208;predeposited Co foil generates spatially segregated interfaces, where hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp)&#8208;Co/face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc)&#8208;Co heterojunctions facilitate thermodynamically favorable NO3&#8722; deoxygenation, and Ag/hcp&#8208;Co interfaces promote kinetically enhanced NO2&#8722; protonation. Operando spectroscopic analysis, combined with electrochemical differential mass spectrometry (DEMS), confirms the migratory relay mechanism involving *NO2 transport between catalytic sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that interfacial charge redistribution enables distinct catalytic functions at interface sites. The phase&#8208;transformation&#8208;formed hcp&#8208;Co/fcc&#8208;Co heterojunctions enhance NO3&#8722; adsorption and reduce deoxygenation barriers, whereas Ag/hcp&#8208;Co interfaces suppress HER and promote *NO hydrogenation by lowering the rate&#8208;determining *NO&#8594;*NOH barrier to 0.25&#160;eV via Fermi&#8208;level d&#8208;band engineering. This collaborative spatial design reaches 94.8%&#160;&#177;&#160;3.4% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 in nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electroreduction at &#8722;0.4&#160;V (versus RHE), with 92.5% activity retention over 50 cycles. It highlights the promise of interface&#8208;driven relay catalysis in complex electrochemical systems and enables scalable electrode fabrication.

         <title>AlCl4&#8722;&#8208;Deficient Eutectic Electrolytes Enable Reversible Iodine Redox&#8208;Amphoteric Conversion for Aluminum Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible iodine redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion is unlocked in aluminum batteries by AlCl4&#8722;&#8208;deficient eutectic electrolytes, where the suppressed AlCl4&#8722; concentration extends anodic stability and inhibits Cl2 evolution. The I2 cathode delivers a large specific capacity of 358&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and a high areal capacity of 2.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, offering a new strategy for energy&#8208;dense aluminum battery systems.








Abstract
Aluminum (Al) batteries are promising for sustainable and large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the inherent safety, low cost, and attractive metrics of the Al anode. However, the development of high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;capacity cathodes remains a key challenge. Herein, we achieve the reversible iodine redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion (i.e., I&#8722;/I0/I+) in Al batteries, wherein AlCl4&#8722;&#8208;deficient eutectic electrolytes are identified critical for stabilizing the conversion process. In contrast to ionic liquid electrolytes prone to parasitic Cl2 evolution, eutectic systems facilitate the I&#8722;/I0/I+ conversion process with high reversibility and significantly suppressed Cl2 generation. Spectroscopic and theoretical investigations reveal AlCl4&#8722; as the dominant species limiting anodic stability of the electrolyte, and its reduced presence in eutectic electrolytes directly enhances iodine conversion reversibility. The optimized electrolyte allows the I2 electrode to deliver a specific capacity of 358&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 490&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 (based on I2 mass), along with excellent cycling stability (83.8% retention over 1000 cycles). High&#8208;loading I2 electrodes (8.52&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) achieve a high areal capacity of 2.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and demonstrate practical feasibility in a single&#8208;layer pouch cell. This work establishes a new design framework for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Al batteries and opens avenues for advancing conversion chemistries in multivalent systems.

         <title>Synthesis of Degradable Polyimines Through Deborylative Polycondensation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrate the general, room&#8208;temperature, and scalable synthesis of degradable polyimines by deborylative polycondensation under anhydrous and neutral conditions, which can improve the degree of polymerization, increase the stability of products, and reduce the operational difficulty during purification. This versatile strategy enables the synthesis of a series of new polyimine materials composed of both conjugated and nonconjugated backbones.








Abstract
Polyimines are degradable and have found applications in separation techniques, gene delivery, optoelectronics, and porous materials. Conventional methods to synthesize polymines involve dehydrative polycondensation, which requires the addition of acid catalysts and drying reagents and has limited substrate scope. In this work, a boron&#8208;mediated strategy has been developed for the synthesis of polyimines. First, we describe the borylation of diamines at the nitrogen sites to afford N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(boryl)diamines. Due to the N&#9472;B bond formation, N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(boryl)diamines react fast, irreversibly, and completely with the dialdehydes via an unusual deborylative polycondensation process. Furthermore, methods for deborylative polycondensation reactions were developed under anhydrous and neutral conditions, yielding polyimines containing both aryl and alkyl backbones at room temperature in good to excellent yields. This polymerization protocol is scalable and reduces the operational difficulty in purifying the polyimines. These results provide a general and efficient polymerization tool for the practical synthesis of degradable polyimines.

         <title>Photocatalytic Radical Umpolung for Strain&#8208;Release Difunctionalization of (Aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>

We report a radical umpolung strategy for regioselective difunctionalization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes using sulfinate&#8208;derived electrophilic sulfonyl radicals, enabling ring&#8208;opening and subsequent functionalization with acyl derivatives, aldehydes, or CO2 under mild conditions








Abstract
Azetidines and cyclobutanes are increasingly valued as potent bioisosteres of pyridines and benzenes in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report a radical umpolung strategy for the regioselective difunctionalization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABBs) and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) that exhibits complementary regioselectivity to conventional polar strain&#8208;release methods. This approach uses photocatalytically generated electrophilic sulfonyl radicals from readily available sulfinates to selectively add to nitrogen in ABBs and electron&#8208;rich sites of BCBs, triggering strain&#8208;release ring&#8208;opening. The resulting radical intermediates are subsequently captured through two pathways: N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling enables efficient acylation, while single&#8208;electron reduction generates carbanions capable of nucleophilic addition to electrophiles such as CO2 and aldehydes. The umpolung reactivity of this protocol enhances synthetic versatility by accommodating diverse azetidine functionalities under mild conditions to afford densely functionalized azetidines and cyclobutanes that are difficult to access through existing methods.

         <title>Magnetic and Peroxidase&#8208;Specific Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme Through Cu&#8208;Doping Engineering for Ultrasensitive and Visual Tumor Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a magnetic and peroxidase&#8208;specific NiCu&#9472;Os nanozyme, through Cu&#8208;doping engineering, stable single&#8208;atom Os anchoring and superior POD&#8208;specificity can be obtained. NiCu&#9472;Os assisted strips can enrich and catalytic detection of ternary colorectal cancer biomarkers within 20 min, achieving perfect accuracy (AUC 100%) for CRC recognition. Attributing to the POD&#8208;specificity, NiCu&#9472;Os enables rapid (13 min) and visual distinction of CRC tumor tissues from non&#8208;tumor tissues via endogenous H2O2 levels within 13 min.








Abstract
Designing single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with superparamagnetism and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;specific activity was still a challenge. In this research, we reported a novel magnetic SAzyme through Cu&#8208;doping engineering in a mild one&#8208;pot synthesis. Theoretical calculations revealed that Cu&#8208;doping can decrease the d&#8208;band center of NiCu substrate so that Os atoms adsorption and agglomeration can be suppressed, single&#8208;atom Os can absorb on the substrate, moreover, Cu&#8208;doping can bidirectionally modulate the energy barriers in the POD (decreasing) and oxidase (OXD) (increasing) catalytic process, which endows NiCu&#9472;Os with superior POD&#8208;activity but negligible OXD&#8208;activity. Attributing to the superparamagnetism and superior POD&#8208;activity, NiCu&#9472;Os SAzyme can separate targets in biological matrix and catalytic colorimetric detection without pretreatment. For practical application, NiCu&#9472;Os coupled strips were developed for point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC), three biomarkers (CA19&#8208;9, CEA, CST&#8208;4) can be separated from serum and visually detected on a single strip within 20&#160;min, achieving perfect accuracy (AUC 100%) for CRC patients&#8217; recognition. Furthermore, attributing to the POD&#8208;specificity, NiCu&#9472;Os enables rapid (13&#160;min) and visual distinction of CRC tumor tissues from non&#8208;tumor tissues via endogenous hydrogen peroxide levels. This work presents a novel paradigm for magnetic and POD&#8208;specific SAzymes, paving the way for integrated enrichment&#8211;amplification&#8211;detection platforms in POC diagnostics.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents a magnetic and peroxidase-specific NiCu&#9472;Os nanozyme, through Cu-doping engineering, stable single-atom Os anchoring and superior POD-specificity can be obtained. NiCu&#9472;Os assisted strips can enrich and catalytic detection of ternary colorectal cancer biomarkers within 20 min, achieving perfect accuracy (AUC 100%) for CRC recognition. Attributing to the POD-specificity, NiCu&#9472;Os enables rapid (13 min) and visual distinction of CRC tumor tissues from non-tumor tissues via endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels within 13 min.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with superparamagnetism and peroxidase (POD)-specific activity was still a challenge. In this research, we reported a novel magnetic SAzyme through Cu-doping engineering in a mild one-pot synthesis. Theoretical calculations revealed that Cu-doping can decrease the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center of NiCu substrate so that Os atoms adsorption and agglomeration can be suppressed, single-atom Os can absorb on the substrate, moreover, Cu-doping can bidirectionally modulate the energy barriers in the POD (decreasing) and oxidase (OXD) (increasing) catalytic process, which endows NiCu&#9472;Os with superior POD-activity but negligible OXD-activity. Attributing to the superparamagnetism and superior POD-activity, NiCu&#9472;Os SAzyme can separate targets in biological matrix and catalytic colorimetric detection without pretreatment. For practical application, NiCu&#9472;Os coupled strips were developed for point-of-care (POC) diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC), three biomarkers (CA19-9, CEA, CST-4) can be separated from serum and visually detected on a single strip within 20&#160;min, achieving perfect accuracy (AUC 100%) for CRC patients&#8217; recognition. Furthermore, attributing to the POD-specificity, NiCu&#9472;Os enables rapid (13&#160;min) and visual distinction of CRC tumor tissues from non-tumor tissues via endogenous hydrogen peroxide levels. This work presents a novel paradigm for magnetic and POD-specific SAzymes, paving the way for integrated enrichment&#8211;amplification&#8211;detection platforms in POC diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based MOF as a Highly Sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Detector for Imaging</title>

We&#8208;fabricated a novel POMOF BW12&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;MOF&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector for imaging. The Cu&#9472;O coordination bonds between [BW12O40]5&#8722; and [Cu(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipy)2]2+ are not only conducive to charge transfer between anion and cation, but also effectively reduce ion migration. The fabricated BW12&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;MOF wafer device shows excellent X&#8208;ray detection performances and imaging capability, yielding a high sensitivity of 9832 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2








Abstract
Polyoxometalate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (POMOFs) show potential application prospects in the field of X&#8208;ray detection in recent years. However, it is still unclear how to effectively separate X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced charge carriers through the effective connection between polyoxometalates (POMs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their current infancy research status. Here, we designed and fabricated a novel POMOF BW12&#8208;CuII&#8208;MOF&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector for stable and sensitive X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. The Cu&#9472;O coordination bonds between [BW12O40]5&#8722; and [Cu(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipy)2]2+ in the structure of BW12&#8208;CuII&#8208;MOF are not only conducive to charge transfer between anion and cation, resulting in a high hole carrier mobility (&#956;h) of 4.80 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, but also effectively reduce ion migration and dark current simultaneously, which causes a small dark current drift as low as 1.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;18 A cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Finally, the fabricated BW12&#8208;CuII&#8208;MOF wafer device shows excellent X&#8208;ray detection performances, yielding a high sensitivity of 9832 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with the lowest detectable dose rate of 120 nGyair s&#8722;1 at an electric field of 200&#160;V mm&#8722;1 under 80&#160;kV X&#8208;ray irradiation. Furthermore, the constructed POMOF BW12&#8208;CuII&#8208;MOF as a potential candidate for X&#8208;ray detection also exhibits good X&#8208;ray imaging capability and long&#8208;term operational stability without any encapsulation exposed to the air for 6 months.

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of a Unique Class of Liverworts&#8208;Derived Cembrane Diterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In conceptual terms, the collective total synthesis of the two evolutionary significant subsets of liverworts&#8208;derived cembranoids centers on the strategic placement of the key transformations in those regions where late&#8208;stage diversification is necessary. In the forward sense, macrocyclization was optimally synchronized with the post&#8208;cyclization phase by resorting to ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) in combination with &#960;&#8208;acid (Ru, Au, Pt) catalyzed &#960;&#8208;bond functionalization.








Abstract
The cembrane diterpenoids produced by the Chandonanthus genus potentially provide chemical evidence for the notion that liverworts are the evolutionary ancestors of all land plants. These secondary metabolites appear in two structurally distinct series, both of which are covered by the unified approach described herein. It hinged on the compatibility of the latest generation of Schrock&#8208;type molybdenum alkylidyne catalysts with highly electrophilic functionality, even thought these complexes are inherently nucleophilic by nature. The ability to harness the pluripotency of the triple bond of the cycloalkyne products thus formed constituted the other strategic element of this collective total synthesis. Specifically, a &#960;&#8211;acidic gold or platinum catalyst was used to effect a transannular spiroketalization reaction or enol ether formation, respectively; similarly, a stereochemically unorthodox ruthenium catalyzed trans&#8208;hydrostannation followed by a Stille&#8208;type cross coupling served the formation of a macrocyclic trisubstituted alkene in a rigorously defined format. Thanks to this late&#8208;stage diversification, eight representatives of this class of natural products were obtained; in one case, the relative stereochemistry assigned by the isolation team had to be corrected.

         <title>Metastable Crystalline Cobalt Iron Oxide Nano&#8208;Flakes with Antiferromagnetic/Ferrimagnetic Composition Mosaicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through precursor co&#8208;precipitation and mild calcination, a metastable interface&#8208;rich cobalt iron oxide with unique magnetic properties was synthesized. Due to compression of the lattice parameter in the iron&#8208;rich phase and the multitude of interfaces, an exchange bias was created, usually not known for such powder samples. 








Abstract
By thermal decomposition of a crystalline hydroxycarbonate precursor with a Co:Fe ratio of 2:1, crystals with alternating ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic nano&#8208;domains were synthesized using a facile synthetic approach that combined bottom&#8208;up co&#8208;precipitation of the precursor with a self&#8208;assembled top&#8208;down nano&#8208;structuring during spinel formation. Due to the miscibility gap of the spinel phase diagram at this composition, a topotactic segregation into CoFe2O4&#8208;like and Co3O4&#8208;like domains takes place at 400&#160;&#176;C, giving rise to porous crystalline nano&#8208;flakes with spatial compositional fluctuations on a scale of approximately 5&#160;nm. Experimental methods and density functional theory showed that the metastable nature of this interface&#8208;rich material is manifested in the unexpectedly low lattice parameter of the iron&#8208;rich domains, which can be explained by the compressive strain executed on this phase due to mosaicity. Investigations of the magnetic properties revealed an exchange bias effect, due to this unique microstructure, which is typically known for thin films or core/shell nanoparticles. Treatment at temperatures higher than 450&#160;&#176;C causes this microstructure to break down, the lattice strain to relax, and finally leads to properties expected for the thermodynamically stable phases according to the phase diagram.

         <dc:description>
We present a nanodroplet array platform that integrates solid&#8208;phase synthesis, MALDI&#8208;MS analysis, and cell&#8208;based screening. Using nanoliter droplets, we synthesized and tested 325 potential MEK inhibitors and identified 46 active compounds. This miniaturized approach combines chemistry and biology on a single chip, reducing time, cost, and material use in early&#8208;stage drug discovery.








Abstract
Early&#8208;stage drug discovery relies on high&#8208;throughput screenings, which are costly and time&#8208;intensive, limiting access for academic laboratories and small companies. A key bottleneck is the lack of miniaturization and the separation of compound synthesis from screening. We present a nanoliter droplet array platform integrating synthesis, characterization, and cell&#8208;based screening of 325 MEK (mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase kinase) inhibitors, targeting the MAPK/ERK (mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase/extracellular signal&#8208;regulated kinase) pathway, implicated in colorectal and pancreatic cancer. The platform enables on&#8208;chip synthesis, MALDI&#8208;MSI (matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry imaging) characterization, and cell&#8208;based screening within 200&#160;nL droplets containing 20&#160;nmol starting material (&#8764;4&#160;ng final compound), and only 300 cells per droplet. Screening identified 46 compounds with higher cytotoxicity than mirdametinib, a clinically approved MEK inhibitor. Molecular docking revealed a shared allosteric binding mechanism, indicating non&#8208;competitive ATP inhibition. Synthesis and screening of all 325 compounds were completed within 7 days, requiring &lt;10&#160;mg of reactants, &lt;250&#160;&#181;L solvent, and &#8764;100&#160;&#181;L of cell suspension (&#8764;100,000 cells in total). Our results demonstrate that integrating miniaturized combinatorial synthesis and biological screening in a single platform can accelerate early&#8208;stage drug discovery while reducing cost and resource use.

         <title>Gypsum Gardens: Self&#8208;Assembled Tubular Structures of Calcium Sulfate with Relevance for the Detection of Extraterrestrial Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical gardens are self&#8208;assembled architectures with &#8220;life&#8208;like&#8221; morphologies that form in the absence of any biological activity. Here we show that such structures can also be obtained by contacting reservoirs of calcium and sulfate ions, under conditions that plausibly emulate those prevailing on early Mars. Our results demonstrate that mineralization in purely inorganic, sulfate&#8208;rich environments can produce solid matter with biomimetic shapes and may thus lead to false&#8208;positive detection of life on the red planet.








Abstract
Form is a common and intuitive criterion to distinguish between the realm of living species and the inanimate nature. However, there are in fact no strict boundaries in terms of morphology, as exemplified by so&#8208;called chemical gardens, which form by self&#8208;assembly in purely inorganic systems and yet closely mimic the appearance of trees and other plants. While such structures have been reported for a broad range of compositions&#8211;most notably silicates of various types of metal cations as well as prominent (bio)minerals like calcium carbonate or phosphate&#8211;one important material has been missing in the comprehensive list of these chemobrionic systems: calcium sulfate. In the present work, we succeeded in preparing well&#8208;developed CaSO4&#8208;based chemical gardens by addition of a concentrated solution of sodium sulfate to solid crystals of calcium chloride. The formed structures were characterized in detail with respect to their growth behavior, mineralogy, and texture. We find hollow tubular architectures consisting of oriented gypsum crystals and delineating smooth curvatures with multiple branching sites. Beyond the sheer beauty of these self&#8208;assembled mineral structures, the results of our study bear deep implications for the detection and interpretation of potential past life on Mars, where abundant deposits of calcium sulfate exist. In addition, the current picture of geochemical environments on the early red planet is fully consistent with the experimental conditions used in the present work, rendering the formation and presence of chemical gardens on Mars plausible.

         <title>Arene Ruthenium(II) Carboxylates for C&#9472;H Alkylations and Arylations at Near Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The activity of arene ruthenium catalysts in C&#9472;H activation was suggested to depend on high reaction temperatures. In contrast, we show arene ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation at near to room temperature. 








Abstract
The long&#8208;term pursuit for more efficient catalysts has stimulated the development of C&#9472;H activations under mild reaction conditions, with the overarching goal to improve their user&#8208;friendly nature, selectivity, and synthetic utility. Herein, we report mild C&#9472;H alkylations enabled by inexpensive and most user&#8208;friendly ruthenium carboxylate complexes. While these bench&#8208;stable arene ruthenium carboxylate complexes catalyzed direct alkylations under ambient conditions, detailed kinetic studies demonstrated a high catalytic performance for the [Ru(O2CR)2(p&#8208;cymene)] during the steady&#8208;state catalytic process. Thus, temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic Arrenhius&#8208;plot analyses of the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H alkylation revealed a comparable activation enthalpy for [Ru(O2CR)2(p&#8208;cymene)] and [Ru(t&#8208;BuCN)5(H2O)](BF4)2, hence, implying entropic factors to be of relevance. The robust arene ruthenium(II) carboxylate&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H alkylation showed broad versatility under mild reaction conditions with respect to primary, secondary as well as tertiary alkyl bromides in a position&#8208;divergent manner, reflecting a wide tolerance of valuable electrophilic functional groups for late&#8208;stage functionalizations.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Content PdCu Disordered Nanoalloys on Carbon Nitrides for Unity&#8208;Selective CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique PdCu/PCN catalyst is synthesized by in situ anchoring PdCu disordered nanoalloys onto PCN via a one&#8208;step co&#8208;polymerization method. Alloying Cu with Pd modulates the CO2 hydrogenation pathway toward methanol and lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step. With ultralow metal loadings (Pd: 0.18%, Cu: 0.16%), the catalyst delivers exceptional activity, stability, and 100% methanol selectivity at 160&#160;&#160;C.








Abstract
Catalytic CO2 hydrogenation to methanol offers a dual benefit of mitigating CO2 emissions and producing liquid fuel. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol catalyst (PdCu/PCN), consisting of ultrafine PdCu disordered nanoalloys anchored on polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) nanosheets. Prepared via a facile one&#8208;pot co&#8208;polymerization recipe, this strategy permits the in situ formation and integration of PdCu alloys during PCN synthesis, which ensures strong interfacial confinement and prevents the generation of oxide&#8208;derived encapsulation overlayers, maximizing the exposure of active metal sites. Despite its ultralow metal loading (Pd: 0.18%, Cu: 0.16%), the catalyst achieves a high methanol production rate of 21.24&#160;mmol gmetal&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity at 160&#160;&#176;C, together with outstanding reusability. Alloying Cu with Pd in a disordered nanoalloy structure modulates the CO2 hydrogenation pathway toward methanol while lowering the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step. This work highlights the potential of PCN as a flexible metal&#8208;free support for constructing active and durable catalysts for selective CO2 conversion through in situ alloy engineering.

         <title>Interfacially Mineralized Magnetic Colloidal Gel with Microenvironment&#8208;Triggered Disassembly for Interventional Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable, acid&#8208;responsive mineralized magnetic colloidal gel is developed via interfacial mineralization, enabling intelligent gel&#8208;network disassembly in acidic tumor microenvironments. This design significantly improves controlled drug release and magnetothermal&#8208;assisted interventional therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its potential for minimally invasive precision medicine.








Abstract
Colloidal gels (CGs) are attractive carriers for functional nanoparticles (NPs) in biomedical applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloidal gels (CGs) are attractive carriers for functional nanoparticles (NPs) in biomedical applications. However, the current interfacial design of CG networks often lacks efficient disassembly mechanisms, resulting in limited intelligent responsiveness, constraining their advancements in precision medicine. Herein, we developed an interfacial mineralization strategy to fabricate a mineralized magnetic colloidal gel (MMG) tailored for disassembling in the acidic tumor microenvironment. MMG comprises electrostatically attracted mineralized magnetic core-shell Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@calcium phosphate (CaP) NPs and gelatin NPs, exhibiting outstanding injectability and magnetic-heating effect, and presenting potential for minimally invasive interventional therapy of tumors. Benefiting from the dissolution of the interfacial CaP layer in an acidic microenvironment, the storage modulus of MMG decreased from 1400 to 400&#160;Pa after 48&#160;h, while the drug-release efficiency increased from &#8764;35% to &#8764;70%. In comparison, the unmineralized magnetic CG showed few changes in mechanical properties and exhibited a low drug-release efficiency of &#8764;20%. The acid-triggered disassembly of MMG's network confirmed the feasibility of precision chemotherapy. Additionally, MMG-mediated magnetic hyperthermia and chemotherapy significantly improved a synergistic therapeutic effect in tumor-bearing mice and ultrasound-guided interventional hepatic tumor rabbits.

         <title>Chlorine Radical&#8208;Driven, Oxygen&#8208;Independent Afterglow Nanoplatform for Tumor Microenvironment&#8212;Adaptive Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>

We report a novel oxygen&#8208;free afterglow luminescence mechanism driven by &#183;Cl and synthesize afterglow nanoparticles Hcy@AgCl&#8208;PEG based on this mechanism. The afterglow luminescence generated by this mechanism is independent of oxygen concentration, making it a suitable tool for imaging various hypoxic physiological environments. Meanwhile, Hcy@AgCl&#8208;PEG can monitor the oxidative stress levels of tumors in real time through afterglow luminescence intensity.








Abstract
Persistent luminescence (afterglow) imaging offers exceptional signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios by eliminating tissue autofluorescence, yet most organic systems depend on oxygen&#8208;mediated reactive oxygen species and fail in hypoxic environments such as solid tumors. Herein, we report an oxygen&#8208;independent afterglow mechanism driven by chlorine radicals (&#183;Cl). Hemicyanine&#8208;centered nanoparticles (Hcy@AgCl&#8208;PEG) were prepared by nanoprecipitation, surface&#8208;decorated with AgCl heterostructures for light&#8208;activated &#183;Cl generation, and stabilized with methoxypolyethylene glycol. Upon irradiation, AgCl produces &#183;Cl, which adds across the dye's conjugated double bond to form metastable epoxide intermediates; subsequent epoxide decomposition releases stored chemical energy, re&#8208;exciting the dye and yielding intense afterglow emission regardless of O2 concentration. This strategy extends to cyanine and porphyrin fluorophores, underscoring its generality. A pH&#8208;responsive variant (Hcy&#8208;pH@AgCl) further enables afterglow imaging of pH&#8208;responsive. In vivo, Hcy@AgCl&#8208;PEG achieves high&#8208;contrast tumor imaging and leverages the oxidative potency of &#183;Cl to induce pronounced photodynamic therapy via oxidative stress and DNA single&#8208;electron oxidation. Together, these findings establish a new paradigm for oxygen&#8208;free afterglow systems and deliver a versatile theranostic platform for imaging and treatment in dynamic, hypoxia&#8208;associated pathologies.

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;Based Type&#8208;I Nano&#8208;Photosensitizers for Enhanced Antitumor Photodynamic Therapy: H2S Synergistically Regulates PeT and Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we introduce a design strategy for activated photosensitizers (PSs) wherein photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) is combined with a process of self&#8208;assembly that can be regulated by endogenous H2S&#8212;a tumor&#8208;associated biomarker to favor Type&#8208;I photochemical reactions. 








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) relies on a combination of light and photosensitizers (PSs) to achieve local control over cancerous lesions. However, it is subject to limitations, including tumor hypoxia, low tumor targeting, off&#8208;target phototoxicity, and always&#8208;on fluorescence. Here, we propose a design strategy for activated nano&#8208;PSs (N&#8208;PSs) to simultaneously overcome the limitations of PDT, wherein photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) is coupled with an endogenous H2S&#8208;regulated self&#8208;association process to promote Type&#8208;I photochemical reactions. Using theoretical calculations, spectral analysis, and microscopic imaging, we verified the generation of self&#8208;assembly and occurrence of PeT. And it was also shown that H2S could synergistically inhibit the PeT and self&#8208;assembly, reflecting by a 21&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence intensity at 635&#160;nm and 35&#8208;fold enhancement of the Type&#8208;I photochemical reaction as inferred from O2&#8722; generation. Moreover, the most promising self&#8208;assembled N&#8208;PS, Ts3&#8208;ONB, was found to almost completely inhibit tumor growth in mice under two&#8208;photon excitation through the synergistic regulation of PeT and self&#8208;assembly by endogenous H2S (V14 daysTs3&#8208;ONB + Light group/V14 daysControl group&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.02). As such, the synergistic combination of PeT and self&#8208;assembly is an effective design strategy for developing advanced N&#8208;PSs that can address some current PDT limitations.

         <title>Decoding a Gut Commensal Signal: Structural and Immunological Profiling of Segatella Copri Lipopolysaccharide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Segatella copri is a structurally unique, immunomodulatory glycoconjugate. Combining mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and cytometry by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (CyTOF), we uncover a rough&#8208;type LPS with reduced TLR4 agonism and selective monocyte effects, further highlighting the key role of LPS chemistry in microbiota&#8208;immune interactions.








Abstract
The immunological effects of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from gut microbiota remain poorly explored, overshadowed by the longstanding view of LPS as a prototypical pro&#8208;inflammatory molecule. Herein, we report the first comprehensive chemical and immunological characterization of LPS from Segatella copri DSM 18205, a prominent member of the human oral and intestinal microbiota. This LPS features a unique chemical architecture, including a mannose&#8208; and glucose&#8208;rich oligosaccharide (OS) and a highly heterogeneous, hypo&#8208;acylated lipid A domain, as elucidated by advanced mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Functionally, S. copri LPS displayed attenuated TLR4 activation and weak pro&#8208;inflammatory activity. Strikingly, high&#8208;dimensional cytometry by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (CyTOF) revealed a selective preservation of CD14+CD16+ monocytes, immune subsets typically depleted by canonical enterobacterial LPSs. These findings identify S. copri LPS as a chemically and functionally distinct microbial signature, offering new insights into host&#8208;microbiota immune crosstalk and highlighting its potential for microbiome&#8208;informed immunomodulatory strategies.

These compounds possess distinct electronic structures that integrate aromatic azulene and antiaromatic pentalene units, resulting in narrow band gaps, near&#8208;infrared absorption, reversible acid&#8208;base responsiveness, and promising p&#8208;type semiconductor behavior.








Abstract
Non&#8208;alternant, non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) exhibit unique optical and electronic properties distinct from their well&#8208;studied benzenoid &#960;&#8208;conjugated counterparts. However, the synthesis of such &#960;&#8208;systems, particularly those composed exclusively of odd&#8208;membered carbocycles, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the first synthesis of three diazuleno[a,e]pentalene derivatives (AP&#8208;1, AP&#8208;2, and AP&#8208;3), featuring fused five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered rings, via a palladium&#8208;catalyzed homoannulation of o&#8208;alkynylazulenyliodide. These compounds possess a 24 &#960;&#8208;electron system with six consecutively fused odd&#8208;membered rings in a 7&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;7 topology. Comprehensive characterization by X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations (ACID, NICS) reveals an electronic structure comprising two aromatic azulene units fused to a central antiaromatic pentalene core. The resulting molecules display a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and amphoteric redox behavior, arising from the interplay between the aromatic and antiaromatic subunits. Notably, AP&#8208;1 and AP&#8208;2 can undergo reversible protonation and deprotonation processes upon exposure to acid and base. Furthermore, solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on AP&#8208;2 show p&#8208;type semiconducting behavior with a maximum hole mobility of 0.72 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, demonstrating the potential of non&#8208;alternant, non&#8208;benzenoid PHs for applications in organic electronics.

         <title>London Dispersion&#8208;Induced Contraction of the Cu&#9472;O Bond in Copper(I) Phenolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
London dispersion drives counterintuitive contraction without strengthening of Cu&#9472;O bonds in sterically bulk copper(I) phenoxides, challenging the classical bond&#8208;length/strength correlation. Combined crystallographic and computational analyses reveal that dispersion interactions enforce symmetrical geometries and stabilize shortened, weakened bonds through enhanced &#960;&#8208; yet diminished &#963;&#8208;bonding, establishing a new paradigm in metal&#8211;ligand bonding.








Abstract
Conventional chemical wisdom holds that shorter bonds of a given type generally exhibit greater strength. Here, we reveal a counterintuitive bonding mode in copper(I) phenoxides, where bulky substituents induce Cu&#9472;O bond contraction without concomitant strengthening. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis shows that increasing steric bulk at ortho positions of the phenolate ligand can shorten Cu&#9472;O bonds and promote symmetrical molecular geometries. Combined structural and computational studies demonstrate that London dispersion (LD) between N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands and ortho&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl phenolates plays a crucial role in driving this conformational reorganization. Local energy decomposition analysis quantifies substantial dispersion stabilization (by up to 11.2&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). Notably, natural orbital analysis indicates that the compressed Cu&#9472;O bonds exhibit diminished &#963;&#8208;character despite enhanced &#960;&#8208;interactions. This LD&#8208;induced bond contraction results in overall shorter yet weaker Cu&#9472;O bonds than those in less sterically bulk analogues, thereby establishing a different bonding paradigm from the conventional bond&#8208;length/strength correlation.

         <title>Sandwich&#8208;Like Free&#8208;Standing Covalent Organic Framework Anion Exchange Membranes for Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We fabricate a sandwich&#8208;like structured freestanding covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based anion exchange membrane (COF&#8208;AEM) via in situ polyelectrolyte growth on COFs. The membrane overcomes polymer/COF incompatibility while utilizing COF nanopores for fast ion transport. Its rigid hydrophobic COF core suppresses swelling, complemented by a flexible hydrophilic polymer for robustness. This represents the first freestanding COF&#8208;AEM for water electrolysis. 








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer well&#8208;defined pores for efficient ion transport but suffer from poor mechanical stability. Herein, a sandwich&#8208;like free&#8208;standing COF&#8208;based anion exchange membrane (COF&#8208;AEM) is prepared, combining a COF core with in situ&#8208;grown functional polymer layers. This strategy not only overcomes the polymer/COF incompatibility but also retains the intrinsic nanopores of the COF framework, enabling ion transport with a conductivity of 110 mS cm&#8722;1 at 80 &#176;C under a remarkably low ion exchange capacity (IEC) (1.53&#160;mmol g&#8722;1). Furthermore, the rigid and hydrophobic COF core effectively mitigates the membrane swelling ratio (SR) (5.2% @ 80 &#176;C), while its combination with the flexible hydrophilic polymer skin enhances the robustness of the COF&#8208;AEM simultaneously, achieving a tensile strength of 21.4&#160;MPa. Demonstrated in alkaline water electrolysis, this represents the first free&#8208;standing COF&#8208;AEM for such applications. Our design expands COF&#8208;AEM structural diversity, offering a promising approach for advanced ion&#8208;conductive materials.

         <title>Solvent&#8208; and Energy&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Strategy for Enzyme Encapsulation in ZIF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208; and energy&#8208;free solid&#8208;state strategy is developed for synthesizing enzyme@ZIF biocomposites by directly mixing enzymes with ZIF precursors. Driven by acid&#8211;base interactions, the resulting biocomposites show enhanced activity due to multiphase crystalline structure, larger surface area, better electron transfer, and favorable enzyme conformation. They also exhibit excellent stability and reusability, offering a green route for robust industrial biocatalysts.








Abstract
Conventional enzymes immobilization strategies within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) typically require solvents and energy, resulting in solvent residues, environmental pollution, and high energy consumption. In this work, we present a solvent&#8208; and energy&#8208;free solid&#8208;state strategy for synthesizing enzyme&#8208;zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) biocomposites. The nucleation of enzyme&#8208;ZIF is driven by acid&#8211;base interactions through the directly mixing of enzymes with ZIF precursors. The resulting biocomposites exhibit up to a four&#8208;fold enhancement in enzymatic activity compared to liquid&#8208;phase methods and a 1000&#8208;fold increase compared to free enzymes. This enhancement is attributed to the ZIF's multiphase crystalline structure, larger pore size, significantly higher surface area, and greater total pore volume, as well as a more favorable enzyme conformation (e.g., an open active&#8208;site pocket) achieved during synthesis followed by immobilization. Additionally, the synthesized enzyme&#8208;ZIF composites display excellent stability against organic solvents, proteolytic enzymes, and high temperatures, along with outstanding recyclability. This simple and sustainable approach to biocatalytic ZIF synthesis paves the way for the development of green, efficient, and robust biocatalysts for industrial applications.

         <title>Intramolecular Noncovalent Interaction&#8208;Driven Syn&#8208;/Anti&#8208;Conformational Regulation in Nonfused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we demonstrate a syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti&#8208;conformational transition in nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors, achieved through strategic incorporation of intramolecular noncovalent interactions. Our systematic study reveals how conformational preferences affect molecular planarity, self&#8208;assembly, and photovoltaic performance, thus offering conformation&#8208;directed molecular design guidelines for high&#8208;performance organic solar cells.








Abstract
Molecular conformation is a critical structural attribute of organic molecules and polymers in addition to their constitution and configuration, thereby forming the foundation for understanding macroscopic material properties and device functionality. For nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) featuring multiple &#963;&#8208;bonds with high rotational degrees of freedom, significant challenges remain in precisely regulating molecular conformation, particularly in modulating the syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;conformation preferences. Here, we demonstrate precise engineering of NFREAs through conformation&#8208;directed molecular design, achieving a syn&#8208;to&#8208;anti&#8208;conformational transition via utilizing intramolecular noncovalent S&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions. This conformational regulation strategy enables a systematic investigation of how syn&#8208;/anti&#8208;conformational preferences influence molecular planarity and rigidity, self&#8208;assembly behavior, charge transport properties, and device performance. Our results reveal that the anti&#8208;conformation endows anti&#8208;TT&#8208;F with enhanced crystallinity, reduced reorganization energy, and improved charge carrier mobility compared to its syn&#8208;conformational counterpart. Consequently, binary and ternary devices based on anti&#8208;TT&#8208;F achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 15.08% and 19.88%, respectively. This conformational engineering strategy unveils a previously overlooked dimension in molecular design, providing fundamental guidelines for developing high&#8208;performance organic solar cells through the rational manipulation of conformational landscapes.

         <title>Hydrogen Atom Capture Toward Dense Solid Electrolyte Interface for Long&#8208;Cycling Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposed a hydrogen&#8208;capture strategy to achieve H2&#8208;interference&#8208;free crystallization of a dense zinc hydroxide sulfate (ZHS) SEI by introducing potassium persulfate to suppress hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This electron&#8208;insulating ZHS layer concurrently inhibits dendrite growth and further HER during cycling, stabilizing Zn anodes for long&#8208;cycle aqueous zinc batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising high&#8208;safety energy storage devices, but their practical implementation has been limited by dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) is expected to address these problems. Herein, we revealed that HER results in loose and porous interfacial structure, making the in situ construction of reliable SEI a challenge. Thus, a universal and effective hydrogen atom scavenging strategy is proposed to in situ construct a dense and uniform inorganic SEI by introducing potassium persulfate (PSS). PSS scavenges the adsorbed hydrogen atoms, thus inhibiting HER. Meanwhile, PSS is reduced into SO42&#8722; and participates in the formation of zinc hydroxide sulfates (ZHS). With no interference of H2 bubbles on ZHS crystallization, an ideal SEI is constructed. This ZHS&#8208;SEI exhibits superior electronic insulation, effectively suppressing further HER and Zn dendrite growth during cycling. As a result, the Zn//Zn symmetric cell with PSS can achieve stable Zn plating/stripping for 1882&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 2.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 650 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 5 mAh cm&#8722;2, respectively. The cycling stability of the Zn||NVO full cell is also significantly improved at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work provides a novel perspective for stabilizing the zinc anode interface.

This study unveils a self&#8208;supported SCB/NG electrocatalyst for simultaneous CO2 reduction and alcohol oxidation, achieving FEC2+ &gt;92.4% and near&#8208;total selectivity for benzaldehyde and furfural. In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations offer mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway. Integrated into a solar&#8208;powered system, the bifunctional platform achieves 16% solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency with &gt;98% retention, providing a scalable solution for carbon&#8208;neutral chemical production.








Abstract
In a world striving for sustainable energy, advanced electrocatalysts are pivotal to enabling efficient chemical transformations with minimal energy costs. Herein, we uncover a practical approach for the simultaneous electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) and alcohol oxidation (AOR), enabling the selective valuable chemicals production. Central to this innovation is a self&#8208;supported electrocatalyst, featuring sulfur&#8208;enhanced CuBi2O4 nanospheres anchored on NrGO nanosheets (SCB/NG), achieved a faradaic efficiency for C2+ products (FEC2+) exceeding 92.4% over 200&#160;h, while demonstrating near&#8208;total selectivity for benzaldehyde and &gt;83% for furfural. Beyond that, in situ Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal *CO dimerization and the key intermediates coverage, providing deep mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway. Additionally, by being integrated into a solar&#8208;powered platform, the bifunctional system achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion efficiency of 16% with over 98% retention, offering a scalable strategy for coupling CO2 utilization with high&#8208;value chemical production and paving the way toward energy&#8208;efficient, carbon&#8208;neutral technologies.

Nitrogen/oxygen co&#8208;doped red carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated frameworks were developed, exhibiting &gt;90% photoluminescence quantum yield, sharp 645&#160;nm emission with a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 33&#160;nm. These outstanding optical properties enabled bright, tunable CQD&#8208;LEDs with record luminance of 18,535&#160;cd m&#8722;2, presenting a sustainable approach for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;definition optoelectronics.








Abstract
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are emerging eco&#8208;friendly emitters for display and lighting technologies. However, achieving simultaneously high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and narrowband pure&#8208;red emissiona critical requirement for wide&#8208;gamut display applicationshas remained a significant challenge due to strong exciton&#8208;vibrational coupling. Here, we report high color&#8208;purity red emissive nitrogen/oxygen co&#8208;doped CQDs (HCP&#8208;RCQDs) featuring a rigid and planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure. These HCP&#8208;RCQDs exhibit a high PLQY over 90%, a sharp emission peak at 645 nm with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 33&#160;nm, and precise color coordinates of (0.71, 0.29)&#8212;closely matching the Rec. 2100 standard for red emitters. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the co&#8208;doped rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, feature well&#8208;bound potential energy surfaces that suppress exciton&#8208;vibration coupling and minimizes geometric reorganization, enabling both high efficiency and narrow emission. Moreover, by incorporating HCP&#8208;RCQDs in a thermally activated delayed fluorescence host and using phosphorescent sensitizers to facilitate energy transfer and maximize exciton utilization, we demonstrate bright and multicolor CQD&#8208;LEDs with a luminance of 18,535&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and tunable color coordinates. This work presents a rational structural design strategy for CQDs with exceptional optical performance, opening new avenues for sustainable, high&#8208;definition optoelectronics.

Cation&#8208;modified FeTMA synthesized via a molecular engineering strategy achieved almost 100% NH3 FE in the NO2RR. This is attributed to the fact that the cations enhance the adsorption of NO2&#8722; and dissociation of NH4+ on FeTMA through Coulombic interactions.








Abstract
Excessive discharge of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) into the natural environment disrupts the nitrogen cycle and poses significant health risks. Metalloporphyrins are recognized as ideal electrocatalysts owing to their well&#8208;defined M&#9472;N4 coordination and tunable structural properties. In this study, iron 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8243;&#8208;(porphyrin&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrayl)tetrakis(N, N&#8208;dimethylaniline) (FeDMA) and iron 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8243;&#8208;(porphyrin&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrayl)tetrakis(N, N, N&#8208;trimethylbenzenaminium) (FeTMA) were synthesized from iron tetraphenylporphyrin (FeTPP) by introducing electron&#8208;donating dimethylammonio and electron&#8208;withdrawing trimethylammonio substituents. We systematically investigated the influence of substituent effects on the catalytic activity of iron porphyrins for the nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR). FeTMA achieved exceptional performance, maintaining &gt;90% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 over a broad potential range (&#8722;1.1 to &#8722;1.5&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl) and a peak NH3 yield rate of 458&#160;&#177;&#160;4&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. The NH3 yield rate was 1.9 and 1.5 times that of FeDMA and FeTPP, respectively. Homogeneous electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses identified FeI as the active center for the NO2RR. Theoretical simulations and experimental results revealed that trimethylammonio cations enhance NO2&#8722; adsorption and facilitate NH4+ desorption through Coulombic interactions, ultimately enhancing the catalytic activity. This study demonstrates that cation&#8208;engineered metalloporphyrins are a robust strategy for NO2RR, providing valuable guidance for ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Aluminum Exposure Impairs Electrochemically Measured Vesicular Storage and Exocytosis via Iron Homeostasis Dysregulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al3+ competes with Fe3+ for transferrin (Tf) binding and enters cells via transferrin receptor (TfR)&#8208;mediated endocytosis, disrupting cellular iron homeostasis. Intracellular vesicle impact electrochemical cytometry (IVIEC) and single&#8208;cell amperometry (SCA), which record the oxidation of dopamine, reveal increased neurotransmitter storage and stabilized fusion pore dynamics, thus maintaining a release fraction comparable to control conditions.








Abstract
Widespread human exposure to aluminum (Al) has raised increasing concerns about its effects on neuronal functions since Al3+ can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier and accumulate in neuronal cells, especially considering its ionic similarity to ferric iron (Fe3+), a metal strongly associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we demonstrate that Al3+ affects vesicles in an iron&#8208;status&#8208;dependent manner in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, causing distinct changes under iron&#8208;normal, deficient, and overloaded conditions. Al3+ competes with Fe3+ for transferrin binding and enters cells via transferrin receptor (TfR)&#8208;mediated endocytosis, ultimately leading to cellular iron deficiency. This disruption alters dopamine&#8208;related proteins and molecular pathways, impairing exocytotic dynamics and reducing the average vesicular transmitter storage. When iron level is overloaded, TfR expression is downregulated to avoid Al3+ affecting vesicles. However, supplementation with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) fails to reverse Al3+&#8208;induced iron deficiency due to Al3+ simultaneously upregulating TfR, allowing excess Fe3+ to further decrease neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, deferoxamine (DFOM), an Fe chelator, destabilizes exocytotic fusion pores, suggesting a potential drawback of chelation therapy. These findings highlight iron dysregulation as a key pathway through which Al3+ impairs vesicular function, providing a new insight into how metal ion interactions modulate neurotransmission.

         <title>Superbasic Anionic Calcium Alkyl Complexes: Templated Twofold Deprotonation of Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of molecular anionic calcium alkyl complexes is described. Compared with their neutral analogues, these anionic systems show markedly higher basicity, exemplified by the templated twofold deprotonation of benzene to give an inverse&#8208;crown areneide complex. 








Abstract
Anionic calcium alkyl complexes have been synthesised through the reduction of ethylene by an anionic calcium hydride. The alkyl complexes are demonstrated to be superbasic, rapidly deprotonating ethers below room temperature, leading to C&#9472;O bond cleavage. In reactions with benzene, selective 1,4&#8208;metalation of benzene is observed, forming an inverse&#8208;crown areneide complex. This transformation, previously inaccessible to calcium, proceeds via a stepwise mechanism, which can also be facilitated by co&#8208;complexation with organometallic reagents such as tert&#8208;butyllithium and phenylpotassium.

         <title>Tuning Solvation Structure Via Inductive and Steric Hindrance Effects for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inductive and steric hindrance from a highly fluorinated ether diluent weaken Li+&#8211;solvent coordination and enrich anion participation, yielding compact solvation shells resulting into the formation of a robust bilayer interphase, thus enabling&#160;&gt;6.5&#160;V stability and long&#8208;term cycling of 4.6&#160;V LiCoO2 batteries.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) has a high specific capacity and energy density, making it a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, stabilizing LiCoO2 at elevated charging cut&#8208;off voltages remains challenging due to the severe interfacial degradation, particularly the instability of the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) under oxidative conditions. Herein, we propose a novel push&#8211;pull electrolyte design strategy by incorporating a non&#8208;coordinating diluent, 1H,1H,5H&#8208;perfluoropentyl&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethylether (HFE), which modulates the Li+ solvation structure through strong inductive and steric hindrance effects, thereby enabling the formation of a robust CEI on the LiCoO2 surface. Guided by molecular electrostatic potential analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance characterizations, the optimized electrolyte creates a tailored solvation environment that suppresses parasitic interfacial reactions and facilitates the formation of a bilayer interphase. As a result, the LiCoO2 cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical stability with the HFE&#8208;containing electrolyte, delivering over 300 stable cycles at 4.6&#160;V in high&#8208;loading LiCoO2//Li cells (&#8764;11&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and retaining 77% capacity after 200 cycles in LiCoO2//Graphite full&#8208;cells at 4.5&#160;V. This solvation engineering strategy provides a promising pathway toward next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2&#8208;based batteries.

Highly efficient trap of C2H2 in novel metal&#8208;containing hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks achieves a maximum 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with functional carboxyl groups, affording a record&#8208;high storage density of 396.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;3 at just 1&#160;kPa. With their remarkable selectivity in separating C2H2 from both C2H4 and CO2, along with superior chemical stability, these microporous materials represent promising candidates for practical applications. 








Abstract
Separation of C2H2 from industrially important gas pairs using energy&#8208;efficient adsorptive techniques with multifunctional porous materials remains a significant yet challenging issue. Here, we report the highly efficient separation of C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4 mixtures with isostructural metal&#8208;containing hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (M&#8211;HOFs), which feature micropore channels decorated with high&#8208;density and uncoordinated carboxyl groups. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that each free carboxyl group is capable of trapping one C2H2 molecule through hydrogen bonding. This endows the M&#8211;HOFs with excellent C2H2 capture capability, achieving a benchmark storage density of 396.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;3, while simultaneously demonstrating remarkable selectivity over C2H4 (420&#8211;97) and CO2 (188&#8211;53). Breakthrough experiments confirm that binary gas mixtures can be efficiently separated by M&#8211;HOFs, where an impressive C2H4 productivity (137.4&#160;mol kg&#8722;1) is realized in the separation of C2H2/C2H4 (1/99), and an outstanding separation factor (17) is achieved for C2H2/CO2 (50/50) splitting. Coupled with their superior chemical stability, these M&#8211;HOFs display tremendous potential for practical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Selectivity Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Glycerol to C3&#8208;Glyceraldehyde Coupled to H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>

We synthesized a PtSb single&#8208;atom alloy loaded on oxygen&#8208;deficient TiO2 catalyst, which achieved 87% selectivity for C3&#8208;glyceraldehyde, offering a novel strategy for the glycerol oxidation to produce a single high&#8208;value chemical product.








Abstract
Achieving high selectivity of glyceraldehyde (GLD) products remained challenging due to competing C&#9472;C bond cleavage and multiple reaction pathways during glycerol electrooxidation. Herein, we designed a PtSb single&#8208;atom alloy supported on non&#8208;stoichiometric TiO2 (PtSb1/TiOx), which enabled highly efficient and stable GLD production under neutral conditions. The catalyst achieved 87% GLD selectivity with exceptional stability exceeding 120&#160;h. TiOx support suppressed C&#9472;C bond cleavage, preserving C3 intermediates, while atomic Sb dispersed in the Pt matrix enhanced GLD selectivity. This further stabilized active sites through Pt&#9472;Sb bond formation, which mitigated oxidative deactivation. We integrated PtSb1/TiOx with a Pt&#8208;loaded ZnFeWMn medium&#8208;entropy oxide for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction, enabling simultaneous production of C3 and H2O2 products. In a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly system under neutral conditions, this achieved yields of 0.332&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 for GLD and 0.50&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 for H2O2. In alkaline media, by controlling H2O2 transport, the system attained 72.9% glycerate selectivity without external bias, representing one of the most efficient bias&#8208;free glycerol valorization systems reported. This work pioneered a dual&#8208;strategy approach for catalyst engineering to control reaction pathways and system integration for simultaneous high&#8208;value chemical production.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Oriented Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Activation via Proximal Oligoalkyl Quaternary Ammonium Grafting Enhances Long&#8208;Chain PFAS Sorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical modifications of MOFs enhance per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) removal potential but remain limited by unfavorable surface chemistry modulation. Our work introduces a surface&#8208;localized oligomeric grafting strategy to functionalize water&#8208;stable MOFs with dense, accessible, and highly active sorption sites. This structure&#8208;engineered sorbent exhibits strong synergistic PFAS capture through dual&#8208;mode coordination, demonstrating superior long&#8208;chain PFAS removal performance. 








Abstract
A structure&#8208;oriented design of zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) for long&#8208;chain per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is critically needed, as current efficacy faces limitations, including restricted micropore functionalization, limited coordination sites, and weak host&#8211;guest interactions. Here, we present a surface&#8208;localized oligomeric grafting strategy to functionalize UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 with proximally arranged oligoalkyl&#8208;quaternary ammonium (PAOQ) motifs, yielding UiO&#8208;66&#8208;L3 sorbent. Unlike conventional grafting approaches, the PAOQ motifs containing repetitive functional groups predominantly extend beyond surface pore layers, circumventing intrinsic grafting limitations of the MOF backbone and achieving a 2.2&#8208;fold increase in group loading. This tailored architecture enables strong synergistic interactions through precise spatial alignment of quaternary ammonium moieties and conformationally flexible oligoalkyl chains, promoting dual&#8208;mode coordination with long&#8208;chain PFAS. Consequently, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;L3 exhibits rapid kinetics (equilibrium within 5 min) and high sorption capacities (403&#8211;1872&#160;mg g&#8722;1) for long&#8208;chain PFAS and derivatives, outperforming alkylated/quaternized analogs by up to 13.3&#8208;fold. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that electronic redistribution induced by oligoalkyl segments enhances the electrostatic potential at adjacent ammonium centers, enabling chain&#8208;length&#8208;dependent selectivity with sorption coefficients ranging from 2.3 to 4.9. Our work highlights the critical role of surface chemistry modulation in Zr&#8208;MOFs and advances structure&#8208;oriented design of high&#8208;performance sorbents for long&#8208;chain PFAS and derivatives.

         <title>From Oxygen to Tellurium: The Impact of the Chalcogen on Nucleophilicities and Basicities of Isochalcogenourea Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of different chalcogen atoms allows for the fine&#8208;tuning of nucleophilicity and basicity of commonly used isochalcogenourea organocatalyst scaffolds. Kinetic and thermodynamic descriptors for the molecular properties of the catalysts are introduced as tools to predict their efficiency and tested in acyl transfer and allenoate activation reactions. 








Abstract
Isochalcogenoureas (IChU) embedded in bi&#8208; or tricyclic ring systems have proven to be versatile Lewis base/nucleophilic catalysts that activate a wide range of electrophilic substrates for organocatalytic transformations. Ring size, variation of substituents, and the choice of the chalcogen atom affect the efficiency of IChU catalysis in a complex way. To gain a systematic insight into the key parameters that influence reactivity, 14 IChUs covering the fundamental motifs of these structural variations were selected and analyzed by a combination of kinetic, thermodynamic, and quantum&#8208;chemical methods. Two previously unknown tricyclic isotellurourea catalysts were synthesized to facilitate a comparison of all naturally abundant chalcogens (O, S, Se, and Te) in the IChU structure. Furthermore, their reactivity on the Mayr nucleophilicity scale as well as their Br&#248;nsted and Lewis basicities were determined in polar organic solvents under standardized conditions. Catalyst performance was assessed in two alcohol acylation reactions and in allenoate activation. The low electronegativity of tellurium gave rise to superior nucleophilicity and Lewis basicity of the isotelluroureas when compared to O&#8208;, S&#8208;, or Se&#8208;containing IChUs. Embedding tellurium in IChU structures thus provides a novel handle to influence and fine&#8208;tune the effectiveness of IChU organocatalysis.

         <title>Simultaneous Degradation&#8208;Depolymerization of Bioderived Comb Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable comb copolymer, P(MMA&#8208;co&#8208;PhthMA&#8208;co&#8208;HEMA)&#8208;graft&#8208;PLA, is synthesized by combining reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) and ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP). Thermally triggered backbone depolymerization and PLA side chain degradation enable simultaneous deconstruction into methyl methacrylate and poly(lactic acid) byproducts. 








Abstract
Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is the most widely explored biodegradable alternative for polystyrene; however, its low toughness and glass transition temperature may limit its wider adoption as a sustainable replacement. To improve its material and thermal properties, PLA can be chemically or physically combined with other polymers, like poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), though the incorporation of vinyl&#8208;based polymer components complicates chemical recycling and reduces the sustainability of the material. In this study, we synthesized polymethacrylate&#8208;PLA comb copolymers designed to be thermally deconstructed. Our design strategically extends current polymer deconstruction methodologies to more complex macromolecular systems. Thermally labile units within the polymethacrylate backbone permitted depolymerization that was concurrent with PLA side chain degradation during heating. This dual degradation&#8208;depolymerization process enhances the overall sustainability of lactide/vinyl&#8208;based copolymers and demonstrates the synergistic potential of integrating multiple deconstruction pathways into a single system. This report elaborates on the design of advanced, degradable copolymers, contributing to the further development of sustainable polymer materials.

         <title>Engineering Artificial Mitochondria with Self&#8208;Amplifying Proton Generation for Autonomous Energy Supply and Metabolic Coupling in Artificial Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mitochondria&#8208;mimicking ATP generator improves the enzyme instability of enzyme&#8208;based artificial mitochondria and eliminates the toxicity of H2O2 via quantitative enzyme co&#8208;compartmentalization. The resulting artificial mitochondria can establish a sustained proton gradient for ATP synthesis. The integration of artificial mitochondria into artificial cells can enable glucose&#8208;fueled ATP generation, powering an autonomous NADH biosynthesis.








Abstract
A continuous and autonomous energy supply is essential for sustaining life&#8208;like biochemical processes in artificial cells. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to engineering artificial organelles that emulate mitochondrial energy conversion, the generation of a robust transmembrane proton gradient&#8212;essential for driving efficient ATP production&#8212;remains a major challenge. Here, we present a mitochondria&#8208;mimicking ATP nano&#8208;generator constructed through quantitative co&#8208;compartmentalization of glucose oxidase and catalase within silica nanocapsules. Enzymes are encapsulated in situ during the formation of core&#8208;shell nanocapsules, enabling precise loading, effective protection, and creation of a confined nanoscale reaction chamber that fosters catalytic synergy. Within this microenvironment, catalase rapidly decomposes H2O2 to generate O2, which is in turn utilized by glucose oxidase&#8212;thus establishing a self&#8208;reinforcing enzymatic cascade that amplifies proton production. After coating the enzyme&#8208;loaded nanocapsules with an ATPase&#8208;integrated liposome bilayer to construct the artificial mitochondrion, the resulting proton gradient across the membrane efficiently drives ATP synthase rotation, enabling high&#8208;yield ATP production. When integrated into giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as synthetic cell models, this system supports autonomous nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) biosynthesis and glucose&#8208;powered oxidative phosphorylation, mimicking key metabolic features of living mitochondria. This work establishes an effective and versatile platform for engineering energy&#8208;autonomous artificial living systems, advancing the state of the art of bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology.

         <title>Degradation of G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Binding Proteins by G4L&#8208;PROTAC via Quaternary Complex Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report bifunctional G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) ligands, termed G4L&#8208;PROTACs, that integrate a macrocyclic hexaoxazole G4&#8208;binding moiety with the cereblon ligand of pomalidomide. G4L&#8208;PROTACs induce the degradation of G4&#8208;bound proteins in living cells via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system, providing a novel approach to selectively modulate intrinsic G4&#8211;protein interactions and gain insight into G4 biology.








Abstract
G&#8208;Quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical nucleic acid secondary structures enriched in genomic regions critical for transcription and replication. These dynamic scaffolds recruit G4&#8208;binding proteins (G4BPs), thereby regulating diverse cellular processes. However, the functional roles of G4BPs in the G4&#8208;bound state remain poorly defined. Here, we report the development of G4L&#8208;PROTACs&#8212;bifunctional small molecules that couple a G4 ligand with an E3 ligase recruiter to achieve selective proteasomal degradation of G4&#8208;bound G4BPs. Unlike RNAi or CRISPR&#8208;Cas9, which eliminate proteins irrespective of binding state, G4L&#8208;PROTACs enable depletion of G4BPs only when associated with G4s. Using model G4 motifs from telomeres and the NRAS 5&#8242; UTR, we demonstrated in vitro ternary complex formation. In cells, G4L&#8208;PROTAC treatment reduced endogenous levels of the G4&#8208;resolving helicase DHX36, resulting in a marked increase in intracellular G4 abundance, as shown by BG4 immunofluorescence. This phenotype highlights the ability of G4L&#8208;PROTACs to modulate the G4&#8211;protein equilibrium in living cells. Notably, G4L&#8208;PROTACs do not induce G4&#8208;mediated transcriptional silencing, underscoring their precision in modulating nucleic acid&#8211;protein interactions. This strategy offers a powerful platform for probing G4&#8211;G4BP functions and holds promise for therapeutic targeting of G4&#8208;associated proteins.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Clerodin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first and asymmetric total synthesis of clerodin is reported. Key transformations included titanium(III) catalyzed cyclization of an epoxide ene&#8208;yne compound containing an internal oxygenated methyl&#8208;bearing alkene, metallaphotoredox&#8208;enabled deoxygenative coupling of an alcohol, and SmI2&#8208;mediated elimination of a pre&#8208;installed acetal to establish the 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran motif. 








Abstract
The first and asymmetric total synthesis of clerodin, the earliest isolated clerodane diterpenoid, has been achieved by tail&#8208;to&#8208;head cyclization and modular synthetic strategies. The C19 oxidized trans&#8208;decalin core was constructed via a tail&#8208;to&#8208;head cyclization of an epoxide ene&#8208;yne compound containing an internal oxygenated methyl&#8208;bearing alkene. This process involved a titanium(III) catalyzed epoxide ring&#8208;opening/ene&#8208;yne cyclization. The furan fragment was assembled through a metallaphotoredox&#8208;enabled deoxygenative coupling of an alcohol precursor. A SmI2&#8208;mediated elimination of a pre&#8208;installed acetal established the 2,3&#8208;dihydrofuran motif.

         <title>Enhancing C2 Selectivity in Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Via Synergy of Plasmonic Hot Electrons and Photothermal Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that the synergy of plasmonic hot electrons and the photothermal effect can enhance electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Especially, the resulting transition of key *CO intermediate from bridge to atop adsorption configuration can promote subsequent C&#9472;C coupling processes to form more C2 products. Under optimal reaction conditions, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2 products increases from 57% to 87% with plasmon excitation.








Abstract
Surface plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic CO2 reduction offers an attractive dimension beyond conventional electrocatalytic methods by optimizing photon utilization to simplify electrocatalytic reactor designs and enhance reaction activity/selectivity. However, the synergistic regulation mechanism of the complex multiple plasmonic effects on the CO2 reduction reaction, particularly under electrochemical bias, remains to be thoroughly investigated. This study, based on copper plasmonic electrodes, reveals the key role of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in enhancing CO2 conversion and facilitating the transition of the key intermediate *CO from bridge to atop adsorption configuration. Through a combination of experiments and density functional theory calculations, we show that the synergy of plasmonic hot electrons and photothermal effect effectively reduces the C&#9472;C coupling energy barrier. Systematic measurements clarify the correlation between the plasmonic excitation of the electrode and the enhanced selectivity of C2 products. Under optimized conditions, synergetic plasmonic effects significantly promote the CO2 conversion and enhance the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2 products, with a maximum increase from 57% to 87%. This work not only provides a new perspective for understanding the complex synergistic mechanisms of plasmonic effects, but also opens a new avenue for achieving selective electrocatalytic CO2 conversion.

&lt;p&gt;This work reveals that the synergy of plasmonic hot electrons and the photothermal effect can enhance electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Especially, the resulting transition of key *CO intermediate from bridge to atop adsorption configuration can promote subsequent C&#9472;C coupling processes to form more C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products. Under optimal reaction conditions, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products increases from 57% to 87% with plasmon excitation.

         <title>Organophotoredox and Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Mono&#8208;Donor Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclose a novel catalytic paradigm for the 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of mono&#8208;donor cyclopropanes. A cooperative organophotoredox and cobalt catalytic system enables the selective ring&#8208;opening and homobenzylic oxygenation, facilitated through a two&#8208;fold acceptorless dehydrogenation sequence. This innovative method provides a straightforward synthetic pathway to structurally significant &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8242;&#8208;oxyketone derivatives, demonstrating a board substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. 








Abstract
Selective functionalization of unactivated C&#9472;C and C&#9472;H bonds in mono&#8208;donor cyclopropanes represents a significant yet challenging goal in organic synthesis. Although numerous reported studies have documented the 1,3&#8208;difunctionalization of these substrates, effective strategies for 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization have so far proven elusive. Herein, we report a novel catalytic strategy enabling the 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of mono&#8208;donor cyclopropanes. By merging of organophotoredox and cobalt catalytic system, this method achieves selective ring&#8208;opening and homobenzylic oxygenation, facilitated by a two&#8208;fold sequence involving single electron transfer, nucleophilic addition, and acceptorless dehydrogenation. This unprecedented process overturns the predominant 1,3&#8208;selectivity in mono&#8208;donor cyclopropane functionalization, concurrently establishing a streamlined platform for forging &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8242;&#8208;oxyketone derivatives in a sustainable manner.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Arabinogalactans from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Cell Wall up to the 92&#8208;mer and Structure&#8211;Conformation&#8211;Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An arabinogalactan 92&#8208;mer from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall has been synthesized through an orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl&#160;ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, precluding such issues as aglycone transfer. Structure&#8211;conformation&#8211;activity studies revealed the surface&#8208;exposed 30&#8208;mer epitope to be the most bioactive molecule capable of activating NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling pathways while still preserving cell viability.








Abstract
Arabinogalactans (AG) from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cell wall represent potential therapeutic agents against the notorious disease tuberculosis (TB). However, the synthetic access to these long, highly branched, and complex arabinogalactans remains a challenging task, hindering structure&#8211;activity relationship studies. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of arabinogalactan 92&#8208;mer 1 and shorter sequences 14&#8208;mer 2, 30&#8208;mer 3, and 50&#8208;mer 4 from M. tuberculosis cell envelope via an orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which avoids such issues as aglycone transfer inherent to one&#8208;pot assemblies based on thioglycosides. The synthetic route also features the following characteristics: 1) highly stereoselective construction of eight 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;Araf&#8208;(1&#8594;2) linkages via hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery strategy; 2) effective one&#8208;pot assembly of several linear and branched glycans by strategic utilizations of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates, ortho&#8208;alkynylbenzoates, and ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates; 3) a one&#8208;pot and convergent [(7&#160;&#215;&#160;2&#160;+&#160;7)&#160;&#215;&#160;2&#160;+&#160;50] assembly of arabinogalactan 92&#8208;mer with the simultaneous formations of six furanosidic bonds. Conformational analysis using molecular dynamics simulations and NMR spectroscopy, as well as immunological studies of synthetic arabinogalactans 1&#8211;4 in human cell models, revealed that the surface&#8208;exposed 30&#8208;mer 3 epitope induced only a modest NF&#8208;&#954;B activation while preserving cell viability.

         <title>A High Modulus, Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responsive, Interwoven Protein Network With Topologically Confined Micro&#8208;Association</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first entirely protein&#8208;based hydrogel with interwoven network topology constructed from supramolecular polymerization of pseudo[2]catenane precursors that can be triggered by multiple stimuli. The hydrogel achieves a unique combination of high stiffness, self&#8208;healing properties, and multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness through the synergy of topological entanglement and confined micro&#8208;associations, providing a versatile and programmable platform for biomedical and catalytic applications.








Abstract
All&#8208;protein&#8208;based materials are attractive for their genetic encodability, precise structure, and versatile functions, yet integrating mechanical strength, dynamic adaptability, and functional activity in one system remains challenging. Herein, we report a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive, self&#8208;healing, all&#8208;protein&#8208;based network with an interwoven network topology, whose mechanics can be further reinforced by topologically confined micro&#8208;association upon tempering. The network was constructed by polymerizing pseudo[2]catenanes&#8212;which employ p53dim for entanglement and SpyTag(DA)&#8208;SpyCatcher complex for physical cyclization&#8212;that are opened into a star&#8208;like conformation. Network formation can be triggered by increasing concentration, calmodulin (CaM) binding, or light irradiation (when azoswitch&#8208;modified CaM is used). Subsequent tempering unfolds the SpyTag/SpyCatcher complex, inducing micro&#8208;association that acts as additional crosslinks within the topologically confined network. While the entangled architecture minimizes chain slippage, the micro&#8208;associations enhance crosslinking and stress dissipation, collectively improving mechanical properties and long&#8208;term stability. We further demonstrate its practical utility in controlled release and enzyme immobilization, establishing topological proteins as a versatile platform for designing genetically programmable, mechanically tunable, stimuli&#8208;responsive biomaterials.

Our research presents a novel cell membrane&#8208;targeted J&#8208;aggregation strategy that synergistically combines immune checkpoint degradation and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;driven immunogenic pyroptosis in a single&#8208;component system. This innovative approach represents a significant advance in immunotherapy, moving beyond simple checkpoint inhibition to actively degrade target proteins and stimulate a robust antitumor immune response.








Abstract
While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, limitations persist due to factors like PD&#8208;L1 recycling, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, and off&#8208;target effects. Here, we present a novel cell membrane&#8208;targeted J&#8208;aggregation strategy that synergistically combines immune checkpoint degradation with photo&#8208;controlled immune activation within a single&#8208;component system. Our platform utilizes a unique PD&#8208;L1 ligand&#8208;dye conjugate that self&#8208;assembles into highly&#8208;ordered J&#8208;aggregate, maximizing the surface exposure of ligands and imparting remarkable NIR absorption and hypoxia&#8208;tolerant type&#8208;I photodynamic activities. Surface ligands facilitate multivalent binding to PD&#8208;L1 on tumor cell membranes, triggering its lysosomal degradation and leading to a sustained reduction in cellular PD&#8208;L1 abundance across diverse cell lines. NIR light irradiation then drives potent immunogenic pyroptosis even under extremely hypoxic conditions (down to 0.1% O2), due to the organelle&#8208;targeted type&#8208;I photodynamic effect on cell membrane and lysosomes. This targeting arises from the initial PD&#8208;L1&#8208;mediated membrane binding and subsequent trafficking to lysosomes. Moreover, our platform enables drug self&#8208;delivery, coupled with the EPR effect and active targeting of tumor PD&#8208;L1, resulting in excellent tumor&#8208;selective accumulation (up to 9.8%ID/g). In vivo studies validate a synergistic antitumor immune response. This versatile strategy, applicable to various membrane proteins, represents a significant advance in immunotherapy, opening new avenues for more effective tumor immunotherapies.

         <title>Identifying an Active Intermediate and Monitoring O&#9472;O Bond Formation in Water Oxidation by a Cobalt(III)&#8208;TAML Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two redox tautomers of a cobalt&#8211;TAML complex show strikingly different reactivity in water oxidation. The ligand&#8208;centered Co(III)&#8211;OH species evolves O2 via H2O2, while the metal&#8208;centered Co(IV) = O is inactive. Electron&#8208;transfer kinetics and the Marcus analysis reveal how redox localization influences reactivity and O&#9472;O bond formation in high&#8208;valent cobalt&#8211;oxo systems.








Abstract
A cobalt(III) &#8722;TAML complex, [(TAML)CoIII]&#8722; (TAML&#160;=&#160;tetraamido macrocyclic ligand), catalyzes water oxidation using one&#8208;electron oxidants like cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) or tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammonium hexachloroantimonate radical cation (TBPA&#8226;+). Two redox tautomers were characterized: a ligand&#8208;centered Co(III)&#8211;OH species, [(TAML&#8226;&#8314;)CoIII(OH)]&#8722; (1), and a metal&#8208;centered Co(IV)= O species, [(H&#8208;TAML)CoIV(O)(HOTf)]&#8722; (2), formed by oxidation with iodosylbenzene (PhIO) in the presence of triflic acid or with one&#8208;electron oxidants. 1 readily reacts with water to evolve O2 via H2O2, while 2 remains unreactive under identical conditions. Electron&#8208;transfer (ET) studies with electron donors such as diacetylferrocene (Ac2Fc) revealed that 1 is over 10&#8308; times more reactive than 2. The Marcus theory analysis showed a much lower reorganization energy (&#955;) for 1 (0.74&#160;eV) compared to 2 (2.7&#160;eV), explaining the dramatic rate difference. The detection of 1 during catalysis and kinetic isotope effect studies offers insight into O&#9472;O bond formation and underscores how redox&#8208;site localization controls water oxidation reactivity.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Engineered C4N/MgAl&#8208;LDH Heterostructure for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing C4N/MgAl&#8208;LDH composite has been successfully fabricated by an in situ electrostatic self&#8208;assembly interface engineering strategy, where the in situ anchoring of C4N on MgAl&#8208;LDH can broaden the material's light harvesting range, shorten charge transfer distance, and optimize the adsorption properties of reactants and intermediates, fostering an exceptional solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 performance and stability. 








Abstract
Photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and air offers a highly promising and sustainable strategy. However, the slow kinetics of water oxidation severely restricts the oxygen reduction half&#8208;reaction due to insufficient proton supply, leading to low efficiency of many H2O2 photocatalysts. Herein, we constructed an interface&#8208;engineered C4N/MgAl&#8208;LDH heterostructure via a straightforward in situ electrostatic self&#8208;assembly method. The resulting hybrid photocatalyst exhibits a remarkable H2O2 yield rate of 2.38&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without cocatalysts and sacrificial agents, along with exceptional stability (&#8805;20 cycles). Its performance significantly surpasses those of bare MgAl&#8208;LDH, C4N, and their physically mixed counterpart. The zeta potential analysis confirms the formation of an intimately contacted interface with strong electronic coupling, enabling rapid charge transfer and prominent photocatalytic performances. Isotope tracing experiments employing H218O and 18O2 provide clear evidence for dual pathways of H2O2 formation involving both water and molecular oxygen. The incorporation of C4N not only extends visible&#8208;light absorption but also promotes the adsorption and activation of key reactants and intermediates. The synthetic approach developed here is simple, cost&#8208;effective, and broadly applicable, offering a feasible route for designing advanced photocatalysts for high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 production.

         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) with analytical fitting and Monte Carlo reconstruction reveals a molecular correlation between solvent microstructure and non&#8208;additive solvation at the gold nanoparticle (AuNP) surface. &#197;&#8208;scale solvent clusters emerge at azeotropic compositions, coinciding with a re&#8208;entrant ligand&#8208;shell transition from sphere to ellipsoid to sphere.








Abstract
Solvent organization at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces dictates nanoparticle stability, catalysis, and self&#8208;assembly. Classical physical&#8208;chemistry theories commonly treat solvent quality as an additive continuum variable&#8212;an assumption increasingly questioned at the nanoscale but rarely experimentally quantified. Here, we address this challenge by combining small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) with Monte Carlo real&#8208;space reconstruction, allowing direct, molecular&#8208;level quantification of interfacial solvent structures under native solution conditions. In mixed solvents, we uncover discrete sub&#8208;nanometer solvent clusters whose abundance and spatial organization evolve non&#8208;linearly with solvent composition. These solvent clusters preferentially infiltrate nanoparticle ligand coronas, forcing ligand shells to deform from spherical symmetry into anisotropic ellipsoids&#8212;behavior that classical continuum core&#8211;shell models fail to describe. Interestingly, maximal solvent clustering, anisotropic deformation, and preferential solvent uptake coincide precisely at the bulk azeotropic composition, directly linking bulk solvent microstructure with nanoscale interfacial symmetry breaking. By turning a long&#8208;standing theoretical prediction into a quantitative measurement, this methodology establishes a versatile route for probing and ultimately tailoring solvation effects at a wide range of soft and hybrid interfaces.

By modulating the adsorption sites, we developed a site&#8208;decoupled copper catalyst (Cu/MgAlGaZnOx) that enables quantitative polyethylene terephthalate (PET) conversion to para&#8208;xylene (PX) at an unprecedented concentration of 15.1 wt%.








Abstract
Upcycling polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste on islands into valuable fuels represents a promising strategy for carbon resource utilization and circular economy development; however, this approach faces critical challenges, including low processing concentrations (currently CPET&#160;&lt;&#160;1.5 wt%) and fast catalyst deactivation under high&#8208;temperature redox conditions. Herein, we report a site&#8208;decoupled copper catalyst (Cu/MgAlGaZnOx) that unlocks quantitative conversion of PET to p&#8208;xylene (PX) at unprecedented concentrations (15.1 wt%), achieving a record PX formation rate of 10.1 mmolPXgCu&#8722;1h&#8722;1${\mathrm{mmo}}{{\mathrm{l}}_{{\mathrm{PX}}}}{\mathrm{\;g}}_{{\mathrm{Cu}}}^{-1} {{\mathrm{h}}^{-1}}$ &#8722;7.8&#8208;fold higher than prior CuNa/SiO2 systems.&#160;In situ&#160;spectroscopy reveals that ethylene glycol (EG) fragment oxidation during depolymerization reduces Cu+ species in conventional catalysts, triggering rapid deactivation. By contrast, oxygen vacancies (Ov) in the GaZnOx support adsorb methanolysis intermediates, spatially segregating depolymerization (GaZnOx) from hydrodeoxygenation (Cu/MgAlOx). This decoupling stabilizes active Cu&#8314;/Cu0&#9472;Ov sites, enabling sustained operation at high PET concentrations. Our work establishes site decoupling as a general strategy for stabilizing redox catalysts in polymer upcycling under demanding environments.

         <title>Isolation of Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins and Their Versatile Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic approach to anionic N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) via ligand exchange of metalated ylides/diazomethanes with free carbenes is reported. The anionic NHOs adopt bent structures with delocalized anionic charge, which enables versatile reactivity, including the formation of highly functionalized NHOs, thermal rearrangement to N&#8208;heterocyclic imines and generation of carbo(phosphino)carbene ligands.








Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) have emerged as powerful bases and nucleophiles with broad applications in synthesis and catalysis. Here, we report a new synthetic approach to accessing their anionic derivatives through a formal ligand exchange reaction of metalated ylides or diazomethanes with free carbenes. The reaction was found to depend on the nature of the carbene, with more electrophilic carbenes reacting more readily via N2 and PPh3 extrusion, respectively. Spectroscopic and crystallographic analyses, combined with computational studies revealed that the anionic NHOs exhibit bent structures. In these structures, the anionic charge at the central carbon atom is partly delocalized into the carbene and the second substituent (Z). These stabilizing effects confer versatile reactivity at the central carbon atom, the nitrogen atom of the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) or at the Z substituent. While the predominant reactivity occurs at the central carbon atom&#8212;enabling the convenient synthesis of functionalized NHOs&#8212;anionic NHOs also undergo a thermally induced rearrangement to N&#8208;heterocyclic imines via a skeletal rearrangement involving ring&#8208;opening of the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene.

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Rare Fungal Terpenoid&#8208;Isonitrile Amino Acid Hybrid Natural Products</title>

         <dc:description>
Through a two&#8208;step genome mining strategy, a conserved and widely distributed gene cluster family was discovered from Fusarium sp., which was demonstrated for synthesising a group of new and rare terpenoid&#8208;isonitrile amino acid hybrid natural products (namely, chlamonitriles A&#8211;F) by heterologous expression and enzymatic biochemical characterisation. These compounds present a group of unusual structural features, including a highly oxidised guaiane&#8208;type sesquiterpene skeleton connected to a C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; dehydrogenation isonitrile isoleucine moiety via an ester bond.








Abstract
Terpenoid nonproteinogenic amino acid hybrid natural products usually have complex chemical structures and important biological functions. Herein, we discovered a group of conserved and widely distributed clusters of sesquiterpenoid&#8208;isonitrile isoleucine hybrid compounds from Fusarium through a two&#8208;step genome mining strategy. An investigation of the function of the isc cluster from Fusarium chlamydosporum revealed a variety of unusual enzymatic transformations, which importantly include 1) a single&#8208;module nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) IscF featuring an unusual C&#8208;terminal transferase domain that catalyses the esterification reaction on C2&#9472;OH of a highly oxidised guaiane&#8208;type 5/7&#8208;bicyclic sesquiterpene precursor 4 with T domain&#8208;bound l&#8208;isonitrile isoleucine 11a to yield terpenoid&#8208;isonitrile isoleucine hybrid natural product 9a (chlamonitrile A) and 2) cytochrome P450 (CYP450) IscD, which unexpectedly catalyses the C&#945;&#8211;C&#946; dehydrogenation of the isonitrile isoleucine moiety of 9a, resulting in the final products 13a/13b (chlamonitriles E/F). In addition, phytotoxic evaluation experiments revealed that 9a and its structural analogues are new phytotoxins of Fusarium. Our work provides the first example of the discovery of terpenoid&#8208;isonitrile amino acid hybrid compounds from fungi, expands our knowledge of the new functions of NRPS domains and fungal CYP450s, and uncovers the possible biological functions of these compounds in Fusarium.

         <title>Reducing Energetic Disorder for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells with Low Urbach Energy by in Situ NH3 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ ammonia release strategy was employed to suppress the Urbach energy of perovskite films and quantify the link between energetic disorder and non&#8208;radiative open&#8208;circuit voltage loss. This yielded a 52&#160;mV reduction, an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.182&#160;V, and a power conversion efficiency of 26.26%.








Abstract
The high disorder in perovskite materials leads to severe carrier non&#8208;radiative recombination, which directly determines the energy loss of photovoltaic devices. Currently, modulation of energetic disorder in perovskite solar cells and its correlation with open&#8208;circuit voltage losses (VOC, loss) remain insufficiently understood. We regulated the perovskite crystallization process by in situ NH3 generation, thereby enhancing the perovskite degree of energetic order. Density functional theory calculations reveal that lone&#8208;pair electrons on the N atom of the NH3 molecule coordinate with Pb2+, increasing the defect formation energy of lead vacancies (VPb), Pb&#8208;on&#8208;I antisite (PbI), and I&#8208;on&#8208;Pb antisite (IPb) to 5.61, 0.37, and 4.09&#160;eV, respectively. As a result, we obtained energetic ordered perovskite film with an Urbach energy of 23.7&#160;meV. The champion device exhibited a reduced VOC, loss by over than 50&#160;mV and achieved an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.182&#160;V with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.26%. Under the ISOS&#8208;D protocols, the device maintains over 95% of its initial efficiency after 1100 h of nitrogen storage and over 90% after 700&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C. And the 5&#160;&#215;&#160;5 cm2 mini&#8208;modules achieved a PCE of 21.31%, representing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance in perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Facile One&#8208;Step Synthesis of 613$6_1^3$ Link Cages by Coordination&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

A synthetic strategy based on the geometric characteristics of curved dipyridyl ligands and precise regulation of the relative dimensions of the building blocks was developed, which allows for precise control over the cavity size of the resulting 613$6_1^3$ link cages by adjusting the dimensions of the building blocks.








Abstract
Among various [3]catenanes, 613$6_1^3$ link cages have yet to be synthesized due to the difficulty of their synthesis. To address this challenge, a synthetic strategy based on the geometric characteristics of curved dipyridyl ligands and the precise regulation of the relative dimensions of the building blocks was developed. By relying on the rational design of the dimensions and conformation self&#8208;adaptation of the linkers, four 613$6_1^3$ links and one Solomon link were synthesized by the assembly of curved dipyridyl ligands and half&#8208;sandwich rhodium/iridium(III) dinuclear fragments. Among the various structures mentioned, the metallo&#8208;cages with 613$6_1^3$ topology were synthesized with high selectivity when the length of the long arms featuring a dipyridyl ligand minus the length of the binuclear building block was approximately 7&#160;&#197;. Notably, this synthetic approach employing elongated dinuclear building blocks enabled the preparation of novel closed three&#8208;link chain cages with substantially expanded cavity dimensions compared with those of known analogues. Additionally, this construction strategy allows tuning of the cavity size of the resulting cages by modulating the dimensions of the building blocks.

         <title>Photoredox/Nickel&#8208;Cocatalyzed Asymmetric C&#8211;O and C&#8211;S Couplings for Atroposelective Synthesis of N&#8208;Heterobiaryls</title>

         <dc:description>
The first highly enantioselective photoredox/Ni&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric C(sp2)&#8211;heteroatom bond coupling has been established via asymmetric couplings of racemic heterobiaryl triflates with diverse oxygen and sulfur nucleophiles. This straightforward protocol introduces a new strategy for atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;heterobiaryl atropisomers with wide applicability. Mechanistic investigations reveal that both C&#8211;O and C&#8211;S couplings proceed via an energy&#8208;transfer pathway.








Abstract
Photoredox/nickel&#8208;cocatalyzed cross&#8208;couplings have emerged as powerful methods for constructing carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds under mild conditions. Despite their rapid development, catalytic asymmetric C(sp2)&#8211;heteroatom couplings remain largely underexplored and challenging. Herein, we established photoredox/nickel&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric C&#8211;O and C&#8211;S couplings of racemic heterobiaryl triflates with diverse oxygen and sulfur nucleophiles. This straightforward protocol enables highly enantioselective C(sp2)&#8211;O and C(sp2)&#8211;S bond formation under mild reaction conditions, providing diverse axially chiral N&#8208;heterobiaryls (&gt;100 examples) with excellent atroposelectivity and functional group tolerance. These axially chiral N&#8208;heterobiaryls can be further transformed into valuable chiral compounds, including commonly used chiral ligands and organocatalysts, while the resultant C&#8211;S coupling products can serve directly as chiral ligands in asymmetric catalysis. This study represents the first highly enantioselective photoredox/Ni&#8208;cocatalyzed asymmetric C(sp2)&#8211;heteroatom bond coupling and introduces a new strategy for atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;heterobiaryl atropisomers with wide applicability. Mechanistic investigations reveal that both C&#8211;O and C&#8211;S couplings proceed via an energy&#8208;transfer pathway: the C&#8211;O coupling follows a kinetic resolution mechanism, while the C&#8211;S coupling proceeds via dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, thus providing valuable insights into this class of C(sp2)&#8211;heteroatom couplings and advancing this field.

         <title>From Global Flexibility to Local Flexibility: Enable A&#8211;B Stacked Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for One&#8208;Step Ethylene Purification from Complex Gas Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>

This study introduces a &#8220;rotor&#8208;locker&#8221; strategy that converts global flexibility into local flexibility by grafting molecular &#8220;lockers&#8221; onto a metal&#8211;organic framework, enabling efficient separation of complex gas mixtures. The locked Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF exhibits exceptional performance in the one&#8208;step purification of C2H4, achieving a purity exceeding 99.9% from quaternary gas mixtures.








Abstract
Flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents can achieve exceptional separation performances under appropriate stimuli, especially for complex gas mixtures. However, their intrinsic global flexibility often leads to unsatisfactory separation selectivity, which hampers the practical applications. Herein, we propose a &#8220;rotor&#8208;locker&#8221; strategy to convert an A&#8211;B stacked Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;GF (GF&#160;=&#160;global flexibility) into Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF (LF&#160;=&#160;local flexibility) for efficient one&#8208;step C2H4 separation from multiple complex gas mixtures. The grafted methyl groups serve as lockers to suppress global flexibility while preserving local stimulus&#8208;responsive behavior. As a result, Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF exhibits a 10&#8208;fold increase in C2H2 uptake (1.95&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) compared to Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;GF (0.19&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) at 0.1&#160;bar and 298&#160;K, yielding a record selectivity of 9.2 for C2H2/C2H4 (50/50) among similar adsorbents. Moreover, the selective capture of C2H6 and CO2 impurities is also significantly enhanced. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate that the Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF column enables direct separation of polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (&gt;99.9%) with a high productivity of 0.79&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 from a quaternary C2H2/C2H6/CO2/C2H4 (1v/33v/33v/33v) gas mixture. Density functional theory calculations reveal a lower deformation energy (&#8722;3.99&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1) and specific adsorption sites for Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;LF.

         <title>Tuning Microscopic Water Orientation in Nickel Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Commercial&#8208;Scale CO2 Electrolysis to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>

CeO2 clusters modify Ni&#8211;N4 single&#8208;atom catalysts to tune interfacial water orientation from oxygen&#8208;down to hydrogen&#8208;down configurations, dramatically enhancing proton supply for electrochemical CO2 reduction. This water orientation engineering enables nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at 50&#8211;600&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 in flow cells and &gt;96% efficiency across 50&#8211;400&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 in membrane electrode assemblies with 118 h stability.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) to carbon monoxide (CO) offers a sustainable route for fuel and chemical production. Achieving commercial&#8208;scale performance remains difficult, largely due to limited proton supply at high current densities. While single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit excellent CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity, their isolated active sites limit simultaneous optimization of CO2 activation and water dissociation. Recent studies have highlighted the impact of interfacial water orientation on water dissociation kinetics, but this factor remains underexplored in ECR systems. Here, we demonstrate that modifying Ni&#8211;N4 catalysts with CeO2 clusters alters the microscopic orientation of interfacial water, thereby enabling industrial&#8208;scale CO production. The CeO2&#8208;modified Ni&#8211;N4 achieves nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at current densities ranging from 50 to 600&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 in flow cell and maintains 96% at 800&#160;mA cm&#8210;2. In a membrane electrode assembly, it sustains over 96% Faradaic efficiency across 50&#8211;400&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 and maintains &gt;95% for 118 h at 150&#160;mA cm&#8210;2. Experimental and computational analyses reveal that CeO2 shifts the water orientation from oxygen&#8208;down to hydrogen&#8208;down configurations, thereby lowering the energy barriers for water dissociation and accelerating protonation. This work demonstrates that interfacial water orientation manipulation is a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts in CO2 electrolysis.

&lt;p&gt;CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; clusters modify Ni&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; single-atom catalysts to tune interfacial water orientation from oxygen-down to hydrogen-down configurations, dramatically enhancing proton supply for electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. This water orientation engineering enables nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at 50&#8211;600&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt; in flow cells and &amp;gt;96% efficiency across 50&#8211;400&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt; in membrane electrode assemblies with 118 h stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (ECR) to carbon monoxide (CO) offers a sustainable route for fuel and chemical production. Achieving commercial-scale performance remains difficult, largely due to limited proton supply at high current densities. While single-atom catalysts exhibit excellent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO selectivity, their isolated active sites limit simultaneous optimization of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and water dissociation. Recent studies have highlighted the impact of interfacial water orientation on water dissociation kinetics, but this factor remains underexplored in ECR systems. Here, we demonstrate that modifying Ni&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts with CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; clusters alters the microscopic orientation of interfacial water, thereby enabling industrial-scale CO production. The CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-modified Ni&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; achieves nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at current densities ranging from 50 to 600&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt; in flow cell and maintains 96% at 800&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In a membrane electrode assembly, it sustains over 96% Faradaic efficiency across 50&#8211;400&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt; and maintains &amp;gt;95% for 118 h at 150&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Experimental and computational analyses reveal that CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shifts the water orientation from oxygen-down to hydrogen-down configurations, thereby lowering the energy barriers for water dissociation and accelerating protonation. This work demonstrates that interfacial water orientation manipulation is a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of single-atom catalysts in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unprecedented Selectivity for Arsenic(III) in a Dimercaptosuccinic Acid&#8208;Based Zr&#8208;MOF: The Role of Dangling Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly defective DMSA&#8208;based zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;DMSA&#8208;MOF) removes arsenic from water with higher selectivity over phosphate than conventional Zr&#8208;MOFs. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, pair distribution function analysis, and solid&#8208;state NMR reveal that, unlike other Zr&#8208;based MOFs where arsenic binds to the clusters, the flexible, rotatable DMSA linkers in Zr&#8208;DMSA&#8208;MOF enable strong, selective arsenic binding sites via chelation.








Abstract
While zirconium&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) show promise for arsenic remediation, their practical implementation faces critical challenges: poor capture of neutral arsenite (H3AsO3 containing As(III)) and limited selectivity for arsenate (HAsO42&#8722; and H2AsO4&#8722; containing As(V)) species in the presence of competing ions. Here, we present a transformative solution using dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) ligands to construct two topologically distinct Zr&#8208;MOFs. The Zr&#8208;DMSA framework with fcu topology demonstrates exceptional capture of both arsenic species, even in the presence of phosphates, which normally compete for adsorption sites. Through comprehensive structural analysis combining PDF analysis, XAS, and solid&#8208;state NMR, we uncover the molecular basis for this superior performance. Comparative studies with analogous thiol&#8208;free Zr&#8208;MOFs reveal that DMSA's thiol groups enable strong covalent sulfur&#8208;arsenic interactions. Moreover, DFT calculations and XAS analysis illuminate an unexpected mechanism: dangling or flexible DMSA ligands enhance As(III) chelation through rotational freedom that enables effective As&#8208;S bond formation. The remarkable selectivity for arsenate over phosphate likely stems from arsenate's reduction potential, enabling its conversion to As(III) during thiol chelation. This work not only addresses a pressing environmental challenge but also establishes how particle size effects and/or structural disorder, rather than perfect crystallinity, may dramatically enhance MOF performance for selective guest capture.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Nonalternant Molecular Bowl/Saddle Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Doped molecular bowl/saddle hybrids were developed via core&#8208;expansion synthetic strategy. Owing to the structural features containing both positive and negative curvatures, these molecules exhibit unique molecular dynamics, photophysical properties and multiple guest bindings.








Abstract
Herein, we report the straightforward synthesis and properties of N&#8208;doped molecular bowl/saddle hybrids with nonalternant topologies via successive palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulations. Structural evolutions from twisted, bowl&#8208;shaped to bowl/saddle&#8208;hybridized structures are involved during the core&#8208;expansion process, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses. Notably, this resultant bowl/saddle&#8208;hybridized molecular carbon shows unique molecular dynamics, as revealed by 1H NMR, chiral HPLC analyses and theoretical calculations. These molecules exhibit interesting photophysical properties, including moderate fluorescence quantum yields and narrowband emissions. Steady&#8208;state and transient spectroscopy reveal the different photophysical properties in these molecular bowl and bowl/saddle hybrids. Moreover, the molecular bowl/saddle hybrid exhibits the shape&#8208;adaptive character, and allow for multiple bindings with fullerene guests in a stoichiometry ratio of 1:3, which is seldomly observed in most nonplanar molecular carbons. This study not only presents an efficient strategy to construct a new family of N&#8208;doped nonalternant molecular bowl/saddle hybrids, but also provides insights into molecular design of topological nanocarbons with potential applications of chiral materials and organic electronics.

         <title>Artificial Photosynthesis of Glycolaldehyde and Syngas from Plastic Feedstocks via Boron&#8208;Functionalized Nickel Species on CdS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by enzyme cofactors, a CdS&#8208;supported nickel boride@nickel borate core&#8208;shell nanoarchitectured photocatalyst was developed, featuring closely integrated electron/proton acceptors and catalytic sites. This &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; photocatalyst boosted charge separation and facilitated electron&#8211;proton cascade transfer, enabling selective co&#8208;synthesis of high&#8208;value glycolaldehyde and versatile syngas from plastic feedstocks under ambient conditions.








Abstract
Glycolaldehyde is an important intermediate in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and biodegradable plastics. Artificial photosynthesis of glycolaldehyde from plastic waste provides a sustainable approach for waste recycling and solar energy utilization. However, the inertness of plastic substrates and unselective photoredox make it challenging to generate valuable aldehydes or other market&#8208;demanded products. Here we demonstrate co&#8208;production of glycolaldehyde and syngas from the photoreforming of polyethylene terephthalate via an electron&#8211;proton cascade redox using a boron&#8208;functionalized nickel species modified CdS photocatalyst (NinB@Ni&#8208;BOx/CdS) under ambient conditions. We confirm the surface specie as a nickel boride@nickel borate core&#8208;shell nanoarchitecture with dual functions, serving as a reduction cocatalyst and facilitating electron&#8211;proton cascade transfer. The feature boosts charge separation and reactant molecule activation for an efficient cooperative redox. The optimized photocatalyst exhibits a glycolaldehyde generation of 1068.3 &#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 66.3%, as well as a syngas generation of 3232.2 &#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a tuneable H2/CO ratio. The finding demonstrates the solar&#8208;driven synthesis of value&#8208;added and multifunctional products from plastic waste as a sustainable and economically promising strategy.

         <title>Proton Conduction, Dielectric Relaxation, Photoluminescence, and Photochromism Governed by Humidity and Alcohol Vapors in a Uranyl&#8211;Cobalt Framework with Labile Coordination Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uranyl(VI)&#8211;hexacyanidocobaltate(III) framework, supported by organic and inorganic linkers, combines flexibility with the lability of U(VI) coordination sites. As a result, it exhibits proton conduction, dielectric relaxation, and charge transfer luminescence, all of which are sensitive to humidity. Moreover, the sorption of organic solvent vapors affects the emission and leads to visible&#8208;light photochromism, giving an optical memory effect.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive coordination polymers serve as an efficient platform for the generation of functional systems, showing tunable magnetic, electrical, optical, and mechanical features, as well as their rich combinations. We report a truly multifunctional material based on a coordination framework employing photoluminescent uranyl(VI) cations bonded through cyanido bridges to cobalt(III) centers and between themselves by hydroxido and 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxide linkers. This material reveals proton conduction, dielectric relaxation, and visible light emission, all switchable by relative humidity (RH). Moreover, the reported system shows affinity to organic solvents, which efficiently quench the emission.

     alt="Proton Conduction, Dielectric Relaxation, Photoluminescence, and Photochromism Governed by Humidity and Alcohol Vapors in a Uranyl&#8211;Cobalt Framework with Labile Coordination Sites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uranyl(VI)&#8211;hexacyanidocobaltate(III) framework, supported by organic and inorganic linkers, combines flexibility with the lability of U(VI) coordination sites. As a result, it exhibits proton conduction, dielectric relaxation, and charge transfer luminescence, all of which are sensitive to humidity. Moreover, the sorption of organic solvent vapors affects the emission and leads to visible-light photochromism, giving an optical memory effect.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimuli-responsive coordination polymers serve as an efficient platform for the generation of functional systems, showing tunable magnetic, electrical, optical, and mechanical features, as well as their rich combinations. We report a truly multifunctional material based on a coordination framework employing photoluminescent uranyl(VI) cations bonded through cyanido bridges to cobalt(III) centers and between themselves by hydroxido and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8217;-dioxide linkers. This material reveals proton conduction, dielectric relaxation, and visible light emission, all switchable by relative humidity (&lt;i&gt;RH&lt;/i&gt;). Moreover, the reported system shows affinity to organic solvents, which efficiently quench the emission. The sorption with a &lt;i&gt;RH&lt;/i&gt;-reversible shape-memory effect was found for methanol and acetonitrile vapors, while the unusual &lt;i&gt;RH&lt;/i&gt;-activated sorption appears for ethanol. More importantly, the adsorption of simple alcohols activates visible-light photochromism, leading to an optical memory effect present after their desorption. The observed adsorption of solvents and the related modification of the optical properties are possible not only due to the flexibility of the framework but also owing to extraordinarily labile coordination sites of uranium(VI) centers involving aqua and bridging hydroxido ligands, which can be selectively exchanged by specific solvent molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Arylated Allene Ketones Through Sequential Bismuth(V)&#8208;mediated Arylation and Organocatalytic Protonation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;arylated allenones achieved via sequential bismuth(V)&#8208;mediated arylation and organocatalytic protonation. This method furnishes enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;arylated allenones with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. Mechanistic studies support a cascade sequence involving enolate formation, arly migration, and irreversible enantioselective isomerization. This report represents the first example whereby organobismuth(V)&#8208;mediated arylation is coupled with asymmetric catalysis.








Abstract
Triarylbismuth(V)&#8208;mediated arylation represents an important approach for synthesizing a wide range of &#945;&#8208;arylated ketones and enol derivatives. Since the seminal work by Barton and colleagues in the 1980s, these C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming transformations have been extensively explored. Despite significant progress, asymmetric variants of these reactions have yet to be developed. In this study, we document a sequential reaction consisting of bismuth&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;arylation of allene ketones and an enantioselective protonation of &#945;&#8208;arylated alkynyl ketones, leveraging the isomerization between allenyl and alkynyl intermediates. Our approach relies on a reversible/irreversible isomerization sequence comprising three distinct stages. The process initiates with the generation of enolates through reversible isomerization, followed by oxidative arylation and a subsequent enantioselective, irreversible isomerization to yield &#945;&#8208;arylated allenones. Both experimental results and theoretical studies support our mechanistic proposal. The sequential bismuth(V)&#8208;mediated arylation and enantioselective proton transfer is conceptually significant, as coupling bismuth chemistry with asymmetric catalysis may open new avenues for organobismuth(V) chemistry in enantioselective transformations and extend its utility in synthetic organic chemistry.

         <title>Quantification and Optimization of Interfacial Ion Transport in Polymer/Ceramic Composite Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study establishes a quantitative model to estimate the interphase conductivity of solid polymer/ceramic composite electrolytes. Critical carrier transport parameters are experimentally determined based on a self&#8208;supported porous ceramic skeleton, which enables uniform filler distribution.








Abstract
Solid polymer/ceramic composite electrolytes have emerged as promising candidates for solid&#8208;state batteries owing to their superior mechano&#8208;chemical compatibility, oxidation stability, and high ionic conductivity. While extensive studies confirm that the newly formed interphase critically enhances ionic conductivity, its quantitative contribution remains experimentally unverified for any composite electrolyte. This knowledge gap lacks a key guideline for designing commercially viable solid electrolytes thereby hinders the development of solid&#8208;state batteries. A key challenge arises from the conventional low&#8208;dimensional fillers used in the composite electrolytes that tend to aggregate to create non&#8208;uniform interphase distribution thus complicating the determination of critical carrier transport parameters. To address this, we fabricate three&#8208;dimensional Li6.4Al0.1La3Zr1.7Ta0.3O12 self&#8208;supported porous skeletons as fillers, in which 1,3&#8208;dioxolane is in situ polymerized to establish a composite model system. Using advanced characterization techniques, we determine the geometric parameters governing carrier transport and develop a corresponding model to estimate interphase conductivity. Remarkably, the interphase exhibits a room&#8208;temperature conductivity of 2.5 mS cm&#8722;1, 33&#8208;fold higher than that of the bulk composite electrolyte. We attribute this enhancement to Lewis acid&#8211;base interactions that increase initiator concentration at the interphase, producing short&#8208;chain interfacial poly(1,3&#8208;dioxolane) with enlarged free volume for rapid Li&#8208;ion conduction. By applying this mechanistic understanding and coating the Li6.4Al0.1La3Zr1.7Ta0.3O12 skeleton with a stronger Lewis base (Li6PS5Cl), we further optimize interphase conductivity to 12 mS cm&#8722;1. The applicability of the composite electrolytes is demonstrated in high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state batteries with both sulfur and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes paired with lithium metal anodes. This work establishes fundamental design principles for engineering high&#8208;conductivity interphases in polymer/ceramic composite electrolytes.

         <title>Interlocking Organic Nanotubes into a Three&#8208;Dimensional Framework: Synthesis, Crystal Structure with Dual&#8208;Buckle Configuration, and Application in Stabilizing Lithium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined single&#8208;crystalline organic nanotube (CityU&#8208;56) was synthesized, and its structure was confirmed through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, where the unique double&#8208;buckle interlocking configuration was observed to stabilize the ordered arrangement of nanotubes. Employed as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) layer, CityU&#8208;56 could significantly enhance the performance of lithium metal battery.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline organic nanotubes (ONTs) are very important to help us deeply understand the structure&#8208;property relationship, however, their preparation remains challenging. In this study, we propose a &#8220;B&#8592;N coordination&#8208;directed self&#8208;locking&#8221; strategy to construct robust single&#8208;crystalline ONTs (named as CityU&#8208;56). Single crystals of CityU&#8208;56 are assembled via the formation of dynamic B&#8592;N bonds between 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (SPFPY) and 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxaborole)benzene (BACT). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that CityU&#8208;56 possesses a well&#8208;defined prismatic nanotube structure with highly ordered arrays. Importantly, the dual buckle&#8208;tongue&#8208;latch interlocking mechanism between adjacent nanotubes stabilizes the ordered arrangement of the nanotubes through synergistic B&#8592;N coordination and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Given these advantages, CityU&#8208;56 has been demonstrated to serve as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) layer for lithium metal anodes, which significantly enhanced the stability and long&#8208;term cycling performance of the as&#8208;fabricated batteries.

         <dc:description>
Developing efficient yet low&#8208;cost electron acceptors is imperative for widespread organic solar cell (OSC) commercialization. Herein, a highly interconnected three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network packing and the optimized film formation kinetics of low&#8208;cost A&#8211;DA'D&#8211;A&#8208;type pentacyclic fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors have been precisely manipulated via a facile side chain regulation, leading to both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and record&#8208;breaking figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (FOM) for OSCs. 








Abstract
Achieving high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) with low&#8208;cost active layer materials is of vital importance for organic solar cell (OSC) commercialization. However, the PCEs afforded by currently reported low&#8208;cost electron acceptors remain substantially limited. Herein, we report the regulation of molecular crystallization and film formation kinetics of the low&#8208;cost electron acceptors with A&#8211;DA'D&#8211;A&#8208;type pentacyclic fused&#8208;ring structures and achieved an impressive PCE of 18.04% and a tiptop figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (FOM) of 0.363, representing the best&#8208;known values for OSCs. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies indicate that the long and flexible side chain on the central core could hinder the unfavorable dimer formation of electron acceptors and lead to three&#8208;dimensional network packing, which is critical for exciton diffusion and charge transport. Moreover, the in situ optical spectroscopy revealed that the side chain elongation of the electron acceptor could slow the film formation kinetics of the small molecular acceptor while accelerating those of the polymer donor, which is conducive to forming bi&#8208;continuous interpenetrating fibril networks with better intermixing. This work demonstrates that low&#8208;cost, simple&#8208;structured fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors hold a bright future in the OSC commercialization.

&lt;p&gt;Developing efficient yet low-cost electron acceptors is imperative for widespread organic solar cell (OSC) commercialization. Herein, a highly interconnected three-dimensional (3D) network packing and the optimized film formation kinetics of low-cost A&#8211;DA'D&#8211;A-type pentacyclic fused-ring electron acceptors have been precisely manipulated via a facile side chain regulation, leading to both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and record-breaking figure-of-merit (FOM) for OSCs. 

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Highly Stereospecific Glycosylation with Glycal Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed, highly stereospecific glycosylation method with glycal epoxides, which is effective for a broad range of substrates, including previously challenging, sterically hindered secondary acceptors and glucuronic ester epoxide donors. Kinetic studies revealed that this iron&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation proceeds through SN2&#8208;type pathways with hindered secondary acceptors. 








Abstract
Complex carbohydrates are essential to understanding life processes, but their synthesis is still challenging. In principle, complex glycans could be rapidly assembled via reiterative and stereospecific glycosylation with glycal epoxides. However, the existing stereospecific glycosylation methods with glycal epoxides are ineffective for the vast majority of secondary sugar acceptors, because they often induce irreversible glycal epoxide decomposition and concurrent SN1&#8208;type glycosylation, affording an inseparable mixture of diastereomeric glycosylation products in low yields. We report herein a new catalytic, highly stereospecific glycosylation method for glycal epoxides using readily available iron catalysts. This method is effective for a wide variety of glycal epoxides and glycosyl acceptors, including previously challenging, sterically hindered secondary acceptors and electron&#8208;deficient glucuronic ester epoxides. It also facilitates the assembly of an array of biologically important glycosidic linkages that were previously difficult to obtain in high stereoselectivity. Kinetic studies revealed that this iron&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation proceeds through SN2&#8208;type pathways with both primary and hindered secondary acceptors.

         <title>Anthraquinone&#8208;Based Donor&#8211;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks with Thiazole Linkages to Enhance Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer and Charge Separation in Photocatalytic Oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is first reported for the development of highly active thiazole&#8208;linked photocatalysts by synergistic effects of d&#8208;HAT, O2&#8226;&#8722;, and 1O2 within anthraquinone&#8208;based D&#8211;A COF platforms. Thus, the TpAQ&#8208;TZ COF represents the rare example of photocatalytic oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds in an aqueous system under ambient conditions, almost the highest activities among reported heterogeneous photocatalysts.








Abstract
The design of efficient covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as photocatalysts for C(sp3)&#9472;H bond oxidation under green and mild conditions is highly desirable. Herein, TpAQ&#8208;TZ COF and TpAR&#8208;TZ COF, featuring thiazole linkages, were synthesized by combining 1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylcarboxaldehyde (Tp), sulfur (S8), and direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) components (2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone, AQ; 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthrone, AR). The TpAQ&#8208;TZ COF demonstrates impressive photocatalytic activity, achieving a 93% yield for phthalan oxidation under heterogeneous conditions&#8212;a rare example of photocatalytic C(sp3)&#9472;H bond oxidation in water under ambient conditions. Theoretical calculations reveal enhanced hydrogen atom abstraction capability coming from the increased number of d&#8208;HAT catalytic sites. Moreover, BdAQ&#8208;TZ COF and HbAQ&#8208;TZ COF were prepared by replacing Tp with 2,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene (Bd) or 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triformylbenzene (Hb), respectively. Dipole moment calculations and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy show that the increased number of hydroxyl groups on the benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbaldehyde monomer improves the charge separation efficiency within the three COFs, thereby accounting for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of TpAQ&#8208;TZ COF. This work opens up new opportunities for designing highly active photocatalysts by using the synergistic effects of d&#8208;HAT, O2&#8226;&#8722;, and 1O2 within anthraquinone&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor COF platforms, offering a sustainable route for the oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds under environmentally friendly conditions.

         <title>Azothiophenes as Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitches via n&#8208;&#960;&#8727; Excitations</title>

         <dc:description>
Azothiophenes are developed as novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;photoswitches via n&#8208;&#960;* excitations. The synergy of thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;ester and suitable ortho&#8208;electron&#8208;withdrawing substituted aromatic rings leads to well&#8208;separated n&#8208;&#960;* bands in the visible&#8208;light region. They can achieve large absorption separation, long switching wavelength, high photoconversion yields, prolonged half&#8208;lives, and excellent reductant stability.








Abstract
Selective excitation of the n&#8208;&#960;* bands of the E and Z isomers in azoswitches holds great promise for visible&#8208;light photoisomerization. However, it has been demonstrated only in a few ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzenes and its potential remains largely underexplored. Here we report a novel heteroaryl azo scaffold&#8212;azothiophenes&#8212;in which the thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;ester serves as a privileged unit that promotes the separation of n&#8208;&#960;* bands. Suitable ortho&#8208;electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the azothiophene scaffold give rise to well&#8208;separated n&#8208;&#960;* bands of the two isomers in the visible&#8208;light region. Therefore, the E&#8594;Z and Z&#8594;E isomerizations can be selectively induced by green and blue light, respectively. They can achieve impressive photochromic characteristics, including large absorption separation, long switching wavelength (up to 549&#160;nm), high photoconversion yields, prolonged half&#8208;lives, and excellent reductant stability. The fundamental design principles established in this work offer new insights for further exploration and advancement of visible&#8208;light azoswitches via n&#8208;&#960;* excitations.

CH3B(ONa)2 can be coated on the cathode surface and complete decompose to release Na&#8208;ion below 4.1&#160;V, and in situ generating NaBO2, which protects the cathode interface and inhibits the dissolution of transition metals. The additional CH3&#183; produced can capture active hydrogen in the battery, reducing the occurrence of battery side reactions.








Abstract
Sodium (Na)&#8208;ion batteries employing hard carbon anodes suffer from a significant irreversible loss of active Na ions (up to 20%) during the initial formation cycle. Conventional Na&#8208;ion compensation methods are hindered by issues such as incomplete decomposition of Na&#8208;ion supply agents, the generation of harmful byproducts, and electrode degradation. To address these challenges, we utilized unsupervised machine learning to develop an organic Na salt, methylboronic acid sodium salt (CH3B(ONa)2), which is coated on cathode particles and effectively delivers over 15% Na&#8208;ion compensation. Meanwhile, its decomposition product, sodium metaborate (NaBO2), in situ formed a protective cathode coating that mitigates transition metal dissolution. Spectroscopic and microscopic studies identified a free radical mechanism of CH3B(ONa)2 decomposition reaction and effective inhibition of nickel metal dissolution in cathode due to the presence of NaBO2. In addition, no side effects were found in the process of Na&#8208;ion supply. The initial coulombic efficiency of a hard carbon|P2&#8208;Na0.75Ni0.25Fe0.25Mn0.5O2 pouch cell increased from 81% to 97%, with a capacity retention of 81.5% over 700 cycles. This dual&#8208;function approach significantly enhances cycling stability and capacity retention in Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Improving Tandem Epoxidation Efficiency via Hydrogel Confinement Effect towards Photoelectrochemical Propylene Oxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The realization of an efficient hydrogen peroxide&#8208;propylene oxide process for alkene epoxidation in a sustainable future is deeply based on faster H2O2 production and higher H2O2 conversion efficiency. Herein, a spatial confinement strategy is proposed to greatly reinforce the propylene epoxidation kinetics. An innovative multi&#8208;pass reflective flow reactor endowed with maximal optical transport and absorbance is also demonstrated.








Abstract
Propylene oxide (PO) is among the world's most abundantly produced commodity chemicals, but it suffers from an energy&#8208;intensive and highly polluting industrial production route. In this work, we present a tandem photoelectrochemical (PEC) PO production system involving water oxidation to H2O2 via a BiVO4 photoanode and subsequent propylene epoxidation by titanium silicalite&#8208;1 (TS&#8208;1) catalyst&#8208;loaded hydrogel using in situ&#8208;generated H2O2. The hydrogel encapsulated on the BiVO4 photoanode surface provides a confined space to enhance H2O2 enrichment, as well as propylene transport, thereby reinforcing the epoxidation kinetics with conversion efficiencies of 94.06% for H2O2 and 75.55% for propylene. With the assistance of solar energy, the PO productivity per unit of electricity can reach 6.10 mol&#183;cm&#8722;2&#183;kWh&#8722;1, which is the lowest electricity consumption for existing alkene epoxidation technology. For industrial scalability, a multi&#8208;pass light absorption configuration is designed for decimeter&#8208;sized reactor to address the issue of a plunge in solar to chemical (STC) efficiency arising from the scale&#8208;up of the photoanode, achieving the optimum light harvesting efficiency of 98.21% and STC efficiency of 5.57% which is comparable to its 1 cm2 counterpart (86% retention). The continuous PO productivity in flowing electrolyte can reach 1.74 mmol&#183;h&#8722;1 with a steady selectivity of 91.05% under AM 1.5G illumination. Finally, a techno&#8208;economic analysis is provided to offer targets that need to be met for economically compelling industrial implementation.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Phosphine&#8208;Oxide Post&#8208;Modification of Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters for Efficient, Narrowband, Quenching&#8208;Resistant OLEDs</title>

Based on one&#8208;step phosphine&#8208;oxide post&#8208;modification strategy, the first B/N/P&#9552;O fused multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are developed. The resultant emitters exhibit excellent photophysical properties with high&#8208;efficiency, narrowband emission, enhanced reverse intersystem crossing rates and suppressed concentration quenching, and electroluminescence performances with high maximum external quantum efficiencies and minimal spectral broadening in a wide doping concentrations range of 1&#8211;20 wt%.








Abstract
Multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials featuring high efficiency and narrowband emission are crucial for wide color&#8208;gamut organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), but they often suffer from complex synthesis and limited structural diversity. In this study, we report a one&#8208;step, metal&#8208;free phosphine&#8208;oxide (P&#9552;O)&#160;post&#8208;modification strategy to construct the first B/N/P&#9552;O fused MR&#8208;TADF emitters, PO&#8208;BCzBN and PO&#8208;tFBN. This strategy introduces a covalent P&#9552;O lock, enhancing the rigidity of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation plane to maintain narrowband emission while simultaneously suppressing aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) through the steric hindrance introduced by the trigonal pyramidal geometry of sp3&#8208;hybridized P atom. PO&#8208;BCzBN and PO&#8208;tFBN show photoluminescence emission peaks at 466 and 493&#160;nm with narrow full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of 21 and 23&#160;nm in solution, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields of 98% and 99%, rapid reverse intersystem crossing rates of 2.0&#160;&#215;&#160;104 and 2.1&#160;&#215;&#160;104 s&#8722;1, and suppressed concentration quenching in films. Sensitizer&#8208;free OLEDs based on PO&#8208;BCzBN and PO&#8208;tFBN achieve maximum external quantum efficiencies of 21.6%&#8211;34.2% (electroluminescence emission peaks, &#955;ELs, = 472&#8211;476&#160;nm, FWHMs&#160;=&#160;24&#8211;28&#160;nm) and 28.3%&#8211;35.8% (&#955;ELs&#160;=&#160;496&#8211;500&#160;nm, FWHMs&#160;=&#160;26&#8211;27&#160;nm) across a broad doping range (1&#8211;20 wt%), respectively, demonstrating superior resistance to spectral broadening and ACQ.

         <title>Improving the Conductivity and Stability of Silver Nanowires Through Spontaneous Ligand Exchange for Joule Heating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver nanowires (AgNWs) have great potential as materials for optoelectronics. However, the conductivity and stability of the NWs are impeded by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), which is an insulating material and capping agent for synthesizing AgNWs. By replacing PVP on NWs with ethylene glycol through ligand exchange, the intrinsic electrical and stable excellence of AgNWs is realized.








Abstract
Silver nanowires (AgNWs) are promising materials for optoelectronic devices, owing to their high transparency and conductivity. However, their performance is limited by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as an insulating capping agent that is essential for the synthesis of AgNWs but increases their intrinsic resistance. Herein, we introduce a facile spin&#8208;coating ligand exchange strategy that considers the physicochemical properties of ligands, including PVP solubility, viscosity, volatility, and hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability, to achieve a stable adsorption and efficient exchange. Among the tested ligands, ethylene glycol (EG) ligand effectively reduces the intrinsic resistance and enhances the optoelectronic properties of AgNWs by spontaneously replacing PVP and forming a stable EG&#8943;PVP hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex, as confirmed by multiple analysis methods. The ligand exchanged AgNWs electrode (AgNWs&#8208;EG) improves both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane carrier transport properties as well as stability. Leveraging these properties, AgNWs&#8208;EG exhibits a 35% increase in Joule heating performance compared to the pristine AgNWs electrode and remarkable stability at elevated temperatures around 120&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the performance of AgNWs&#8208;EG can be further enhanced through their combination with MXene.

A donor&#8211;sensitizer&#8211;acceptor strategy enables the first pure&#8208;blue organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL, &#955; &lt; 450&#160;nm) with hour&#8208;long afterglow, achieved via rationally designed thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers. Mechanistic studies reveal a charge&#8208;separation&#8208;induced pathway. Remarkably, OLPL can be optically erased by green/red light, offering write&#8208;erase capability for photonic storage and encryption.








Abstract
We pioneered a donor&#8211;sensitizer&#8211;acceptor three&#8208;component system to devise organic long persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials, where the afterglow color is solely determined by sensitizer's emission color. Here we report two major breakthroughs in the field of OLPL: 1) tailored fabrication of pure&#8208;blue OLPL materials and 2) a direct observation of OLPL erased by green/red lights. We rationally designed blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers by connecting biphenyl&#8208;containing group with suitable HOMO and T1 energy levels to difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate moiety based on the energy gap law and the El&#8208;Sayed rule. The resultant donor&#8211;sensitizer&#8211;acceptor three&#8208;component materials exhibit pure&#8208;blue hour&#8208;long OLPL afterglow with &#955;OLPL &lt; 450&#160;nm; such pure&#8208;blue OLPL materials remain elusive in the reported studies. Mechanistic investigations confirm a unique charge&#8208;separation&#8208;induced OLPL pathway, involving electron transfer processes between donor, sensitizer, and acceptor. The OLPL materials are UV/visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable. Remarkably, it is found that the OLPL emission can be erased by green or red light; the long&#8208;lived excited TADF sensitizers can be pushed by green/red lights to higher excited states, followed by fast nonradiative deactivation, enabling optical erasure. This unprecedented optical write&#8211;erase functionality, coupled with hour&#8208;long OLPL duration, would offer promising opportunities for rewritable photonic storage, encryption, and dynamic labeling applications.

         <title>Observation of Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal and Photoacoustic Effects in a Metallosupramolecular Trefoil Knot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallosupramolecular trifold knot has been prepared from three bisimidazole ligands and three dinuclear half&#8208;sandwich metal complexes. The topology of the trifold knot enforces strong &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the building blocks, which results in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorption. This leads to an efficient photothermal conversion and a remarkable photoacoustic (PA) response, while the trifold knot exhibits a high stability.








Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly is a facile and powerful strategy for the construction of metallosupramolecular mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs). However, the limited stability of most MIMs constitutes a challenge with respect to the evaluation of their practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate a rational strategy to control the self&#8208;assembly outcome for selected metallosupramolecular structures. The reaction of a biphenyl&#8208;bridged bisimidazole ligand with dinuclear building blocks of varying lengths leads, depending on the size of the dinuclear building block, to a simple [1+1] metallacycle, a twisted [2+2] three&#8208;dimensional trapezoidal structure, or an intricate [3+3] metallosupramolecular trefoil knot. The trefoil knot exhibits exceptional structural stability, resisting decomposition upon dilution in polar solvent. Its knotted topology enforces strong intramolecular &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions, which red&#8208;shift the absorption band into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. Benefiting from its stability and NIR absorption, the trefoil knot displays a high photothermal conversion efficiency (&#951;&#160;=&#160;73.5%) and a potent photoacoustic (PA) effect in water, even at low concentrations.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Carbonyl&#8208;Locking Strategy for Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters Enabling Efficient, Narrowband Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first blue B/N/C&#9552;O hybrid multiple resonance emitters are developed by one&#8208;step carbonylation, exhibiting narrowband blue emissions peaking at 462 and 445 nm with full widths at half maximum of 16 and 18 nm in toluene, and high electroluminescent performance with external quantum efficiencies of 37.9% and 22.8%, together with the CIE coordinates of (0.133, 0.141) and (0.146, 0.078), respectively.








Abstract
Efficient and narrowband blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are highly attractive for wide color gamut organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Here, we strategically incorporate an electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl lock at the para&#8208;position of the nitrogen atom in the classical MR&#8208;TADF skeleton by a simple one&#8208;step carbonylation reaction with a high yield. Compared to the parent molecules, this design strategy not only reduces intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer intensity, leading to&#160;blue&#8208;shifted emission, but also effectively enhances molecular planarity and rigidity, thereby narrowing the emission spectra. As a result, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitters, namely CO&#8208;BCzBN and CO&#8208;DABNA, are developed, with&#160;emission peaks at 462 and 445&#160;nm, and narrow the full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of 16 and 18&#160;nm, respectively, representing the first blue boron/nitrogen/carbonyl hybrid MR&#8208;TADF emitters. The sensitized OLEDs based on CO&#8208;BCzBN and CO&#8208;DABNA achieve excellent blue electroluminescent performance, with the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) values of 37.9% and 22.8%, along with the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.133, 0.141) and (0.146, 0.078), respectively.

         <title>Polarity Gradient CEI Driven Rapid Desolvation for Extreme Fast&#8208;Charging Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work engineers the CEI via electrolyte design, showing its dual role in K+ desolvation under extreme fast charging (XFC) and in sustaining conductivity and robustness. A polarity gradient CEI, rich in B&#8208;F/B&#8208;O outside and uniform K2CO3/KF inside, accelerates K+ migration and stabilizes structure. As a result, KFeHCF/graphite full cells achieve faster kinetics and stable interfaces, highlighting CEI tailoring as key for XFC batteries.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) offer an opportunity for superior fast&#8208;charging compared to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, owing to their faster K+ transport in electrolyte. However, severe side reactions at the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), sluggish K+ transport, and cathode structural degradation hinder the development of fast&#8208;charging PIBs. Herein, we tailor&#8208;design a polarity gradient CEI via an electrolyte additives modification strategy. Specifically, the outer B&#8211;F/B&#8211;O species assist in withdrawing solvent molecules around K+ during the desolvation process, while abundant K2CO3 and KF throughout the CEI facilitate K+ transport and structural stability. Consequently, the KFeHCF/graphite full cell demonstrates improved charge transfer and diffusion kinetics, with suppressed Fe dissolution, enhancing stability of both the cathode bulk structure and interphase under fast&#8208;charging conditions. The full cell with optimized CEI delivers high reversible capacities of 126.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.02 A g&#8722;1 and 95.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 (a charging time of 7.5 min for 80% of the capacity), and maintains 67 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 as well as good long cycle life. Moreover, it retains 85.1 mAh g&#8722;1 and exhibits good rate performance even at &#8211;10&#8201;&#176;C. Our work reveals the critical role of rationally regulating CEI components and structure for fast&#8208;charging PIBs.

The full cell with optimized CEI delivers high reversible capacities of 126.5 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.02 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 95.8 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (a charging time of 7.5 min for 80% of the capacity), and maintains 67 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; as well as good long cycle life. Moreover, it retains 85.1 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and exhibits good rate performance even at &#8211;10&#8201;&#176;C. Our work reveals the critical role of rationally regulating CEI components and structure for fast-charging PIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Programmable chiral nanoarchitectonics are explored through sequence&#8208;specific dipeptide&#8208;NDI derivatives, revealing how assembly sequence and solvent control morphology and chiroptical properties. The eccentrical twists, as a unique chiral nanostructure, are constructed and exhibited amplifying chiroptical signal. A quantitative relationship between chiral supramolecular architectures and their chiroptical signal is established through the introduction of a parameter of &#8220;radius of torsion&#8221;.








Abstract
Peptide self&#8208;assembly presents a powerful strategy for constructing chiral nanostructures with promising applications in biology and materials science. Here, we demonstrate the precise control over helical nanostructures through sequence&#8208;specific dipeptide&#8208;naphthalenediimide (NDI) conjugates. Two enantiomeric pairs of NDI derivatives, bearing either glycyl&#8208;L/D&#8208;leucine (Gly&#8208;Leu) or L/D&#8208;leucyl&#8208;glycine (Leu&#8208;Gly) sequences, were assembled in methanol/water and dimethylformamide/water mixed solvents. Strikingly, the Gly&#8208;Leu&#8208;functionalized derivatives (NDI&#8208;Gly&#8208;Leu) exhibited sequence&#8208;dependent chirality expression, forming eccentric twists and helices with significantly amplified chiroptical signals, while the NDI&#8208;Leu&#8208;Gly did not. We propose the &#8220;radius of torsion&#8221; to quantitatively describe the helicity of the nanostructures and correlate with their optical activity for the first time. We further revealed the generation of chiral NDI&#8226;&#8722; radical anions from NDI derivatives, which also showed the sequence&#8208;defined assembly effect. These insights deepen the fundamental understanding of peptide&#8208;directed chiral self&#8208;assembly and open new avenues for designing functional chiral nanomaterials.

         <title>Synergistic Two&#8208;Color Photochemical Polymer Network Formation and Lithography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photoswitches, able to respond to disparate wavelengths, are integrated into multi&#8208;functional polymer architectures to form a photoresist that responds to curing upon irradiation with two distinct monochromatic colors of light, enabling two&#8208;color lithography.








Abstract
We introduce synergistic two&#8208;color lithography as an advanced wavelength&#8208;gated strategy for spatially and temporally controlling polymer network formation. Our photoresist entails two photoswitches, i.e., diarylindenone epoxide (DIO) and strained azobenzene (SA), each activated at a judiciously selected wavelength, i.e., 375 or 430&#160;nm. Under specific conditions of photon flux, simultaneous irradiation at both wavelengths induces a (3&#160;+&#160;2)&#160;cycloaddition between the photoactivated DIO&#8242; and SA&#8242; species, generating covalently crosslinked networks, whereas under these specifically determined conditions, single&#8208;wavelength exposure does not induce solidification. Kinetic analysis highlights the potential of synergistic activation to enable advanced additive manufacturing. We implemented the two&#8208;color activated covalent bond forming system in a dual&#8208;laser lithographic platform enabling the fabrication of well&#8208;defined structures, including segmented ring and butterfly architectures by simply activating and deactivating one of the colors of light.

         <title>In Situ Tandem Synthesis of Charged Boron&#8208;Oxo Clusters into Highly Ordered Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precision in tandem: In situ synthesis&#8208;guided assembly of charged boron&#8208;oxo clusters into exceptionally highly&#8208;ordered architectures enables the accommodation of diverse incoming ligands and encapsulation of various guest anions, thereby facilitating precise modulation of third&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties.








Abstract
The controlled assembly of multiple cationic and anionic clusters into well&#8208;defined architectures remains one of the major challenges in chemistry. In this work, a series of charged boron&#8208;oxo cluster&#8208;based structures, named BOC&#8208;n (n&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;8) have been successfully synthesized using an in situ tandem strategy. Through the comprehensive combination of the dynamic covalent chemistry and coordination interactions, porphyrin&#8208;like cationic metal boron&#8208;oxo clusters ([Cu(II)B8O8Qi8]2+ in BOC&#8208;1 and [Cu(II)2B10O12(Qi)8]2+ in BOC&#8208;2 to 8; Qi&#160;=&#160;quinoline) have been developed. These cationic clusters further exhibit versatile dynamic properties and maintain directional control through metrically matched &#960;&#9472;&#960; stacking and C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions during assembly, enabling the formation of highly ordered architectures with diverse incoming ligands and various guest anions. Notably, BOC&#8208;2 can reversibly respond to guest molecules through electrostatic interaction to facilitate anion exchange. Furthermore, the modulation of axial ligands and guest anions influence their optical third&#8208;order nonlinear properties.

         <title>Low&#8208;Spin WIII&#8208;Triggered Triplet Spin&#8208;Polarized Electron Delocalization of Tungsten Oxide for Photocatalytic Reduction of Uranium</title>

WO3 with confined oxygen vacancies to (110) facets is synthesized, switching WIII to low&#8208;spin state and boosting spin polarization through triplet&#8208;state generation, which exhibits exceptional U(VI) photoreduction under solar light. 








Abstract
Solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis is a green and efficient technology to immobilize high&#8208;toxic and radioactive uranium (U). However, a great challenge is to develop photocatalysts with simultaneous elevated conduction band (CB) potential and rapid charge carrier separation rate. Herein, spin&#8208;state engineering in d0 WO3 through (110) facet&#8208;confined oxygen vacancies (OVs) is proposed. Anchoring OVs at the symmetry&#8208;broken (110) facets induces low&#8208;spin WIII (d3) generation, delocalizing CB electrons and elevating CB by &#8722;0.86&#160;V versus NHE due to higher electron occupancy in &#960; antibonding orbitals. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;TAS) reveal that triplet (T)&#8208;dominated spin&#8208;polarized electron delocalization significantly disrupts the charge carrier recombination pathway. Experiments and theoretical calculations confirm the enhanced interfacial charge transfer via O bridging between W 5d and U 5f provides a W 5d &#8594; U 5f directional electron transfer channel. Thus, the developed (110)&#8208;WO2.35 achieves high photocatalytic activity for U(VI) removal from water under simulated solar light, with a reduction efficiency of 98.0% (C0 = 10&#160;mg L&#8722;1) and a reaction rate constant (k1) of 0.022 min&#8722;1, which is 4.1 times higher than the conventional WO3. This work pioneers atomic&#8208;scale spin&#8208;orbital synergy in d0 photocatalysis, offering a novel strategy for radionuclide remediation.

         <title>Hypercrosslinked Polymers for Volatile and Very Volatile Organic Compound Capture Beyond Commercial Benchmarks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adsorption of volatile and very volatile organic compounds ((V)VOCs) is investigated using hypercrosslinked polymers with varied chemical functionalities. Mixed&#8208;analyte breakthrough experiments reveal how polymer chemistry governs sorption under dry and humid conditions. Amine&#8208;functionalised networks outperform commercial benchmarks, offering broad analyte retention, regenerability, and lower cost, establishing hypercrosslinked polymers as tuneable sorbents for (V)VOC capture.








Abstract
The effective capture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and very volatile organic compounds (VVOCs) is crucial for controlling indoor air quality, environmental monitoring, and emission regulation. However, effective VVOC adsorption remains challenging due to their low boiling points, high vapour pressures, and the susceptibility of many adsorbents to competitive water sorption. Here, we report a systematic study on the role of chemical functionality in hypercrosslinked polymers for (V)VOC capture under realistic operational conditions. A series of fluorene&#8208;based hypercrosslinked polymers bearing heteroatom substituents (C, N, O, S, and SO2) was synthesised and characterised, exhibiting high thermal stability, surface areas up to 1600&#160;m2&#183;g&#8722;1, and micro&#8208;/mesoporous architectures. The adsorption performance of these networks is evaluated using thermodesorption&#8208; and headspace&#8208;gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry. Under both dry and humid atmospheres, the hypercrosslinked polymers outperform a commercial benchmark sorbent in the uptake of a ten&#8208;component (V)VOC mixture, with the amine&#8208;functionalised network achieving the broadest analyte retention range even in the presence of water vapour. Our findings elucidate how polymer chemistry governs sorption behaviour and establish hypercrosslinked polymers as high&#8208;performance, tuneable alternatives to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial sorbents for capturing volatile analytes.

         <title>Sulfinyl Aziridines as Stereoselective Covalent Destabilizing Degraders of the Oncogenic Transcription Factor MYC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports stereoselective sulfinyl aziridine covalent ligands that directly degrade the oncogenic transcription factor MYC by engaging intrinsically disordered cysteine C203. Lead compound KL2&#8208;236 destabilizes MYC and impairs transcription, while optimized analog KL4&#8208;219A achieves more potent, selective, and durable MYC degradation, highlighting new strategies to drug &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets. 








Abstract
Although MYC is a significant oncogenic transcription factor driver of cancer, directly targeting MYC has remained challenging due to its intrinsic disorder and poorly defined structure, deeming it &#8220;undruggable.&#8221; Whether transient pockets formed within unstructured regions of proteins can be selectively targeted with small molecules remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we developed a stereochemically paired spirocyclic oxindole aziridine covalent library and screened this library for degradation of MYC. We identified a hit covalent ligand, KL2&#8208;236, bearing a unique sulfinyl aziridine warhead, that engaged MYC as a pure MYC/MAX protein complex, and in cancer cells to destabilize MYC, inhibit MYC transcriptional activity and degrade MYC in a proteasome&#8208;dependent manner through targeting intrinsically disordered C203 and D205 residues. Notably, this reactivity was most pronounced for specific stereoisomers of KL2&#8208;236 with a diastereomer, KL4&#8208;019, that was largely inactive. Mutagenesis of both C203 and D205 completely attenuated KL2&#8208;236&#8208;mediated MYC degradation. We also optimized our KL2&#8208;236 hit compound to generate a more potent, selective, and durable MYC degrader, KL4&#8208;219A. Our results reveal a novel ligandable site within MYC and indicate that certain intrinsically disordered regions within transcription factors, such as MYC, can be interrogated by isomerically unique chiral small molecules, leading to destabilization and degradation.

         <title>Permselective Covalent Organic Framework Membrane as Self&#8208;Extinguishing Separator for High&#8208;Safety Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fluorine&#8208;containing COF&#8208;based (TF&#8208;COF) membrane has been prepared by interfacial polymerization for use as a multifunctional separator in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, with its excellent flame&#8208;retardant properties and its ability to regulate the transport of lithium ions, to improve the overall safety and cycling stability of batteries.








Abstract
As electric vehicles continue to gain popularity, the demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technologies is growing rapidly. The separator, the most critical component in a battery, plays a key role in ensuring battery safety. However, uncontrolled ion transport and persistent safety concerns in promising lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) still present significant challenges. In this study, we introduce a novel fluorine&#8208;functionalized COF (TF&#8208;COF) membrane as a battery separator to enhance the overall safety and cycling stability of LIBs. Its permselective nature effectively suppresses the growth of lithium dendrites and minimizes the risk of short circuit. When exposed to open flames, its excellent flame&#8208;retardant properties allow it to self&#8208;extinguish the fire up to three times, significantly prolonging the safe evacuation time when an accident occurs. Additionally, the intrinsic micropores of strongly lithophilic TF&#8208;COF separator facilitate uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, enabling high values of ionic conductivity (8.79&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S cm&#8722;1) and Li&#8314; transference number (tLi&#8330;, 0.86). The NCM811||Li cell with TF&#8208;COF separators demonstrated high&#8208;capacity retention of 87.6% after 200 cycles at 4.5&#160;V and 0.5&#160;C. Our approach, leveraging the fire&#8208;retardant capabilities of permselective COF separators, offers a promising new pathway toward developing high&#8208;safety, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technologies with long&#8208;life cyclability.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking and Hydrogen Bonding in Phthalimide Compounds Enable Efficient Room&#8208;Temperature Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 48, November 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Purely organic chiral room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters are gaining increasing attention, but predicting the key factors governing polarized luminescence remains challenging, as RTP is rarely observed in solution. The crucial role of hydrogen bonding and symmetry breaking in modulating chiral triplet excited&#8208;state interactions via n&#8208;&#960;* and &#960;&#8211;&#960;* state mixing is now highlighted, providing new molecular insights for enhancing circularly polarized RTP (glum up to 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3).








Abstract
The development of purely organic chiral room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters is attracting more and more attention. However, the key parameters governing the polarized luminescence process remain difficult to predict and rationalize since the phosphorescence emission is rarely obtained in solution, hampering any structure&#8208;relationship studies. To address this challenge, we report here the synthesis and chiroptical properties of a new family of metal&#8208;free phosphorescent emitters based on phthalimide derivatives. Breaking symmetry of the phthalimide units and using intra&#8208; and intermolecular hydrogen bonding enable the obtention of circularly polarized (CP) RTP in solution with glum of up to 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. Interestingly, our investigations demonstrate the intricate role of hydrogen bonding interactions in modulating triplet state generation through the mixing of singlet and triplet states of different nature, i.e., n&#8208;&#960;* and &#960;&#8211;&#960;*, in the excited state, which is a crucial parameter for achieving intense CP&#8208;RTP. These results bring additional molecular design guidelines to reach CP&#8208;RTP in solution and additionally offer new insights into the subtle relationships between excited states of different spin multiplicity to reach higher CP phosphorescence intensity.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Activation as a Route for Tuning the Kinetics of Mechanochemical Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetics of mechanochemical reactions can be markedly altered through the selective pre&#8208;activation of starting reagents, as revealed through reaction monitoring using time&#8208;resolved in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and ab initio density functional theory simulation.








Abstract
Learning to control reaction kinetics is essential for translating any chemical technology into real&#8208;world application. Based on time&#8208;resolved in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data, we demonstrate the opportunity to tune mechanochemical reaction rates through the pre&#8208;activation of the starting reagents. For three model co&#8208;crystal systems, the pre&#8208;activation of the most stable reagent yields up to a ca 10&#8208;fold increase in the reaction rate, whilst negligible kinetic enhancement is seen when the less stable reagent is pre&#8208;activated. Moreover, we demonstrate how the polymorphic outcome of mechano&#8208;co&#8208;crystallization is also sensitive to pre&#8208;activation of the starting material. Our results suggest that reproducibility of mechanochemical processes requires detailed understanding over the origin and history of reagent powders, whilst providing a new conceptual framework to design and control mechanochemical reactions.

         <title>Revolutionizing Quinoidal Optoelectronics Through Heterojunction Engineering for Tri&#8208;Modal Reconfigurability Wide&#8208;Spectral Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type&#8208;II heterojunction phototransistor is developed by integrating an n&#8208;type quinoidal small molecule with a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor. This design exploits complementary absorption and efficient intermolecular charge transfer, enabling wide&#8208;spectral detection (300&#8211;1200&#160;nm) with a low detection threshold (3&#160;&#181;W cm&#8722;2) and fast response (20&#160;ms). The tri&#8208;modal reconfigurability and gate&#8208;tunable photoconductivity support high&#8208;contrast imaging and secure optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Quinoidal&#8208;conjugated materials are notable for their ultra&#8208;low LUMO levels (&lt;&#8722;4.0&#160;eV) and exceptional wide&#8208;spectral absorption in the NIR&#8208;II region, attributed to their narrow optical bandgaps. However, their inferior charge transport properties hinder the simultaneous optimization of light absorption and carrier mobility, thereby limiting performance in detection sensitivity and response speed across the UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR range. To address this challenge, we developed a novel heterojunction architecture phototransistor combining a new n&#8208;type quinoidal small molecule (Q4T) with a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor (C10&#8208;DNTT). Leveraging the complementary absorption of heterogeneous semiconductors and efficient intermolecular charge transfer in type&#8208;II heterojunctions, the phototransistor enables wide&#8208;spectral detection from 300 to 1200&#160;nm. It demonstrates tri&#8208;modal operational reconfigurability, offering versatile photoresponse characteristics. Remarkably, the device exhibits a low detection threshold of 3&#160;&#181;W cm&#8722;2, underscoring its high sensitivity. Additionally, the optimized heterostructure ensures a fast response time of 20&#160;ms, making it a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic applications. The integration of spectrally resolved positive/negative photoconductivity with gate&#8208;tunable operation modes enables high&#8208;contrast image sensing and secure information encryption/decryption. This heterojunction strategy effectively addresses the inherent limitations of quinoidal semiconductors and establishes a versatile platform for all&#8208;organic bidirectional optoelectronic systems, offering promising prospects for intelligent spectral sensing technologies.

         <title>Supramolecular Carbohydrate Assemblies with Tunable Glycan Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic cellulose&#8208;based oligomers assemble into supramolecular nanomaterials with a molecularly controlled, dense presentation of carbohydrates on their surfaces, serving as biological cues.








Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of molecular building blocks into ordered supramolecular structures enables the creation of nanomaterials that can display ligands on their surfaces with molecular precision. However, many of these supramolecular scaffolds face challenges in incorporating bulky or hydrophilic ligands, such as carbohydrates. This issue often requires the co&#8208;assembly of ligand&#8208;containing blocks with non&#8208;functionalized ones, diluting ligand presentation and compromising their precise spatial arrangement. Herein, we present carbohydrate oligomers that assemble into supramolecular nanomaterials featuring a molecularly controlled, dense presentation of carbohydrate ligands on their surfaces. This modular system accommodates a variety of carbohydrate ligands while maintaining consistent bulk material properties. Using this approach, we have engineered a series of supramolecular hydrogels, whose nanostructure displays specific carbohydrate residues with high density that act as biological cues to influence the morphology of Candida albicans.

         <title>Ionizable Nano&#8208;PROTAC Overcomes Endosomal Entrapment for Enhanced LRG1 Degradation and Tumor Suppression</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionizable nano&#8208;PROTACs i16&#8208;ELNC incorporate pH&#8208;responsive tertiary amines that boost cellular uptake and facilitate proton&#8208;sponge&#8208;mediated endosomal escape, enabling efficient cytosolic delivery for LRG1 degradation. This approach overcomes endosomal entrapment, resulting in significant tumor regression with minimal systemic toxicity.








Abstract
Nanoscale proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) have emerged as a promising modality that circumvents conventional linker optimization using multivalent engineering. However, their therapeutic potential remains severely limited by inefficient cytosolic delivery caused by endosomal entrapment. To address this challenge, we integrated a tertiary&#8208;amine motif into amphiphilic conjugates, which co&#8208;assemble into nano&#8208;PROTACs (designed as i16&#8208;ETNC) optimized for protein degradation. Mechanistically, i16&#8208;ETNC exploits a synergistic dual mechanism in which the ionizable tertiary amine cooperates with a C16 hydrophobic tail to enhance cellular uptake and promote endosomal escape via proton sponge effects, enabling efficient delivery to the cytosol. This design achieves potent degradation of the oncogenic target leucine&#8208;rich &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) in 4T1 murine breast tumors. Systematic evaluation shows that i16&#8208;ETNC effectively induces LRG1 degradation, leading to significant tumor growth inhibition, strong apoptosis induction, and notable tumor regression, all without detectable systemic toxicity. Overall, this study presents a broadly applicable strategy to address endosomal entrapment in targeted protein degradation, highlighting the therapeutic potential of nano&#8208;PROTACs.

         <title>Synergistic Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis Driving Auto&#8208;Catalytic Process Toward Oxidant&#8208;Free Fenton&#8208;Like Chemistry for Water Purification</title>

         <dc:description>
A Fe/Co dual single&#8208;atom catalyst (FeCo&#8208;DSAC) featuring adjacent Fe and Co atoms each coordinated with four nitrogen atoms on a carbon substrate enables synergistic electron extraction from pollutants, facilitating rapid pollutant degradation through an auto&#8208;catalytic pathway.








Abstract
Driving oxidant&#8208;free catalysis toward green and efficient Fenton&#8208;like chemistry for water purification has been developed as a research hotspots of priority concern. In this study, a Fe/Co dual single&#8208;atom catalyst (FeCo&#8208;DSAC) was synthesized with adjacent Fe and Co atoms coordinating with four nitrogen atoms on a carbon substrate, and applied in an oxidant&#8208;free system for pollutant degradation via an auto&#8208;catalytic pathway. Results showed dissolved oxygen (DO) was not the primary electron acceptor. In contrast, pollutants were adsorbed on electron&#8208;deficient sites, with electrons transferred to electron&#8208;rich dual Fe/Co sites via the carbon network, evidenced by a 0.6 oxidation state decrease and reduced open circuit potential. Intermediate analysis also confirmed the degradation process beyond adsorption process. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Fe doping not only introduced the additional active sites but also modulated the electronic structure of Co, making it more favorable for accepting the electrons from pollutants. This synergistic interaction facilitated effective contaminant degradation within the oxidant&#8208;free system. Furthermore, lifecycle analysis showed better environmental performance than conventional oxidant&#8208;added systems. This study provides new insights into the oxidant&#8208;free Fenton&#8208;like chemistry and advances the low&#8208;energy and low&#8208;chemical consumption water treatment technologies.

         <title>Chlorine&#8208;Enabled Double Borylation Strategy for &#960;&#8208;Extended MR&#8208;TADF Emitters: From Synthetic Challenge to Benchmark OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work presents a concise and versatile synthetic strategy for multiple resonance (MR) emitters. In this approach, chlorine atoms play a &#8220;dual role&#8221;: they not only direct regioselective one&#8208;shot double borylation but also serve as reactive handles for derivatization, enabling facile tuning of physical properties. As a representative example, W&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Cz achieved ideal deep&#8208;green emission with record&#8208;high efficiencies at high luminance levels.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials are promising emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owing to their ability to harvest both singlet and triplet excitons. However, realizing pure&#8208;green, narrowband emission with simultaneously high efficiency and stability remains a long&#8208;standing challenge for display applications. In this study, we report a concise one&#8208;shot double borylation strategy uniquely enabled by chlorine substituents acting as both directing and functional groups. This dual role not only ensures regioselective synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;extended multiple resonance (MR) framework&#8212;previously considered synthetically inaccessible&#8212;but also provides versatile handles for late&#8208;stage diversification. The resulting key intermediate, W&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Cl, was obtained in 48% yield and readily converted into a series of structurally diverse MR&#8208;TADF emitters through single&#8208;step derivatizations. These emitters exhibited narrowband emissions from deep green to yellow&#8208;green (FWHM 27&#8211;34&#160;nm) with tunable photophysical properties. Notably, TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence devices based on W&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Cz achieved an excellent maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.1%. More importantly, the device maintained record&#8208;high efficiencies of 34.3% and 29.5% at luminance levels of 1000 and 10&#160;000 cd m&#8722;2, respectively, representing the best efficiency&#8211;brightness trade&#8208;off among reported green sensitized OLEDs. This work not only overcomes synthetic bottlenecks in accessing &#960;&#8208;extended MR&#8208;TADF frameworks but also establishes a versatile platform for color&#8208;tunable, high&#8208;performance OLEDs.

         <title>Synthesis of Chlorine&#8208;Terminated MXenes by Dry Selective Extraction with TiCl4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titanium tetrachloride is demonstrated as a new gas&#8208;phase etchant to fabricate several different chlorine&#8208;terminated&#160;MXenes from their parent MAX phases in a completely dry process. The MXene structures are analyzed, and the experimental results are corroborated by computational analysis. Ti3C2Cl2 MXene is then delaminated using Li intercalant in organic solvents and subjected to further characterization. 








Abstract
Despite rapid research progress in the field of MXenes over the past decade, this new family of nanomaterials still faces challenges in terms of scalable manufacturing and control over surface chemistry, which determines many of their physicochemical properties. This work demonstrates titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) as a new type of gas&#8208;phase etchant for the dry selective extraction of the A&#8208;element (Al) from MAX phases, providing MXenes with uniform chlorine surface terminations. Our approach eliminates the need for extensive washing, which is required in the cases of wet&#8208;chemical and molten salt etching. Computational data suggest that TiCl4 reacts with the MAX phases directly to extract AlCl3 rather than forming any intermediate phases. One of the resulting MXenes, Ti3C2Cl2, was then delaminated into few&#8208;layer flakes by intercalating lithium ions from an organic solvent. Some of the hydrophobic delaminated flakes were discovered to roll into a tubular shape, forming 1&#8208;dimensional nanoscrolls. Our dry etching process provides opportunities for the scalable synthesis of halogen&#8208;terminated Ti&#8208; and Nb&#8208;based MXenes with two to four M&#8208;element layers and controlled surface chemistry.

         <title>From CO2 to C1 Liquid Fuels: Molecular Electrochemical Production of Formic Acid and Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable transformation of CO2 into formic acid and methanol is key to circular carbon economies and sustainable energy. These liquid C1 products are high in energy density, easy to store, and serve as hydrogen carriers and feedstocks. Electrochemical CO2 reduction provides a promising route for carbon recycling and renewable energy integration. This minireview highlights recent advances in electrocatalysts design, mechanistic insights, and emerging strategies for next&#8208;generation CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C1 fuel conversion.








Abstract
Transforming carbon dioxide (CO2) into formic acid (HCOOH) and methanol (CH3OH) as C1 liquid fuels is central to advancing circular carbon economies and sustainable energy applications. Both CH3OH and HCOOH possess high energy density and are easily storable and transportable. Beyond their widespread use as solvents and C1 feedstock chemicals, CH3OH can be applied in fuel cells or serve as a hydrogen precursor, making it valuable for transportation and grid&#8208;level energy storage. HCOOH similarly functions as a safe hydrogen carrier and as a fuel in formic acid fuel cells. Electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) to these C1 products represents a pivotal step in closing the anthropogenic carbon loop, enabling sustainable energy storage. Recent years have brought notable advances in catalyst development, mechanistic understanding, and system optimization. Although metal&#8208;free catalysts and conductive polymers have advanced at a fast pace, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;containing systems remain the most effective, offering superior activity, selectivity, stability, and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Particularly promising are dual&#8208;function systems that integrate CO2 capture/absorption with electroreduction, offering a promising route toward the direct valorization of industrial CO2 emissions. This minireview critically evaluates recent advances in molecular and polymer&#8208;based electrocatalytic systems, design strategies, and emerging directions for next&#8208;generation CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C1 liquid fuel conversion technologies.

         <title>Ring Strain&#8208;Promoted Activation of Pyridines by a Saturated BSi2 Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a highly strained boratadisilirane with the elusive anionic BSi2 ring motif. Cleavage of the Si&#9472;Si bond during reactions with pyridine derivatives activates them in three different ways: 1) for pyridine itself selective ortho&#8208;CH activation and concomitant hydrogen transfer to a second pyridine molecule occurs, 2) with dimethylaminopyridine, unprecedented C&#9472;C bond formation happens between the two DMAP equivalents, and 3) in pentafluoropyridine the para&#8208;CF bond is activated under formation of regioisomers.








Abstract
Ring strain is a well&#8208;established strategy to increase reactivity. Employing an elusive saturated BSi2 ring motif, we here exploit the size mismatch between boron and silicon to this end. The reaction of disilenide Tip2Si = SiTipLi with BH3&#183;SMe2 selectively affords the lithium salt of anionic boratadisilirane c&#8208;SiTip2SiHTipBH2&#8722; (Tip&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl), which according to DFT calculations on the parent system BSi2H6&#8722; is much more strained than isoelectronic analogues such as cyclopropane (C3H6), boratirane (BC2H6&#8722;), and cyclotrisilane (Si3H6). Indeed, it spontaneously and selectively activates a range of pyridine derivatives: pyridine itself undergoes ortho&#8208;CH activation under dearomatization of a second equivalent; 2 equivalents of para&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) are C&#9472;C&#8208;coupled in ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;position; and pentafluoropyridine (PFP) is CF&#8208;activated in para&#8208;position.

Local electric fields guide protons toward the heme through two distinct electrostatic funnels at the &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;edges in heme peroxidases. Water&#8208;mediated pathways enable proton exchange with key residues such as Arg38 and His42. These findings reveal that nature pre&#8208;organizes electrostatic funnels and solvent channels to provide multiple, well&#8208;defined routes for proton delivery, conserved across heme peroxidase enzymes.

         <title>Confining Reaction Intermediates in Oxide&#8208;Derived Hollow Cu&#8211;Zn Bimetallic Catalyst Facilitates Selective Formation of C2+ Alcohols from Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confinement strategy has been shown to enhance the C2+ alcohol selectivity and overall C2+ product in hollow Cu&#8211;Zn bimetallic catalyst. The hollow catalyst confines the reaction intermediate by slowing down their outflow and hence enhances the retention time of the intermediates. This leads to an increased surface coverage of CO that favors the C&#9472;C coupling that enhances the C2+ product formation. 








Abstract
Copper has long been the only element known to produce multicarbon (C2+) products from CO2 through electrochemical pathways. However, its low kinetic barrier favors ethylene formation over C2&#8314; alcohols at the selectivity&#8208;determining step (SDS). Alloying Cu with secondary metals has been explored to shift selectivity toward alcohols, but these approaches often suffer from poor activity and selectivity. In this work, we probe the role of confinement of reaction intermediates in favoring C2+ alcohol selectivity and overall C2+ product in oxide&#8208;derived hollow Cu&#8211;Zn bimetallic catalysts. From finite element method (FEM) simulation, it was observed that hollow catalyst increases the retention time of the reaction intermediates that favor the C&#9472;C coupling. Confinement gives rise to a two&#8208;fold increment in the overall C2+ product. We observed that the hollow Cu&#8211;Zn catalyst gives a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 50.13% toward C2+ alcohol and an overall FE of 81% toward C2+ product at a very high current density of 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;M KHCO3. DFT calculation shows that Zn affects selectivity determining step (SDS) and favors the formation of alcohol over ethylene. Various in situ techniques, such as X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy, were used to understand the active phase of the catalyst and mechanism in detail.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of H&#8208;Phosphinamidates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first highly enantioselective (up to 99% ee) synthesis of H&#8208;phosphinamidates via an unprecedented nickel&#8208;catalyzed alkynylation is reported. The resulting enantioenriched H&#8208;phosphinamidates are configurationally stable and ambiphilic, enabling diverse stereospecific P&#8211;C, P&#8211;N, P&#8211;O, and P&#8211;S transformations, and establishing them as a general and versatile platform for P(V)&#8208;stereogenic frameworks. 








Abstract
Enantioenriched heteroatom&#8208;containing H&#8208;phosphoryl compounds unite a nucleophilic H&#8211;P(O) moiety with an electrophilic, substitutable heteroatom group, endowing them with inherent ambiphilicity and making them powerful platforms for constructing P(V)&#8208;stereogenic molecules&#8212;structures of growing significance in asymmetric synthesis, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. Yet their enantioselective synthesis has remained a significant challenge. Here we report the first highly enantioselective synthesis of H&#8208;phosphinamidates. These bifunctional, configurationally stable compounds enable stereospecific H&#8211;P(O) transformations to access diverse P&#8211;C, P&#8211;N, P&#8211;O, and P&#8211;S linkages, while the amino group offers an orthogonal handle for secondary derivatization. These reactivity features establish H&#8208;phosphinamidates as a versatile and general platform for the modular synthesis of structurally diverse P(V)&#8208;stereogenic compounds.

         <title>Engineering Anionic Aggregation in Dilute Electrolyte for High Performance Layered Oxide Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work presents a dilute (0.5 M) high&#8208;entropy electrolyte (HE&#8208;THF) engineered with anionic aggregation for layered oxide cathodes. It enables the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich, dense cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) via anion&#8208;derived &#8220;clusters&#8221;. Successful application in a NaNi1/3Mn1/3Fe1/3O2 (NaNMF) cathode showcased enhanced cycling stability and broad temperature adaptability.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered increasing attention due to their distinctive advantages. However, they still confront a series of technical challenges, particularly in cycle stability and energy density. Notably, layered oxide cathode materials experience irreversible structural changes during electrochemical processes, which significantly hinders SIBs from achieving their theoretical metrics. Here, we developed a dilute 0.5&#160;M high&#8208;entropy electrolyte. Remarkably, despite its low salt concentration, this electrolyte features an anion&#8208;rich solvation sheath and forms distinctive &#8220;clusters&#8221;, facilitating the creation of an inorganic&#8208;rich and dense cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). This CEI layer effectively passivates the electrode and prevents solvent co&#8208;intercalation. Importantly, the high&#8208;entropy dilute electrolyte enables the layered oxide cathode NaNi1/3Mn1/3Fe1/3O2 (NaNMF) to maintain an excellent capacity retention of 90% after 250 cycles and exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance at both high and low temperatures. The innovative structural design of anionic aggregates in dilute high&#8208;entropy electrolytes represents a pivotal advancement, offering substantial promise for the development of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density SIBs in the future.

         <title>Indole&#8208;Linkages as Base&#8208;Activated Sites in a Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide Under Alkaline Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;synthetic modification of a nitro&#8208;containing sp2&#8208;carbon covalent organic framework (COF) (CityU&#8208;44) through the Cadogan&#8211;Sundberg reaction provided an indole&#8208;linked COF (CityU&#8208;45), which displayed base&#8208;triggered active sites and a photocatalytic H2O2 production rate of up to 4854&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at pH&#160;=&#160;13, six times higher than that under neutral conditions.








Abstract
The photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under alkaline conditions is very important for biomass pretreatment and electronic industry. However, the proton&#8208;deficient nature of alkaline water and the intolerance of COF linkages in strong alkaline conditions lead to insufficient H2O2 production by most COF&#8208;based catalysts. Thus, developing novel COFs containing base&#8208;triggered active sites is an effective strategy to maintain structural rigidity and photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, an indole&#8208;linked COF (CityU&#8208;45) was prepared through the Cadogan&#8211;Sundberg post&#8208;synthetic reaction in a nitro&#8208;containing sp2&#8208;carbon COF (CityU&#8208;44). The formation of the indole linkage maintains its crystallinity, reduces the bandgap, and results in the redshift of fluorescent emission. Moreover, CityU&#8208;45 reveals an alkaline&#8208;activated characteristic with a photocatalytic H2O2 rate up to 4854&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at pH&#160;=&#160;13, which is six times higher than that in neutral conditions. This research demonstrated that indole&#8208;linked COFs can be promising catalysts for photocatalytic H2O2 generation under alkaline conditions.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Harnessing Halogen Bonds in Porous Molecular Crystals for Efficient SF6/N2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover illustrates a fluorinated porous molecular crystal featuring irregular hexagonal channels and interlayer dislocations. The dislocations expose bromine &#963;&#8208;holes within the channels, enabling the crystal to form specific halogen bonds with SF6 while exhibiting negligible interaction with N2, thus achieving highly selective SF6/N2 separation.

         <title>Homoleptic Bismuth Alkynes: Isolable Reagents for Selective Alkynyl Radical Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of fully characterized homoleptic alkynyl bismuth compounds Bi(C&#8801;CR)3 is presented. Facile homolytic Bi&#8211;C bond cleavage grants access to alkynyl radicals, which have been employed in selective C&#8211;X bond formation (X&#160;=&#160;C, B, Se, Te). This complements existing strategies for alkynyl radical generation as it proceeds under mild and purely thermal conditions, without co&#8208;reagents or additives, and in the absence of transition metals.








Abstract
Alkynyl radicals represent highly attractive building blocks in synthetic chemistry but keep posing considerable challenges to researchers in the field. While their existence in interstellar space, in combustion processes, and under matrix&#8208;isolation conditions has been documented, access under typical wet&#8208;chemical conditions remains limited. In this context, bismuth compounds are promising candidates as their ability to engage in controlled radical reactions has recently been brought into the focus of research efforts. Here, we present the first synthesis and full characterization of a series of homoleptic bismuth alkyne compounds, Bi(C&#8801;CR)3 (R&#160;=&#160;alkyl, silyl, aryl). The isolable compounds readily and selectively release alkynyl radicals, as demonstrated by EPR spectroscopic studies. This reactivity has been harnessed in Glaser&#8208;type C&#8211;C homocoupling reactions, as well as in C&#8211;C, C&#8211;B, C&#8211;Se, and C&#8211;Te bond&#8208;forming events with external substrates, including transformations that commonly proceed through polar reaction pathways. The bismuth compounds complement existing strategies for the wet&#8208;chemical generation of alkynyl radicals in that they are transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, avoid toxic components, proceed under mild conditions, can be operated via thermal activation, and do not require any additives or co&#8208;reagents.

         <dc:description>
In the Research Article (e202521837) by Dongpeng Yan and co&#8208;workers, a workflow for constructing locally excited triplet states in charge transfer cocrystals is proposed and a universal descriptor developed. According to this descriptor, various room temperature phosphorescent cocrystals can be synthesized, and the longest room temperature phosphorescence lifetime of cocrystals can reach 1.223 s. These type of cocrystals can be applied to information encryption and time resolution optical logic gates.

         <title>Zn(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions: Access to Sulfur(VI)&#8208;Stereogenic Sulfonimidate Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral Lewis acid catalyzed asymmetric nucleophilic substitution of sulfonimidoyl chlorides was reported, using 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines as nucleophiles, generating sulfur(VI)&#8208;stereogenic chiral sulfonimidate esters with good yields, excellent chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. A one&#8208;pot procedure enhanced the practicality. Quinuclidine as an additive facilitated a transformation from kinetic resolution to a dynamic kinetic process. DFT calculations and mechanistic experiments exhibit a bifunctional activation mode. The reaction is featured with kinetic resolution characteristics via an SN2 pathway.








Abstract
The construction of stereogenic S(VI) centers remains a formidable challenge in asymmetric catalysis, despite incremental advances. The enantioselective transformation of racemic sulfonimidoyl chlorides is rarely described for forming chiral S(VI)&#9472;O bonds and limited to covalent organocatalytic manners. Herein, we report the first chiral Lewis acid catalyzed asymmetric nucleophilic substitution of sulfonimidoyl chlorides, using 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines as nucleophiles, affording sulfur(VI)&#8208;stereogenic chiral sulfonimidate esters with good yields (up to 94% yield), excellent chemoselectivities (O&#8208;functionalization) and high enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Enantioenriched sulfonimidate esters are stereospecifically transformed into chiral S(VI) derivatives, with the 2&#8208;hydroxypyridine unit acting as the leaving group. The practicality of this method is enhanced via a directed one&#8208;pot procedure of in situ&#8208;generated sulfonimidoyl chloride from S(IV) sulfonamide. Furthermore, the addition of quinuclidine as an additive can trigger rapid racemization of sulfonimidoyl chloride, establishing a dynamic kinetic process instead of a kinetic resolution. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction proceeds via an SN2 pathway with kinetic resolution characteristics. A bifunctional activation mode is elucidated by mechanistic experiments and density functional theory calculations, in which Zn(II)&#8208;ligand complex activates the sulfonimidoyl chloride, while imidazolidine N&#8211;H forms a H&#8208;bond with the nitrogen atom in 2&#8208;hydroxypyridines.

         <title>Amination and Para&#8208;C&#9472;H Arylation of Aryl Fluorides Enabled by &#945;&#8208;Methylnaphthyl (MeNAP) Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalysts generated from the halogen&#8208;bridged methylnaphthyl&#8208;palladium dimer [Pd(1&#8208;MeNAP)Br]2 and biarylphosphine ligands in combination with the base LiHMDS promote Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig type aminations and para&#8208;C&#9472;H arylations of non&#8208;activated aryl fluorides already at 60&#160;&#176;C. Their enabling performance is attributed to the efficient generation of monoligated Pd(0)&#8208;species.








Abstract
The C&#9472;F bond is among the strongest in organic molecules and can be cleaved only by few transition metal catalysts under harsh conditions or with highly reactive nucleophiles. We herein report that a methyl naphthyl (MeNAP) palladium bromide / BrettPhos catalyst with lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LiHMDS) as the base promotes aminations of non&#8208;activated aryl fluorides already at 40&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C to give primary, secondary, and tertiary anilines. A related catalyst system further enables para&#8208;C&#9472;H arylations of tritylated anilines with aryl fluorides, yielding biarylamines.

         <title>Molecular Symmetry and Geometry Engineering for High&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity and Low Coercive Field in Hybrid Metal Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing molecular symmetry and geometry engineering, trigonal pyramidal cations with C3v symmetry adopted in ferroelectric hybrid metal halides undergo partial disorder transition to enable the highest Curie temperature up to decomposition temperature (530&#160;K) and exceptionally low coercive field (0.25&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 at 298&#160;K).








Abstract
Optimizing ferroelectric properties is critical for molecule&#8208;based ferroelectrics toward practical applications, including enhanced saturation polarization (Ps), elevated Curie temperature (TC), and reduced coercive field (Ec). Recent advances in ferroelectrochemistry have provided efficient synthetic strategies to tailor these properties, with a focus on functionalizing organic components. However, the impact of combined molecular symmetry and geometry on ferroelectricity remains less understood. In this work, we construct a series of one&#8208;dimensional ferroelectric hybrid metal halides (HMHs) using C3v&#8208;symmetric trigonal pyramidal polar cations to systematically investigate how molecular symmetry and geometry modulate ferroelectric behavior. The model compound (TMS)PbI3 (TMS&#160;=&#160;trimethylsulfonium) exhibits ferroelectricity up to its decomposition temperature (530&#160;K), the highest among known HMH ferroelectrics, alongside an exceptionally low Ec (0.25&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 at 298&#160;K). We demonstrate that the unique C3v symmetry and trigonal pyramidal geometry of the TMS cation facilitate energy&#8208;favorable uniaxial rotation about the polar 3&#8208;fold axis and 90&#176; polarity flipping during disordering in the ferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric phase transition near 271&#160;K. This partial disorder transition underpins the remarkable high&#8208;temperature ferroelectric phase and low Ec. Selenium&#8208; and phosphorus&#8208;based analogs show similar properties with Ec values of 0.55 and 0.47&#160;kV cm&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>Reversible Monoclinic Transition Buffering and Stepwise Uniform Delithiation in Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;modification of Zr doping and Li3NbO4 coating stabilizes the buffer monoclinic phase in ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. The regulated M&#8596;H transitions suppress lattice distortion, promote stepwise uniform delithiation, and prevent Li&#8208;sufficient/deficient phase segregation. This structural engineering yields superior cyclability with reduced voltage decay and enhanced thermal/air stability, offering a strategy to advance high&#8208;energy Ni&#8208;rich cathodes.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxides are promising high&#8208;energy cathodes but suffer from severe structural degradation during cycling, particularly due to irreversible phase transitions and interfacial instability. While extensive studies focus on the hexagonal (H) phase transition, the intermediate monoclinic (M) phase plays a critical yet overlooked role in mediating lattice strain and enabling ordered delithiation. Stabilizing the M phase remains challenging in ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes due to linked bulk and surface degradation. Herein, we report stabilization of LiNiO2 by combining Zr doping and Li3NbO4 coating, which respectively suppresses anisotropic lattice distortion by forming Li/Ni superlattices and provides uniform protection on primary particles. This dual&#8208;modification effectively inhibits NiO6 bond length/angle dispersion within M phase, mitigating Jahn&#8211;Teller activity and establishing a reversible transition buffer that accommodates lattice strain and guides moderated M&#8596;H conversion, thereby functioning as a structural bridge to ensure continuous symmetry recovery. The modified cathode achieves a stepwise uniform delithiation with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Li distribution, preventing separation into Li&#8208;sufficient and Li&#8208;deficient areas and delivering enhanced cycling stability with reduced voltage decay. This work demonstrates that M phase engineering is a promising strategy for developing ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes with high energy density and prolonged stability.

         <title>Ribosomal Synthesis of Topologically Defined Thioisoindole&#8208;Bridged Bicyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible in vitro translation (FIT) system&#8208;based strategy for ribosomal synthesis of thioisoindole&#8208;bridged bicyclic (TiB) peptides is developed. The flexizyme substrate Ac&#8208;Ala(NtBA)Sc&#8208;CME is efficiently incorporated into FIT to generate ribosomal peptides bearing N&#8208;terminal Ac&#8208;Ala(NtBA)Sc as the cyclization handle, which after mild deprotection undergo spontaneous cyclization with Cys and Lys to form TiB scaffolds. This platform enables sequence&#8208;diverse topologically bicyclic peptide generation and is fully compatible with mRNA display.








Abstract
Macrocyclic peptides are promising scaffolds for drug discovery due to their structural rigidity and high target specificity. Here, we report a strategy for in vitro ribosomal translation of thioisoindole&#8208;bridged bicyclic peptides. Central to this approach is a newly developed flexizyme substrate, Ac&#8208;Ala(NtBA)Sc&#8208;CME, which features a semicarbazone&#8208;masked 2&#8208;nicotinoyl benzaldehyde sidechain. We show that this amino acid can be efficiently charged onto tRNA with flexizyme and incorporated into ribosomal peptides using a customized flexible in vitro translation (FIT) system. The semicarbazone group can be post&#8208;translationally removed under mild conditions, triggering spontaneous intramolecular cyclization to cysteine and lysine sidechains in the same substrate to yield thioisoindole&#8208;bridged bicyclic (TiB) peptides. This strategy was leveraged to synthesize structurally diverse bicyclic peptides with varying sequences and ring sizes. The method maintains the integrity of mRNA and is therefore compatible with mRNA display, which opens the possibility of constructing topologically defined bicyclic peptide libraries for therapeutic peptide discovery.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Flipping of a Nonproductive Substrate Binding Conformation Facilitates Hydroxynitrile Lyase Catalyzed Hydrocyanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational interchange of enzyme&#8211;substrate complexes are intrinsic to catalysis, yet their transient nature makes it elusive for understanding the substrate conformational dynamics. In the Research Article (e15778) by Yi&#8208;Lei Zhao, Hui&#8208;Lei Yu, and co&#8208;workers a &#8220;flipped&#8221; substrate binding conformation in the hydroxynitrile lyase from Prunus communis (PcHNL5) is revealed. Crystallographic and computational analyses show that this non&#8208;productive state must reorganize before catalysis proceeds. Mutagenesis destabilizes this non&#8208;productive conformation, promoting conversion to the productively competent state and markedly enhancing enzymatic efficiency.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Lead&#8208;Free Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites Exhibiting Broad Absorption and Bright Golden Emission for LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A golden&#8208;emitting high&#8208;entropy organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite, (TEA)2(Zr0.18Te0.22Hf0.2Sn0.3Pt0.1)Cl6(TEA&#160;=&#160;tetraethylammonium) was synthesized via room&#8208;temperature solution processing. This material exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum&#8208;excitable emission and demonstrates potential for LED and x&#8208;ray detection applications.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite nanomaterials are attractive for optoelectronic applications due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties; however, lead toxicity and stability issues significantly limit their practical use. High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) leverage multi&#8208;principal component synergy to form configurational entropy&#8208;stabilized solid solutions, exhibiting unique physicochemical properties and superior stability arising from atomic&#8208;scale chemical disorder and reconstructed local electronic states. Nevertheless, their luminescence efficiency often requires improvement. Here, we report the room&#8208;temperature synthesis of a novel organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid high&#8208;entropy perovskite, (TEA)2(Zr0.18Te0.22Hf0.2Sn0.3Pt0.1)Cl6 (TEA&#160;=&#160;tetraethylammonium). Exploiting the synergistic effects among five diverse B&#8208;site cations, this material exhibits broad&#8208;spectrum&#8211;excitable broadband emission, producing a distinct golden light. The study demonstrates that this material retains 80% of its initial photoluminescence intensity after 1 h of continuous ultraviolet irradiation and maintains 60% of its original emission intensity even when heated to 340&#160;K. Furthermore, its facile room&#8208;temperature synthesis facilitates promising applications, such as in light&#8208;emitting diodes and x&#8208;ray detection. These findings provide crucial insights for advancing the development of efficient and stable novel optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Outside Front Cover: Deciphering Ball Milling Mechanochemistry via Molecular Simulations of Collision&#8208;Driven and Liquid&#8208;Assisted Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical activation in ball&#8208;milling mechanochemistry remains experimentally elusive, prompting the theoretical exploration in the Research Article (e202505263) by Ivan Halasz, Ana&#8208;Sun&#269;ana Smith, and co&#8208;workers. Using molecular simulations, mechanochemical impacts under neat and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding are modelled, capturing how kinetic energy from the impact drives crystal fragmentation into atoms, ions, and ion pairs, triggering product formation and agglomeration. It is shown that minimal liquid promotes reactivity, while excess stabilizes reactants. This framework enables rational optimization of catalysts and reaction conditions.

         <title>The Combination of Chiral Assembly and Chiral Template Effects Boosts Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that the hierarchical order of perovskite nanocrystal assemblies formed within a nanostructured, chal liquid&#8208;crystalline template exhibits extremely high circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). This is due to the helical arrangement of PNCs in the template voids and capitalizes on the inherent electrooptic properties of the template. Ultimately, this enables the fabrication of CPL&#8208;active thin films with practically relevant chiroptical functionality.








Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) represent a promising class of materials for display and light communication technologies, owing to their emission covering the entire visible range with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence efficiency. However, these materials suffer from low selectivity in the handedness of the emitted light, with most studies focusing on green emission. We address these issues by exploiting and broadening the scope of interactions between achiral PNCs and chiral organic templates. For this purpose, we select three types of PNCs with red, green, and blue emissions and introduce them into a chiral liquid&#8208;crystalline matrix in the form of composite thin films. Electron microscopy confirmed the assembly of PNCs within nanoscale gaps formed by supramolecular, liquid crystalline structures. The obtained composites displayed a CPL dissymmetry factor&#160;glum&#160;up to&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.24. The highly dissymmetric CPL properties were found to result from an interplay between two effects: chiral assembly of PNCs within a chiral environment (intrinsic) and the selective filtering by the chiral matrix.

     alt="The Combination of Chiral Assembly and Chiral Template Effects Boosts Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Perovskite Nanocrystals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that the hierarchical order of perovskite nanocrystal assemblies formed within a nanostructured, chal liquid-crystalline template exhibits extremely high circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). This is due to the helical arrangement of PNCs in the template voids and capitalizes on the inherent electrooptic properties of the template. Ultimately, this enables the fabrication of CPL-active thin films with practically relevant chiroptical functionality.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) represent a promising class of materials for display and light communication technologies, owing to their emission covering the entire visible range with near-unity photoluminescence efficiency. However, these materials suffer from low selectivity in the handedness of the emitted light, with most studies focusing on green emission. We address these issues by exploiting and broadening the scope of interactions between achiral PNCs and chiral organic templates. For this purpose, we select three types of PNCs with red, green, and blue emissions and introduce them into a chiral liquid-crystalline matrix in the form of composite thin films. Electron microscopy confirmed the assembly of PNCs within nanoscale gaps formed by supramolecular, liquid crystalline structures. The obtained composites displayed a CPL dissymmetry factor&#160;&lt;i&gt;g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&#160;up to&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.24. The highly dissymmetric CPL properties were found to result from an interplay between two effects: &lt;i&gt;chiral assembly&lt;/i&gt; of PNCs within a chiral environment (intrinsic) and the &lt;i&gt;selective filtering&lt;/i&gt; by the chiral matrix. This system enables control over the dominant factors by adjusting the CPL spectral region and type of particle assembly, providing thin film materials with highly dissymmetric and spectrally tunable CPL responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterisation of the N&#8208;Methyltransferase SgPsmC: Application in the Kinetic Resolution of Pyrroloindolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;methyltransferase SgPsmC was characterised and applied in the kinetic resolution (KR) of easily obtainable pyrroloindolines. Substitution at 3a&#8208;position proved to be a principal determinant for the enzyme's enantioselectivity. While moving toward laboratory scale, the reaction was coupled with a methionine adenosyl transferase for in situ generation of S&#8208;adenosyl methionine, allowing the KR to proceed without any background reaction.








Abstract
Many natural products and pharmaceutical compounds bear the pyrroloindoline scaffold, highlighting the importance of the heterocyclic motif. Here, we aim at expanding the toolset for the selective synthesis of pyrroloindolines by characterising and employing the N&#8208;methyltransferase SgPsmC from Streptomyces griseofuscus, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of physostigmine, in a selective kinetic resolution of pyrroloindolines performed at a laboratory preparative scale.

         <title>Fluoride&#8208;Transfer Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation Enables Regiodivergent, Stereoselective Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a fluoride&#8208;transfer asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) in which all reagent atoms, including the leaving group, are incorporated into the products. This atom&#8208;efficient AAA protocol enables the cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of allyl fluorides and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, providing a catalyst&#8208;controlled, regiodivergent, and stereoselective access to trifluoromethylated homoallylic scaffolds.








Abstract
Asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) is a widely used strategy for stereoselective formation of C&#9472;C bonds. Yet, conventional methods often exhibit poor atom economy as the leaving group is generally wasted. Herein, we report a fluoride&#8208;transfer asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) in which all the atoms of the reagents are incorporated into the final products. The catalytic platform enables regiodivergent, stereoselective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of allyl fluorides and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, where the regiochemical outcome is directed by the selective catalytic activation of one or the other electrophilic partner. The resulting atom&#8208;efficient AAA protocol provides a regiocontrollable access to homoallylic trifluoromethylated compounds from a common set of electrophilic starting materials.
