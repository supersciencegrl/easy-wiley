      <title>Rapid High&#8208;Resolution 3D Printing and Surface Functionalization via Type I Photoinitiated RAFT Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>RAFT facilitated digital light projection 3D printing of polymeric materials provides a convenient and facile route for inducing post&#8208;fabrication transformations via reactivation of dormant chain transfer agents. While applying RAFT photopolymerization to additive manufacturing has been explored in some early works, these systems are unable to produce commercially viable build speeds and are only printable if high concentrations of a select few divinyl crosslinking monomers are used. In this work, we report the use of a Norrish type I photoinitiator in conjunction with a RAFT agent to produce a variety of open&#8208;air 3D printable resins that rapidly cure under visible light irradiation (&#955;max = 405 nm). The photoinitiator&#8208;RAFT system polymerizes extremely quickly and provides high 3D printing build rates of up to 9.1 cm/h, representing a 7&#8208;fold increase compared to previous RAFT mediated 3D printing systems. 3D printed materials containing thiocarbonylthio groups can be also produced using low concentrations of divinyl comonomers in the initial resins, which has not been successfully achieved using other photocontrolled RAFT polymerization techniques. Interestingly, the inclusion of RAFT agents significantly improves 3D printing resolution compared to formulations without RAFT agent, allowing the fabrication of intricate and complex objects. Spatiotemporally controlled surface modifications of the 3D printed objects from the dormant RAFT agent groups on the material surfaces were also performed under one and two&#8208;pass configurations, inducing multiple successive post&#8208;printing transformations on the same object. The rapidly curing photoinitiator&#8208;RAFT 3D printing process reported herein paves the way for a new generation of previously unprintable RAFT functionalized materials to be printed with high resolution and at commercially competitive build speeds.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling generally forms C&#8211;N bonds by reductive elimination from metal complexes bearing covalent C&#8208; and N&#8208;ligands.

Mechanistic studies suggest the process operates via transmetalation of an aryl organoboron to a Cu(II) complex bearing neutral N&#8208;ligands, such as nitriles or N&#8208;heterocycles. Subsequent generation of a putative Cu(III) complex enables the oxidative C&#8211;N coupling to take place, delivering nitrilium intermediates and pyridinium products. The reaction is general for a range of N(sp) and N(sp  2  ) precursors and can be applied to drug synthesis and late&#8208;stage N&#8208;arylation, and the limitations in the methodology are mechanistically evidenced.</dc:description>

      <title>Construct Sturdy Packing of Self&#8208;Assembling Iridium Complex via Endocytic Trafficking for Long&#8208;Term Lysosome Tracking</title>
      <dc:description>Live cell imaging of lysosome positioning and motility is critical to the study of lysosome status and function for pharmacological interventions. To create a super stable lysosomal probe for long&#8208;term live cell imaging, we design and synthesize an aromatic&#8208;peptide&#8208;conjugated cyclometalated iridium(III) complex that emits light via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking oriented self&#8208;assembly in water at extremely low concentration. Through endocytic trafficking, self&#8208;assemblies transform from nanoparticles to sturdy packed networks stabilized in lysosomal acidic environment. Upon short time/low dose treatment of the iridium complex at passage 0, live cell lysosomal tracking is applicable beyond the 14th passage of cells with high labelling rate and a mild decline in luminescent intensity. The illuminated lysosomes are trackable using super&#8208;resolution imaging to study their response to cellular processes.</dc:description>

      <title>The design of a GLP&#8208;1/PYY dual acting agonist</title>
      <dc:description>The two gut hormones GLP&#8208;1 and PYY  3&#8208;36  , which are both secreted from the L&#8208;cells upon food stimuli, have a stronger inhibitory effect on food intake when they are combined, compared to their individual effects as single agonists. Although they are not homologous and share no sequence similarity, we show that a GLP&#8208;1 analogue can be designed to exhibit potent activity on both the Y  2  and GLP&#8208;1 receptors. Dual acting hybrid analogues were realized by designing truncated and potent Y  2  receptor PYY analogues, followed by integrating the critical residues into GLP&#8208;1.

      <title>Scalable De Novo Synthesis of Aldgarose and Total Synthesis of Aldgamycin N</title>

To mitigate the &#8220;cost&#8221; of this strategic amendment, a practical and scalable de novo synthesis of this precious branched octose was developed.

      <title>Efficient Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Carbonylation of 1,3&#8208;Dienes: Selective Synthesis of Adipates and Other Aliphatic Diesters</title>

      <title>Strong Self&#8208;Trapped Exciton Emissions in Two&#8208;dimensional Na&#8208;In Halide Perovskites Triggered by Antimony Doping</title>
      <dc:description>Soft lattice and strong exciton&#8208;phonon coupling have been demonstrated in layered double perovskites (LDPs) recently, therefore LDP represents a promising class of compounds as excellent self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) emitters for applications in the field of solid&#8208;state lighting. However, few LDPs with outstanding STE emissions have been discovered, and their optoelectronic properties are still unclear. Based on the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Cs  2  NaInCl  6  , we synthesized two 2D derivatives (PEA)  4  NaInCl  8  : Sb (PEA = phenethylamine) and (PEA)  2  CsNaInCl  7  : Sb with monolayer and bilayer inorganic sheets by a combination of dimensional reduction and Sb&#8208;doping. Bright broadband emissions were obtained for the first time under ambient temperature and pressure, with photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 48.7% (mono&#8208;) and 29.3% (bi&#8208;), superior to current known LDPs. Spectroscopic characterizations and first&#8208;principles calculations of excited state indicate the broadband emissions originate from STEs trapped at the introduced [SbCl  6  ]  3&#8208;  octahedron. Our results provide important insights for designing LDPs with broadband emissions.</dc:description>

      <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Featured Rigid Polyimides Affording Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with High External Quantum Efficiency Up to 21.0%</title>
      <dc:description>A series of rigid nonconjugated polyimide (PI)&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers were reported for the first time, based on a &#8220;&#8208;TADF&#8208;Linker&#8208;Host&#8208;&#8221;strategy. Among of which, the TADF unit contains a typical TADF luminous core structure, the host unit exhibits effective conjugation length that endows polyimide with high triplet energy, and the linker unit has an aliphatic ring structure to improve solubility and inhibit intramolecular charge transfer effect, thus making the polymers exhibit the TADF property of the TADF unit. All the TADF polyimides exhibit high thermal stability (  T  g  &gt; 308  o  C) and refractive index (1.76&#8208;1.79). Remarkably, highly&#8208;efficient polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) based on the polymers are successfully realized, leading to a maximal external quantum efficiency of 21.0% along with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. Such an outstanding efficiency is amongst the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance of nonconjugated PLEDs, confirming the effectiveness of our structural design strategy, providing helpful and valuable guidance on the development of highly&#8208;efficient fluorescent polymer materials and PLEDs.</dc:description>

      <title>Asymmetric Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidation of Functionalized Aldimines as 1,4&#8208;Dipoles</title>
      <dc:description>The use of functionalized aldimines has been demonstrated as newly structural 1,4&#8208;dipole precursors under carbene catalysis. More importantly, enantiodivergent organocatalysis has been successfully developed using carbene catalysts with the same absolute configuration, leading to both (  R  )&#8208; and (  S  )&#8208; enantiomers of six&#8208;membered heterocycles with quaternary carbon centers.

      <title>Effect of MOF Database Selection on the Assessment of Gas Storage and Separation Potentials of MOFs</title>
      <dc:description>Development of computation&#8208;ready metal&#8208;organic framework databases (MOF DBs) has accelerated high&#8208;throughput computational screening (HTCS) of materials to identify the best candidates for gas storage and separation.

We examined thousands of common materials of the two recently updated, very widely used MOF DBs to reveal how structural discrepancies affect simulated CH  4  , H  2  , CO  2  uptakes and CH  4  /H  2  separation performances of MOFs.

      <dc:description>The co&#8208;insertion of dual ions can often offer enhanced electrochemical performance for the aqueous zinc batteries. Although the insertion of non&#8208;metallic ions has been achieved in aqueous zinc batteries, the co&#8208;insertion chemistry of non&#8208;metallic cations is still a challenge. Here, a reversible H  +  /NH  4  +  co&#8208;insertion/extraction mechanism was developed in an aqueous Zn/MnO  2  battery system. The synergistic effect between the dual cations endows the aqueous batteries with the fast kinetics of ion diffusion and the reversible structure evolution of MnO  2  . As a result, the Zn/MnO  2  battery displays excellent rate capability and cycling performance. This work will pave the way toward the design of aqueous rechargeable batteries with non&#8208;metallic ions.</dc:description>

      <title>Assembly of dynamic supramolecular polymers on a DNA origami platform</title>
      <dc:description>Biological processes rely on transient non&#8208;covalent interactions that govern the assembly of molecular building blocks into higher order, multi&#8208;component systems with emergent functions and topologies. A platform for the dynamic assembly of synthetic multicomponent complexes, analogous to the above, would provide novel entries to study and modulate the assembly of synthetic systems into higher order topologies. Here, we establish a hybrid DNA origami&#8208;based approach as an assembly platform that enables dynamic templating of supramolecular architectures. It entails the site&#8208;selective recruitment of multicomponent supramolecular polymers to the DNA origami platform with preservation of the intrinsic dynamics and reversibility of the assembly process. We show that the composition of the supramolecular assembly on the platform can be tuned dynamically and that the system allows for monomer rearrangement as well as for the inclusion of molecular cargo. We envision that this work lays the conceptual basis for studying synthetic supramolecular structures in their native environment in real&#8208;time and provides the basis new strategies for controlled multicomponent self&#8208;assembly of synthetic building blocks.</dc:description>

      <title>Boosting Zn electrode reversibility in aqueous electrolyte using low&#8208;cost antisolvents</title>
      <dc:description>Antisolvent addition has been widely studied in crystallization in the pharmaceutical industries by breaking the solvation balance of the original solution. Here we report a similar antisolvent strategy to boost Zn reversibility via regulation of the electrolyte on a molecular level. By adding for example methanol into ZnSO  4  electrolyte, the free water and coordinated water in Zn  2+  solvation sheath gradually interact with the antisolvent, which minimizes water activity and weakens Zn  2+  solvation. Concomitantly, dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition occurs via change in the deposition orientation, as evidenced by in situ optical microscopy. Zn reversibility is significantly boosted in antisolvent electrolyte of 50% methanol by volume (Anti&#8208;M&#8208;50%) even under harsh environments of &#8722;20 &#176;C and 60 &#176;C. Additionally, the suppressed side reactions and dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping in Anti&#8208;M&#8208;50% electrolyte significantly enhance performance of Zn/polyaniline coin and pouch cells. We demonstrate this low&#8208;cost strategy can be readily generalized to other solvents, indicating its practical universality.

      <title>Synthesis of Core@Shell Cu&#8208;Ni@Pt&#8208;Cu Nano&#8208;Octahedra and Their Improved MOR Activity</title>
      <dc:description>Fabrication of 3  d  metal&#8208;based core@shell nanocatalysts with engineered Pt&#8208;surfaces provides an effective approach for improving the catalytic performance. The challenges in such preparation include shape control of the 3  d  metallic cores and thickness control of the Pt&#8208;based shells. Herein, we report a colloidal seed&#8208;mediated method to prepare octahedral CuNi@Pt&#8208;Cu core@shell nanocrystals using CuNi octahedral cores as the template. By precisely controlling the synthesis conditions including the deposition rate and diffusion rate of the shell&#8208;formation through tuning the capping ligand, reaction temperature, and heating rate, uniform Pt&#8208;based shells can be achieved with a thickness of &lt; 1 nm. The resultant carbon&#8208;supported CuNi@Pt&#8208;Cu core@shell nano&#8208;octahedra showed superior activity in electrochemical methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) compared with the commercial Pt/C catalysts and carbon&#8208;supported CuNi@Pt&#8208;Cu nano&#8208;polyhedron counterparts, demonstrating that both the lattice strain and shape effects arising from the as&#8208;prepared CuNi@Pt&#8208;Cu octahedral nanocatalysts play a crucial role in MOR performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Na3SO4H &#8211; the first representative of the material class of sulphate hydrides</title>
      <dc:description>The first representative of a novel class of mixed&#8208;anionic compounds, the sulphate hydride Na  3  SO  4  H and the corresponding deuteride Na  3  SO  4  D were obtained from the solid&#8208;state reaction of NaH or NaD with dry Na  2  SO  4  . An exact reaction control is required, since too harsh conditions lead to the reduction of sulphate to sulfide. A combined X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction study revealed that the compound crystallizes in the tetragonal space group  P  4/  nmm  with the lattice parameters  a  = 7.0034(2) &#197; and  c  = 4.8569(2) &#197;. The sole presence of hydride and absence of hydroxide ions is proven by vibrational spectroscopy and comparison with spectra obtained from quantum chemical calculations.  1  H and  23  Na MAS NMR spectra are consistent with the structure of Na  3  SO  4  H: a single  1  H peak at 2.9 ppm is observed, while two peaks, at 15.0 and 6.2 ppm for the inequivalent  23  Na sites are observed. Elemental analysis and quantum chemical calculations further support these results. The newly discovered compound adds to the emerging new classes of mixed anionic hydrides which may in the future prove useful for ionic conduction applications and beyond.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Hydrogenation of Heavy Homologues of Rhodium Carbynes: [(Me3P)2(Ph3P)Rh&#8801;E&#8208;Ar*] (E = Sn, Pb)</title>

Tin dihydride  3  was either synthesized in reaction of the dihydridostannate [Ar*SnH  2  ]  &#8211;  with [(Ph  3  P)  3  RhCl] or via reaction between hydrides [(Ph  3  P)  3  RhH] and &#189; [(Ar*SnH)  2  ]. Homologous lead hydride [(Ph  3  P)  2  RhH  2  PbAr*] (  7  ) was synthesized analogously from [(Ph  3  P)  3  RhH] and &#189; [(Ar*PbH)  2  ]. Abstraction of hydrogen from  3  and  7  supported by styrene and trimethylphosphine addition yields tetrylidynes  10  and  11  . Stannylidyne  10  was also characterized by  119  Sn M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Hydrogenation of the triple bonds at room temperature with excess H  2  gives the  cis  &#8208;dihydride [(Me  3  P)  2  (Ph  3  P)RhH  2  PbAr*] (  12  ) and the tetrahydride [(Me  3  P)  2  (Ph  3  P)RhH  2  SnH  2  Ar*] (  14  ). Complex  14  eliminates spontaneously one equivalent of hydrogen at room temperature to give the dihydride [(Me  3  P)  2  (Ph  3  P)RhH  2  SnAr*] (  13  ). Hydrogen addition and elimination at stannylene tin between complexes  13  and  14  is a reversible reaction at room temperature.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>C  &#8208;aryl glycosyl compounds offer better  in vivo  stability relative to  O&#8208;  and  N&#8208;  glycoside analogues.  C  &#8208;aryl glycosides are extensively investigated as drug candidates and applied to chemical biology studies. Previously,  C  &#8208;aryl glycosides are derived from lactones, glycals, glycosyl stannanes, and halides, via methods displaying various limitations with respect to the scope, functional group compatibility, and practicality. Challenges remain in the synthesis of  C  &#8208;aryl nucleosides and 2&#8208;deoxysugars from easily accessible carbohydrate precursors. Herein, we report a cross&#8208;coupling method to prepare  C  &#8208;aryl and heteroaryl glycosides, including nucleosides and 2&#8208;deoxysugars, from glycosyl esters and bromoarenes. Activation of the carbohydrate substrates leverages dihydropyridine (DHP) as an activating group followed by decarboxylation to generate a glycosyl radical via C&#8211;O bond homolysis. This strategy represents a new means to activate alcohols as a cross&#8208;coupling partner. The convenient preparation of glycosyl esters and their stability exemplifies the potential of this method in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Stanene&#8208;Based Nanosheets for&#160;&#946;&#8208;Elemene Delivery and Ultrasound&#8208;Mediated Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has emerged as a superior modality for cancer treatment owing to the non&#8208;invasiveness and high tissue&#8208;penetrating depth. However, developing biocompatible nanomaterial&#8208;based sonosensitizers with efficient SDT capability remains challenging. Here, we employed a liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation strategy to obtain a new type of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) stanene&#8208;based nanosheets (SnNSs) with a band gap of 2.3 eV, which is narrower than those of the most extensively studied nano&#8208;sonosensitizers, allowing a more efficient US&#8208;triggered separation of electron (e  &#8722;  )&#8722;hole (h  +  ) pairs for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In addition, we discovered that such SnNSs could also serve as robust near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) agents owing to their efficient photothermal conversion, and serve as nanocarriers for anticancer drug delivery owing to the inherent 2D layered structure. This study not only presents general nanoplatforms for SDT&#8208;enhanced combination cancer therapy, but also highlights the utility of 2D SnNSs to the field of nanomedicine.</dc:description>

      <title>Exclusive strain effect boosts overall water splitting in PdCu/Ir core/shell nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>Core/shell nanocatalysts are a class of promising materials, which achieve the enhanced catalytic activities through the synergy between ligand effect and strain effect. However, it has been challenging to disentangle the contributions from the two effects, which hinders the rational design of superior core/shell nanocatalysts. Herein, we report precise synthesis of PdCu/Ir core/shell nanocrystals, which can significantly boost oxygen evolution reaction (OER)  via  the exclusive strain effect. This is accomplished by heteroepitaxial coating of four Ir atomic layers onto PdCu nanoparticle. The relatively thick Ir shell eliminates the ligand effect, but creates a compressive strain of ~3.60%. The strained PdCu/Ir catalysts can deliver an overpotential of 283 mV with a corresponding current density of 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  and a mass activity of 1.83 A mg  &#8722;2  Ir  at 1.51 V (  vs.  RHE). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the compressive strain in Ir shell downshifts the d&#8208;band center and weakens the binding of the intermediates, leading to the enhanced OER activity. The compressive strain is also found to boost hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. It is further demonstrated that the strained PdCu/Ir core/shell nanocrystals are excellent catalysts for both anode and cathode in overall water&#8208;splitting electrocatalysis, attaining an impressive cell voltage of 1.583 V at 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  with a long&#8208;term stability of 2000 cycles.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Photocatalytic anticancer profile of a Ir(III) photocatalyst (  Ir3  ) with strong light absorption, high turnover frequency, and excellent biocompatibility is reported.  Ir3  showed selective photo&#8208;cytotoxicity against cisplatin&#8208; and sorafenib&#8208;resistant cell lines while remaining dormant to normal cell lines in the dark.  Ir3  exhibited excellent photo&#8208;catalytic oxidation of cellular co&#8208;enzyme, the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), and amino acids via a single electron transfer mechanism. The photo&#8208;induced intracellular redox imbalance and change in mitochondrial membrane potential resulted in necrosis and apoptosis of cancer cells. Importantly,  Ir3  exhibited high biocompatibility and photo&#8208;catalytic anticancer efficiency as evident from  in&#8208;vivo  zebrafish and mouse cancer models. To the best of our knowledge,  Ir3  is the first Ir(III) based photocatalyst with such a high biocompatibility and photocatalytic anticancer therapeutic effect.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In multistep continuous flow chemistry, studying complex reaction mixtures in real time is a significant challenge, but provides an opportunity to enhance reaction understanding and control. We report the integration of four complementary process analytical technology tools (NMR, UV/vis, IR and UHPLC) in the multistep synthesis of an active pharmaceutical ingredient, mesalazine. This synthetic route exploits flow processing for nitration, high temperature hydrolysis and hydrogenation reactions, as well as three inline separations.

Here, we modularly design peptide&#8208;cyanine conjugates that intracellularly self&#8208;assembly into 1D columnar superstructures with controlled cyanine aggregation, exhibiting distinct imaging or photothermal properties.

While self&#8208;assembled residue with single cyanine substitution (Pr&#8208;1Cy) forms loose column, in which cyanine dyes with undefined structure keeps fluorescence quantum yield up to 9.5 % (emission at 819 nm in H2O).

      <title>A Fast Room&#8208;Temperature Self&#8208;Healing Glassy Polyurethane</title>
      <dc:description>Glassy polymer can hardly self&#8208;heal at room temperature because of their frozen polymer chains under such a state. Now, we designed and synthesized a colorless and transparent glassy polyurethane assembled using low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight oligomers carrying a large number of loosely packed weak hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds), which has a glass transition temperature (T  g  ) up to 36.8 &#176;C and behaves unprecedentedly robust stiffness with a tensile Young&#8217;s modulus of 1.56&#177;0.03 GPa. Fast room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing was observed in this polymer network that the broken glassy polyurethane (GPU) specimen can recover to a tensile strength up 7.74&#177;0.76 MPa after healing for as little as 10 min, which is quite prominent compared to the reported room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing polymers. We revealed that the high density of loose&#8208;packed hydrogen bonds can reversibly dissociate/associate below T  g  of GPU (that is secondary relaxation), which enables the reconfiguration of the damaged network in the fractured interfaces, in spite of the extremely slow diffusion dynamics of molecular chains under room temperature. Based on these features, we demonstrate that our GPU shows potential application as an optical lens</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Electrofluorescence from a Thermally&#8208;Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecule</title>
      <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR&#8208;OLEDs) are potential light&#8208;sources for various sensing applications since the OLEDs possess unique features such as ultra&#8208;flexibility and the possibility for low&#8208;cost fabrication. However, the rather low external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency (EQE) of NIR&#8208;OLEDs has been a critical obstacle for the potential applications. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient NIR emitter exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and its application to NIR&#8208;OLEDs. The designed NIR&#8208;TADF emitter, TPA&#8208;PZTCN, has a high photoluminescence quantum yield of over 40% with a peak wavelength at 729 nm even in a highly doped co&#8208;deposited film. The EL peak wavelength of the NIR&#8208;OLED is 734 nm with an EQE of 13.4%, which is unprecedented among rare&#8208;metal&#8208;free NIR&#8208;OLEDs in this spectral range. Further, TPA&#8208;PZTCN can sensitize a deep NIR fluorophore to achieve a peak wavelength of approximately 900 nm, resulting in an EQE of over 1% in a TADF&#8208;sensitized NIR&#8208;OLED with high operational device durability (LT  95  &gt;600 hr.).</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The first C5 polymerization is reported, where the main&#8208;chain is growing by five carbon atoms of the monomer at a time. Three dienyltriphenylarsonium ylide monomers were synthesized and polymerized with triethylborane as initiator leading to random terpolymers (C1, C3, C5) with mainly C5 repeating units (up to 84.1%). It has been found that the methyl group (electron&#8208;donating substituent) on the conjugated double bond of ylides facilitates the formation of C5 segments. A mechanism was proposed based on NMR characterization and DFT calculations. The high C5 content ensures that we are on the right track for pure C5 homopolymerization.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Fabrication of Low&#8208;Coordinate Single&#8208;Atom Ni Electrocatalysts by MOFs for Highly Selective CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted tremendous interests due to their ultrahigh activity and selectivity. However, the rational control over coordination environment of SACs remains a grand challenge. Herein, a post&#8208;synthetic metal substitution (PSMS) strategy has been developed to fabricate single&#8208;atom Ni catalysts with different N coordination numbers (denoted Ni&#8208;Nx&#8208;C) on pre&#8208;designed N&#8208;doped carbon derived from metal&#8208;organic frameworks. When served for CO2 electroreduction, the obtained Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C catalyst achieves CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 95.6%, much superior to that of Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;C. Theoretical calculations reveal that the lower Ni coordination number in Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C can significantly enhance COOH* formation, thereby accelerating CO2 reduction. In addition, Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C shows excellent performance in Zn&#8208;CO2 battery with ultrahigh CO FE and excellent stability. This work opens up a new and general avenue to accurate control over coordination environment of SACs for CO2 utilization.</dc:description>

      <title>Biodegradable Charge Transfer Complexes for Glutathione Depletion Induced Ferroptosis and NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Imaging Guided Cancer Photothermal Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Suffering from the laborious synthesis and undesirable tumor microenvironment response, the exploitation of novel NIR&#8208;II absorbed organic photothermal agents is of importance to promote phototherapeutic efficacy. Herein, two kinds of charge transfer complex nanoparticles (TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ and TMB&#8208;TCNQ) are prepared via supramolecular assembly. Because of the larger energy gap between donor and acceptor, TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ presents higher charge transfer degree (72%) than that of TMB&#8208;TCNQ (48%) in nanoaggregates. Therefore, TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ exhibits stronger NIR&#8208;II absorption ability with a mass extinction coefficient of 15.4 Lg  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  at 1300 nm and better photothermal effect. Impressively, the specific cysteine response can make the TMB&#8208;F4TCNQ effectively inhibit the intracellular biosynthesis of GSH, leading to redox dsyhomeostasis and ROS&#8208;mediated ferroptosis.

      <title>Complementary Syntheses Giving Access to a Full Suite of Differentially Substituted Phthalocyanine&#8208;Porphyrin Hybrids**</title>
      <dc:description>Phthalocyanines and porphyrins are often the scaffolds of choice for use in widespread applications. Synthetic advances allow bespoke derivatives to be made, tailoring their properties. The selective synthesis of unsymmetrical systems, particularly phthalocyanines, has remained a significant unmet challenge. Porphyrin&#8208;phthalocyanine hybrids offer the potential to combine the favorable features of both parent structures, but again synthetic strategies are poorly developed. Here we demonstrate strategies that give straightforward, controlled access to differentially substituted meso&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrabenzotriazaporphyrins by reaction between an aryl&#8208;aminoisoindolene (    A    ) initiator and a complementary phthalonitrile (    B    ). The choice of precursors and reaction conditions allows selective preparation of 1:3    Ar&#8208;ABBB    and, uniquely, 2:2    Ar&#8208;ABBA   functionalised hybrids.</dc:description>

      <title>Generation of elemental fluorine through the electrolysis of copper difluoride at room temperature</title>
      <dc:description>The safe generation of F2  gas at room temperature using simple cell configurations has been the &#8216;holy grail&#8217; of fluorine research for centuries. Thus, to address this issue, we report F2  gas generation through the electrolysis of CuF2  in a CsF&#8208;2.45HF molten salt without the evolution of H2  gas. The CuF2  is selected through a series of thermodynamic and kinetic assessments of possible metal fluorides. Anode assessments on graphite and glass&#8208;like carbon demonstrate absence of the anode effect during F2  gas generation due to stabilized operations at room temperature. Although Ni anode dissolves during electrolysis in the conventional medium&#8208;temperature cell, herein, it facilitates stable electrolysis over 100 h, achieving the F2  gas purity over 99 % with potential operation using one&#8208;compartment electrolysis. This work presents a safe and propitious mechanism for high&#8208;purity fluorine gas generation for small&#8208;scale lab and industrial applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Hysteretic Control of Near&#8208;infrared Transparency Using a Liquescent Radical Cation</title>
      <dc:description>A liquescent dihydrophenazine radical cation,  1  &#8226;+  &#8226;NTf  2  &#8211;  , showed drastic changes in near&#8208;infrared (near&#8208;IR) transparency and opaqueness through hysteretic phase transitions with no measurable degradation of the compound even under aerated conditions. During the heating and slow cooling process (0.5 K min  &#8211;1  ), its electronic and magnetic properties were altered clearly and repeatedly changed between diamagnetic solid and paramagnetic liquid states. The liquid state was transparent to near&#8208;IR light (940 nm), but the solid state was opaque, despite both samples exhibiting a similar green color under room light. Additionally, the liquid state was changed to a glass state under a fast cooling process (2&#8211;10 K min  &#8211;1  ). UV/vis/near&#8208;IR and electron spin resonance spectroscopies revealed that these drastic changes were attributable to the dynamic dissociation and association of a &#960;&#8208;dimer structure for  1  &#8226;+  accompanying with the solid&#8211;liquid phase transitions even under the neat conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Conformational plasticity of cyclic Ras&#8208;inhibitor peptides defines cell permeabilization activity.</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclorasins 9A5 and 9A54 are 11&#8208;mer cyclic peptides that inhibit the Ras&#8211;Raf protein interaction. The peptides share a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;like motif; however, only cyclorasin 9A5 can permeabilize cells to exhibit strong cell&#8208;based activity. To unveil the structural origin underlying their distinct cellular permeabilization activities, we compared the three&#8208;dimensional structures of cyclorasins 9A5 and 9A54 in water and in the less polar solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by solution NMR. We found that cyclorasin 9A5 changes its extended conformation in water to a compact amphipathic structure with converged aromatic residues surrounded by Arg residues in DMSO, which might contribute to its cell permeabilization activity. However, cyclorasin 9A54 cannot adopt this amphipathic structure, due to the steric hindrance between two neighboring bulky amino&#8208;acid sidechains, Tle&#8208;2 and dVal&#8208;3. We also found that the bulkiness of the sidechains at positions 2 and 3 negatively affects the cell permeabilization activities, indicating that the conformational plasticity that allows the peptides to form the amphipathic structure is important for their cell permeabilization activities.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Industrial hydrogen production based on methane steam reforming (MSR) remains challenges in intensive carbon emissions, retarded hydrogen generation due to coke deposition over catalysts, and huge consumption of water. We herein report an electrochemical splitting of methane (ESM) in molten salts at 500 &#176;C to produce hydrogen in an energy saving, emission&#8208;free and water&#8208;free manner. Following the most energy&#8208;saving route on methane&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion, methane is electrochemically oxidized at anode to generate carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The generated anodic carbon dioxide is in situ captured by the melts and reduced to solid carbon at cathode, enabling a spatial separation of anodic hydrogen generation from cathodic carbon deposition.

By structure transformation of a pyridine&#8208;coordinated [A&#8208;&#945;&#8208;PMo9O34]9&#8722;  , a new &#947;&#8208;Keggin&#8208;type divacant lacunary polyoxomolybdate [&#947;&#8208;PMo10O36]7&#8722;  was obtained, which can be further used as a precursor for synthesizing a POM&#8211;organic hybrid.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A macromolecular drug for cancer therapy via extracellular calcification</title>
      <dc:description>Cancer chemotherapy typically relies on drug endocytosis and inhibits tumor cell proliferation via intracellular pathways; however, severe side effects may arise. In this study, we performed a first attempt to develop macromolecular&#8208;induced extracellular chemotherapy involving biomineralization by absorbing calcium from the blood through a new type of drug, polysialic acid conjugated with folate (folate&#8208;polySia), which selectively induces biogenic mineral formation on tumor cells and results in the pathological calcification of tumors. The macromolecule&#8208;initiated extracellular calcification causes cancer cell death mainly by intervening with the glycolysis process in cancer cells. Systemic administration of folate&#8208;polySia inhibited cervical and breast tumor growth and dramatically improved survival rates in mice. This study provides an extracellular therapeutic approach for malignant tumor diseases via calcification that is ready for clinical trials and offers new insights into macromolecular anticancer drug discovery.</dc:description>

      <title>Characterization and Mechanistic Study of the Radical SAM Enzyme ArsS Involved in Arsenosugar Biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Arsenosugars are a group of arsenic&#8208;containing      ribosides  that are found predominantly in marine algae but also in terrestrial organisms. It has long been proposed that arsenosugar biosynthesis involves a key intermediate 5'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;5'&#8208;dimethylarsinoyl&#8208;adenosine (DDMAA), but how DDMAA is produced remains largely elusive. In this study, we report characterization of ArsS as a DDMAA synthase, which catalyzes a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM)&#8208;mediated alkylation (adenosylation) of dimethylarsenite (DMAs  III  ) to produce DDMAA. We show this radical&#8208;mediated reaction is redox neutral, and multiple turnover can be achieved without external reductant. Subsequent phylogenomic and biochemical analyses revealed that DDMAA synthases are widespread in distinct bacterial phyla with similar catalytic efficiencies, and these enzymes likely have originated from cyanobacteria. This study not only reveals a key step in arsenosugar biosynthesis but also a new paradigm in radical SAM chemistry, highlighting the remarkable catalytic diversity of this superfamily of enzymes.</dc:description>

      <title>Capturing Manganese Oxide Intermediates in Electrochemical Water Oxidation at Neutral pH by In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
Direct capture of an intermediate species on the surface of manganese oxide nanoparticles was achieved in electrochemical water oxidation and visualized using in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy. A Raman band position at 760&#8197;cm&#8722;1 combined with isotope&#8208;labeling experiments using H218O and D2O confirmed the generation of the surface terminal MnIV=O species, which is the water oxidation intermediate for the oxygen evolution reaction.

Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is a promising means to produce eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen fuels. Inspired by the Mn4CaO5 cluster in nature, substantial works have been performed to develop efficient manganese (Mn)&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts. Despite improvements in catalytic activity, the underlying mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is not completely elucidated owing to the lack of direct spectroscopic evidence for the active Mn&#8208;oxo moieties. We identify water oxidation intermediates on the surface of Mn3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) in the OER at neutral pH by in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy. A potential&#8208;dependent Raman peak was detected at 760&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and assigned to the active MnIV=O species generated during water oxidation. Isotope&#8208;labeling experiments combined with scavenger experiments confirmed the generation of surface terminal MnIV=O intermediates in the Mn&#8208;oxide NPs. This study provides an insight into the design of systems for the observation of reaction intermediates.

      <title>Enantioselective Addition of &#945;&#8208;Nitroesters to Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>
An enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed addition of &#945;&#8208;nitroesters to alkynes affords access to &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid precursors containing contiguous stereocenters. These motifs can be further transformed into &#945;&#8208;amino esters without stereoablation.







Abstract
By using Rh&#8211;H catalysis, we couple &#945;&#8208;nitroesters and alkynes to prepare &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid precursors. This atom&#8208;economical strategy generates two contiguous stereocenters, with high enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol. In this transformation, the alkyne undergoes isomerization to generate a RhIII&#8211;&#960;&#8208;allyl electrophile, which is trapped by an &#945;&#8208;nitroester nucleophile. A subsequent reduction with In powder transforms the allylic &#945;&#8208;nitroesters to the corresponding &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino esters.

      <title>Strain Engineering of MXene/CNT Hierarchical Porous Hollow Microsphere Electrocatalyst for High&#8208;efficiency Lithium Polysulfides Conversion Process</title>
      <dc:description>
A tensile&#8208;strained MXene/CNT porous microsphere was developed by Xin Wang, Zhongwei Chen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202011493) as electrocatalyst for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. A unique O&#8211;Ti&#8211;C interface was constructed on the MXene surface through a spray&#8208;drying process and heat treatment to produce internal stress, inducing lattice distortion and enlargement of the Ti&#8722;Ti bond.

      <title>Seven&#8208;step Synthesis of All&#8208;nitrogenated Sugar Derivatives Using Sequential Overman Rearrangements</title>
      <dc:description>
All&#8208;nitrogenated sugars (ANSs), in which all hydroxy groups in a carbohydrate are replaced with amino groups, are anticipated to be privileged structures with useful biological activities. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202015141), Takaaki Sato, Noritaka Chida et&#8197;al. report synthesis, transformation, and biological tests of ANS derivatives. The key to success is a seven&#8208;step synthesis of ANSs by the sequential Overman rearrangement enabling formal simultaneous substitution of four or five hydroxy groups in monosaccharides with amino groups.
