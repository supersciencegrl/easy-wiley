         <title>CO2&#8208;assisted Controllable Synthesis of PdNi Nanoalloys for Highly Selective Hydrogenation of Biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;bishydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran (BHMTHF), a vital fuel precursor and solvent, is crucial for biomass refining. Herein, we report highly selective and stable PdNi nanoalloy catalysts for this deep hydrogenation process. A CO2&#8208;assisted green method was developed for the controllable synthesis of various bimetallic and monometallic catalysts. The PdNi/SBA&#8208;15 catalysts with various Pd/Ni ratios exhibited a volcano&#8208;like trend between BHMTHF yield and Pd/Ni ratio. Among all catalysts tested, Pd2Ni1/SBA&#8208;15 achieved the best performance, converting 99.0% of HMF to BHMTHF with 96.0% selectivity, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Additionally, the Pd2Ni1/SBA&#8208;15 catalyst maintained excellent stability even after five recycling runs. Catalyst characterizations (e.g., HAADF&#8208;STEM) and DFT calculations confirmed the successful formation of the alloy structure with electron transfer between Ni and Pd, which accounts for the remarkable performance and stability of the catalyst. This work paves the way for developing highly selective and stable alloy catalysts for biomass valorization.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Control over Social and Narcissistic Self&#8208;Sorting from Multicomponent Mixtures in Seed&#8208;Initiated Supramolecular Polymerization by Fine&#8208;Tuning of Steric Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers offer an intriguing possibility to transfer molecular properties from the nano&#8208; to the mesoscale. Towards this achievement, seed&#8208;initiated supramolecular polymerization has emerged as a powerful tool, as it prevents unlimited growth and enables size control of the assembly outcome. However, the potential application of the seeding method in the context of complex supramolecular systems is hitherto unclear. Herein we demonstrate that minute differences in molecular design in direct proximity to intermolecular recognition sites govern the molecular packing and in turn dictate the efficacy of seeded polymerization processes. We introduce a stepwise increase in steric demand in the central amino acid residue of a diamide system, which gradually increases the rotational displacement within the aggregated state. This fine&#8208;tuning of the molecular packing directly affects the propensity of the different aggregates to act as seeds for the other supramolecular synthons. In turn this allows us to selectively target specific trapped monomer states in binary mixtures for social or narcissistic seeded polymerization.</dc:description>

         <title>CO Oxidation Catalyzed by Perovskites: The Role of Crystallographic Distortions Highlighted by Systematic Experiments and Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The identification of key materials&#8217; parameters correlated with the performance can accelerate the development of heterogeneous catalysts and unveil the relevant underlying physical processes. However, the analysis of correlations is often hindered by inconsistent data. Besides, nontrivial, yet unknown relationships may be important, and the intricacy of the various processes may be significant. Here, we tackle these challenges for the CO oxidation catalyzed by perovskites using a combination of rigorous experiments and artificial intelligence. A series of 13 ABO3 (A = La, Pr, Nd, Sm; B = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co) perovskites was synthesized, characterized, and tested in catalysis. To the resulting dataset, we applied the symbolic&#8208;regression SISSO approach. We identified an analytical expression correlated with the activity that contains the normalized unit&#8208;cell volume, the Pauling electronegativity of the elements A and B, and the ionization energy of the element B. Therefore, the activity is described by crystallographic distortions and by the chemical nature of A and B elements. The generalizability of the identified descriptor is confirmed by the good quality of the predictions for 3 additional ABO3 and of 16 chemically more complex AMn(1&#8208;x)B&#8217;xO3 (A = La, Pr, Nd; B&#8217; = Fe, Co Ni Cu, Zn) perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>Fuel&#8208;driven&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugated Superstructures to Form Transient Conductive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite advances in creating dissipative materials with transient properties, such as hydrogels and active droplets, their application remains confined to temporal changes in structural properties. Developing out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium materials whose electronic functions are parameterized by a chemical reaction cycle is challenging. Yet, this class of materials is required to construct biomimetic materials. In contrast to traditional chemical reaction cycles that exploit molecularly dissolved building blocks at thermodynamic equilibrium, we show that fiber structures derived from reactive naphthalene diimide (NDI) building blocks can be used as resting states to form far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium conductive hydrogels after the addition of chemical fuels. Upon fueling the NDI&#8208;derived fibers, a dual&#8208;component activation and deactivation pathway is deduced by kinetic analysis and is absent when using a molecularly dissolved resting state. Investigating the solid&#8208;state morphologies of the structures formed throughout the fuel&#8208;driven reaction cycle using cryo&#8208;EM reveals that the resting thermodynamic fibers evolve to transient thicker fibrils and layered superstructures. We show that the transient redox&#8208;active hydrogels exhibit a nearly threefold increase in electrical conductivity upon fuel consumption before reverting to their original value over hours. These far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium materials are potential candidates in applications such as programmable biorobotics and chemical computing.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of MoO 3 &#160;by Surface Oxidation of Mo 2 C (MXene) for Stable Near&#8208;Surface Reactions in Aqueous Aluminum&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) is a promising positive electrode material for aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity. However, MoO3&#160;faces several challenges in an aqueous electrolyte, such as easy dissolution of reaction products, volume expansion, and low conductivity, which severely limit its application in aqueous batteries. In this work, we effectively increased the overall conductivity of the electrode by in&#8208;situ growing MoO3&#160;on the Mo2C MXene layer. MXene can effectively inhibit the dissolution and structural loss of MoO3&#160;reaction products. Additionally, the coordination effect of Mo2C and MoO3&#160;achieves a stable near&#8208;surface reaction on the MXene laminates, resulting in the Mo2C/MoO3&#160;composite exhibiting excellent aluminum storage properties (123.5 mAh/g after 200 cycles at 0.4 A/g). The energy storage mechanism of H+/Al3+&#160;co&#8208;insertion/extraction was elucidated through non&#8208;in&#8208;situ characterization, and the promotion effect of Mo2C on MoO3&#160;reaction kinetics was verified by density functional theory calculations. This work provides new insights into improving the stability of AAIB cathodes and extends the application of Mo&#8208;based MXene in aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>A Proteomics Pipeline for Generating Clinical Grade Biomarker Candidates from Data&#8208;Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry (DIA&#8208;MS) Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clinical biomarker development has been stymied by inaccurate protein quantification from mass spectrometry (MS) discovery data and a prolonged validation process. To mitigate these issues, we created the Targeted Extraction Assessment of Quantification (TEAQ) software package that uses data&#8208;independent acquisition analysis from a discovery cohort to select precursors, peptides, and proteins that adhere to analytical criteria required for established targeted assays. TEAQ was applied to DIA&#8208;MS data from plasma samples acquired on a new high resolution accurate mass (HRAM) mass spectrometry platform where precursors were evaluated for linearity, specificity, repeatability, reproducibility, and intra&#8208;protein correlation based on 8&#8208; or 11&#8208;point loading curves at three throughputs. This data can be used as a general resource for developing other targeted assays. TEAQ analysis of data from a case and control cohort for inflammatory bowel disease (n=492) identified 1110 signature peptides for 326 quantifiable proteins from the 1179 identified proteins. Applying TEAQ analysis to discovery data will streamline targeted assay development and the transition to validation and clinical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>De(sulfon)amidative Cyclization: The Synthesis of Dibenzolactams and Dibenzosultams for Organic Light Emitting Diode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study addresses a challenge in organic synthetic chemistry: the direct cleavage of amide bonds, which is typically hampered by the thermodynamic stability of the C(Ar)&#8211;C(acyl) bond. Previous methods often rely on &#8220;CO&#8221; extrusion&#8208;jointing transition metal&#8208;catalyzed process and require activated tertiary amides, limiting their applicability due to incompatibility with reactive functional groups such as halogens. Herein, we report a transition metal&#8208;free approach for the deamidative cyclization of biaryl diamides via a radical process, yielding dibenzolactam derivatives. Along this line, we have developed the desulfonamidative cyclization of biaryl disulfonamides to produce dibenzosultams through direct nucleophilic aromatic substitution, demonstrating high selectivity for unsymmetrical structures. Additionally, unsymmetrical sulfamoyl biaryl amides, containing both amide and sulfonamide functionalities, can selectively undergo desulfonamidative coupling with the amide to form dibenzolactams, which offers a complementary synthetic pathway to unsymmetric dibenzolactams. These protocols exhibit excellent compatibility with reactive functional groups, including halogens, providing an innovative synthetic toolbox for the development of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials used in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). DMAC&#8208;PDO, incorporating a dibenzolactam as the acceptor unit, serves as an efficient blue TADF emitter with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 23.4%.</dc:description>

         <title>High Configuration Entropy Promises Electrochemical Stability of Chloride Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy, Long&#8208;Life All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity, stability, and interface compatibility are indispensable for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;life all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), yet there are scarce SSEs with sufficient ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, with a high&#8208;entropy SSE (HE&#8208;SSE, Li2.9In0.75Zr0.1Sc0.05Er0.05Y0.05Cl6), we show the high configuration entropy has a thermodynamically positive relationship with the high&#8208;voltage stability. As a result, the ASSBs with HE&#8208;SSE and high&#8208;voltage cathode materials exhibit superior high&#8208;voltage and long&#8208;cycle stability, achieving 250 cycles with 81.4% capacity retention when charged to 4.8 V (vs. Li+/Li), and even 5000 cycles if charged to 4.6 V (vs. Li+/Li).&#160;&#160;Experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations confirm that the HE&#8208;SSE greatly suppresses the high&#8208;voltage degradation of SSE at the interface, promoting the high&#8208;voltage stability coordinately through high entropy and interface stability. The high entropy design offers a general strategy to simultaneously improve the high&#8208;voltage stability and ionic conductivity of SSEs, creating an avenue to building high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;life ASSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Monocyclic Luminophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compact luminophores with long emission wavelengths have aroused considerable theoretical and practical interest. Organics with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are also desirable for their longer lifetimes and larger Stokes shifts than fluorescence. Utilizing the low electronic transition energy intrinsic to thiocarbonyl compounds, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were attached to the 4H&#8208;pyran&#8208;4&#8208;thione core to further lower the excited state energies. The resulting mini&#8208;phosphors were doped into suitable polymer matrices. These purely organic, amorphous materials emitted near&#8208;infrared (NIR) RTP. Having a molar mass of only 162 g&#183;mol&#8208;1, one of the phosphors emitted RTP that peaked at 750 nm, with a very large Stokes shift of 15485 cm&#8208;1 (403 nm). Thanks to the good processability of the polymer film, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with NIR emission were easily fabricated by coating doped polymer on ultraviolet LEDs. This work provides an intriguing strategy to achieve NIR RTP using compact luminophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structure Determination by 3D Electron Diffraction of the Extra&#8208;large Pore Zeolite ITQ&#8208;70</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we present the synthesis, characterization, and structural analysis of a novel zeolite, ITQ&#8208;70, using 3D electron diffraction tomography. This unique material was synthesized under alkaline conditions, employing tetrakis(diethylamino)phosphonium as organic structure&#8208;directing agent, leading to the formation of a pure silica zeolite. ITQ&#8208;70 is distinguished by its extra&#8208;large pore apertures, which extend along all three axes and intersect one to each other. A notable feature of this zeolite is the presence of structurally ordered defects in very high concentration (38% of the silicon atoms). As a result, ITQ&#8208;70 exhibits the lowest framework density (10.0 T/1000&#197;3) ever reported for any zeolite except RWY (7.6 T/1000&#197;3), which contains sulfur instead of oxygen connecting T&#8208;atoms.</dc:description>

We report the synthesis and properties of four &#960;&#8208;extended, fused fluorene derivatives with high diradical character, taking advantage of a molecular design where the closed&#8208;shell does not include any Clar sextet, comparatively to a maximum of 5 in the corresponding open&#8208;shell state. This led to an unusual open&#8208;shell triplet ground state with an outstanding singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST) of ca. 19&#8197;kcal/mol, one of the highest values reported to date for an all&#8208;carbon conjugated scaffold.







Abstract
The synthesis of diradical organic compounds has garnered significant attention due to their thermally accessible spin inversion and optoelectronic properties. Yet, preparing such stable structures with high open&#8208;shell behavior remains challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of four &#960;&#8208;extended, fused fluorene derivatives with high diradical character, taking advantage of a molecular design where the closed&#8208;shell does not include any Clar sextet, comparatively to a maximum of 5 in the corresponding open&#8208;shell state. This led to an unusual open&#8208;shell triplet ground state with an outstanding singlet&#8208;triplet energy difference (&#916;EST) of ca. 19&#8197;kcal/mol, one of the highest values reported to date for an all&#8208;carbon conjugated scaffold. Incorporation of dithiafulvene units at each end of the molecule (at the five&#8208;membered rings) furnishes extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) undergoing reversible oxidations to the radical cation and diradical dication. The various pro&#8208;aromatic structures presented herein show highly localized spin density and a limited conjugation due to the confined &#960;&#8208;electrons in the aromatic cycles, as supported by 1H NMR, UV/Visible, EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations.

         <title>Highly Efficient Red/Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescence from Doped Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping the thionation products of phthalimide into its matrix leads to highly efficient red/near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence with boosted quantum yields of up to ~33&#8201;%. Newly generated emissive clusters and the external heavy atom effect are two key factors to the red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence, while the high efficiency arises from the enhanced exciton generation efficiency and energy transfer process upon doping.







Abstract
Organic red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with low toxicity and facile synthesis are highly sought after, particularly for applications in biotechnology and encryption.

&lt;p&gt;Doping the thionation products of phthalimide into its matrix leads to highly efficient red/near-infrared room temperature phosphorescence with boosted quantum yields of up to ~33&#8201;%. Newly generated emissive clusters and the external heavy atom effect are two key factors to the red-shifted photoluminescence, while the high efficiency arises from the enhanced exciton generation efficiency and energy transfer process upon doping.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic red/near-infrared (NIR) room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with low toxicity and facile synthesis are highly sought after, particularly for applications in biotechnology and encryption. However, achieving efficient red/NIR RTP emitters has been challenging due to the weak spin-orbit coupling of organics and the rapid nonradiative decay imposed by the energy gap law. Here we demonstrate highly efficient red/NIR RTP with boosted quantum yields (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Asymmetrified Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Solid Additives Enable All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 19&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Two electron&#8208;deficient isomers, 4,5&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;1) and 5,6&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;2), were designed as solid additives to optimize the properties of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;DT blend. Compared to the as&#8208;cast device, SF&#8208;1&#8208; and SF&#8208;2&#8208;treated devices displayed regulated fibrillar donor&#8208;acceptor network, improved exciton diffusion length, and thus enhanced power conversion efficiencies approaching 19&#8201;%, which is one of rare solid additives for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;polymer organic solar cells.







Abstract
Disordered polymer chain entanglements within all&#8208;polymer blends limit the formation of optimal donor&#8208;acceptor phase separation. Therefore, developing effective methods to regulate morphology evolution is crucial for achieving optimal morphological features in all&#8208;polymer organic solar cells (APSCs). In this study, two isomers, 4,5&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;1) and 5,6&#8208;difluorobenzo&#8208;c&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;thiadiazole (SF&#8208;2), were designed as solid additives based on the widely&#8208;used electron&#8208;deficient benzothiadiazole unit in nonfullerene acceptors. The incorporation of SF&#8208;1 or SF&#8208;2 into PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;DT blend induces stronger molecular packing via molecular interaction, leading to the formation of continuous interpenetrated networks with suitable phase&#8208;separation and vertical distribution. Furthermore, after treatment with SF&#8208;1 and SF&#8208;2, the exciton diffusion lengths for PY&#8208;DT films are extended to over 40&#8197;nm, favoring exciton diffusion and charge transport. The asymmetrical SF&#8208;2, characterized by an enhanced dipole moment, increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PM6&#8201;:&#8201;PY&#8208;DT&#8208;based device to 18.83&#8201;% due to stronger electrostatic interactions. Moreover, a ternary device strategy boosts the PCE of SF&#8208;2&#8208;treated APSC to over 19&#8201;%. This work not only demonstrates one of the best performances of APSCs but also offers an effective approach to manipulate the morphology of all&#8208;polymer blends using rational&#8208;designed solid additives.

         <title>Gas Tunnel Engineering of Prolyl Hydroxylase Reprograms Hypoxia Signaling in Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gas tunnel of PHD2, an iron&#8208;based O2 sensing enzyme, is engineered using a computation&#8208;guided rational design approach. The engineered mutants exhibit an increased rate of gas transport to the active site, along with increased catalytic activity in vitro. These mutants also display enhanced intracellular activity demonstrating the ability to reprogram hypoxia signaling by activating PHD2.







Abstract
Cells have evolved intricate mechanisms for recognizing and responding to changes in oxygen (O2) concentrations. Here, we have reprogrammed cellular hypoxia (low O2) signaling via gas tunnel engineering of prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), a non&#8208;heme iron dependent O2 sensor. Using computational modeling and protein engineering techniques, we identify a gas tunnel and critical residues therein that limit the flow of O2 to PHD2&#8217;s catalytic core. We show that systematic modification of these residues can open the constriction topology of PHD2&#8217;s gas tunnel. Using kinetic stopped&#8208;flow measurements with NO as a surrogate diatomic gas, we demonstrate up to 3.5&#8208;fold enhancement in its association rate to the iron center of tunnel&#8208;engineered mutants. Our most effectively designed mutant displays 9&#8208;fold enhanced catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM=830&#177;40&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) in hydroxylating a peptide mimic of hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF&#8208;1&#945;, as compared to WT PHD2 (kcat/KM=90&#177;9&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Furthermore, transfection of plasmids that express designed PHD2 mutants in HEK&#8208;293T mammalian cells reveal significant reduction of HIF&#8208;1&#945; and downstream hypoxia response transcripts under hypoxic conditions of 1&#8201;% O2. Overall, these studies highlight activation of PHD2 as a new pathway to reprogram hypoxia responses and HIF signaling in cells.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design of Bicyclic Helical Peptides That Target the Oncogene &#946;&#8208;Catenin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicyclic peptide is reported that combines two hydrocarbon staples with i,i+4 and i,i+3 spacing, respectively. In the resulting i,i+4,i+7 crosslink topology, a central spiro center connects two macrocycles that are formed during ring&#8208;closing metathesis. After affinity maturation, we obtain a high&#8208;affinity binder of the oncogenic protein &#946;&#8208;catenin which inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway in a cell&#8208;based assay.







Abstract
The inhibition of intracellular protein&#8208;protein interactions is challenging, in particular, when involved interfaces lack pronounced cavities. The transcriptional co&#8208;activator protein and oncogene &#946;&#8208;catenin is a prime example of such a challenging target. Despite extensive targeting efforts, available high&#8208;affinity binders comprise only large molecular weight inhibitors. This hampers the further development of therapeutically useful compounds. Herein, we report the design of a considerably smaller peptidomimetic scaffold derived from the &#945;&#8208;helical &#946;&#8208;catenin&#8208;binding motif of Axin. Sequence maturation and bicyclization provided a stitched peptide with an unprecedented crosslink architecture. The binding mode and site were confirmed by a crystal structure. Further derivatization yielded a &#946;&#8208;catenin inhibitor with single&#8208;digit micromolar activity in a cell&#8208;based assay. This study sheds light on how to design helix mimetics with reduced molecular weight thereby improving their biological activity.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Protocol to Access Silacyclobutanes with Unprecedented Functional Group Tolerance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive protocol was developed for the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes, which are well&#8208;known lynchpin intermediates in organosilicon synthesis. Unlike conventional methods, our protocol elegantly avoids the use of moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive Grignard or lithium reagents, offering a markedly more step&#8208;efficient and functionally tolerant approach. was developed.







Abstract
While significant progress has been made in the area of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening and formal cycloaddition reactions of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes (SCBs), synthesizing these SCBs&#8212;particularly those bearing additional functional groups&#8212;continues to present synthetic challenges. In this context, we present a novel Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive coupling reaction that combines 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;substituted silacyclobutanes with aryl or vinyl halides and pseudohalides, thereby obviating the need for organometallic reagents. This method facilitates the generation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted silacyclobutanes with a remarkable tolerance for various functional groups. This approach serves as a complementary and more step&#8208;economical alternative to the commonly used yet moisture&#8208; and air&#8208;sensitive nucleophilic substitution reactions involving Grignard or lithium reagents.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, a Ni-catalyzed reductive protocol was developed for the synthesis of 1,1-disubstituted silacyclobutanes, which are well-known lynchpin intermediates in organosilicon synthesis. Unlike conventional methods, our protocol elegantly avoids the use of moisture- and air-sensitive Grignard or lithium reagents, offering a markedly more step-efficient and functionally tolerant approach. was developed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While significant progress has been made in the area of transition metal-catalyzed ring-opening and formal cycloaddition reactions of 1,1-disubstituted silacyclobutanes (SCBs), synthesizing these SCBs&#8212;particularly those bearing additional functional groups&#8212;continues to present synthetic challenges. In this context, we present a novel Ni-catalyzed reductive coupling reaction that combines 1-chloro-substituted silacyclobutanes with aryl or vinyl halides and pseudohalides, thereby obviating the need for organometallic reagents. This method facilitates the generation of 1,1-disubstituted silacyclobutanes with a remarkable tolerance for various functional groups. This approach serves as a complementary and more step-economical alternative to the commonly used yet moisture- and air-sensitive nucleophilic substitution reactions involving Grignard or lithium reagents. Our initial mechanistic studies indicate that this reaction is initiated by oxidative cleavage of the Si&#8722;Cl bond in 1-chlorosilacyclobutanes, which represents a distinct mechanism from the previously documented reductive coupling processes involving carbon electrophiles and chlorosilanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tracking Minority Species in Redox Reactions: A Quantitative Combined XAS and Modulation Excitation Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports on the use of modulation excitation through periodic switches of electrical potential coupled with X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy to probe the redox reaction of Fe(II) and Fe(III) species in a volume containing only 30 pmol of Fe.







Abstract
Understanding the nature of intermediates/active species in reactions is a major challenge in chemistry. This is because spectator species typically dominate the experimentally derived data and consequently active phase contributions are masked. Transient methods offer a means to bypass this difficulty. In particular, modulation excitation with phase&#8208;sensitive detection (ME&#8208;PSD) provides a mechanism to distinguish between spectator and reacting species. Herein, modulation excitation (ME) time&#8208;resolved (energy dispersive) X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, assisted by phase sensitive detection (PSD) analysis, has been applied to the study of a liquid phase process; in this case the classic ferrocyanide/ferricyanide redox couple. Periodic switches of the electrical potential (anodic/cathodic) enabled the use of the ME approach. Structural changes at fractions as low as 2&#8201;% of the total number of electroactive species were detected within the X&#8208;ray beam probe volume containing ~30&#8197;pmol of Fe(II)/Fe(III).

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Peterson&#8208;Type Olefination Reactivity and its Use in a Silicon&#8208;Promoted Carbonyl&#8208;Carbonyl Cross Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between the Si=C double bond of a silene and the C=O bond of a variety of carbonyl compounds produces four&#8208;membered silaoxetane heterocycles. These intermediates can be characterized, and engage in alkene&#8208;forming retro&#8208;cycloaddition reactions by the addition of SiO2. Moreover, the silene olefination reagent can be formed in&#8197;situ, giving rise to a new one&#8208;pot silicon&#8208;based reductive carbonyl&#8208;carbonyl cross coupling methodology.







Abstract
The [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between the Si=C double bond of adamantylsilene and the carbonyl group of aliphatic, aromatic or acetylenic ketones and aldehydes is demonstrated. The product of this reaction that is central to a non&#8208;ionic version of the Peterson olefination is an unusual four&#8208;membered 1,2&#8208;silaoxetane heterocycle that was characterized spectroscopically and crystallographically. In the presence of SiO2, the silaoxetane undergoes retro&#8208;cycloaddition with the formation of alkene products. As the [2+2] cycloaddition proceeds without the necessity of any base, enolizable ketones can be converted into olefins. In addition, it is shown that the adamantylsilene can be produced in&#8197;situ by a sila&#8208;Peterson reaction, providing valuable input for the development of a new one&#8208;pot silicon&#8208;based reductive carbonyl&#8208;carbonyl cross coupling methodology.

         <title>Recognition and order of multiple sidechains by metal&#8211;organic framework enhances the separation of hexane isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordering of multiple sidechains on a metal&#8211;organic framework is achieved by the assembly of linkers that differ only in the appended functional groups at a chiral centre. The strain induced by the functional groups defines the conformation of each linker and drives their ordering in the crystal structure of the framework. The pore environments formed by this assembly have well&#8208;defined adsorption sites for hexane isomers and enhance their separation.







Abstract
Porous materials perform molecular sorting, separation and transformation by interaction between their framework structures and the substrates. Proteins also interact with molecules to effect chemical transformations, but rely on the precise sequence of the amino acid building units along a common polypeptide backbone to maximise their performance. Design strategies that positionally order sidechains over a defined porous framework to diversify the internal surface chemistry would enhance control of substrate processing. Here we show that different sidechains can be ordered over a metal&#8211;organic framework through recognition of their distinct chemistries during synthesis. The sidechains are recognised because each one forces the common building unit that defines the backbone of the framework into a different conformation in order to form the extended structure. The resulting sidechain ordering affords hexane isomer separation performance superior to that of the same framework decorated only with sidechains of a single kind. The separated molecules adopt distinct arrangements within the resulting modified pore geometry, reflecting their strongly differentiated environments precisely created by the ordered sidechains. The development of frameworks that recognize and order multiple sidechain functionality by conformational control offers tailoring of the internal surfaces within families of porous materials to direct interactions at the molecular level.

         <title>Diphenylacetylene&#8208;Incorporating Octaphyrin: A Rigid Macrocycle with Readily Separable Conformational Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanded porphyrins with diphenylacetylene as a key building block have been prepared. Owing to the rigidity of the resulting macrocycle, conformational isomers can be isolated, unlike known, flexible expanded porphyrins. The irreversible conformational inversion, coupled with the distinct spectral and color features of the isomers, allowed us to fabricate a new accumulated thermal sensor capable of indicating exposure to high temperatures.







Abstract
An expanded carbaporphyrinoid analogue, octaphyrin(2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1), containing two rigid diphenylacetylene moieties is reported. In contrast to traditional pyrrolic macrocycles where flexible conformers coexist in dynamic equilibrium, this macrocycle exists as two separable, conformationally stable stereoisomers, denoted as 1A and 1B. The conformational effect of both conformers, as well as their protonated forms, were thoroughly studied using NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Importantly, heating conformer 1B leads to its irreversible conversion to 1A, whereas in its protonated form, 1A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MSA undergoes irreversible transformation to 1B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MSA at lower temperatures. These temperature&#8208;dependent features establish a foundation for developing new accumulated heat sensors, as demonstrated by the use of the present octaphyrins as a customized thermochromic indicator in steam sterilization. The present study thus underscores how the conformational rigidity of these new polypyrrolic macrocycles imparts properties that are distinct from historically flexible expanded porphyrinoids.

         <title>Steering the Selectivity of CORR from Acetate to Ethanol via Tailoring the Thermodynamic Activity of Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal approach was developed to tune the selectivity of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in CORR from acetate to ethanol by tailoring the thermodynamic activity of water. The faradaic efficiencies of ethanol and alcohol can reach 42.5&#8201;% and 55.1&#8201;% at 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The ability to control the selectivity of CORR opens up new possibilities for synthesizing a wider range of valuable chemical products from CO2.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon monoxide (CO) into oxygenated C2+ products at high rates and selectivity offers a promising approach for the two&#8208;step conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, a major drawback of the CO electrochemical reduction in alkaline electrolyte is the preference for the acetate pathway over the more valuable ethanol pathway. Recent research has shed light on the significant impact of thermodynamic water activity on the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction pathways, but less is understood for the electrochemical reduction of CO. In this study, we investigated how the water activity at the electrified interface can be enhanced to adjust the selectivity between acetate and ethanol. We employed an ionomer modifier to lower the local concentration of alkali ions (via Donnan exclusion), successfully enhancing ethanol production while suppressing acetate formation. We observed a remarkable improvement in the Faradaic efficiency of ethanol and alcohol (i.&#8201;e. ethanol, propanol etc), which reached 42.5&#8201;% and 55.1&#8201;%, respectively, at a current density of 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The partial current densities of ethanol and alcohol reached 698 and 942&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, we achieved a 3.7&#8208;fold increase in the ethanol/acetate ratio, providing clear evidence of our successful modulation of product selectivity.

     alt="Steering the Selectivity of CORR from Acetate to Ethanol via Tailoring the Thermodynamic Activity of Water"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A universal approach was developed to tune the selectivity of Cu-based catalysts in CORR from acetate to ethanol by tailoring the thermodynamic activity of water. The faradaic efficiencies of ethanol and alcohol can reach 42.5&#8201;% and 55.1&#8201;% at 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The ability to control the selectivity of CORR opens up new possibilities for synthesizing a wider range of valuable chemical products from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical conversion of carbon monoxide (CO) into oxygenated C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products at high rates and selectivity offers a promising approach for the two-step conversion of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). However, a major drawback of the CO electrochemical reduction in alkaline electrolyte is the preference for the acetate pathway over the more valuable ethanol pathway. Recent research has shed light on the significant impact of thermodynamic water activity on the electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction pathways, but less is understood for the electrochemical reduction of CO. In this study, we investigated how the water activity at the electrified interface can be enhanced to adjust the selectivity between acetate and ethanol. We employed an ionomer modifier to lower the local concentration of alkali ions (via Donnan exclusion), successfully enhancing ethanol production while suppressing acetate formation. We observed a remarkable improvement in the Faradaic efficiency of ethanol and alcohol (i.&#8201;e. ethanol, propanol etc), which reached 42.5&#8201;% and 55.1&#8201;%, respectively, at a current density of 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The partial current densities of ethanol and alcohol reached 698 and 942&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, we achieved a 3.7-fold increase in the ethanol/acetate ratio, providing clear evidence of our successful modulation of product selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon Clusteroluminescence Enabled by Through&#8208;Space Conjugation for In Vivo Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;Photon clusteroluminescence (with emission wavelength up to 688&#8197;nm) was achieved in small clusteroluminogens (CLgens) with only two isolated heteroatomic units through the efficient and n&#8208;electron&#8208;involved through&#8208;space conjugation, which promotes the in vivo bioimaging of CLgens with excellent biocompatibility.







Abstract
Clusteroluminescence (CL) materials without largely conjugated structures have gained significant attention due to their unique photophysical properties and potential in bioimaging. However, low luminescence efficiency and short emission wavelength limit their development. This work designs three luminogens with CL properties (CLgens) by introducing n&#8208;electron&#8208;involved through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC) into diarylmethane. Apart from single&#8208;photon excited long&#8208;wavelength (686&#8197;nm) and high&#8208;efficiency (29&#8201;%) CL, two&#8208;photon clusteroluminescence (TPCL) is successfully achieved in such small luminogens with only two isolated heteroatomic units. TSC stabilized in the aggregate state has been proven to realize efficient spatial electron delocalization similar to conventionally conjugated compounds. Encouraged by the excellent TPCL properties, two&#8208;photon imaging of blood vessels in vivo and biocompatibility verification utilizing CLgens are also achieved. This work illustrates the essential role of TSC in promoting nonlinear optical properties of CLgens and may facilitate further design and development of the next generation of bioprobes with excellent biocompatibility.

         <title>Individually Tunable Energy Levels of Oligomers Based on N&#8722;B&#8592;N Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monodisperse oligomers based on electron&#8208;accepting double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) unit with individually tunable energy levels were developed. This unique energy level tuning is attributed to the separation of LUMO and HOMO at the atomic scale of the BNBP unit and the different contributions of charge transfer transitions in the excited states.







Abstract
Opto&#8208;electronic properties and device performance of organic semiconductors are mainly determined by energy levels of their frontier molecular orbitals, e.g. lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) in the ground state, first singlet state (ES1) and first triplet state (ET1) in the excited state. These energy levels are always intricately intertwined. Herein, we report a series of monodisperse oligomers based on double B&#8592;N bridged bipyridine (BNBP) units. With the increasing number of repeating units, the oligomers exhibit gradually downshifted ELUMO and nearly unchanged EHOMO due to the different distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of the oligomers. Moreover, the oligomers exhibit gradually decreasing ES1 and nearly unchanged ET1 because of the different contributions of the charge transfer component in the excited state. This work provides new insight into energy level tuning of organic semiconductors, which is important for high&#8208;performance organic opto&#8208;electronic devices.

         <title>Iridium(III) Photosensitizers Induce Simultaneous Pyroptosis and Ferroptosis for Multi&#8208;Network Synergistic Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first case of metal&#8208;based small molecule dual&#8208;inducers of pyroptosis and ferroptosis is reported here. The iridium(III)&#8208;triphenylamine photosensitizers, IrC and IrF, can induce DNA damage&#8208;related gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, along with regulating iron stress&#8208;related gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis and glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) depletion synergistically promoted ferroptosis, and further trigger a strong immune response.







Abstract
The integration of pyroptosis and ferroptosis hybrid cell death induction to augment immune activation represents a promising avenue for anti&#8208;tumor treatment, but there is a lack of research. Herein, we developed two iridium (III)&#8208;triphenylamine photosensitizers, IrC and IrF, with the capacity to disrupt redox balance and induce photo&#8208;driven cascade damage to DNA and Kelch&#8208;like ECH&#8208;associated protein&#8197;1 (KEAP1). The activation of the absent in melanoma&#8197;2 (AIM2)&#8208;related cytoplasmic nucleic acid&#8208;sensing pathway, triggered by damaged DNA, leads to the induction of gasdermin D (GSDMD)&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Simultaneously, iron homeostasis, regulated by the KEAP1/nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;related factor&#8197;2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase&#8197;1 (HO&#8208;1) pathway, serves as a pivotal bridge, facilitating not only the induction of gasdermin&#8197;E (GSDME)&#8208;mediated non&#8208;canonical pyroptosis, but also ferroptosis in synergy with glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4 (GPX4) depletion. The collaborative action of pyroptosis and ferroptosis generates a synergistic effect that elicits immunogenic cell death, stimulates a robust immune response and effectively inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Our work introduces the first metal&#8208;based small molecule dual&#8208;inducers of pyroptosis and ferroptosis for potent cancer immunotherapy, and highlights the significance of iron homeostasis as a vital hub connecting synergistic effects of pyroptosis and ferroptosis.

         <title>Highly Diffusive Nonluminescent Carriers in Hybrid Phase Lead Triiodide Perovskite Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated carriers can be captured by phase transition induced defects (PTIDs) formed by hybrid&#8208;phase within the same MAPbI3 single crystal and then be &#8220;protected&#8221; form radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombinations. The mobility of PTID&#8208;dressed nonluminescent carriers is successfully promoted by about 14&#8208;fold to as high as 1345.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, comparing with band&#8208;edge free carriers at room temperature. What's more, facilitated by this highly diffusive nonluminescent carrier within, the MAPbI3 NWs&#8208;based photodetector's responsivity is promoted by about three times.







Abstract
Crystal structural rearrangements unavoidably introduce defects into materials, where even these small changes in local lattice structure could arouse a prominent impact on the overall nature of crystals. Contrary to the traditional notion that defects obstruct carrier transport, herein, we report a promoted transport mechanism of nonluminescent carriers in single&#8208;crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 nanowires (1345.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, about a 14&#8208;fold improvement), enabled by the phase transition induced defects (PTIDs). Carriers captured by PTIDs evade both the radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombinations during the incomplete tetragonal&#8208;to&#8208;orthorhombic phase transition at low temperatures, forming a specific nonluminescent state that exhibits an efficient long&#8208;distance transport and thereby realize a prominent enhancement of photocurrent responsivity for photodetector applications. The findings provide broader insights into the carrier transport mechanism in perovskite semiconductors and have significant implications for their rational design for photoelectronic applications at varied operating temperatures.

Carriers captured by PTIDs evade both the radiative and non-radiative recombinations during the incomplete tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition at low temperatures, forming a specific nonluminescent state that exhibits an efficient long-distance transport and thereby realize a prominent enhancement of photocurrent responsivity for photodetector applications. The findings provide broader insights into the carrier transport mechanism in perovskite semiconductors and have significant implications for their rational design for photoelectronic applications at varied operating temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Grafting Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Framework for Benchmark Selectivity of C2H2/CO2 Separation under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reticular chemistry and pore engineering have garnered significant advancements in metal&#8208;organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks, leveraging robust metal&#8208;coordination and covalent bonds. However, these achievements remain elusive in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks, hindered by their inherent weakness in hydrogen bonding. Herein, we strategically manipulate the porosity of hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks through a grafting approach, culminating in the synthesis of two isomorphic HOFs, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;99 and HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, with distinct pore environments. Remarkably, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100, with its microporous architecture, not only showcases exceptional stability but also achieves unparalleled separation efficiency and ultrahigh selectivity for C2H2/CO2 mixtures (50/50, v/v) under ambient conditions. Its IAST selectivity value of 201 stands as a benchmark, towering over all previously reported HOFs. The pore of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;100 boasts an electrostatic potential highly favourable for C2H2 adsorption, as evidenced by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealing multiple hydrogen bonding interactions between C2H2 molecules and the framework. In situ gas&#8208;carrier powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis underscores the adaptability of pore structure, dynamically adjusting its orientation in response to C2H2, thereby enabling a highly efficient and specific separation of C2H2/CO2 mixtures through specific adsorptive interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Monomer Synthesis and Framework Assembly: Achieving Isoreticular Modulation of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematic construction of isoreticular hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) promises tailored material properties crucial for diverse applications, yet is challenging due to the weak, flexible, and non&#8208;directional nature of hydrogen bonds. Herein, we develop an &#8220;integrated monomer synthesis&#8208;framework assembly&#8221; (ISA) methodology for constructing a series of isoreticular HOFs. Unlike traditional methods where monomers are first synthesized and then assembled into HOFs, the ISA system employs dicyandiamide rigid hydrogen&#8208;bonded hexameric clusters as connecting nodes to covalently react with planarized C3&#8208;symmetric cyano&#8208;precursors (C3&#8208;CPs) to generate diaminotriazine (DAT) monomers, while simultaneously inducing the directional assembly into isoreticular (6,3)&#8208;net hcb topological DAT&#8208;C6&#8208;HOFs. The pore sizes and microenvironments of the resulting DAT&#8208;C6&#8208;HOFs can be precisely tuned by varying the structural modulation (length and steric hindrance) of the &#960;&#8208;bridge on C3&#8208;CPs, enabling highly selective sensing towards perfluorooctanoic acid over other homologous molecules, that are difficult to be separated and detected by chromatography. Overall, the ISA methodology facilitates the scalable creation of families of isostructural HOFs and provides a customized structural platform for investigating factors beyond topology that impact the capturing, releasing, and responding to guest molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Formamidinium Incorporates into Rb&#8208;based Non&#8208;perovskite Phases in Solar Cell Formulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials, such as formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), are among the most promising emerging photovoltaic materials. However, the spontaneous phase transition from the photoactive perovskite phase to an inactive non&#8208;perovskite phase complicates the application of FAPbI3&#160;in solar cells. To remedy this, alkali metal cations, most often Cs+, Rb+or K+, are included during perovskite synthesis to stabilize the photoactive phase. The atomic&#8208;level mechanisms of stabilization are complex. While Cs+&#160;dopes directly into the perovskite lattice, Rb+&#160;does not, but instead forms an additional non&#8208;perovskite phase, and the mechanism by which Rb confers increased stability remains unclear. Here, we use&#160;1H&#8211;87Rb double resonance NMR experiments to show that FA+&#160;incorporates into the Rb&#8208;based non&#8208;perovskite phases (FAyRb1&#8208;yPb2Br5&#160;and&#160;&#948;&#8208;FAyRb1&#8208;yPbI3) for both bromide and iodide perovskite formulations. This is demonstrated by changes in the&#160;1H and&#160;87Rb chemical shifts,&#160;1H&#8211;87Rb heteronuclear correlation spectra, and&#160;87Rb{1H} REDOR spectra. Simulation of the REDOR dephasing curves suggests up to ~60% FA+&#160;incorporation into the inorganic Rb&#8208;based phase for the bromide system. In light of these results, we hypothesize that the substitution of FA+&#160;into the non&#8208;perovskite phase may contribute to the greater stability conferred by Rb salts in the synthesis of FA&#8208;based perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Hydrogen Acceptor&#8211;Donor Enables Relay Mechanism for Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction is a crucial process for sustainable ammonia production. However, to maximize ammonia yield efficiency, this technology inevitably operates at the potentials more negative than 0 V vs. RHE, leading to high energy consumption and competitive hydrogen evolution.&#160;To eradicate this issue, hydrogen tungsten bronze (HxWO3) as reversible hydrogen donor&#8208;acceptor is partnered with copper (Cu) to enable a relay mechanism at potentials positive than 0 V vs. RHE, which involves rapid intercalation of H into HxWO3 lattice, prompt de&#8208;intercalation of the lattice H and transfer onto Cu, and spontaneous H&#8208;mediated nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion on Cu.&#160;The resulting catalysts demonstrated a high ammonia yield rate of 3332.9&#177;34.1 mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a Faraday efficiency of ~100 % at 0.10 V vs. RHE, displaying a record&#8208;low estimated energy consumption of 17.6 kWh kgammonia&#8722;1. Using these catalysts, we achieve continuous ammonia production in an enlarged flow cell at a real energy consumption of 17.0 kWh kgammonia&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic Multi&#8208;Site Chelation for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis base 2D covalent organic frameworks, TFT&#8208;COF and TT&#8208;COF are applied to mitigate energetic mismatches and introduce effective n&#8208;type surface energetics and band bending via cyclic, multi&#8208;site chelation with undercoordinated lead ions. Such a multi&#8208;site chelation effect enables a high efficiency of 25.64&#8201;% (certified 24.94&#8201;%) and excellent stability in the inverted perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination losses and moisture&#8208;induced degradation significantly impede the development of highly efficient and stable inverted (p&#8211;i&#8211;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which require high&#8208;quality perovskite bulk. In this research, we mitigate these challenges by integrating thermally stable perovskite layers with Lewis base covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The ordered pore structure and surface binding groups of COFs facilitate cyclic, multi&#8208;site chelation with undercoordinated lead ions, enhancing the perovskite quality across both its bulk and grain boundaries. This process not only reduces defects but also promotes improved energy alignment through n&#8208;type doping at the surface. The inclusion of COF dopants in p&#8211;i&#8211;n devices achieves power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.64&#8201;% (certified 24.94&#8201;%) for a 0.0748&#8208;cm2 device and 23.49&#8201;% for a 1&#8208;cm2 device. Remarkably, these devices retain 81&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 978&#8197;hours of accelerated aging at 85&#176;C, demonstrating remarkable durability. Additionally, COF&#8208;doped devices demonstrate excellent stability under illumination and in moist conditions, even without encapsulation.

         <title>[5]Helicene Based &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Macrocycles with Persistent Figure&#8208;Eight and M&#246;bius Shapes: Efficient Synthesis, Chiral Resolution and Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated chiral shape&#8208;persistent molecular nanocarbons hold great potential as chiroptical materials, though their synthesis remains a considerable challenge. Here, we present a simple approach using Suzuki coupling of a [5]helicene building block with various aromatic units, enabling the one&#8208;pot synthesis of a series of chiral macrocycles with persistent figure&#8208;eight and M&#246;bius shapes. Single&#8208;crystal structures of 7 compounds were solved, and 22 enantiomers were separated by preparative chiral HPLC. A notable pyrene&#8208;bridged figure&#8208;eight macrocycle, with its rigid, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated and overcrowded structure, exhibited pure excimer emission and outstanding circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, including a large dissymmetric factor (|glum| = 3.8 &#215; 10&#8722;2) and significant CPL brightness (BCPL = 710.5 M&#8208;1cm&#8208;1). This method provides a versatile synthetic platform for producing various chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight macrocycles and singly or triply twisted M&#246;bius macrocycles with C2 and D3 symmetry, offering tunable chiroptical properties for CPL applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Dearomative [1,5]&#8208;Sigmatropic Carbon Shift of Heterole&#8208;Fused Norcaradienes Enabled Concise Helicenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the locked fluxionality of norcaradienes fused by benzene, unexplored less aromatic heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes, creatively generated by intramolecular hydroarylation of heteroaryl alkynylcyclopropanes, reserve a balancing fluxionality that permits a dearomative 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic carbon shift of norcaradienes akin to the reduced aromaticity of heterole. This &#8220;walk&#8221; shift was confirmed by the isolation of a cycloheptatriene species derived from ring&#8208;expansion of a dearomatized alkynylated heterole&#8208;fused norcaradiene. A following ester&#8208;directed ring&#8208;opening rearomatization of these dearomatized heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes gives the products featuring migratory acylmethyls that are competent for helicenation with the neighboring (hetero)arenes via (formal) dehydrative alkenylation. Such balancing reactivity of heterole&#8208;fused norcaradienes will open up the opportunity for the development of controllable reactions of fused norcaradienes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of molecular host&#8208;guest complexes with enhanced performance, relative to those of their components, is a central theme in supramolecular chemistry. Here we explore a host&#8208;guest system consisting of an atomically precise gold nanocluster bound inside a zinc porphyrin nanoring. UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence titrations with different sized nanorings revealed strong binding between a pyridinethiol&#8208;coated Au25 nanocluster and a nanoring consisting of six zinc porphyrin units, and complexation is confirmed by mass spectrometry. Formation of this assembly enhances the stability of the gold nanocluster. The host&#8208;guest complex also exhibits remarkable activity and selectivity for photochemical CO2 to CO conversion and singlet oxygen generation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Fatal Mushroom Neurotoxin Muscarine is Released from a Harmless Phosphorylated Precursor upon Cellular Injury</title>

         <dc:description>l&#8208;(+)&#8208;Muscarine (1)&#8208;producing mushrooms pose a severe threat to human health as ingestion can result in circulatory collapse or even death. However, their metabolic profile is surprisingly poorly understood, including knowledge of poison release and potentially toxic congeners. In the mycelium of the 1&#8208;producing fool&#8217;s funnel mushroom Clitocybe rivulosa, we identified 4&#8217;&#8208;phosphomuscarine (2) as the major natural product. Its structure was elucidated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and by comparison with a synthesized reference. We also detected this previously overlooked phosphorylated compound in the fiber cap mushrooms Pseudosperma spectrale and Inocybe nitidiuscula. Studies on the activation of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 indicate only weak affinity of 2 to this target. Furthermore, we present biological evidence that muscaridine (3), a quaternary amine congener related to and co&#8208;occurring with 1, does not activate the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 on human embryonic kidney cells. Our work provides important insight into the metabolic profile and the pharmacology of some of the most poisonous mushrooms. As the harmless 2 can liberate the potentially fatal 1 by unspecific enzymatic ester cleavage, these results are highly relevant for emergency medicine to estimate the true toxicity of these mushrooms.</dc:description>

         <title>Triflic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrative Amination of 2&#8208;Arylethanols with Weak N&#8208;Nucleophiles in Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic deoxyamination of readily available 2&#8208;arylethanols offers an appealing, simple, and straightforward means of accessing &#946;&#8208;(hetero)arylethylamines of biological interest. Yet, it currently represents a great challenge to synthetic chemistry. In most cases, the alcohol has to be either pre&#8208;activated in situ or converted into a reactive carbonyl intermediate, limiting the substrate scope for some methods. Examples of direct dehydrative amination of 2&#8208;arylethanols are still scarce. Here, we describe a catalytic protocol based on the synergy of triflic acid and hexafluoroisopropanol, which enables the direct and stereospecific amination of a broad array of 2&#8208;arylethanols, and does not require any pre&#8208;activation of the alcohol. This approach yields high value&#8208;added products incorporating sulfonamide, amide, urea, and aniline functionalities. In addition, this approach was applied to the sulfidation of 2&#8208;arylethanols. Mechanistic experiments and DFT computations indicate the formation of phenonium ions as key intermediates in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Electrocatalysis for the Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Heteroarylation of Indoles, Pyrroles, and Furans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative cross&#8208;dehydrogenative C&#8208;H/C&#8208;H functionalizations represent an exemplary approach for synthesizing carbonyl compounds via &#945;&#8208;heteroarylation. Here we present the development of a direct anodic oxidative coupling process between 2&#8208;acylimidazoles and divergent heterocyclic systems including indole, pyrrole, and furan, facilitated by ferrocene&#8208;assisted asymmetric nickel electrocatalysis with high levels of enantioselectivity. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the reaction initially involves the formation of a chiral Ni&#8208;bound &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical, which is then captured by the heteroarene radical cation via intermolecular stereoselective radical/radical cation coupling. The mild, scalable, and robust reaction conditions allow for a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance, enabling access to a wide range of chiral hetero&#8208;compounds. The consequential &#945;&#8208;heteroaromatic carbonyl products can potentially be transformed into a plethora of synthetically valuable frameworks, as exemplified by their application in the asymmetric total synthesis of (&#8208;)&#8208;COX&#8208;2 inhibitor, (+)&#8208;acremoauxin A, and (+)&#8208;pemedolac.</dc:description>

This study focuses on understanding how DNA polymerases recognize and incorporate nucleotides with diverse chemical modifications, aiming to develop advanced nucleotide probes. We present the crystal structures of ternary complexes of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (KlenTaq) with C5&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;modified environment&#8208;sensitive 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (dUTP) probes. These nucleotides include SedUTP, BFdUTP and FBFdUTP, which bear selenophene, benzofuran and fluorobenzofuran, respectively, at the C5 position of uracil, and exhibit high conformational sensitivity. SedUTP and FBFdUTP serve as dual&#8208;app probes, combining a fluorophore with X&#8208;ray anomalous scattering Se or 19F NMR labels. Our study reveals that the size of the heterocycle influences how DNA polymerase families A and B incorporate these modified nucleotides during single nucleotide incorporation and primer extension reactions. Remarkably, FBFdUTP's responsiveness enabled real&#8208;time monitoring of the binary complex formation and polymerase activity through fluorescence and 19F NMR. Comparative analysis of incorporation profiles, fluorescence, 19F NMR data, and crystal structures of ternary complexes highlights the enzyme's plasticity. Key insights are provided into the role of gatekeeper amino acids (Arg660 and Arg587) in accommodating and processing these modified substrates, offering a structural basis for next&#8208;generation nucleotide probe development.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrrolizwilline, a unique bacterial alkaloid assembled by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase and non&#8208;enzymatic dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a structurally diverse group of heterocyclic specialized metabolites characterized by a core structure comprising a hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolizine. PAs are synthesized through two main pathways. In plants, assembly occurs via a homospermidine synthase, and in bacteria, through combined action of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase and a Baeyer&#8208;Villiger monooxygenase. While the toxic properties of plant&#8208;derived PAs and their prevalence in animal and human foods have been extensively studied, the biological roles and biosynthesis of more complex bacterial PAs are not well understood. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a bacterial biosynthetic gene cluster from&#160;Xenorhabdus hominickii,&#160;xhpA&#8208;G, which is responsible for producing the PA pseudo&#8208;dimer pyrrolizwilline. Analysis of&#160;X. hominickii&#160;promoter exchange mutants together with heterologous expression of&#160;xhpA&#8208;G&#160;in&#160;E. coli, revealed a set of pathway intermediates, two of which were chemically synthesized, as well as multiple derivatives. This information was leveraged to propose a detailed biosynthetic pathway to pyrrolizwilline. Furthermore, we have characterized the hydrolase XhpG, the key enzyme in the conversion of the pathway intermediate pyrrolizixenamide to pyrrolizwilline, using X&#8208;ray crystallography and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS).</dc:description>

         <title>Second Generation Zwitterionic Aza&#8208;Diarylethene: Photoreversible CN Bond Formation, Three&#8208;State Photoswitching, Thermal Energy Release, and Facile Photoinitiation of Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diarylethenes are a well&#8208;studied and optimized class of photoswitches with a wide range of applications, including data storage, smart materials, or photocontrolled catalysis and biological processes. Most recently, aza&#8208;diarylethenes have been developed in which carbon&#8208;carbon bond connections are replaced by carbon&#8208;nitrogen connections. This structural elaboration opens an entire new structure and property space expanding versatility and applicability of diarylethenes. In this work, we present the second generation of zwitterionic aza&#8208;diarylethenes, which finally allows for fully reversible photoswitching and precise control over all three switching states. High&#8208;yielding photoswitching between the neutral open form and a zwitterionic&#160;Z&#160;isomer is achieved with two different wavelengths of light. The third zwitterionic&#160;E&#160;isomeric state can be reached up to 87% upon irradiation with a third wavelength. Its high energy content of &gt;10 kcal/mol can be released thermally by deliberate solvent change as trigger mechanism, rendering aza&#8208;diarylethenes into interesting candidates for molecular solar thermal energy&#160;storage (MOST) applications. The third state further serves as locking state, allowing to toggle light&#8208;responsiveness reversibly between thermally labile and thermally stable switching. Further, irradiation of the zwitterionic states leads to highly efficient photopolymerization of methyl acrylate (MA),&#160;directly harnessing the unleashed chemical reactivity of aza&#8208;diarylethene in materials applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of slide&#8208;ring polymers based on pillar[5]arene/alkyl chain host&#8722;guest interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Slide&#8208;ring polymers exhibit distinctive mechanical properties, making them highly promising for applications in emerging fields such as energy storage devices and smart sensing. However, existing slide&#8208;ring polymer systems primarily rely on hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic interactions to achieve ring&#8208;axle interlocking in aqueous phases. This reliance limits the construction of slide&#8208;ring networks mainly to water&#8208;soluble polymers, excluding a diverse range of lipophilic polymers. Therefore, it is crucial to introduce efficient construction strategies that facilitate interpenetration in organic solvents, enabling the development of diverse slide&#8208;ring polymers and expanding their range and applications. Herein, by utilizing the pillar[5]arene/alkyl chain host&#8722;guest interactions, we successfully facilitated the interpenetration of a pillar[5]arene and poly(caprolactone), enabling the efficient construction of two slide&#8208;ring polymer networks in organic solvents. One of these two slide&#8208;ring polymers demonstrates a unique network deformation mechanism along with outstanding mechanical properties compared with the control covalently cross&#8208;linked polymer network, including maximum stress (4.43 vs 1.98 MPa), maximum strain (1285 vs 330%), and toughness (35.4 vs 3.92 MJ/m3). More importantly, this strategy of making slide&#8208;ring polymers is highly versatile, given the wide range of macrocyclic arenes and alkyl chain&#8208;containing polymers it can accommodate.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Modulation of Efficient Macrocyclic Emitters Featuring Delayed Fluorescence by Conjugation Length and Cavity Dimensions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocyclic emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics have attracted widespread attention in the field of organic electroluminescence (EL) materials due to their unique geometries and excellent luminescence performance. Despite the significant impact of conjugation length and cavity dimensions on molecular conformation, the influence of these factors on the excited&#8208;state properties remains understudied. Herein, we formulated a strategy aimed at modulating the conformation of TADF macrocyclic molecules containing aniline as the donor (D) unit, and triazine as the acceptor (A), linked in D&#8208;A and D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A alternative macrocyclic construction (MC&#8208;TNT and MC&#8208;TST). Corroborated by experimental and theoretical analyses, the compact and conformationally twisted MC&#8208;TNT exhibits efficient blue luminescence in crystalline state, facilitating EL at high doping concentrations with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 13.9%, leading the field of blue macrocyclic emitters. Notably, MC&#8208;TST with &#960;&#8208;bridge and flat conformation, demonstrates diminished Coulombic repulsion, achieving nearly 100% photoluminescence quantum yield and superior horizontal dipole orientation of 85% in 5 wt% doped &#64257;lms, and the corresponding device's EQEmax reaches record&#8208;high 32.7% within the TADF macrocyclic domain.</dc:description>

Herein we report the first photoredox&#8208;catalyzed radical&#8208;type [3+2] annulation of aromatic amides with olefins. We established an approach to generate unprecedented iminium radicals by reducing the oxyiminium intermediates, formed in situ from corresponding amides with Tf2O, via photoredox catalysis. The [3+2] annulation was achieved via stepwise radical process, instead of forming linear products via other pathways as previously reported. This annulation protocol exhibits excellent functional group tolerance, and a diversity of substrates are united under the photoredox conditions, affording iminium products that can be in situ diversified into 1&#8208;indanones, enamines and amines. Mechanistic investigations indicate reduction of the oxyiminium intermediate to the iminium radicals by excited&#8208;state of the photocatalyst initiates the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Valuable para&#8208;Benzoquinone from Aqueous Phenol on NiRu Hybrid Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxidation of aqueous phenol to para&#8208;benzoquinone (p&#8208;BQ) offers a sustainable approach for both pollutant abatement and value&#8208;added chemicals production. However, achieving high phenol conversion and p&#8208;BQ yield under neutral conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported Ru nanoparticles (NiRu) hybrid electrocatalyst, which exhibits a superior phenol conversion of 96.5% and an excellent p&#8208;BQ yield of 83.4% at pH 7.0, significantly outperforming previously reported electrocatalysts. This exceptional performance benefits from the triple synergistic modulation of the NiRu catalyst, including enhanced phenol adsorption, increased p&#8208;BQ desorption, and suppressed oxygen evolution. By coupling a flow electrolyzer with an extraction&#8208;distillation separation unit, the simultaneous phenol removal and p&#8208;BQ recovery are realized. Additionally, the developed electrocatalytic system with the NiRu/C anode displays good stability, favorable energy consumption, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions for phenol&#8208;containing wastewater treatment, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. This work offers a promising strategy for achieving low&#8208;carbon emissions in phenol wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Orientational Compatibility Modulation of Ligands in Low&#8208;Symmetry Multi&#8208;Cavity Discrete Coordination Cages by Neighbouring Cage Participation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complexation of Pd(II) with a designer unsymmetrical bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (2:4 ratio) yielded a specific Pd2L4 type &#8220;single&#8208;cavity discrete coordination cage&#8221; (SCDCC), from a pool of 4 isomeric structures. The observed selctivity is attributed to inherent orientational preference of the ligand strands around the metal centers. Crafting a short coordinating arm at either ends of the bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (i.e the longer&#8208;arm) produced a pair of unsymmetrical isomeric tris&#8208;monodentate ligands; whereas crafting the same short&#8208;arm at both ends of the ligand gives an unsymmetrical tetrakis&#8208;monodentate ligand. Complexation of Pd(II) with either of the isomeric tris&#8208;monodenate ligands (3:4 ratio) resulted in corresponding low&#8208;symmetry &#8220;multi&#8208;cavity discrete coordination cage&#8221; MCDCC having two conjoined cavities, though the inherent relative orientational preference of the longer arms is not achievable in these cages. The enforced orientation is sustained by &#8220;Neighbouring Cage Participation&#8221; (NCP). However, one&#8208;pot combination of Pd(II), with a mixture of isomeric tris&#8208;monodenate ligands in 3:2:2 ratio produced an integratively self&#8208;sorted mixed&#8208;ligated MCDCC from a pool of 31 structures. Also, mixing Pd(II) with the tetrakis&#8208;monodentate ligand produced a MCDCC having three conjoined cavities. The inherent orientational preference of longer&#8208;arm of the ligand strands is retained in the mixed&#8208;ligated double&#8208;cavity and the homo&#8208;ligated triple cavity cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Synchronous Modulation of H&#8208;bond Interaction and Steric Hindrance via Bio&#8208;molecular Additive Screening in Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In addressing challenges such as side reaction and dendrite formation, electrolyte modification with bio&#8208;molecule sugar species has emerged as a promising avenue for Zn anode stabilization. Nevertheless, considering the structural variability of sugar, a comprehensive screening strategy is meaningful yet remains elusive. Herein, we report the usage of sugar additives as a representative of bio&#8208;molecules to develop a screening descriptor based on the modulation of the hydrogen bond component and electron transfer kinetics. It is found that xylo&#8208;oligosaccharide (Xos) with the highest H&#8208;bond acceptor ratio enables efficient water binding, affording stable Zn/electrolyte interphase to alleviate hydrogen evolution. Meanwhile, sluggish reduction originated from the steric hindrance of Xos contributes to optimized Zn deposition. With such a selected additive in hand, the Zn||ZnVO full cells demonstrate durable operation. This study is anticipated to provide a rational guidance in sugar additive selection for aqueous Zn batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation and Deactivation of Chirality Transfer in the Superbundles of Sequence&#8208;defined Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discrete oligomers can be used to precisely evaluate the structure&#8208;property relationship and enable unique chiroptical activities, however, the role of stereochemical sequences in chirality transfer is still unclear. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a series of sequence&#8208;defined chiral azobenzene (Azo) oligomers via iterative stepwise chain growth strategy, and the discovery of controllable activation and deactivation of chirality transfer. Sequence&#8208;defined stereoisomers with one single chiral (L or D) stereocenter at the &#945;&#8208;position, &#969;&#8208;position and middle&#8208; (m&#8208;) position have completely different self&#8208;assembly dynamics and chirality transfer mechanisms. &#969;&#8208;positional stereocenter can effectively command all Azo building blocks to adopt a tilted &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking along the helical superbundles, exhibiting the activation of chirality transfer. However, discrete oligomers with the stereocenter at other positions can only self&#8208;assemble into non&#8208;helical nanowires, accompanied by the deactivation of chirality transfer. Kinetic experiments as well as chemical simulations indicate that the cooperative supramolecular interaction, including the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between repeated Azo units, the intermolecular hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance, are intrinsic driving forces for these differentiations. This study has shed light on the unique self&#8208;assembled kinetics in stereosequential oligomers and the mechanism of chirality induction at hierarchical levels.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Renal&#8208;clearable engineered nanoparticles are being explored for their potential to deliver therapeutic agents for kidney disease treatment. A fundamental understanding of how these nanoparticles accumulate in diseased kidneys at the cellular level is essential to enhance their effectiveness and minimize side effects on adjacent healthy tissues. Herein, we report that the accumulation of glutathione&#8208;coated, near&#8208;infrared emitting gold nanoparticles (GS&#8208;AuNPs) correlates strongly with the necrotic stages of injured proximal tubular cells. Using a rhabdomyolysis&#8208;induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mouse model, we observed that GS&#8208;AuNPs were significantly accumulated in the extracellular lumen of proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) at advanced necrotic stage, where cellular debris and released intracellular contents impeded their clearance. In contrast, during early necrosis, GS&#8208;AuNPs were still cleared through the open lumen. Additionally, intracellular uptake of GS&#8208;AuNPs was significantly reduced across all necrotic stages. These findings underscore the need for new strategies to design nanoparticles that can effectively target and be taken up by the diseased tubular cells before extensive necrosis occurs; so that nanoparticle&#8208;mediated drug delivery for kidney disease treatment can be achieved with desired efficacy and precision.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxenoid reactivity enabled by targeted photoactivation of periodate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of low&#8208;valent intermediates continues to inspire new modes of reactivity across synthetic chemistry. But while the generation and reactivity of both carbenes and nitrenes are well&#8208;established, difficulties in accessing oxene, their oxygen&#8208;based congener, has severely hampered its application in synthesis. Here, we report a conceptually novel approach to oxene generation through the violet&#8208;light photolysis of tetrabutylammonium periodate. By revealing an unexpected geometric change upon periodate photoexcitation that facilitates intersystem crossing, we have exploited the near&#8208;barrierless dissociation of triplet periodate into oxene. Under these operationally simple conditions, we have demonstrated the epoxidation of a wide range of substituted olefins, revealing unprecedented functional group compatibility. By overcoming the historic challenges associated with employing oxene as an intermediate in organic chemistry, we believe that this platform will inspire the development of new reactive oxygen&#8208;based methodologies across industry and academia.</dc:description>

By revealing an unexpected geometric change upon periodate photoexcitation that facilitates intersystem crossing, we have exploited the near-barrierless dissociation of triplet periodate into oxene. Under these operationally simple conditions, we have demonstrated the epoxidation of a wide range of substituted olefins, revealing unprecedented functional group compatibility. By overcoming the historic challenges associated with employing oxene as an intermediate in organic chemistry, we believe that this platform will inspire the development of new reactive oxygen-based methodologies across industry and academia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Ion Co&#8208;insertion Induced Spontaneous and Reversible Phase Conversion Chemistry for Unprecedented Zn2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogues are highly promising electrode materials due to their versatile electrochemical activity and low cost. However, they often suffer from severe structural damage caused by the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and dissolution of high&#8208;spin outer metal ions, resulting in poor cycle life. Material modification and electrolyte regulation have been the common approaches to address this issue, albeit with very limited success. We report here a novel and efficient strategy to preserve structural stability by co&#8208;inserting Co2+ and Zn2+ ions in KCo[Fe(CN)6]. This co&#8208;insertion induced a spontaneous and reversible phase conversion by the replacement of low&#8208;spin inner ion (Fe3+), which efficiently relieves structural damage caused by Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and metal&#8208;ion dissolution, leading to an outstanding Zn2+ storage capacity and an exceptional improvement of cycle life with a capacity retention of 97.7% over 4400 cycles at 40 C. We also demonstrated the enhancement of co&#8208;intercalation on ion migration using a combined approach of experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides an important progress to solve the cycle stability of Prussian blue analogues towards their practical application as electrode materials for aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Structurally Compact Penta(N,N&#8208;diphenylamino)corannulene as Dopant&#8208;free Hole Transport Materials for Stable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hole transport materials (HTMs) are essential for improving the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, we have designed and synthesized a novel organic small molecule HTM, cor&#8208;(DPA)5, characterized by a bowl&#8208;shaped core with symmetric five diphenylamine groups. Compared to already&#8208;known HTMs, the bowl&#8208;shaped and relatively compact structure of cor&#8208;(DPA)5 facilitates intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, promotes film formations, and enhances charge transport. Consequently, the cor&#8208;[DPA(2)]5 HTM exhibits high charge mobility, exceptional hydrophobicity, and a significantly elevated glass transition temperature. Superior to previously reported HTMs such as spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and cor&#8208;OMePTPA, our newly synthesized cor&#8208;(DPA)5 HTM is free from any ionic dopants. As a result, the dopant&#8208;free cor&#8208;[DPA(2)]5&#8208;based PSC demonstrates an impressive efficiency of 24.01%, and exhibits outstanding operational stability. It retains 96% after continuous exposure to 1 sun irradiation for 800 hours under MPP (maximum power point) tracking in ambient air. These findings present a structurally compact novel HTM and exemplify a new approach to the molecular design of HTM for the development of stable and effective PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Allylic Nitriles via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Cyanation of Biaryl Diallylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axially chiral nitriles are common motifs in organic photoelectric materials, biological compounds, and agrochemicals. Unfortunately, the limited synthetic approaches to axially chiral nitriles have impeded their availability. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric allylic cyanation of biaryl allylic alcohols for the synthesis of axially chiral nitrile structures in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90% yield and &gt;99% ee). This process enables the synthesis of a diverse range of axially chiral allylic nitriles bearing &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated alcohol moieties. Leveraging the allylic alcohol and cyano groups as versatile functionalization handles allow for further derivatization of these axially chiral frameworks. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that both steric and electronic interactions play crucial roles in determining the enantioselectivity of this transformation. Moreover, this mild and facile protocol is also applicable for gram&#8208;scale preparation of the chiral nitriles.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Access to&#160;Phosphorus Ylide&#8208;fused Heteroarenes Possessing Tunable Optoelectronic Properties and High Nonlinear Optical Performances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a novel family of ylidic P&#8208;heteroarenes (P1&#8208;P6), structurally featuring unique phosphonium cyclopentadienylide (P&#8208;Cp)&#8208;fused &#960;&#8208;skeletons and synthetically prepared via an unexpected one&#8208;pot [2+3]/[3+3] phospha&#8208;annulation reaction. While the facile and modular synthesis allows the fine&#8208;tuning of their optical absorptions and redox properties, single&#8208;crystallographic and theoretical analysis of these P&#8208;heteroarenes further reveal that the fusion of P&#8208;Cp&#160;moiety leads to substantial intramolecular charge&#8208;separated features with high ylidic character values of up to 84%. Benefitted from such dipolar structures, these P&#8208;heteroarenes not only allows stepwise electrophilic substitution reaction for further structural &#960;&#8208;expansions, but also exhibit excellent nonlinear optical (NLO) responses and optical limiting (OL) performances comparable to or exceed those of C60. As a model compound, the persistent radical&#8208;anion salt of P5a was also prepared through chemical reduction, thus offering valuable insights into the electronic structures of reduced P&#8208;ylidic species. Our work not only established a highly efficient synthetic method toward new P&#8208;heteroarenes, but also provide fundamental understanding of those fused&#8208;ring ylidic P&#8208;heterocycles with promising NLO/OL applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Matrix&#8208;Mediated Cation Exchange of Perovskite Quantum Dots for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cesium&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite quantum dot (CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD) is very promising for photovoltaic applications due to its good phase stability and outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, achieving the CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs with tunable compositions and robust surface matrix remains a challenge. Here, the surface matrix&#8208;mediated cation exchange of PQDs is proposed, in which a bi&#8208;functional molecule, tetrafluoroborate methylammonium (FABF4), is applied for the cation exchange and stabilizing surface matrix of PQDs. The results reveal that the FA+ of FABF4 molecules could exchange the Cs+ of CsPbI3 PQDs forming alloy CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs, allowing to tune the spectroscopies of PQDs. Meanwhile, the BF4&#8208; of FABF4 molecules can effectively stabilize the surface lattice and substantially diminish the surface vacancies of PQDs, improving the phase stability and optoelectronic properties of PQDs. Consequently, CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD solar cells deliver an efficiency of up to 17.49%, which is the highest value of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD solar cells. This work provided important design principles for the composition and surface matrix regulation of PQDs for high&#8208;performance solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep Neutral Network Enhanced Mesoscopic Thermodynamic Model for Unlocking the Electrode/Electrolyte Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structure and properties of the electrode/electrolyte interface significantly influence the electrochemical processes of energy storage and conversion, yet the challenge lies in accurate description of both molecular characteristics and external field effects. Here, we develop a mesoscopic thermodynamic model that calculates the thermodynamic properties of electrolytes based on chemical potential, and its efficiency is enhanced by a deep neutral network. The deep neutral network enhanced mesoscopic thermodynamic (DeepMT) model effectively bridges the gap between micro&#8208;level characteristics of ions and macro&#8208;level effects of external field, enabling precise presentation of ion density distributions over complex conditions. Our result indicates that the DeepMT model not only demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement of approximately four orders of magnitude over direct theoretical calculations, but also accurately predicts interface properties including ion adsorption, surface charge, and differential capacitance through the statistical analysis of density distributions.</dc:description>

         <title>Microfluidic Precision Manufacture of High Performance Liquid Chromatographic Microspheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A key bottleneck in developing chromatographic material is the chemically entangled control of morphology, pore structure, and material chemistry, which holds back precision material manufacture in order to pursue advanced separation performance. In this work, a precision manufacture strategy based on droplet microfluidics was developed,&#160;for production of highly efficient chromatographic microspheres with independent control&#160;over&#160;particle morphology, pore structure&#160;and material chemistry.&#160;The droplet&#8208;synthesized microspheres display extremely narrow particle size distribution (CV&lt;3%), enabling a 100% production yield due to complete elimination of sieving steps. More importantly, the size of the droplet&#8208;synthesized microspheres is freely adjustable without the need for re&#8208;optimizing chemical recipes or reaction conditions. The resulting materials exhibit excellent separation efficiencies, achieving a reduced plate height of hmin&#8203;=1.67. This precision manufacture strategy also allows for flexible pore design and continuous pore size adjustment across three orders of magnitudes, providing a novel vehicle for resolution fine&#8208;tuning targeting protein separation. Besides traditional silica, organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid silica, zirconia, and titania microspheres can also be precisely synthesized on the same platform, supporting various separation applications and operating conditions. Powered by precision manufacture, super&#8208;throughput production, and versatile chemistry, the high&#8208;performance droplet&#8208;synthesized separation material will pave the way towards green and precision chromatographic industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Removal of Residual Additive Enabling Perfect Crystallization of Photovoltaic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hinges on the precise control of the perovskite film crystallization process, often improved by the inclusion of additives. While dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is traditionally used to manage this process, its removal from the films is problematic. In this work, methyl phenyl sulfoxide (MPSO) was employed instead of DMSO to slow the crystallization rate, as MPSO is more easily removed from the perovskite structure. The electron delocalization associated with the benzene ring in MPSO decreases the electron density around the oxygen atom in the sulfoxide group, thus reducing its interaction with PbI2. This strategy not only sustains the formation of a crystallization&#8208;slowing intermediate phase but also simplifies the elimination of the additive. Consequently, the optimized PSCs achieved a leading power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.95% along with exceptional stability. This strategy provides a novel method for fine&#8208;tuning perovskite crystallization to enhance the overall performance of photovoltaic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Reactive Oxygen Species Generation via Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis with FeIII&#8208;Initiated Self&#8208;cycled Fenton System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an FeIII&#8208;initiated self&#8208;cycling Fenton system (SF&#8208;CEC), where the synergistic effects of O2 activation and FeIII&#8208;activated H2O2 further enhance 1O2 generation. In this SF&#8208;CEC system, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can degrade protonated azo dyes by nearly 99&#8201;% within 10&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Contact Electro&#8208;Catalysis (CEC) using commercial dielectric materials in contact&#8208;separation cycles with water can trigger interfacial electron transfer and induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the inherent hydrophobicity of commercial dielectric materials limits the effective reaction sites, and the generated ROS inevitably undergo self&#8208;combination to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In typical CEC systems, H2O2 does not further decompose into ROS, leading to suboptimal reaction rates. Addressing the generation and activation of H2O2 is therefore crucial for advancing CEC. Here, we synthesized a catalyst by loading the dielectric material polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) onto ZSM&#8208;5 (PTFE/ZSM&#8208;5, PZ for short), achieving uniform dispersion of the catalyst in water for the first time. The introduction of an FeIII&#8208;initiated self&#8208;cycling Fenton system (SF&#8208;CEC), with the synergistic effects of O2 activation and FeIII&#8208;activated H2O2, further enhanced ROS generation. In the FeIII&#8208;initiated SF&#8208;CEC system, the synergistic effects of ROS and protonated azo dyes enabled nearly 99&#8201;% degradation of azo dyes within 10&#8197;minutes, a sixfold improvement compared to the CEC system. This represents the fastest degradation rate of methyl orange dye induced by ultrasound to date. Without extra oxidants, this system enabled stable dissolution of precious metals in weakly acidic solutions at room temperature, achieving 80&#8201;% gold dissolution within 2&#8197;hours, 2.5&#8197;times faster than similar CEC systems. This study also corrects the unfavorable perception of CEC applications under acidic conditions, providing new insights for the fields of dye degradation and precious metal recovery.

         <title>One&#8208;Stone&#8208;For&#8208;Three&#8208;Birds Strategy Using a Fullerene Modifier for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fullerene derivative (denoted as C60&#8208;TMA) is synthesized and employed to modify the interface between perovskite and C60. C60&#8208;TMA can passivate the surface defects to suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination, form a cascade energy level to facilitate electron extraction, and induce secondary growth of perovskite, contributing to a champion PCE of 24.89&#8201;% for inverted PSCs with significantly improved thermal stability.







Abstract
The electron extraction from perovskite/C60 interface plays a crucial role in influencing the photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we develop a one&#8208;stone&#8208;for&#8208;three&#8208;birds strategy via employing a novel fullerene derivative bearing triple methyl acrylate groups (denoted as C60&#8208;TMA) as a multifunctional interfacial layer to optimize electron extraction at the perovskite/C60 interface. It is found that the C60&#8208;TMA not only passivates surface defects of perovskite via coordination interactions between C=O groups and Pb2+ cations but also bridge electron transfer between perovskite and C60. Moreover, it effectively induces the secondary grain growth of the perovskite film through strong bonding effect, and this phenomenon has never been observed in prior art reports on fullerene related studies. The combination of the above three upgrades enables improved perovskite film quality with increased grain size and enhanced crystallinity. With these advantages, C60&#8208;TMA treated PSC devices exhibit a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.89&#8201;% than the control devices (23.66&#8201;%). Besides, C60&#8208;TMA benefits improved thermal stability of PSC devices, retaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1200&#8197;h, primarily due to the reinforced interfacial interactions and improved perovskite film quality.

         <title>P&#8208;doped RuSe2 on Porous N&#8208;Doped Carbon Matrix as Catalysts for Accelerated Sulfur Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalyst of phosphorus doped RuSe2 (P&#8208;RuSe2) with&#160;the enhanced conductivity and the modulation of the d&#8208;band center is engineered via a rational screening strategy, which augments its effectiveness in interacting with LiPSs and hence exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of high capacity, superior rate capability and stable cycle life.







Abstract
Monocomponent catalysts exhibit the limited catalytic conversion of polysulfides due to their intrinsic electronic structure, but their catalytic activity can be improved by introducing heteroatoms to regulate its electronic structure. However, the rational selection principles of doping elements remain unclear. Here, we are guided by theoretical calculations to select the suitable doping elements based on the balanced relationship between the adsorption strength of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalytic activity of lithium sulfide. We apply the screening method to develop a new catalyst of phosphorus doped RuSe2, manifesting the further enhanced conductivity compared with original RuSe2, facilitating charge transfer and further modulating the d&#8208;band center of RuSe2, thereby augmenting its effectiveness in interacting with LiPSs. Consequently, the assembled cell exhibits an areal capacity of 7.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, even under high sulfur loading of 8.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a lean electrolyte condition (5.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1). This rational screening strategy offers a robust solution for the design of advanced catalysts in the field of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries and potentially other domains as well.

We apply the screening method to develop a new catalyst of phosphorus doped RuSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, manifesting the further enhanced conductivity compared with original RuSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, facilitating charge transfer and further modulating the d-band center of RuSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby augmenting its effectiveness in interacting with LiPSs. Consequently, the assembled cell exhibits an areal capacity of 7.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, even under high sulfur loading of 8.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a lean electrolyte condition (5.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This rational screening strategy offers a robust solution for the design of advanced catalysts in the field of lithium-sulfur batteries and potentially other domains as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Clean One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Structurally Ordered Linear, Monocyclic, and Bicyclic Oligosiloxanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetraacetoxysilanes reacted with silanols or silanediols under base&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free conditions to selectively generate acetoxy&#8208;containing di&#8208; and trisiloxanes. Cyclotetrasiloxanes and bicyclic pentasiloxanes with precisely constructed structures were obtained from successive one&#8208;pot reactions of a tetraacetoxysilane with various silanediols. The acetoxy&#8208;containing oligosiloxanes can serve as efficient surface&#8208;treatment agents and as new building blocks for heat&#8208;resistant materials.







Abstract
A highly selective cross&#8208;coupling reaction between Si&#8722;OAc (AcO=acetoxy) and Si&#8722;OH compounds that generates unsymmetrical and symmetrical oligosiloxanes concurrent with the release of acetic acid has been developed. The high selectivity arises from the reactivity difference that depends on the varying number of acetoxy groups present, thus facilitating a clean one&#8208;pot synthesis of oligosiloxanes. For instance, the reactions of di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, or tetraacetoxysilanes with silanols furnish acetoxy&#8208;containing di&#8208; and trisiloxanes in high yield. Two equivalents of tetraacetoxysilane can react with various silanediols to form 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexaacetoxytrisiloxanes, which subsequently react with a second molecule of a silanediol to selectively afford 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetraacetoxycyclotetrasiloxanes. The cyclotetrasiloxanes further react with a third molecule of silanediol to provide unprecedented bicyclic pentasiloxanes with acetoxy groups at the bridgehead silicon atoms. Applications of the acetoxy&#8208;containing products as efficient surface&#8208;treatment agents and new building blocks for highly heat&#8208;resistant materials are demonstrated.

         <title>Precise Preparation of Supramolecular Spherical Nucleic Acids for Nucleolin&#8208;Targeted Gene Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise supramolecular nucleic acids (Supra&#8208;SNAs) were designed by incorporating a pair of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin modified with multiple nucleic acids and adamantane with functional targeting nucleic acid. These Supra&#8208;SNAs with multivalent structure exhibit enhanced nuclease resistance, cellular uptake, and gene regulation capabilities in comparison to single&#8208;stranded DNA molecule. Moreover, the inhibition of gene expression in tumor cells leads to down&#8208;regulate PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and thus effective cell proliferation and death against tumor cells.







Abstract
Molecular spherical nucleic acids (m&#8208;SNAs) are a second generation of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), which are of significance in potential application of targeted delivery of nucleic acids or gene regulation due to their defined molecular structures. Nevertheless, m&#8208;SNAs typically involve a single DNA sequence which greatly limits its functions as either targeting purpose or gene regulation. In response, we proposed here a third generation, supramolecular spherical nucleic acids (Supra&#8208;SNAs) with two different sequences to achieve both above&#8208;mentioned functions. Specifically, we constructed a series of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly structures by coupling a cell membrane receptor (i.e., nucleolin)&#8208;recognizing aptamer (AS1411)&#8208;modified adamantine as targeting probe and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antisense&#8208;functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin to specifically inhibit the overexpression of HER2 proteins for gene regulations. In comparison to the m&#8208;SNA precursors, such Supra&#8208;SNA structures exhibited enhanced levels of resistance to nuclease degradation, cellular uptake, gene regulation capabilities and tumor retention capacity. We demonstrated that Supra&#8208;SNAs exhibited optimal cell suppression rates and cell apoptosis via a phosphatidylinositol 3&#8208;kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway. The well&#8208;defined molecular structures provide an attractive platform for investigating interrelationship between structure and property at the molecular level.

         <title>An Aza&#8208;Prilezhaev&#8208;Based Method for Inversion of Regioselectivity in Stereospecific Alkene 1,2&#8208;Aminohydroxylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under acidic conditions (TFA) and in the presence of water, BocNHOTs promotes stereospecific 1,2&#8208;aminohydroxylations of alkenes. The processes involve intermolecular aza&#8208;Prilezhaev aziridination followed by stereospecific SN2&#8208;like opening by water. This reagent combination provides regiochemical outcomes that are opposite to those observed using epoxidation initiation 1,2&#8208;aminohydroxylation protocols. The reaction platform enables other classes of alkene 1,2&#8208;aminofunctionalization, and intramolecular processes are also feasible, including unusual variants that evoke azabicyclobutane reactivity.

         <title>Organic Cationic&#8208;Coordinated Perfluoropolymer Electrolytes with Strong Li+&#8208;Solvent Interaction for Solid State Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed unique copolymerized perfluoropolymer electrolytes to enlarge the molecular distance through the ionic dipole interactions between the perfluoropolymer chains and solvated molecules based on ionic liquid and lithium salt, which strongly facilitate the transport of Li+, achieving solid&#8208;state batteries with superior performance.







Abstract
The practical application of solid&#8208;state polymer lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) is plagued by the inferior ionic conductivity of the applied polymer electrolytes (PEs), which is caused by the coupling of ion transport with the motion of polymer segments. Here, solvated molecules based on ionic liquid and lithium salt with strong Li+&#8208;solvent interaction are inserted into an elaborately engineered perfluoropolymer electrolyte via ionic dipole interaction, extensively facilitating Li+ transport and improving mechanical properties. The intensified formation of solvation structures of contact ion pairs and ionic aggregates, as well as the strong electron&#8208;withdrawal properties of the F atoms in perfluoropolymers, give the PE high electrochemical stability and excellent interfacial stability. As a result, Li||Li symmetric cells demonstrate a lifetime of 2500&#8197;h and an exceptionally high critical current density above 2.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, Li||LiFePO4 batteries exhibit consistent cycling for 550&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;C, and Li||uncoated LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells achieve 1000&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C with an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.45&#8201;%, one of the best results reported to date based on PEs. Our discovery sheds fresh light on the targeted synergistic regulation of the electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical properties of PEs to extend the cycle life of LMBs.

         <title>Engineering the Substrate Specificity of UDP&#8208;Glycosyltransferases for Synthesizing Triterpenoid Glycosides with a Linear Trisaccharide as Aided by Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
UDP&#8208;glycosyltransferase UGT91H enzymes for the regioselective 2&#8220;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation of triterpenoids to generate triterpenoid glycosides with a linear trisaccharide are described.

Triterpenoids have wide applications in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. The glycosylation of triterpenoids catalyzed by UDP&#8208;glycosyltransferases (UGTs) is a crucial method for producing valuable derivatives with enhanced functions. However, only a few UDP&#8208;glucosyltransferases have been reported to synthesize the rare triterpenoids with linear&#8208;chain trisaccharide at C3&#8722;OH. This study revealed that the UGT91H subfamily primarily contributed to the 2&#8220;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation of triterpenoids with high regioselectivity, then the substrate scope was further expanded by ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR). With ancestral enzyme UGT91H_A1 as a model, the sequence&#8208;structure&#8208;function relationship was explored. A RTAS loop (R212/T213/A214/S215) was identified to affect the substrate specificity of UGT91H_A1. Transferring this RTAS loop to the corresponding position of UGT91H enzymes successfully expanded their substrate spectra. The functional role of RTAS loop was further elucidated by molecular dynamics simulation and quantum mechanical computation. UGT91H_A1 was applied to the low&#8208;cost synthesis of terpenoid rhamnosides with a linear trisaccharide in combining with a self&#8208;sufficient UDP&#8208;rhamnose regeneration system. Finally, we developed a phylogeny&#8208;based platform to efficiently mining new UGT91Hs from plant genomic data. This study provided robust biocatalysts for synthesizing various triterpenoid glycosides with a linear trisaccharide and demonstrated ASR as an efficient tool in engineering the function of UDP&#8208;glycosyltransferases.

         <title>Oscillating Structural Transformations in the Electrochemical Synthesis of Graphene Oxide from Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8197;situ time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of electrochemical graphite oxidation in aqueous sulfuric acid reveal periodic structural changes of a graphite intercalation compound (GIC) into &#8220;pristine graphite oxide&#8221;. The potential oscillations of the graphite electrode correlate with the appearance and disappearance of a solid phase identified as stage&#8208;1 GIC. The observed phenomenon can be considered as a new type of oscillating reaction.







Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of graphene oxide (GO) is known to occur with potential oscillations, but the structural changes underlying these oscillations have remained unclear. In&#8197;situ time&#8208;resolved synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrates that the electrochemical synthesis of GO in aqueous H2SO4 can be described as an oscillating reaction. The transformation from graphite to GO proceeds through periodic structural oscillations that correlate with potential cycles. Stage&#8208;1 graphite intercalation compound (GIC) is found only at the peak of the potential cycle, but not at the bottom of the cycle. Stage&#8208;1 GIC is formed in the first half&#8208;cycle from stage&#8208;2 GIC and then transforms into &#8220;pristine graphite oxide&#8221; (PGO) on the lower side of the potential cycle, after which the cycle restarts with the formation of a new portion of stage&#8208;1 GIC. Water&#8208;washing results in the transformation of PGO into water&#8208;swollen GO with d(001) ~11&#8197;&#197;. These periodic structural changes can be considered a new type of oscillating reaction. The presented results provide broad insights into the oscillating structural changes occurring during the anodic graphite oxidation in aqueous H2SO4 and allow to update of the mechanism of GO electrochemical formation.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Construction of Functional Multi&#8208;Dimensional MXene&#8208;based Composites Directly from MAX Phases through Gas&#8208;Solid Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ construction of functional multi&#8208;dimensional MXene&#8208;based composites with versatile architectures is first realized directly from MAX phases through a general and efficient gas&#8208;solid reaction, for electrochemical applications, especially the durable lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, thanks to appealing synergistic effects induced by the involved components.







Abstract
The weak bonding of A atoms with MX layers in MAX phases not only enables the selective etching of A layers for MXene preparation but brings about the chance to construct A derivatives/MXene composites via in situ conversion. Here, a facile and general gas&#8208;solid reaction systems are elegantly devised to construct multi&#8208;dimensional MXene based composites including AlF3 nanorods/MXene, AlF3 nanocrystals/MXene, amorphous AlF3/MXene, A filled carbon nanotubes/MXene, layered metal chalcogenides/MXene, MOF/MXene, and so on. The intrinsic effect mechanism of interlayer confinement towards crystal growth, catalytic behavior, van der Waals&#8208;heterostructure construction and coordination reaction are rationally put forward. The tight interface combination and synergistic effect from distinct components make them promising active materials for electrochemical applications. More particularly, the AlF3 nanorods/Nb2C MXene demonstrate bi&#8208;directional catalytic activity toward the conversion between Li2S and lithium polysulfides, which alleviates the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>A Regenerable Bi&#8208;Based Catalyst for Efficient and Stable Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Bi0.6Cu0.4 NSs, enriched with Bi/Cu&#8722;O bonds, is electrochemically transformed from Bi0.6Cu0.4 NBs and exhibits exceptional performance in converting CO2 to formate at industrial current densities. In stability test, the effective repetitive electrochemical treatments extend the selectivity for formate to 90&#8201;% for up to 400&#8197;h.







Abstract
Renewable electricity shows immense potential as a driving force for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) in production of formate (HCOO&#8722;) at industrial current density, providing a promising path for value&#8208;added chemicals and chemical manufacturing. However, achieving high selectivity and stable production of HCOO&#8722; at industrial current density remains a challenge. Here, we present a robust Bi0.6Cu0.4 NSs catalyst capable of regenerating necessary catalytic core (Bi&#8722;O) through cyclic voltammetry (CV) treatment. Notably, at 260&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, faradaic efficiency of HCOO&#8722; reaches an exceptional selectivity to 99.23&#8201;%, maintaining above 90&#8201;% even after 400&#8197;h, which is longest reaction time reported at the industrial current density. Furthermore, in stability test, the catalyst was constructed by CV reconstruction to achieve stable and efficient production of HCOO&#8722;. In 20&#8197;h reaction test, the catalyst has a rate of HCOO&#8722; production of 13.24&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;s&#8722;1, a HCOO&#8722; concentration of 1.91&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1, and an energy consumption of 129.80&#8197;kWh&#8201;kmol&#8722;1. In&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopy reveals the formation of Bi&#8722;O structure during the gradual transformation of catalyst from Bi0.6Cu0.4 NBs to Bi0.6Cu0.4 NSs. Theoretical studies highlight the pivotal role of Bi&#8722;O structure in modifying the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates, which further reduces energy barrier for *OCHO conversion in CO2RR.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Dynamic Carburization of Mo Oxide with Unprecedented High CO Formation Rate in Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ carburization of the Mo&#8208;based catalyst at 500&#8201;&#176;C is achieved in RWGS reaction. The surface O/Mo atomic ratio plays significant role in carburization, i.&#8201;e., lower surface O/Mo atomic ratio is beneficial to carburization. In situ carburization induced by reaction product of CO strongly promotes the RWGS activity showing CO formation rate of 7544.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcatal&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
In situ construction of active structure under reaction conditions is highly desired but still remains challenging in many important catalytic processes. Herein, we observe structural evolution of molybdenum oxide (MoOx) into highly active molybdenum carbide (MoCx) during reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Surface oxygen atoms in various Mo&#8208;based catalysts are removed in H2&#8208;containing atmospheres and then carbon atoms can accumulate on surface to form MoCx phase with the RWGS reaction going on, both of which are enhanced by the presence of intercalated H species or Pt&#8208;dopants in MoOx. The structural evolution from MoOx to MoCx is accompanied by enhanced CO2 conversion, which is positively correlated with the surface C/Mo ratio but negatively with the surface O/Mo ratio. As a result, an unprecedented CO formation rate of 7544.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcatal&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 600&#8201;&#176;C has been achieved over in situ carbonized H&#8208;intercalated MoO3 catalyst, which is even higher than those from noble metal catalysts.

     alt="In-Situ Dynamic Carburization of Mo Oxide with Unprecedented High CO Formation Rate in Reverse Water-Gas Shift Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situ carburization of the Mo-based catalyst at 500&#8201;&#176;C is achieved in RWGS reaction. The surface O/Mo atomic ratio plays significant role in carburization, i.&#8201;e., lower surface O/Mo atomic ratio is beneficial to carburization. In situ carburization induced by reaction product of CO strongly promotes the RWGS activity showing CO formation rate of 7544.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;catal&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situ construction of active structure under reaction conditions is highly desired but still remains challenging in many important catalytic processes. Herein, we observe structural evolution of molybdenum oxide (MoO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;) into highly active molybdenum carbide (MoC&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;) during reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Surface oxygen atoms in various Mo-based catalysts are removed in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-containing atmospheres and then carbon atoms can accumulate on surface to form MoC&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; phase with the RWGS reaction going on, both of which are enhanced by the presence of intercalated H species or Pt-dopants in MoO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;. The structural evolution from MoO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; to MoC&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; is accompanied by enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion, which is positively correlated with the surface C/Mo ratio but negatively with the surface O/Mo ratio. As a result, an unprecedented CO formation rate of 7544.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;catal&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 600&#8201;&#176;C has been achieved over in situ carbonized H-intercalated MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst, which is even higher than those from noble metal catalysts. During 100&#8197;h stability test only a minimal deactivation rate of 2.3&#8201;% is observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Operando Spectroelectrochemistry Unravels the Mechanism of CO2 Electrocatalytic Reduction by an Fe Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive experimental investigation of the mechanistic aspects of the selective electroreduction of CO2 to CO by an iron porphyrin using IR and UV/Visible absorption spectroelectrochemistry provides operando insights at molecular scale. In addition to the main catalytic cycle involving FeI species as resting state, a secondary pathway involving the protonation of the porphyrin ligand into a phlorin ligand at the Fe0 level was identified.







Abstract
Iron porphyrins are molecular catalysts recognized for their ability to electrochemically and photochemically reduce carbon dioxide (CO2). The main reduction product is carbon monoxide (CO). CO holds significant industrial importance as it serves as a precursor for various valuable chemical products containing either a single carbon atom (C1), like methanol or methane, or multiple carbon atoms (Cn), such as ethanol or ethylene. Despite the long&#8208;established efficiency of these catalysts, optimizing their catalytic activity and stability and comprehending the intricate reaction mechanisms remain a significant challenge. This article presents a comprehensive investigation of the mechanistic aspects of the selective electroreduction of CO2 to CO using an iron porphyrin substituted with four trimethylammonium groups in the para position [(pTMA)FeIII&#8722;Cl]4+. By employing infrared and UV/Visible spectroelectrochemistry, changes in the electronic structure and coordination environment of the iron center can be observed in real&#8208;time as the electrochemical potential is adjusted, offering new insights into the reaction mechanisms. Catalytic species were identified, and evidence of a secondary reaction pathway was uncovered, potentially prompting a re&#8208;evaluation of the nature of the catalytically active species.

         <title>Beyond Single&#8208;Cycle Autonomous Molecular Machines: Light&#8208;Powered Shuttling in a Multi&#8208;Cycle Reaction Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rotaxane&#8208;based shuttle is operated autonomously by utilizing optical energy. The presence of two azobenzene moieties in the ring component of the rotaxane introduces additional complexity, which is leveraged to extend artificial non&#8208;equilibrium systems beyond single&#8208;cycle chemical reaction networks.







Abstract
Biomolecular machines autonomously convert energy into functions, driving systems away from thermodynamic equilibrium. This energy conversion is achieved by leveraging complex, kinetically asymmetric chemical reaction networks that are challenging to characterize precisely. In contrast, all known synthetic molecular systems in which kinetic asymmetry has been quantified are well described by simple single&#8208;cycle networks. Here, we report on a unique light&#8208;driven [2]rotaxane that enables the autonomous operation of a synthetic molecular machine with a multi&#8208;cycle chemical reaction network. Unlike all prior systems, the present one exploits a photoactive macrocycle, which features a different photoreactivity depending on the binding sites at which it resides. Furthermore, E to Z isomerization reverses the relative affinity of the macrocycle for two binding sites on the axle, resulting in a multi&#8208;cycle network. Building on the most recent theoretical advancements, this work quantifies kinetic asymmetry in a multi&#8208;cycle network for the first time. Our findings represent the simplest rotaxane capable of autonomous shuttling developed so far and offer a general strategy to generate and quantify kinetic asymmetry beyond single&#8208;cycle systems.

         <title>Hyperconjugation&#8208;Driven Isodesmic Reaction of Indoles and Anilines: Reaction Discovery, Mechanism Study, and Antitumor Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented isodesmic reaction of indoles and anilines was developed in this work. The &#963;&#8594;&#960;* hyperconjugation between alkyl group and indole ring was identified as the driving force of this transformation through theoretical and experimental studies. The developed methodology was applied to obtain antitumor quindoline derivatives that exhibited substantial activity in both in vitro assays and in vivo models.







Abstract
Isodesmic reactions, in which chemical bonds are redistributed between substrates and products, provide a general and powerful strategy for both biological and chemical synthesis. However, most isodesmic reactions involve either metathesis or functional&#8208;group transfer. Here, we serendipitously discovered a novel isodesmic reaction of indoles and anilines that proceeds intramolecularly under weakly acidic conditions. In this process, the five&#8208;membered ring of the indole motif is broken and a new indole motif is constructed on the aniline side, accompanied by the formation of a new aniline motif. Mechanistic studies revealed the pivotal role of &#963;&#8594;&#960;* hyperconjugation on the nitrogen atom of the indole motif in driving this unusual isodesmic reaction. Furthermore, we successfully synthesized a diverse series of polycyclic indole derivatives; among quinolines, potential antitumor agents were identified using cellular and in vivo experiments, thereby demonstrating the synthetic utility of the developed methodology.

         <title>Rational Design of 7&#8208;Azaindole&#8208;Based Robust Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for Gas Sorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A preorganized tetrapodal building block, incorporating &#945;&#8208;carboline units, self&#8208;assembles to form a 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF). The expanded hydrogen bonding between the heteroaromatic substructures, along with intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, spontaneously build up an interpenetrated architecture that bestows an extraordinary robustness to the microporous crystalline material, showing a good selectivity for CO2 adsorption.







Abstract
7&#8208;Azaindole has been integrated as building block with complementary N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N hydrogen bonding sites for the synthesis of a tetrahedral molecular tecton, namely tetra(&#945;&#8208;carbolin&#8208;6&#8208;yl)methane, TACM. The self&#8208;assembly of this molecule results in a 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF). This supramolecular structure constitutes a crystalline microporous material with an extraordinary thermal and chemical robustness. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals how the five&#8208;fold catenation of diamonoid systems, stabilized by hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, form an interpenetrated network with monodimensional channels. The structural features of the crystalline material are also observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Additionally, the microporosity of the activated TACM&#8208;HOF is characterized by gas sorption (N2, CO2, CH4 and H2) experiments performed at different pressures. A selective adsorption is observed for CO2 uptake and TACM&#8208;HOF also presents a good adsorption capacity for H2 among supramolecular organic frameworks.

         <title>Polyanionic Receptors for Carboxylates in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxylate anions are important but challenging substrates for recognition in aqueous solution. These divalent receptors employ charge&#8208;neutral binding sites to bind simple carboxylates in water with no cosolvent, despite the presence of multiply anionic solubilising groups.







Abstract
Receptors for carboxylate anions have many possible biomedical applications, including mimicry of the vancomycin group of antibiotics. However, binding carboxylates in water, the biological solvent, is highly challenging due to the hydrophilicity of these polar anions. Here we report, for the first time, the recognition of simple carboxylates such as acetate and formate in water by synthetic receptors with charge&#8208;neutral binding sites. The receptors are solubilised by polyanionic side&#8208;chains which, remarkably, do not preclude anion binding. The tricyclic structures feature two identical binding sites linked by polyaromatic bridges, capable of folding into closed, twisted conformations. This folding is hypothesised to preorganise the structures for anion recognition, mimicking the process which generates many protein binding sites. The architecture is suitable for elaboration into enclosed structures with potential for selective recognition of biologically relevant carboxylates.

         <title>Collective Asymmetric Synthesis of Thiosilvatins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of the epidithiodiketopiperazine (&#8722;)&#8208;dithiosilvatin is reported along with a collective approach to ten related thiosilvatins. The described methods offer a practical blueprint for exploring the dithiotiketopiperazine pharmacophore with absolute and relative stereocontrol.







Abstract
Thiosilvatins are a family of biologically active sulfenylated diketopiperazine natural products. The first members were reported over 40&#8197;years ago, but total synthesis of a thiosilvatin has remained elusive. Here, we describe the first, collective, synthesis of the parent epidithiodiketopiperazine (&#8722;)&#8208;dithiosilvatin and ten related thiosilvatins. Several of the targets are structurally revised. A catalytic asymmetric sulfenylation of triketopiperazines efficiently controls absolute configuration at the thioaminal units. Further synthetic highlights include a diastereoconvergent installation of the requisite cis&#8208;orientation of the sulfur atoms and a tandem epidisulfide formation/O&#8208;prenylation under mild Mitsunobu conditions. The described methods for late&#8208;stage diversification of sensitive bis(methylthio)diketopiperazines offer a blueprint for systematically exploring this interesting 3D&#8208;pharmacophore in stereochemically pure form.

         <title>Amplification and Attenuation of Asymmetry via Kinetically Controlled Seed&#8208;Induced Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we introduce a novel strategy to both amplify and attenuate asymmetry in supramolecular assemblies using a seed&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization strategy under kinetic conditions&#8212;an unprecedented observation in the field.







Abstract
The amplification of asymmetry in supramolecular polymers has recently garnered significant attention. While asymmetry amplification has predominantly been explored under thermodynamic conditions, the kinetic aspect of this process unveils intriguing observations, yet is scarcely reported in the literature. Herein, drawing inspiration from macromolecular systems, we propose a novel strategy for enhancing asymmetry in supramolecular polymers through a seed&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization approach under kinetic conditions, employing a naphthalene diimide&#8208;derived monomer (ANSG) for template&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization, utilizing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and pyrophosphate (PPi) as templates. A chiral seed comprising [ANSG&#8208;ATP]S effectively amplifies the overall supramolecular asymmetry when exposed to a mixture of achiral templates (PPi) and monomers (ANSG), owing to its efficient seeding characteristics under kinetic conditions. As a result of efficient co&#8208;operativity, conversely, employing an achiral seed [ANSG&#8208;PPi]S in a mixture of chiral templates (ATP) and monomers (ANSG) results in the attenuation of asymmetry, highlighting the effective modulation achievable through the seeding approach, an unprecedented observation in the field. Exploiting the efficient aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) of the resultant supramolecular polymers further extends the amplification and attenuation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) as a potential function.

         <title>Hydrogenolysis of Haloboranes: from Synthesis of Hydroboranes to Formal Hydroboration Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of hydroboranes is reported from dihydrogen (H2) and haloboranes, using a base to trap the released acid, under both stoichiometric and catalytic conditions. The system is applicable to one&#8208;pot hydrogenolysis/hydroboration reactions of C=C unsaturated bonds.







Abstract
Hydroboranes are versatile reagents in synthetic chemistry, but their synthesis relies on energy&#8208;intensive processes. Herein, we report a new method for the preparation of hydroboranes from hydrogen and the corresponding haloboranes. Triethylamine (NEt3) form with dialkylchloroboranes a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) able to split H2 and afford the desired hydroborane with ammonium salts. Unreactive haloboranes were unlocked using a catalytic amount of Cy2BCl, enabling the synthesis of commonly used hydroboranes such as pinacolborane or catecholborane. The mechanisms of these reactions have been examined by DFT studies, highlighting the importance of the base selection. Finally, the system&#8216;s robustness has been evaluated in one&#8208;pot B&#8722;Cl hydrogenolysis/hydroboration reactions of C=C unsaturated bonds.

         <title>Isofunctional but Structurally Different Methyltransferases for Dithiolopyrrolone Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two for one job: DtpM and XrdM are two bacterial enzymes that have different structures but still catalyze the same reaction: the amide N&#8208;methylation of dithiolopyrrolones (DTPs). Ligand binding to both enzymes was studied using X&#8208;ray crystallography, modeling, mutagenesis and activity assays. The results suggest that different organisms developed distinct methyltransferases for the same task by convergent evolution.







Abstract
Dithiolopyrrolone (DTP) natural products are produced by several different bacteria and have potent antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer activities. While the amide of their DTP core can be methylated to fine&#8208;tune bioactivity, the enzyme responsible for the amide N&#8208;methylation has remained elusive in most taxa. Here, we identified the amide methyltransferase XrdM that is responsible for xenorhabdin (XRD) methylation in Xenorhabdus doucetiae but encoded outside of the XRD gene cluster. XrdM turned out to be isofunctional with the recently reported methyltransferase DtpM, that is involved in the biosynthesis of the DTP thiolutin, although its X&#8208;ray structure is unrelated to that of DtpM. To investigate the structural basis for ligand binding in both enzymes, we used X&#8208;ray crystallography, modeling, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, and kinetic activity assays. Our study expands the limited knowledge of post&#8208;non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) amide methylation in DTP biosynthesis and reveals an example of convergent evolution of two structurally completely different enzymes for the same reaction in different organisms.

         <title>Time&#8208;Encoded Information Encryption with pH Clock Guided Broad&#8208;Spectrum Emission by Dynamic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4D encryption: Using the time&#8208;gated broad&#8208;spectrum emission of a cyanostilbene&#8208;based AIE system under the influence of a pH clock, an additional dimension in the form of time is introduced for data encryption.







Abstract
With growing threats from counterfeiting&#8208;based security breaches, multi&#8208;level and specific stimuli&#8208;responsive anti&#8208;counterfeiting devices and message encryption methods have attracted immense research interest. Fluorescence&#8208;based encryption from aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;based materials solves the problems to a considerable extent. However, the development of smarter patterns with hierarchical security levels alongside dynamic display is still challenging. To screen out this complication, we bring forward a pH&#8208;switchable fluorescent assembly of an AIEgen and an aliphatic acid.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4D encryption&lt;/b&gt;: Using the time-gated broad-spectrum emission of a cyanostilbene-based AIE system under the influence of a pH clock, an additional dimension in the form of time is introduced for data encryption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With growing threats from counterfeiting-based security breaches, multi-level and specific stimuli-responsive anti-counterfeiting devices and message encryption methods have attracted immense research interest. Fluorescence-based encryption from aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-based materials solves the problems to a considerable extent. However, the development of smarter patterns with hierarchical security levels alongside dynamic display is still challenging. To screen out this complication, we bring forward a pH-switchable fluorescent assembly of an AIEgen and an aliphatic acid. We later temporally direct the molecular assembly with the aid of a chemical trigger-regulated pH clock, generating a transitory multicolor emission, including transient white light generation. The pH-dependent emissions were further implemented in constructing smart multi-input fluorescent chemical AND gates. Subsequently, we integrate the time-gated emissive system to develop an advanced multi-dimensionally secure data encryption strategy. This novel approach enhances anti-counterfeiting measures by introducing an additional layer of security based on temporal characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>d&#8208;Electrons of Platinum Alloy Steering CO Pathway for Low&#8208;charge Potential Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 batteries suffer from sluggish solid&#8208;solid co&#8208;oxidation kinetics of C and Li2CO3, requiring extremely high charging potentials and leading to serious side reactions and poor energy efficiency. Herein, we introduce a novel approach to address these challenges by modulating the reaction pathway with tailored Pt d&#8208;electrons and develop an aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 battery with CO and Li2CO3 as the main discharge products. Note that the gas&#8208;solid co&#8208;oxidation reaction between CO and Li2CO3 is both kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable. Consequently, the Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with CoPt alloy&#8208;supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber (CoPt@NCNF) cathode exhibit a charging potential of 2.89 V at 50 &#181;A cm&#8208;2, which is the lowest charging potential to date. Moreover, the CoPt@NCNF cathode also shows exceptional cycling stability (218 cycles at 50 &#181;A cm&#8208;2) and high energy efficiency up to 74.6%. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the lowered d&#8208;band center of CoPt alloy effectively promotes CO desorption and inhibits further CO reduction to C. This work provides promising insights into developing efficient and CO&#8208;selective Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The glycosylation of peptides and proteins can significantly impact their intrinsic properties, such as conformation, stability, antigenicity, and immunogenicity. Current methods for preparing N&#8208;linked glycopeptides typically rely on amide bond formation, which can be limited by the presence of reactive functional groups like acids and amines. Late&#8208;stage functionalization of peptides offers a promising approach to obtaining N&#8208;linked glycopeptides. In this study, we demonstrate the preparation of N&#8208;linked glycopeptides through a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective Giese addition between N&#8208;glycosyl oxamic acid and peptides containing dehydroalanine (Dha) under visible light conditions. Unlike traditional methods that rely on the coupling of aspartic acid and glycosylamine, this approach utilizes the conjugation of N&#8208;glycosylated carbamoyl radicals with Dha, facilitating the straightforward modification of complex peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>A Critical View on the Use of DNA Hydrogels in Cell&#8208;Free Protein Synthesis</title>

         <dc:description>Numerous studies have reported in the past that the use of protein&#8208;encoding DNA hydrogels as templates for cell&#8208;free protein synthesis (CFPS) leads to better yields than the use of conventional templates such as plasmids or PCR fragments. Systematic investigation of different types of bulk materials from pure DNA hydrogels and DNA hydrogel composites using a commercially available CFPS kit showed no evidence of improved expression efficiency. However, protein&#8208;coding DNA hydrogels were advantageously used in microfluidic reactors as immobilized templates for repetitive protein production, suggesting that DNA&#8208;based materials offer potential for future developments in high&#8208;throughput profiling or rapid in situ characterization of proteins.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) are a growing class of chemotherapeutic agents that have yielded striking clinical successes. However, the efficacy of ADCs often suffers from issues associated with tumor heterogeneity and resistance. To overcome these problems, a new generation of ADCs comprising a single monoclonal antibody with multiple different payloads attached, termed multi&#8208;payload ADCs, have been developed. Here we deploy multiple orthogonal site&#8208;specific protein modification strategies to generate highly homogeneous multi&#8208;functionalised antibody conjugates comprising up to four different functionalities installed at four unique sites on the antibody. This work, which includes the use of a site&#8208;specific cyclopropenone (CPO)&#8208;based reagent, represents the first example of a homogeneous multi&#8208;payload ADC with a payload count greater than two, and thereby facilitates the development of the next generation of ADCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Inducible Radiomimetic Photosensitizers Selectively Suppress Cancer Cell Proliferation by Damaging DNA through Radical Cation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;inducible radiomimetic photosensitizers have been developed to damage DNA through radical cation chemistry. They exhibit selective and redox&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity and demonstrate significant potential in combination therapy. This innovative approach not only provides an alternative strategy for phototherapy but also establishes a novel cellular platform for studying the direct effects of radiotherapy.







Abstract
Radiotherapy leverages ionizing radiation to kill cancer cells through direct and indirect effects, and direct effects are considered to play an equal or greater role. Several photosensitizers have been developed to mimic the direct effects of radiotherapy, generating radical cations in DNA models, but none has been applied in cellular studies. Here, we design a radiomimetic photosensitizer, producing DNA radical cations in cells for the first time. To reduce adverse effects, several redox&#8208;inducible precursors are prepared as cancer cells have elevated levels of GSH and H2O2. These precursors respond to GSH or H2O2, releasing the active photosensitizer that captures DNA abasic (AP) sites and generates DNA radical cations upon photolysis, without disrupting the redox state of cells. DNA radical cations migrate freely and are eventually trapped by H2O and O2 to yield DNA lesions, thus triggering DNA damage response. Our study suggests that direct effects of radiotherapy suppress cancer cell proliferation mainly by inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, rather than promoting apoptosis. Synergistic effects of the precursor and chemotherapeutic agents are also observed in combination phototherapy. Beyond highlighting an alternative strategy for phototherapy, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study affords a facile cellular platform to study the direct effects of radiotherapy.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Enzyme Mimetic MoCu Dual&#8208;Atom Nanozyme Triggering Oxidative Stress Cascade Amplification for High&#8208;Efficiency Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;enzyme mimetic MoCu dual&#8208;atom nanozyme (MoCu DAzyme) with multiple catalytic active sites can generate various reactive oxygen species, deplete glutathione, and block glutathione regeneration by consuming NADPH, thereby triggering oxidative stress cascade amplification for collaborative catalytic therapy. The antitumor therapeutic effect is further enhanced when synergized with photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with ultrahigh atom utilization efficiency have been extensively applied in reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated cancer therapy. However, the high energy barriers of reaction intermediates on single&#8208;atom sites and the overexpressed antioxidants in the tumor microenvironment restrict the amplification of tumor oxidative stress, resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we report a multi&#8208;enzyme mimetic MoCu dual&#8208;atom nanozyme (MoCu DAzyme) with various catalytic active sites, which exhibits peroxidase, oxidase, glutathione (GSH) oxidase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase mimicking activities. Compared with Mo SAzyme, the introduction of Cu atoms, formation of dual&#8208;atom sites, and synergetic catalytic effects among various active sites enhance substrate adsorption and reduce the energy barrier, thereby endowing MoCu DAzyme with stronger catalytic activities. Benefiting from the above enzyme&#8208;like activities, MoCu DAzyme can not only generate multiple ROS, but also deplete GSH and block its regeneration to trigger the cascade amplification of oxidative stress. Additionally, the strong optical absorption in the near&#8208;infrared II bio&#8208;window endows MoCu DAzyme with remarkable photothermal conversion performance. Consequently, MoCu DAzyme achieves high&#8208;efficiency synergistic cancer treatment incorporating collaborative catalytic therapy and photothermal therapy.

     alt="Multi-Enzyme Mimetic MoCu Dual-Atom Nanozyme Triggering Oxidative Stress Cascade Amplification for High-Efficiency Synergistic Cancer Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multi-enzyme mimetic MoCu dual-atom nanozyme (MoCu DAzyme) with multiple catalytic active sites can generate various reactive oxygen species, deplete glutathione, and block glutathione regeneration by consuming NADPH, thereby triggering oxidative stress cascade amplification for collaborative catalytic therapy. The antitumor therapeutic effect is further enhanced when synergized with photothermal therapy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) with ultrahigh atom utilization efficiency have been extensively applied in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cancer therapy. However, the high energy barriers of reaction intermediates on single-atom sites and the overexpressed antioxidants in the tumor microenvironment restrict the amplification of tumor oxidative stress, resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we report a multi-enzyme mimetic MoCu dual-atom nanozyme (MoCu DAzyme) with various catalytic active sites, which exhibits peroxidase, oxidase, glutathione (GSH) oxidase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase mimicking activities. Compared with Mo SAzyme, the introduction of Cu atoms, formation of dual-atom sites, and synergetic catalytic effects among various active sites enhance substrate adsorption and reduce the energy barrier, thereby endowing MoCu DAzyme with stronger catalytic activities. Benefiting from the above enzyme-like activities, MoCu DAzyme can not only generate multiple ROS, but also deplete GSH and block its regeneration to trigger the cascade amplification of oxidative stress. Additionally, the strong optical absorption in the near-infrared II bio-window endows MoCu DAzyme with remarkable photothermal conversion performance. Consequently, MoCu DAzyme achieves high-efficiency synergistic cancer treatment incorporating collaborative catalytic therapy and photothermal therapy. This work will advance the therapeutic applications of DAzymes and provide valuable insights for nanocatalytic cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Initiated Nano&#8208;Micelles Mediated Covalent Modification of mRNA for Labeling and Treatment of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving in situ spontaneous and precise mRNA covalent modification can effectively interfere with the translation of mRNA in tumor cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. The linked Luminol and Ce6 generated 1O2 in situ by CRET and furan&#8208;mediated covalent modification of mRNAs was triggered for RNA interference in situ. This strategy offers novel insights into in situ RNA interference.







Abstract
As a promising gene therapy strategy, controllable small molecule&#8208;mRNA covalent modification in tumor cells could be initiated by singlet oxygen (1O2) to complete the modification process. However, in vivo generation of 1O2 is usually dependent on excitation of external light, and the limited light penetration of tissues greatly interferes the development of deep tumor photo therapy. Here, we constructed a tumor&#8208;targeting nano&#8208;micelle for the spontaneous intracellular generation of 1O2 without the need for external light, and inducing a high level of covalent modification of mRNA in tumor cells. Luminol and Ce6 were chemically bonded to produce 1O2 by chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) triggered by high levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The sufficient 1O2 oxidized the loaded furan to highly reactive dicarbonyl moiety, which underwent cycloaddition reaction with adenine (A), cytosine (C) or guanine (G) on the mRNA for interfering with the tumor cell protein expression, thereby inhibiting tumor progression. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that this self&#8208;initiated gene therapy nano&#8208;micelle could induce covalent modification of mRNA by 1O2 without external light, and the process could be monitored in real time by fluorescence imaging, which provided an effective strategy for RNA&#8208;based tumor gene therapy.

         <title>Hydroxyl Radical Mediated Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Baeyer&#8208;Villiger Oxidation over Covalent Triazine/Heptazine&#8208;Based Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Baeyer&#8208;Villiger&#160; oxidation of ketones to the corresponding lactones/esters is a classic and essential reaction in the chemical industry. However, this oxidation process has not yet been achieved in ambient conditions with the aid of oxygen and heterogeneous photocatalysts. In this study, we developed an organic photocatalytic system using covalent triazine/heptazine&#8208;based frameworks (CTF&#8208;TB/CHF&#8208;TB) to enable the B&#8208;V oxidation reaction under mild conditions through a cascade reaction pathway. Experimental data and theoretical calculations showed that heptazine/triazine units can "chelate&#8221; and decompose the in situ generated H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH). Compared to conventional methods that primarily involve metal&#8208;activated benzaldehyde at elevated temperatures (e.g., 60 oC), the &#8226;OH generated in our study can readily cleave the C&#8208;H bond of benzaldehyde, forming an active intermediate that drives subsequent sequential processes: O2&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8226;OH&#8594;Ph&#8208;CO&#8226;&#8594;Ph&#8208;COOO&#8226;. By employing this photocatalytic process, a yield of 91% and a selectivity of over 99&#8201;% were obtained in the oxidation of cyclohexanone to caprolactone at room temperature. This performance is comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts, and our CHF&#8208;TB catalyst demonstrates impressive reusability, maintaining a high yield after 5 consecutive runs. This work presents a straightforward approach for C&#8208;H cleavage by organocatalysts to produce &#949;&#8208;caprolactone in a mild manner by Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Confined Active Silver Nanoclusters with Ultrawide Operating Temperature Window in CO oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported metal nanoclusters are often highly active in many catalytic reactions but less stable particularly under harsh reaction conditions. Here, we demonstrate that this activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off can be efficiently broken through rational design of surrounding microenvironment of the supported nanocatalyst including gas adsorbate overlayer and underneath support surface chemistry. Our studies reveal that chemisorbed oxygen species on Ag surface and surface hydroxyl groups on oxide support, which are dynamically consumed during reaction but sustained by reaction environment (O2 and H2O vapor), drive spontaneous redispersion of Ag particles and stabilization of highly active Ag nanoclusters. Such a dynamic confinement effect from gas&#8208;catalyst&#8208;support interaction enables the Ag nanoclusters to exhibit complete catalytic oxidation of CO over a wide temperature window of 25 &#8208; 500 &#176;C under dry conditions and 200 &#8208; 800 &#176;C under wet conditions as well as remarkable stability at 300 &#176;C over 1000 h.</dc:description>

         <title>The &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Synthase FabF Catalyzes Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation in a Bimodal Pattern for Fatty Acid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinctive bimodal substrate selectivity pattern and carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation catalytic mechanism of &#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Synthase FabF in Type&#8208;II Fatty Acid Biosynthesis pathway was reported. It utilizes three door residues in the substrate tunnel to achieve selective recognition of acyl&#8208;ACP with substrates of different chain lengths and catalyzes the transacylation&#8208;condensation reaction to complete the carbon chain elongation synthesis of fatty acids.







Abstract
Fatty acids produced by the type&#8208;II fatty acid biosynthetic pathway (FAS&#8208;II) are essential biomaterials for bacterial membrane construction and numerous metabolic routes. The &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase FabF catalyzes the key C&#8722;C bond formation step for fatty acid elongation in FAS&#8208;II. Here, we revealed the substrate recognition and catalytic mechanisms of FabF by determining FabF&#8208;ACP complexes. FabF displays a distinctive bimodal catalytic pattern specifically on C6 and C10 acyl&#8208;ACP substrates. It utilizes positively charged residues located on the &#951;3&#8208;helix and loop1 regions near the catalytic tunnel entrance to bind ACP, and two hydrophobic cavities as well as &#8220;front&#8221;, &#8220;middle&#8221;, and &#8220;back&#8221; door residues to specifically stabilize C6 and C10 acyl substrates for preferential catalysis. Further quantum chemistry calculations suggest that the FabF catalytic residues Lys336 and His304 facilitate proton transfer during condensation catalysis and C&#8722;C bond formation. Our results provide key mechanistic insights into the biosynthesis of molecular carbon skeletons based on ketosynthases that are highly conserved through the FAS and polyketide synthase (PKS) analogous biosynthetic routes, broaden the understanding of the tricarboxylic acid cycle that utilizes lipoic acid derived from C8&#8208;ACP accumulated due to the FabF distinctive catalytic pattern for oxidative decarboxylations, and may facilitate the development of narrow&#8208;spectrum antibacterial drugs.

         <title>Imidazolate&#8208;Stabilized Cu(III): Dioxygen to Oxides at Type 3 Copper Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazole ligation of metals through histidine is extensive among metalloproteins and enzymes, yet the role of the imidazolate conjugate base is often neglected, despite its potential accessibility when bonded to a highly oxidized metal center. Using synthetic models of oxygenated tyrosinase enzymes with exclusive monodentate imidazole ligation, we find that deprotonation of the &#956;2&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;peroxidodicopper(II) species triggers redox isomerization to an imidazolate&#8208;ligated bis(&#956;2&#8208;oxido)dicopper(III) species.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Imidazole ligation of metals through histidine is extensive among metalloproteins and enzymes, yet the role of the imidazolate conjugate base is often neglected, despite its potential accessibility when bonded to a highly oxidized metal center. Using synthetic models of oxygenated tyrosinase enzymes with exclusive monodentate imidazole ligation, we find that deprotonation of the &#956;2-&#951;2:&#951;2-peroxidodicopper(II) species triggers redox isomerization to an imidazolate-ligated bis(&#956;2-oxido)dicopper(III) species.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Dissipative Assembly with Switchable Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A switchable non&#8208;equilibrium dissipative assembly promoting fibroblast adhesion/proliferation and efficient drug delivery was developed using chemical fuel. Nanofibers acted as chiral hydrogel scaffolds for cell adhesion and drug reservoirs. This system transitions between nanofiber and nanospherical forms, enabling targeted drug delivery and recovery, highlighting its scientific significance.







Abstract
Natural dissipative assembly (DSA) often exhibit energy&#8208;driven shifts in natural functions. However, creating man&#8208;made DSA that can mimic such biological activities transformation remains relatively rare. Herein, we introduce a cytomembrane&#8208;like dissipative assembly system based on chiral supramolecules. This system employs benzoyl cysteine in an out of equilibrium manner, enabling the shifts in biofunctions while minimizing material use. Specifically, aroyl&#8208;cystine derivatives primarily assemble into stable M&#8208;helix nanofibers under equilibrium conditions. These nanofibers enhance fibroblast adhesion and proliferation through stereospecific interactions with chiral cellular membranes. Upon the addition of chemical fuels, these functional nanofibers temporarily transform into non&#8208;equilibrium nanospheres, facilitating efficient drug delivery. Subsequently, these nanospheres revert to their original nanofiber state, effectively recycling the drug. The programmable function&#8208;shifting ability of this DSA establishes it as a novel, fuel&#8208;driven drug delivery vehicle. And the bioactive DSA not only addresses a gap in synthetic DSAs within biological applications but also sets the stage for innovative designs of &#8242;living&#8242; materials.

         <title>Small Molecule RNA Degraders</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As one of the central molecules for life, RNA is connected to various processes involved in disease. Achieving a targeted, specific and irreversible RNA degradation is both a challenge and a highly valuable goal for pushing forward the development of new therapeutics. This minireview aims to summarize and provide mechanistic insights into every approach so far to drug and irreversibly degrade disease&#8208;associated RNA using small molecules.







Abstract
RNA is a central molecule in life, involved in a plethora of biological processes and playing a key role in many diseases. Targeting RNA emerges as a significant endeavor in drug discovery, diverging from conventional protein&#8208;centric approaches to tackle various pathologies. Whilst identifying small molecules that bind to specific RNA regions is the first step, the abundance of non&#8208;functional RNA segments renders many interactions biologically inert. Consequently, small molecule binding does not necessarily meet stringent criteria for clinical translation, calling for solutions to push the field forward. Converting RNA&#8208;binders into RNA&#8208;degraders presents a promising avenue to enhance RNA&#8208;targeting. This mini&#8208;review outlines strategies and exemplars wherein simple small molecule RNA binders are reprogrammed into active degraders through the linkage of functional groups. These approaches encompass mechanisms that induce degradation via endogenous enzymes, termed RIBOTACs, as well as those with functional moieties acting autonomously to degrade RNA. Through this exploration, we aim to offer insights into advancing RNA&#8208;targeted therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antiviral Agents against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants Inhibit the Conserved Viral Protein Nsp1&#8211;RNA Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The demand for robust antiviral approaches is underscored by the continued COVID&#8208;19 spread. SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nsp1, highly conserved among SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants, plays a pivotal role in controlling host protein expression and viral RNA translation. A small&#8208;molecule Nsp1 inhibitor exhibited antiviral activity against various sarbecoviruses, signifying a promising strategy against future viral challenges.







Abstract
The ongoing global threats posed by COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, catalyzed by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, underscores the pressing need for effective antiviral strategies. The viral non&#8208;structural protein&#8197;1 (Nsp1) significantly influences pathogenicity by impeding host protein expression and enhancing viral RNA translation through its interaction with the stem&#8208;loop&#8197;1 (SL1) in the 5&#8242; untranslated region (UTR). We have developed a novel dual&#8208;luciferase reporter assay, designed to investigate the critical Nsp1&#8211;SL1 interaction, and identified P23E02 as a potential inhibitor. Our investigation, combining molecular docking studies and alanine mutagenesis, has unveiled that P23E02 disrupts Nsp1&#8211;40S ribosomal subunit interaction, liberating translational inhibition and empowering host antiviral responses. P23E02 exhibits antiviral efficacy against various sarbecoviruses, making it a promising candidate for combatting COVID&#8208;19 and related diseases. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting the Nsp1/SL1 axis and lays the foundation for innovative antiviral interventions, ultimately fortifying global preparedness against future viral threats.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution&#8208;processable conducting polymers open up a new era in organic electronics, fundamentally altering the processing methods of electronic devices. P&#8208;type conducting polymers, exemplified by aqueous solution&#8208;processed poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), have been successfully commercialized. However, the performance of electron&#8208;transporting (n&#8208;type) materials remains considerably poorer. One of the primary challenges lies in striking a balance between conductivity and solvent processability. At present, most n&#8208;type conducting polymers necessitate toxic solvents for processing, which contradicts environmentally sustainable principles and impedes their potential for large&#8208;scale industrial applications.

The PBFDO:PEOx films exhibit remarkable electrical conductivity exceeding 1000 S cm&#8722;1 with outstanding stability even at temperatures up to 250 &#176;C, establishing it as a prominent green solvent&#8208;processed n&#8208;type conducting polymer that rivals the most advanced p&#8208;type counterparts. Various applications including organic thermoelectric, electrochemical transistor and electrochromic devices were showcased, highlighting the broad potential of PBFDO:PEOx in advancing green organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Reconfiguration by Cation/Anion Cross&#8208;coordination for   Highly Reversible and Facile Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hard carbon (HC) materials are promising anodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to low cost, high specific capacity and low working potential. However, the poor compatibility of the electrolyte with HC leads to low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and sluggish Na+ transport kinetics. Here, we propose an electrolyte reconfiguration strategy based on the hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) theory by introducing methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (MTPPB). MTPPB can realize a spontaneous cross&#8208;coordination solvation structure with NaPF6 by selective affinity, synchronously optimizing the interfacial chemistry and sodium storage process. The advantages of the chemical &#960;&#8208;&#960; bridging of MTPP+&#8208;HC and interaction of MTPP+&#8208;PF6&#8722; contribute to preferential and oriented reduction of PF6&#8722;, forming a low&#8208;resistance supramolecular SEI. Additionally, Na+&#8208;Br&#8722; coordination weakens the Na+&#8208;solvent interactions, facilitating Na+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics. Consequently, the HC||Na cell achieves a superior ICE of 96.6%, desirable rate capability under 25 &#176;C and invisible capacity decay after 500 cycles at 1 C under &#8722;20 &#176;C. The Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7||HC pouch battery displays a high ICE of 90.3% and a 15% increment of energy density under 25 &#176;C. This work provides a guidance through electrolyte reconfiguration engineering for designing practical HC&#8208;based SIBs with high energy/power density and long&#8208;life span in the extended operating&#8208;temperature range.</dc:description>

Additionally, Na+-Br&#8722; coordination weakens the Na+-solvent interactions, facilitating Na+ de-solvation kinetics. Consequently, the HC||Na cell achieves a superior ICE of 96.6%, desirable rate capability under 25 &#176;C and invisible capacity decay after 500 cycles at 1 C under &#8722;20 &#176;C. The Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7||HC pouch battery displays a high ICE of 90.3% and a 15% increment of energy density under 25 &#176;C. This work provides a guidance through electrolyte reconfiguration engineering for designing practical HC-based SIBs with high energy/power density and long-life span in the extended operating-temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Nanocomposite Polymer&#8208;integrated Ca&#8208;doped CeO2
Electrolyte for Robust and High&#8208;rate All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the seamless interfaces between solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) and electrode materials, SPEs&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSSIBs) are considered promising energy storage systems. However, the sluggish Na+ transport and uncontrollable Na dendrite propagation still hinder the practical application of SPEs&#8208;based ASSSIBs. Herein, Ca&#8208;doped CeO2 (Ca&#8208;CeO2) nanotube framework is synthesized and integrated with poly (ethylene oxide) methyl ether acrylate&#8208;perfluoropolyether copolymer (PEOA&#8208;PFPE), resulting in multifunctional solid nanocomposite electrolytes (namely SNEs, i.e., PEOA&#8208;PFPE/Ca&#8208;CeO2). Our investigations demonstrate that the fluorous effect incurred by the fluorine&#8208;containing PEOA&#8208;PFPE and the oxygen vacancy effect induced by the Ca&#8208;CeO2 framework could synergistically promote the dissociation of sodium salt, ultimately enhancing the Na+ mobility in SNEs. Besides, the resultant SNEs construct rapid Na+ transport channels and homogenize the Na deposition in SNEs/Na interface, which effectively prevents the Na dendrite growth. Furthermore, the assembled carbon&#8208;coated sodium vanadium phosphate (NVP@C)||PEOA&#8208;PFPE/Ca&#8208;CeO2||Na coin cell delivers impressive rate capability of 97.9 mA h g&#8208;1 at 2 C and outstanding cycling stability with capacity retention of 84.3% after 300 cycles at 1 C. This work illustrates that constructing multifunctional SNEs via incorporating functional inorganic frameworks into fluorine&#8208;containing SPEs could be a promising strategy for the commercialization of robust and high&#8208;performance ASSSIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Strengthen Water O&#8208;H Bond in Electrolytes for Enhanced Reversibility and Safety in Aqueous Aluminum Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries present a promising prospect for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications, owing to the abundance, inherent safety, and the high theoretical capacity of aluminum. However, their voltage output and energy density are significantly hindered by challenges such as complex hydrogen evolution and uncontrollable solvation reactions. In this work, we demonstrate that water decomposition is restrain by increasing the electron density of water protons and increasing the dissociation energy of H2O through robust dipole interactions with highly polar dimethylformamide (DMF) molecules. Moreover, the incorporation of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) flame retardant effectively addresses the flammability risk arising from a substantial presence of organic additives The in&#8208;depth study with experimental and theoretical simulations reveals that the water&#8208;poor solvation structure with reduced water activity is achieved, which can (i) effectively mitigate undesired solvated H2O&#8208;mediated side reactions on the Al anode; (ii) boost the de&#8208;solvation kinetics of Al3+ while preventing cathode structural distortion; (iii) reduce the flammability of hybrid electrolytes. As a proof of concept, the Al//AlxMnO2 full cell employing a hybrid electrolyte demonstrate enhanced stability (deliver 335 mAh g&#8208;1 while retaining 71% capacity for 400 cycles) compared to those with pure electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Supramolecular Network Enabled Gentle Reprogramming of Liquid Crystal Elastomer toward Evolutionary Robot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature, many organisms augment chances of survival by reprogramming their structures to evolving environment, among which sea squirts being a prime example. Such reprogramming has been demonstrated in liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuator assembled with heat assistance. However, the required temperature being higher than the actuation temperature limits its application. Here, we reported a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular network LCE to construct soft modular and reprogrammable actuator by assembling with a gentle heat treatment. Leveraging the Michael addition reaction, we introduced hydrogen bonding to the LCE matrix with functionalized pyridine monomers. Experimental and molecular dynamics modeling proved the efficient dynamic hydrogen bond exchange at 60&#176;C, significantly lower than the actuating temperature of the LCE. This gave rise to the reversible and robust adhesion of the same collection of LCE modules capable of being built into different bilayers and performing various morphing upon a short thermal stimulation. Therefore, we demonstrated that these comparatively weak cross&#8208;links enabled reconfiguration of the LCE actuator. With the developed hydrogen&#8208;bonding LCEs, we built proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept modular reprogrammable robot, performing crawling, sailing, and microcircuit repair tasks. This bioinspired and efficient method for evolutionary LCE robot offers a viable path for further development of intelligent actuators sustainable in complex environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuteration and Tritiation of Pharmaceuticals by Non&#8208;Directed Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation in Heavy and Super&#8208;Heavy Water</title>

         <dc:description>
We present a hydrogen isotope exchange reaction using non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis. The catalytic system relies on a commercially available pyridine ligand that enables aromatic C&#8722;H activation. Labelling of 39 pharmaceuticals was achieved by utilizing D2O as the deuterium source and solvent, without requiring fluorinated cosolvents. Expansion to T/H exchange on three different pharmaceuticals by using T2O as isotopic source was demonstrated.







Abstract
Deuterated and tritiated analogs of drugs are valuable compounds for pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. In this work, we present a novel hydrogen isotope exchange reaction of drugs using non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis. Aromatic C&#8722;H activation is achieved by a commercially available pyridine ligand. Using the most convenient and cheapest deuterium source, D2O, as the only solvent 39&#8197;pharmaceuticals were labelled with clean reaction profiles and high deuterium uptakes. Additionally, we describe the first application of non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis for H/T exchange on three different pharmaceuticals by using T2O as isotopic source, demonstrating the applicability to the synthesis of radiotracers.

         <title>Promoting CO2 Electroreduction to Hydrocarbon Products via Sulfur&#8208;Enhanced Proton Feeding in Atomically Precise Thiolate&#8208;Protected Cu Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two model Cu4(MMI)4 and Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 clusters with well&#8208;defined structures and stable low&#8208;coordinated Cu+ species are prepared to explore the synergistic effect of Cu+ and adjacent S site on CO2RR. Cu4(MMI)4 reduce CO2 to deep&#8208;reduced products with a FE of 91.0&#8201;% (including 53.7&#8201;% for CH4) while maintaining remarkable stability. Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 shows a notable preference for C2+ products with a maximum FE of 58.5&#8201;% and a JC2+ of 152.1&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Thiolate&#8208;protected Cu clusters with well&#8208;defined structures and stable low&#8208;coordinated Cu+ species exhibit remarkable potential for the CO2RR and are ideal model catalysts for establishing structure&#8208;electrocatalytic property relationships at the atomic level. However, extant Cu clusters employed in the CO2RR predominantly yield 2e&#8722; products. Herein, two model Cu4(MMI)4 and Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 clusters (MMI=2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole) are prepared to investigate the synergistic effect of Cu+ and adjacent S sites on the CO2RR. Cu4(MMI)4 can reduce CO2 to deep&#8208;reduced products with a 91.0&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (including 53.7&#8201;% for CH4) while maintaining remarkable stability. Conversely, Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 shows a remarkable preference for C2+ products, achieving a maximum FE of 58.5&#8201;% with a C2+ current density of 152.1&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2. In situ XAS and ex situ XPS spectra reveal the preservation of Cu+ species in Cu clusters during CO2RR, extensively enhancing the adsorption capacity of *CO intermediate. Moreover, kinetic analysis and theoretical calculations confirm that S sites facilitate H2O dissociation into *H species, which directly participate in the protonation process on adjacent Cu sites for the protonation of *CO to *CHO. This study highlights the important role of Cu&#8722;S dual sites in Cu clusters and provides mechanistic insights into the CO2RR pathway at the atomic level.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Driven Dynamic Behavior of Nanoconfined Water in Hydrophilic MXene Sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the detailed proton&#8208;driven dynamic behaviors of nanoconfined water between hydrophilic MXene sheets using molecular dynamics simulation based on the active learning potential trained by deep neural network algorithms. These findings have illuminated several novel phenomena including the MXene oxidation rate regulated by protons, the formation of a hexagonal ice phase exhibiting unconventional bonding patterns at room temperature, and a significant reduction in water diffusivity.







Abstract
Liquid water under nanoscale confinement has attracted intensive attention due to its pivotal role in understanding various phenomena across many scientific fields. MXenes serve an ideal paradigm for investigating the dynamic behaviors of nanoconfined water in a hydrophilic environment. Combining deep neural networks and an active learning scheme, here we elucidate the proton&#8208;driven dynamics of water molecules confined between V2CTx sheets using molecular dynamics simulation. Firstly, we have found that the Eigen and Zundel cations can inhibit water&#8208;induced oxidation by adjusting the orientation of water molecules, thus proposing a general antioxidant strategy. Besides, we also identified a hexagonal ice phase with abnormal bonding rules at room temperature, rather than only at ultralow temperatures as other studies reported, and further captured the proton&#8208;induced water phase transition. This highlighted the importance of protons in the maintaining stable crystal phase and phase transition of water. Furthermore, we discussed the conversions of different water structures and water diffusivity with changing proton concentrations in detail. The results provide useful guidance in practical applications of MXenes including developing antioxidant strategies, identifying novel 2D water phases and optimizing energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Enhanced Charge&#8208;Carrier Dynamics and Efficient Photoelectrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion on Antimony Sulfide&#8208;Based Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work integrates a CuSn alloy&#8208;modified CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 photocathode for efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. The photocathode possesses an excellent onset potential of 0.62&#8197;VRHE, achieves the highest ammonia Faraday efficiency of 97.82&#8201;% with a yields up to 16.96&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;VRHE. The excellent charge carrier kinetics and moderate NO2&#8722; adsorption provide an effective strategy for achieving stable and efficient photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
The photoelectrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (PEC NO3RR) has emerged as a promising pathway for facilitating the natural nitrogen cycle. The PEC NO3RR can lower the reduction potential needed for ammonia synthesis through photogenerated voltage, showcasing the significant potential for merging abundant solar energy with sustainable nitrogen fixation. However, it is influenced by the selective photocathodes with poor carrier kinetics, low catalytic selectivity, and ammonia yields. There are few reports on suitable photoelectrodes owning efficient charge transport on PEC NO3RR at low overpotentials. Herein, we rationally constructed the CuSn alloy co&#8208;catalysts on the antimony sulfides with a highly selective PEC ammonia and an ultra&#8208;low onset potential (0.62&#8197;VRHE). CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 photoelectrodes achieved an ammonia faradic efficiency of 97.82&#8201;% at a low applied potential of 0.4&#8197;VRHE, and an ammonia yield of 16.96&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;VRHE under one sun illumination. Dynamics experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 has an enhanced charge separation and transfer efficiency, facilitating photogenerated electrons to participate in PEC NO3RR quickly. Meanwhile, moderate NO2* adsorption on this photocathode optimizes the catalytic activity and increases the NH4+ yield. This work opens an avenue for designing sulfide&#8208;based photocathodes for the efficient route of solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion.

         <title>Enantioconvergent and Site&#8208;Selective Etherification of Carbohydrate Polyols through Chiral Copper Radical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By harnessing a chiral radical copper catalytic system, the challenging enantioconvergent and site&#8208;selective etherification of carbohydrate polyols is achieved. Besides being broadly applicable over a considerable range of sugars, multiple dimensions of stereocontrol can be tackled simultaneously. Remarkably, when anomeric unprotected reducing sugars were employed, dynamic kinetic resolution is further activated to achieve &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation.







Abstract
Going beyond currently reported two electron transformations that formed the core backdrop of asymmetric catalytic site&#8208;selective carbohydrate polyol functionalizations, we herein report a seminal demonstration of an enantioconvergent copper catalyzed site&#8208;selective etherification of minimally protected saccharides through a single&#8208;electron radical pathway. Further, this strategy paves a rare strategy, through which a carboxamide scaffold that is present in some glycomimetics of pharmacological relevance, can be selectively introduced. In light of the burgeoning interest in chiral radical catalysis, and the virtual absence of such stereocontrol broadly in carbohydrate synthesis, our strategy showcased the unknown capability of chiral radical copper catalysis as a contemporary tool to address the formidable site&#8208;selectivity challenge on a remarkable palette of naturally occurring saccharides. When reducing sugars were employed, a further dynamic kinetic resolution type glycosylation can be activated by the catalytic system to selectively generate the challenging &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides.

&lt;p&gt;By harnessing a chiral radical copper catalytic system, the challenging enantioconvergent and site-selective etherification of carbohydrate polyols is achieved. Besides being broadly applicable over a considerable range of sugars, multiple dimensions of stereocontrol can be tackled simultaneously. Remarkably, when anomeric unprotected reducing sugars were employed, dynamic kinetic resolution is further activated to achieve &#946;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation.

         <title>Six&#8208;Membered Ring Directed Assembly of a Zirconium Zeolitic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a new paradigm for zirconium zeolite&#8208;type frameworks through the conversion of extraframework sites in natural zeolite into part of the framework by symmetry&#8208; and size&#8208;matched ring&#8208;directing agent for the size&#8208;exclusion separation of hexane isomers.







Abstract
The synthesis of zirconium MOFs with zeolite net is quite challenging due to the high connectivity of Zr6 clusters, which is far from tetrahedral connection, a requisite for zeolite net. In this work, we demonstrate a six&#8208;membered ring (6MR) strategy through mimicking of mineral zeolites with mixed ditopic and tritopic carboxylate linkers. With this strategy, the ditopic linker cross&#8208;links Zr6 clusters to form 4&#8208;connected zeolite&#8208;like nets, while the tritopic one is used to direct the formation of 6MR and simultaneously consumes extra coordination sites on the cluster. The feasibility of this strategy is shown by one zeolitic metal&#8211;organic framework (NNM&#8208;5) and this strategy has also led to the synthesis of the other dia&#8208;type zirconium MOF (NNM&#8208;6). Interestingly, as the tritopic linker not only directs the formation of 6MR but also partitions 6MR into small segments, NNM&#8208;5 with SOD topology shows a structural feature of small aperture and big cage, which has led to efficient separation of hexane isomers. With both exceptionally high n&#8208;hexane uptake (65.9&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and size&#8208;exclusion selectivity, an exceptional separation capability is verified by breakthrough experiments. Calculation results demonstrate that the large difference of diffusion energy barrier due to the small aperture accounts for the underlying separation mechanism.

         <title>Thienyltriazine Triamides: Thickness Insensitive Interlayer Materials Featuring Fine&#8208;Tuned Optoelectronic and Aggregation Characters for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Every component counts: the optoelectronic properties and aggregation behaviors of thienyltriazine triamides (TTTAs) are precisely regulated through simultaneous core unit, aromatic arm, and pendant polar group engineering. Consequently, the TTTA TT&#8722;N&#8722;M emerges as a universal cathode interlayer (CIL) material for highly efficient organic solar cells with record&#8208;breaking thickness tolerance, ranking it among the top CIL materials ever identified.







Abstract
A novel class of thienyltriazine triamides (TTTAs) was facile synthesized and firstly used as cathode interlayers (CILs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). By utilizing different aromatic arms and pendant polar groups, their optoelectronic properties and aggregation behaviors were effectively modulated. The combination of thienyltriazine (TT) core, naphthylamide arm and imidazole pendant group endows TT&#8722;N&#8722;M with suitable energy levels, intensified work function tunability, higher conductivity, and well&#8208;balanced crystallinity and film&#8208;forming ability, boosting both the performance and stability of OSCs significantly. Remarkably, the solar cell efficiency remains stable at around 90&#8201;% of the optimal efficiency even as the interlayer thickness varied from 5 to 95&#8197;nm, demonstrating its insensitivity to thickness. Moreover, TT&#8722;N&#8722;M exhibits compatibility with various active layer systems, achieving a maximum efficiency of 19.60&#8201;% for single&#8208;junction solar cell. Its exceptional tolerance to thickness fluctuations and performance establishes a new benchmark for multi&#8208;armed CIL&#8208;based OSCs, also positioning them among the most high&#8208;performing CIL materials documented thus far. This work not only broadens the scope of CIL materials for OSCs but also offers deep insights into design strategies and structure&#8208;properties relationships, being beneficial for the future development of more efficient CIL materials for organic optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Type Supra&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Dots with Long Lifetime Photogenerated Radicals Boosting Tumor Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A donor&#8208;acceptor type supra&#8208;CDs has been fabricated by using red emissive CDs as donor and electron&#8208;withdrawing molecule as acceptor. This peculiar donor&#8208;acceptor configuration facilitates the efficient charge separation in supra&#8208;CDs, thereby generating more superoxide radicals and additional holes&#8208;related radicals, which collectively boosts type&#8208;I tumor photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have gained significant interest because of their potential in biomedical applications. Nevertheless, developing CDs with efficient photoinduced charge separation for tumor photodynamic therapy (PDT) remains a challenge. This study presents a novel class of supra&#8208;carbon&#8208;dots (supra&#8208;CDs) developed by fusing red emissive CDs with 2,3&#8208;dicyanohydroquinone (DCHQ) via post&#8208;solvothermal treatment. In supra&#8208;CDs, the core, acting as electron donors, is formed by assembled CDs with substantial sp2 domains, the fused interface originating from DCHQ with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups functions as the electron acceptor. This configuration creates the unique donor&#8208;acceptor nanostructure. Upon white light irradiation, the excited electrons from the assembled CDs were transferred to the electron&#8208;withdrawing interface, whereas the photogenerated holes were retained within the assembled CDs as radicals, leading to effective photoinduced charge separation. The separated photogenerated electrons then react with oxygen to generate superoxide radicals. Simultaneously, the photogenerated holes undergo oxidation of crucial cellular substrates. This dual action underscores the exceptional cell&#8208;killing efficacy of supra&#8208;CDs. Moreover, the increased particle sizes (~20&#8197;nm) ensure supra&#8208;CDs to exhibit a notable capacity for tumor accumulation via the improved permeability and retention effect, thereby achieving satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor PDT efficacy in a mouse subcutaneous tumor model.

         <title>Modulating the Leverage Relationship in Nitrogen Fixation Through Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Regulated Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom molecular catalyst with asymmetric O/N coordination forms hydrogen bonds with H2O to regulate proton transfer, simultaneously achieving superior NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency, and modulating the leverage relationship between activity and selectivity in nitrogen reduction reaction.







Abstract
In the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), a leverage relationship exists between NH3&#8208;producing activity and selectivity because of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which means that high activity with strong protons adsorption causes low product selectivity. Herein, we design a novel metal&#8208;organic hydrogen bonding framework (MOHBF) material to modulate this leverage relationship by a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;regulated proton transfer pathway. The MOHBF material was composited with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to form a Ni&#8208;N2O2 molecular catalyst (Ni&#8208;N2O2/rGO). The unique structure of O atoms in Ni&#8208;O&#8208;C and N&#8208;O&#8208;H could form hydrogen bonds with H2O molecules to interfere with protons being directly adsorbed onto Ni active sites, thus regulating the proton transfer mechanism and slowing the HER kinetics, thereby modulating the leverage relationship. Moreover, this catalyst has abundant Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom sites enriched with Ni&#8208;N/O coordination, conducive to the adsorption and activation of N2. The Ni&#8208;N2O2/rGO exhibits simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity of NH3 production with a maximum NH3 yield rate of 209.7&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 45.7&#8201;%, outperforming other reported single&#8208;atom NRR catalysts.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Photodetection by Zero&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Indium&#8208;Halide with Minimal Structural Distortion and Reduced Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photovoltaic challenges of 0D hybrid halides are addressed by tetragonal C24H72N8In2Br14, featuring closely spaced [InBr6]3&#8722; octahedra and [InBr4]&#8722; tetrahedra linked by anion bridging and vacancies, facilitating a reduced direct band gap with enhanced carrier mobility, enabling visible light photodetection with responsivity of ~10&#8197;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 under 3&#8197;V at 485&#8197;nm wavelength, and ~81.2&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 with ~7&#215;109 Jones detectivity in self&#8208;powered mode.







Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;inspired zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid halides exhibit impressive light emission properties; however, their potential in photovoltaics is hindered by the absence of interconnection between the inorganic polyhedra, leading to acute radiative recombination and insufficient charge separation. We demonstrate that incorporating closely&#8208;spaced dissimilar polyhedral units with minimal structural distortion leads to a remarkable enhancement in visible&#8208;light photodetection capability. We designed 0D C24H72N8In2Br14 (HIB) with a tetragonal crystal system, replacing the Cs+ of Cs2InBr5.H2O (CIB) with 1,6&#8208;hexanediammonium (HDA) cation. HIB comprises [InBr6]3&#8722; octahedra, and [InBr4]&#8722; tetrahedra units spaced 3.9&#8197;&#197; apart by the HDA linker. The [InBr4]&#8722; unit is additionally linked to HDA via intercalated bromine through hydrogen and halogen bonding interactions, respectively. This structural arrangement lowers the dielectric confinement, thereby enhancing carrier density and mobility, and increasing the diffusion coefficient compared to CIB. With 3.6&#8201;% bromine vacancy within the [InBr4]&#8722; block, mid&#8208;gap states are created, reducing the direct band gap to 2.19&#8197;eV. HIB demonstrates an unprecedently high responsivity of 9975.9&#177;201.6&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 under 3&#8197;V potential bias at 485&#8197;nm wavelength, among low&#8208;dimensional hybrid halides. In the absence of potential bias, the self&#8208;powered photodetection parameters are 81.2&#177;3.0&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 and (6.98&#177;0.21)&#215;109 Jones.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioconvergent Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Etherification of Phenols by Allylation to Access Chiral C(sp3)&#8722;O Allyl Aryl Ethers</title>

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed etherification of phenols with regioisomeric mixtures of racemic silylated and germylated allylic chlorides enables the enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent formation of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted chiral allylic aryl ethers as a single regioisomer (see Scheme). Key to success is the metalloid moiety governing the regioselectivity, and these highly functionalized allylic ethers can subsequently undergo chemoselective chemical modifications.







Abstract
An enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent allylation of phenols under nickel catalysis with an &#945;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;regioisomeric mixture of racemic silylated/germylated allylic chlorides is reported. The silyl/germyl group governs the regioselectivity, and the transformation affords enantiomerically enriched unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allyl aryl ethers with excellent regiocontrol in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, no nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;O bond activation is observed at room temperature. The synthetic value of these densely functionalized silicon&#8208;containing building blocks is demonstrated in a series of chemoselective transformations, including a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement for the construction of an &#945;&#8208;chiral silane.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Swelling Microporous Membrane for High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8722;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cation&#8208;exchange membrane made from rigid polymers was developed for Zn&#8722;I2 batteries. It shows high ion selectivity, suppressing the I2 cathode shuttle effect. Abundant sulfonate groups in the membrane ensure uniform Zn2+ flux on the anode. Additionally, the membrane's microporosity allows pre&#8208;adsorption of active materials, boosting battery capacity to 287&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Overall, the battery exhibits high stability and capacity over 10,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8722;I2) batteries are gaining popularity due to cost&#8208;effectiveness and ease of manufacturing. However, challenges like polyiodide shuttle effect and Zn dendrite growth hinder their practical application. Here, we report a cation exchange membrane to simultaneously prevent the polyiodide shuttle effect and regulate Zn2+ deposition. Comprised of rigid polymers, this membrane shows superior swelling resistance and ion selectivity compared to commercial Nafion. The resulting Zn&#8722;I2 battery exhibits a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4&#8201;% and low self&#8208;discharge rate of 4.47&#8201;% after 48&#8197;h rest. By directing a uniform Zn2+ flux, the membrane promotes a homogeneous electric field, resulting in a dendrite&#8208;free Zn surface. Moreover, its microporous structure enables pre&#8208;adsorption of additional active materials prior to battery assembly, boosting battery capacity to 287&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. At 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the battery exhibits a steady running for 10,000&#8197;cycles with capacity retention up to 96.1&#8201;%, demonstrating high durability of the membrane. The practicality of the membrane is validated via a high&#8208;loading (35&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) pouch cell with impressive cycling stability, paving a way for membrane design towards advanced Zn&#8722;I2 batteries.

         <title>Highly Durable Inverted Inorganic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells Enabled by Multifunctional Additives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two multifunctional additives of AQS&#8201;:&#8201;FPMA and AQS&#8201;:&#8201;FPEA are developed to suppress the voltage loss of inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells of 1.78&#8197;eV and construct highly efficient and durable inverted inorganic perovskite/organic tandem solar cells. The formation of AQS&#8208;involved intermediate phase regulate the crystalliztaion rate resulting in lower defects of inorganic perovskites. Moreover, the benchmark of T90 lifetime of perovskite/organic tandem solar cells under MPPT can be promoted to 1000&#8197;h, which will facilitate the real&#8208;world deployment.







Abstract
Inverted perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (P/O TSCs) suffer from poor long&#8208;term device stability due to halide segregation in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid wide&#8208;band gap (WBG) perovskites, which hinders their practical deployment. Therefore, developing all&#8208;inorganic WBG perovskites for incorporation into P/O TSCs is a promising strategy because of their superior stability under continuous illumination. However, these inorganic WBG perovskites also face some critical issues, including rapid crystallization, phase instability, and large energy loss, etc. To tackle these issues, two multifunctional additives based on 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (AQS) are developed to regulate the perovskite crystallization by mediating the intermediate phases and suppress the halide segregation through the redox&#8208;shuttle effect. By coupling with organic cations having the desirable functional groups and dipole moments, these additives can effectively passivate the defects and adjust the alignment of interface energy levels. Consequently, a record Voc approaching 1.3&#8197;V with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.59&#8201;% could be achieved in a 1.78&#8197;eV band gap single&#8208;junction inverted all&#8208;inorganic PSC. More importantly, the P/O TSC derived from this cell demonstrates a T90 lifetime of 1000&#8197;h under continuous operation, presenting the most stable P/O TSCs reported so far.

To tackle these issues, two multifunctional additives based on 9,10-anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid (AQS) are developed to regulate the perovskite crystallization by mediating the intermediate phases and suppress the halide segregation through the redox-shuttle effect. By coupling with organic cations having the desirable functional groups and dipole moments, these additives can effectively passivate the defects and adjust the alignment of interface energy levels. Consequently, a record &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; approaching 1.3&#8197;V with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.59&#8201;% could be achieved in a 1.78&#8197;eV band gap single-junction inverted all-inorganic PSC. More importantly, the P/O TSC derived from this cell demonstrates a &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; lifetime of 1000&#8197;h under continuous operation, presenting the most stable P/O TSCs reported so far.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Selective Production of C2+ Oxygenates from CO2 in Strongly Acidic Condition by Rough Ag&#8208;Cu Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;into&#8208;C2+ oxygenates conversion in strongly acidic conditions (pH=0.75) can be greatly boosted over a Ag&#8722;Cu alloy catalyst with high surface roughness.







Abstract
The acidic electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) oxygenates is of great importance in view of enhancing carbon utilization efficiency and generating products with high energy densities, but suffering from low selectivity and activity. Herein, we synthesized Ag&#8722;Cu alloy catalyst with highly rough surface, by which the selectivity to C2+ oxygenates can be greatly improved. In a strongly acidic condition (pH=0.75), the maximum C2+ products Faradaic efficiency (FE) and C2+ oxygenates FE reach 80.4&#8201;% and 56.5&#8201;% at &#8722;1.9&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, with a ratio of FEC2+ oxygenates to FEethylene up to 2.36. At this condition, the C2+ oxygenates partial current density is as high as 480&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The in situ spectra, control experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the high generation of C2+ oxygenates over the catalyst originates from its large surface roughness and Ag alloying.

         <title>A Novel Anion Receptor Additive for &#8208;40&#186;C&#160;Sodium Metal&#160;Batteries&#160;by Anion/Cation Solvation Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium metal batteries, known for their high theoretical specific capacity, abundant reserves,&#160;and promising&#160;low&#8208;temperature performance, have garnered significant attention. However, the large ionic radius of Na+&#160;and sluggish transport kinetics across the interfacial structure hinder their practical application.&#160;Previous reviews have rarely regulated electrolyte performance from the perspective of anions; as important components of the electrolyte, the regulation mechanism is not well understood. Herein, a novel anion receptor additive, 4&#8208;aminophenylboronic acid pinalol ester (ABAPE), is proposed to weaken the coupling between anions and cations and accelerate&#160;Na+&#160;transport kinetics.&#160;The results of theoretical calculations and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy with deep Ar&#8208;ion etching demonstrate that&#160;the introduction of this additive alters the solvation structure of Na+, reduces&#160;the desolvation barrier and forms&#160;a stable and dense electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, ABAPE forms hydrogen bonds (&#8211;NH&#183;&#183;&#183;O/F) with H2O/HF, effectively preventing the hydrolysis of NaPF6&#160;and stabilizing acidic species. Consequently, the Na||Na symmetric cell exhibits excellent long&#8208;cycle performance of 500 h at 1 mA cm&#8208;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8208;2. The Na||Na3V2(PO4)3&#160;(NVP) full cell with the addition of ABAPE maintains a capacity retention of 84.29% at 1 C after&#160;1200 cycles and presents no capacity decay&#160;over 150 cycles at &#8208;40&#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Upcycling of Polyamide Wastes to Tertiary Amines Using Mo Single Atoms and Rh Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of sustainable practices through the chemical recycling of polyamide wastes holds significant potential, particularly in enabling the recovery of a range of nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds. Herein, we report a novel strategy to upcycle polyamide wastes to tertiary amines with assistance of H2 in acetic acid under mild conditions (e.g., 180 &#186;C), which is achieved over anatase TiO2 supported Mo single atoms and Rh nanoparticles. In this protocol, the polyamide is first converted into diacetamide intermediates via acidolysis, which are subsequent hydrogenated into corresponding carboxylic acid monomers and tertiary amines in 100% selectivity. It is verified that Mo single atom and Rh nanoparticles work together to activate both amide bonds of the diacetamide intermediate, and synergistically catalyze its hydrodeoxygenation to form tertiary amine, but this catalyst is ineffective for hydrogenation of carboxylic acid. This work presents an effective way to reconstruct various polyamide wastes into tertiary amines and carboxylic acids, which may have promising application potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Linkable Fullerene Electron Transport Layer with Internal Encapsulation Capability for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A stable and compact fullerene electron transport layer (ETL) is crucial for high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, traditional fullerene&#8208;based ETLs like C60 and PCBM are prone to aggregate under operational conditions, a challenge recently recognized by academic and industrial researchers. Here, we designed and synthesized a novel cross&#8208;linkable fullerene molecule, bis((3&#8208;methyloxetan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methyl) malonate&#8208;C60 monoadduct (BCM), for use as an ETL in PSCs. Upon a low&#8208;temperature annealing at 100 &#176;C, BCM undergoes in&#8208;situ cross&#8208;linking to form a robust cross&#8208;linked BCM (CBCM) film, which demonstrates excellent electron mobility and a suitable band structure for efficient PSCs. Our results show that PSCs incorporating CBCM&#8208;based ETL achieve an impressive efficiency of 25.89% (certified: 25.36%), significantly surpassing the 23.25% efficiency of PCBM&#8208;based devices. The intramolecular covalent interactions within CBCM films effectively prevent aggregation and enhance film compactness, creating an internal encapsulation layer that mitigates the decomposition and ion migration of perovskite components. Consequently, CBCM&#8208;based PSCs show exceptional stability, maintaining 97.8% of their initial efficiency after 1000 hours of maximum power point tracking, compared to only 78.6% retention in PCBM&#8208;based devices after less than 820 hours.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution with alkyl and heteroaryl carbon nucleophiles has been well&#8208;established. However, the asymmetric allylic arylation of acyclic internal alkenes with aryl nucleophiles remains challenging and underdeveloped. Herein we report a stereospecific 3&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement interrupted asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization (Int&#8208;AASI) that enables asymmetric allylic arylation. By means of this stepwise strategy, both enantioenriched allylic arylation products and axially chiral alkenes could be readily obtained in high enantioselectivities. Experimental studies support a mechanism involving a cascade of asymmetric allylic amination, stereospecific aryl 3&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement and alkene isomerization. Density functional theory studies detailed the reasons of achieving the high chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, stereoselectivity and stereospecificity, respectively.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of non&#8208;copper&#8208;based materials for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with high selectivity at large current density is highly desirable, but still a great challenge. Herein, we report iron group metal ions of M2+ (M = Fe, Co, or Ni)&#8208;doped amorphous/crystalline SnSe/SnSe2nanorod/nanosheet hierarchical structures (a/c&#8208;SnSe/SnSe2) for selective CO2 electroreduction to ethanol. Iron group metal ions doping induces multiple active sites at the interface of M2+&#8208;doped SnSe/SnSe2 p&#8208;n heterojunction, which strengthens *CO intermediate binding for further C&#8722;C coupling to eventual ethanol generation. As a representative, Fe9.0%&#8208;a/c&#8208;SnSe/SnSe2 exhibits an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 62.7% and a partial current density of 239.0 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.6 V in a flow cell. Moreover, it can output an ethanol Faradaic efficiency of 63.5% and a partial current density of 201.2 mA cm&#8722;2 with a full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 24.1% at 3.0 V in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. This work provides insight into non&#8208;Cu based catalyst design for stabilizing the key intermediates for selective ethanol production from CO2 electroreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Single  Molecular Dispersion of Crown Ether&#8208;Decorated Cobalt Phthalocyanineon Carbon Nanotubes for Robust CO2 Reduction through Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immobilizing molecular catalysts on electro&#8208;conductive supports (for example, multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes, CNTs) represent a promising way to well&#8208;defined catalyst/support interfaces, which has shown appreciable performance for catalytic transformation. However, their full potential is far from achieved due to insufficient utilization of the intrinsic activity for each immobilized molecular catalyst, especially at loadings that should allow decent current densities. In the present work, we discover host&#8208;guest interaction between tetra&#8208;crown ether substituted cobalt phthalocyanine and metal ions, for example K+ ions, not only eliminate catalyst aggregation at immobilization procedures but also reinforce catalyst/support interactions by additional electrostatic attractions under operational conditions. Through simple dip&#8208;coating procedures, a successful single&#8208;molecular dispersion is achieved. Such a catalyst/electrode interface is stable and can selectively catalyze CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion (&#65310;96%) with almost unchanged turnover frequency (TOF) at all loading conditions, which implies a full utilization of the intrinsic activity of supported molecular catalysts. Therefore, a simultaneous achievement of high TOF and high current density (TOF of 111 s&#8208;1 at 38 mA/cm2) is achieved, in an aqueous H&#8208;type electrolyzer at an overpotential of 570 mV.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery, Total Synthesis, and Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Evaluation of Naturally Occurring Naphthopyrone&#8208;Macrolide Hybrids as Potent NLRP3 Inflammasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, gymnoasins A&#8208;C, were discovered from an Antarctic fungus, and biomimetic asymmetric synthesis of gymnoasin A was achieved. Gymnoasin A significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, providing a valuable new drug lead for the development of novel therapeutics targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome.







Abstract
Numerous clinical disorders have been linked to the etiology of dysregulated NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain&#8208;containing protein 3) inflammasome activation. Despite its potential as a pharmacological target, modulation of NLRP3 activity remains challenging. Only a sparse number of compounds have been reported that can modulate NLRP3 and none of them have been developed into a commercially available drug. In this research, we identified three potent NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, gymnoasins A&#8208;C (1&#8211;3), with unprecedented pentacyclic scaffolds, from an Antarctic fungus Pseudogymnoascus sp. HDN17&#8208;895, which represent the first naturally occurring naphthopyrone&#8208;macrolide hybrids. Additionally, biomimetic synthesis of gymnoasin A (1) was also achieved validating the chemical structure and affording ample amounts of material for exhaustive bioactivity assessments. Biological assays indicated that 1 could significantly inhibited in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome activation and in vivo pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine IL&#8208;1&#946; release, representing a valuable new lead compound for the development of novel therapeutics with the potential to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome.

         <title>Photocatalytic Direct Para&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Amination of Benzyl Alcohols: Selectivity Independent of Side Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H amination of benzyl alcohols whose reactivity and site selectivity are independent of existing side substituents is disclosed.







Abstract
Aminoarenes are important molecules for broad applications in nearly all modern industries that involve chemicals. Direct and site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond amination of arenes provides the most efficient and convenient method to prepare aminoarenes. A main challenge is to selectively install the amino group (or other functional groups) to the distal para&#8208;carbon of arenes (especially multi&#8208;substituted arenes) during the C&#8722;H bond functionalization events. Herein, we address this problem by designing a new strategy via a sequential radical dearomatization/radical amination/rearomatization process for para&#8208;selective amination of benzyl alcohols. The para&#8208;selectivity of our reaction is completely independent of the electronic and steric properties of the other substituents of the arene substrates. Aminoarenes with many substituents (up to full substitution) and diverse substitution patterns, including those difficult to synthesize previously, could be readily prepared using our protocols. Further exploration of the current strategy shall lead to other challenging C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes.

         <title>In vivo Metabolic Sensing of Hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]Pyruvate in Mice Using a Recyclable Perfluorinated Iridium Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperpolarization enhances pyruvate signal, enabling real&#8208;time metabolic flux monitoring by MRI. Our study presents a novel method, achieving a 22% increase in hyperpolarized in [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate's enhancement using Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) with a perfluorinated Iridium catalyst in a fluorinated solvent/methanol blend. This catalyst enables easy separation from hyperpolarized pyruvate, ensuring biocompatibility and recyclability, and allowing in vivo metabolic sensing in human pancreatic xenografts.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time visualization of metabolic processes in vivo provides crucial insights into conditions like cancer and metabolic disorders. Metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), by amplifying the signal of pyruvate molecules through hyperpolarization, enables non&#8208;invasive monitoring of metabolic fluxes, aiding in understanding disease progression and treatment response. Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) presents a simpler, cost&#8208;effective alternative to dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization, eliminating the need for expensive equipment and complex procedures. We present the first in vivo demonstration of metabolic sensing in a human pancreatic cancer xenograft model compared to healthy mice. A novel perfluorinated Iridium SABRE catalyst in a fluorinated solvent and methanol blend facilitated this breakthrough with a 1.2&#8208;fold increase in [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate SABRE hyperpolarization. The perfluorinated moiety allowed easy separation of the heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;containing catalyst from the hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate target. The perfluorinated catalyst exhibited recyclability, maintaining SABRE&#8208;SHEATH activity through subsequent hyperpolarization cycles with minimal activity loss after the initial two cycles. Remarkably, the catalyst retained activity for at least 10&#8197;cycles, with a 3.3&#8208;fold decrease in hyperpolarization potency. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study encourages wider adoption of SABRE hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate MR for studying in vivo metabolism, aiding in diagnosing stages and monitoring treatment responses in cancer and other diseases.

         <title>Harnessing Ion&#8208;Dipole Interactions for Water&#8208;Lean Solvation Chemistry: Achieving High&#8208;Stability Zn Anodes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate with high permanent dipole moments effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, forming a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+ and improved interfacial characteristics of electrodes, thus improving the Zn plating/stripping reversibility.







Abstract
The reversibility and stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are largely limited by water&#8208;induced interfacial parasitic reactions. Here, dimethyl(3,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2&#8208;oxoheptyl)phosphonate (DP) is introduced to tailor primary solvation sheath and inner&#8208;Helmholtz configurations for robust zinc anode. Informed by theoretical guidance on solvation process, DP with high permanent dipole moments can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8208;dipolar interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Thus, interfacial side reactions can be suppressed through a shielding effect. Meanwhile, lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of DP also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Thus, these merits endow the Zn anode with a high&#8208;stability performance exceeds 3800&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Zn batteries and a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% at 4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Zn||Cu batteries. Benefiting from the stable zinc anode, the Zn||NH4V4O10 cell maintains 80.3&#8201;% of initial discharge capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and exhibits a high retention rate of 99.4&#8201;% against to the initial capacity during the self&#8208;discharge characterizations.

         <title>C&#8722;S&#8208;Selective Stille&#8208;Coupling Enables Stereodefined Alkene Synthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
A highly C&#8722;S&#8208;selective Stille&#8208;coupling between aryl thianthrenium salts and tri&#8208; or tetrasubstituted alkenyl stannanes is described, which provides an expedient route to the preparation of polysubstituted alkenes in a stereoretentive manifold.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly C&#8722;S&#8208;selective Stille cross&#8208;coupling between aryl thianthrenium salts and tri&#8208; or tetrasubstituted alkenyl stannanes is described. Herein, critical challenges including site&#8208; and chemoselectivity control are well addressed through C&#8722;H thianthrenation and C&#8722;S alkenylation, thereby providing an expedient access to stereodefined tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted alkenes in a stereoretentive fashion. Indeed, the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Stille&#8208;alkenylation of poly(pseudo)halogenated arenes displays privileged capability to differentiate C&#8722;S over C&#8722;I, C&#8722;Br, C&#8722;Cl bonds, as well as oxygen&#8208;based triflates (C&#8722;OTf), tosylates (C&#8722;OTs), carbamates and sulfamates under mild reaction conditions. Sequential and multiple cross&#8208;couplings via selective C&#8722;X functionalization should be widely applicable for increasing functional molecular complexity. Modular installation of stereospecific alkene motifs into pharmaceuticals illustrated the synthetic application of the present protocol in drug discovery.

         <title>Deciphering Pauling's Third Rule: Uncovering Strong Anharmonicity and Exceptionally Low Thermal Conductivity in TlAgSe for Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pauling's third empirical rule, which deals with the cationic repulsion due to proximity in the face or edge shared polyhedra in a crystal structure, can provide structural instability required to suppress the lattice thermal conductivity. TlAgSe shows low lattice thermal conductivity and promising thermoelectric performance due to strong anharmonicity and correlated atomic rattling because of Pauling's third rule.







Abstract
The elucidation of chemical bonding, coupled with an exploration of the correlated dynamics of constituent atoms, is essential for unravelling the underlying mechanism responsible for low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;L) exhibited by a crystalline solid, which is essential for thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings. In this regard, Pauling's third empirical rule, which deals with the cationic repulsion due to proximity in the face or edge shared polyhedra in a crystal structure, can bring about the lattice instability required to suppress the &#954;L. Here, we demonstrate the presence of such instability in a ternary selenide, TlAgSe, leading to a ultra&#8208;low &#954;L of 0.17&#8197;W/m.K at 573&#8197;K. Our study reveals the instability arising from Ag&#8722;Ag repulsion within edge&#8208;shared AgSe4 tetrahedra through investigation of the local structure using synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and supported by first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations. We observe correlation between weakening in the Ag and the Tl&#8208;sublattice, providing direct experimental evidence of Pauling's third empirical rule. The correlated rattling of Ag and Tl induces a highly anharmonic lattice and low energy optical phonons, resulting in suppressed sound velocity and ultralow &#954;L in TlAgSe. The electronic origin of soft and anharmonic lattice is the presence of filled antibonding states in the valence band near the Fermi level constructed by Ag(4d)&#8722;Se(4p) and Tl(6s)&#8722;Se(4p) interactions. This work demonstrates that the evidence of dynamic distortion in a crystal lattice is governed by the third empirical rule given by Pauling, which can act as a potential new strategy for diminishing &#954;L in crystalline solids.

         <title>Alder&#8208;Ene Reaction&#8208;Mediated Suppression of Tin(II) Oxidation for Efficient Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzaldehyde oxime is introduced into the mixed Sn&#8722;Pb perovskite precursor to inhibit the oxidation of Sn(II), which can also regulate the crystallization and improve the electronic structure of the perovskite film, ultimately resulting in enhanced long&#8208;term stability and performance of devices.







Abstract
Despite numerous studies have reported the inhibition of tin (II) oxidation in mixed tin&#8208;lead halide perovskite, there remains a dearth of mechanistic information regarding how tin (II) undergoes oxidation in the precursor solution, particularly in terms of the involvement of DMSO. We here take advantage of density functional theory (DFT) to uncover that SnI2 can coordinate with DMSO and react with singlet oxygen, resulting in the generation of Sn (IV). Moreover, our DFT simulations reveal that benzaldehyde oxime (BZHO) competes with SnI2 in reacting with oxygen through the Alder&#8208;ene reaction, hence effectively restraining the oxidation of tin (II), which is further verified by several experimental characterizations. Besides, the introduction of BZHO has also regulated the crystallization of the perovskite film and modified the electronic structure of the perovskite surface. As a result, the perovskite solar cells with the addition of BZHO demonstrate superior performance and operational stability, retaining 82&#8201;% of the initial PCE under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination for 800&#8197;hours. Furthermore, the efficiency of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells treated with BZHO reached 26.76&#8201;%. Therefore, this work presents a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;performance and stable all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.

In this study, we developed a new strategy for carbon aerogel generation by cross&#8208;linking biomass bits with zinc ionic glue. Zn2+ ions as the glue cleavage cellulose hydrogen bonds of natural biomass, then facilitate dehydration crosslinking reaction between cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin for re&#8208;constructing the whole block structure. This strategy provides a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective way for large&#8208;scale preparation and application of aerogel materials, which will open up a range of applications relevant to extraction separation, catalysis, insulation, and other fields.







Abstract
Carbon aerogels (CAs) have garnered significant attention due to their multifunctional applications. Biomass waste, abundantly generated by agriculture and industry, serves as a primary carbon source. However, developing a facile, sustainable, and efficient method to produce CAs from biomass waste remains challenging. In this study, a one&#8208;step Zn2+ ion&#8208;glue&#8208;assisted carbonization technique was developed to produce large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance CAs. Various biomass materials (wood bits, peanut shells, bamboo bits, and straw waste) were treated in a molten salt system (ZnCl2/KCl) at 300&#8201;&#176;C for 2&#8197;h to obtain large&#8208;block CAs derived from biomass bits. Zn2+ ions cleave cellulose hydrogen bonds in natural biomass, facilitating the dehydration crosslinking reaction among cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, thus reconstructing the entire block structure. The resulting CAs exhibited high porosity (95&#8201;%) and low density (0.078&#8197;g/cm3). Numerous hydroxyl and carbonyl groups were preserved during the low&#8208;temperature treatment, facilitating chemical modification for diverse applications. For instance, amidoxime functionalized CAs were utilized as filters for selective and highly efficient extraction of U(VI) from wastewater. The adsorption capacity and extraction efficiency reached 801.2&#8197;mg/g and 95&#8201;% with a flux rate of 6.1&#215;103&#8197;L/m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h.

         <title>A Photocaged Microtubule&#8208;Stabilising Epothilone Allows Spatiotemporal Control of Cytoskeletal Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocaged epothilone has been developed to fill the unmet need for a high&#8208;performance optically triggered microtubule (MT) stabiliser. A one&#8208;pot synthesis from commercial epothilone delivered CouEpo, whose 100&#8208;fold bioactivity turn&#8208;on upon visible&#8208;light photouncaging led to sub&#8208;nanomolar potency, allowing high spatial and temporal resolution control of MT structure and dynamics in live cells during GFP imaging.







Abstract
The cytoskeleton is essential for spatial and temporal organisation of a wide range of cellular and tissue&#8208;level processes, such as proliferation, signalling, cargo transport, migration, morphogenesis, and neuronal development. Cytoskeleton research aims to study these processes by imaging, or by locally manipulating, the dynamics and organisation of cytoskeletal proteins with high spatiotemporal resolution: which matches the capabilities of optical methods. To date, no photoresponsive microtubule&#8208;stabilising tool has united all the features needed for a practical high&#8208;precision reagent: a low potency and biochemically stable non&#8208;illuminated state; then an efficient, rapid, and clean photoresponse that generates a high potency illuminated state; plus good solubility at suitable working concentrations; and efficient synthetic access. We now present CouEpo, a photocaged epothilone microtubule&#8208;stabilising reagent that combines these needs. Its potency increases approximately 100&#8208;fold upon irradiation by violet/blue light to reach low&#8208;nanomolar values, allowing efficient photocontrol of microtubule dynamics in live cells, and even the generation of cellular asymmetries in microtubule architecture and cell dynamics. CouEpo is thus a high&#8208;performance tool compound that can support high&#8208;precision research into many microtubule&#8208;associated processes, from biophysics to transport, cell motility, and neuronal physiology.

         <title>Enzyme Machinery for Bacterial Glucoside Metabolism through a Conserved Non&#8208;hydrolytic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;hydrolytic pathway of glucoside conversion in four steps is widely conserved in bacteria and is encoded from a discrete genomic locus (GUL). The GUL pathways involve metallocenter lyases that cleave C3&#8208;oxidized glucosides with broad specificity and hydrate the resulting glycal elimination product. The structural and mechanistic basis for these reactions is presented, and GUL genomic diversity in bacteria is explored.







Abstract
The flexible acquisition of substrates from nutrient pools is critical for microbes to prevail in competitive environments. To acquire glucose from diverse glycoside and disaccharide substrates, many free&#8208;living and symbiotic bacteria have developed, alongside hydrolysis, a non&#8208;hydrolytic pathway comprised of four biochemical steps and conferred from a single glycoside utilization gene locus (GUL). Mechanistically, this pathway integrates within the framework of oxidation and reduction at the glucosyl/glucose C3, the eliminative cleavage of the glycosidic bond and the addition of water in two consecutive lyase&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Here, based on study of enzymes from the phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, we reveal a conserved Mn2+ metallocenter active site in both lyases and identify the structural requirements for specific catalysis to elimination of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucosides and water addition to the resulting 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;keto&#8208;glycal product, yielding 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucose. Extending our search of GUL&#8208;encoded putative lyases to the human gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, we discover a Ca2+ metallocenter active site in a putative glycoside hydrolase&#8208;like protein and demonstrate its catalytic function in the eliminative cleavage of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucosides of opposite (&#945;) anomeric configuration as preferred by the A. tumefaciens enzyme (&#946;). Structural and biochemical comparisons reveal the molecular&#8208;mechanistic origin of 3&#8208;keto&#8208;glucoside lyase stereo&#8208;complementarity. Our findings identify a basic set of GUL&#8208;encoded lyases for glucoside metabolism and assign physiological significance to GUL genetic diversity in the bacterial domain of life.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Silylene&#8208;Supported Aluminium Atoms with Aluminylene and Alane Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient aluminylene intermediate supported by a pincer bis&#8208;silylene ligand is proposed to form from the reduction of its iodide precursor. It rapidly dimerizes in a [2+2] cycloaddition to give the isolable Si2Al2 heterocycle. In the presence of Fe0, the aluminylene can be stabilized as a dative AlI&#8594;Fe0 type complex. The Fe0&#8208;aluminylene complex transforms in solution to foster a silylene&#8208; and aluminylene&#8208;coordinated Fe0 complex.







Abstract
The suitability of electron&#8208;rich bis&#8208;silylenes, specifically the neutral chelating [SiII(Xant)SiII] ligand (SiII=PhC(NtBu)2Si, Xant=9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) and the anionic [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]&#8722; pincer ligand (NAcrid=2,7,9,9&#8208;tetramethylacridane), has been successfully probed to stabilize monovalent bis&#8208;silylene&#8208;supported aluminium complexes (aluminylenes). At first, the unprecedented aluminium(III) iodide precursors [SiII(Xant)SiII]AlI2+ I&#8722; 1 and [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]AlI2 2 were synthesized using AlI3 and [SiII(Xant)SiII] or [SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Li(OEt2)], respectively, and structurally characterized. While reduction of 1 with KC8 led merely to unidentified products, the dehalogenation of 2 afforded the dimer of the desired {[SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Al:} aluminylene with a four&#8208;membered SiIV2AlIII2 ring. Remarkably, the proposed aluminylene intermediates [SiII(Xant)SiII]AlII and {[SiII(NAcrid)SiII)]Al:} could be produced through reaction of 1 and 2 with Collman's reagent, K2Fe(CO)4, and trapped as AlI:&#8594;Fe(CO)4 complexes 5 and 6, respectively. While 6 is stable in solution, 5 loses one CO ligand in solution to afford the silylene&#8208; and aluminylene&#8208;coordinated iron(0) complex 7 from an intramolecular substitution reaction. The electronic structures of the novel compounds were investigated by Density Functional Theory calculations.

&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; were synthesized using AlI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and [Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(Xant)Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;] or [Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(N&lt;sub&gt;Acrid&lt;/sub&gt;)Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;)]Li(OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)], respectively, and structurally characterized. While reduction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; led merely to unidentified products, the dehalogenation of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; afforded the dimer of the desired {[Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(N&lt;sub&gt;Acrid&lt;/sub&gt;)Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;)]Al:} aluminylene with a four-membered Si&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ring. Remarkably, the proposed aluminylene intermediates [Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(Xant)Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;]Al&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;I and {[Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(N&lt;sub&gt;Acrid&lt;/sub&gt;)Si&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;)]Al:} could be produced through reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with Collman's reagent, K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and trapped as Al&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;:&#8594;Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complexes &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. While &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; is stable in solution, &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; loses one CO ligand in solution to afford the silylene- and aluminylene-coordinated iron(0) complex &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; from an intramolecular substitution reaction. The electronic structures of the novel compounds were investigated by Density Functional Theory calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Recognition in Mechanochemistry: Insights from Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemically&#8208;induced molecular recognition processes have been studied by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy using &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA), serine, and alanine as representative substrates. To disentangle different mechanochemical effects, a mixer mill and a resonant acoustic mixer were applied as mixing devices.







Abstract
Molecular&#8208;recognition events are highly relevant in biology and chemistry. In the present study, we investigated such processes in the solid state under mechanochemical conditions using the formation of racemic phases upon reacting enantiopure entities as example. As test systems, &#945;&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)lactic acid (TFLA) and the amino acids serine and alanine were used. The effects of ball&#8208;milling and resonant acoustic mixing (RAM) on the formation of racemic phases were probed by using solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In a mixer mill, a highly efficient and fast racemic phase formation occurred for both TFLA and the two amino acids. RAM led to the racemic phase for TFLA also, and this process was facilitated upon employing pre&#8208;milled enantiopure entities. In contrast, under comparable conditions RAM did not result in the formation of racemic phases for serine and alanine.

         <title>Highly Tough Slide&#8208;Crosslinked Gel Polymer Electrolyte for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) was meticulously designed and prepared for lithium metal batteries. The incorporation of the slide&#8208;ring structure endows SCGPE with excellent toughness and superior electrochemical properties. This structure provides fast Li+ ion transport pathways while restricting the mobility of TFSI&#8722; anions, thereby promoting uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) hold great promise for the practical application of lithium metal batteries. However, conventional GPEs hardly resists lithium dendrites growth and maintains long&#8208;term cycling stability of the battery due to its poor mechanical performance. Inspired by the slide&#8208;ring structure of polyrotaxanes (PRs), herein we developed a dynamic slide&#8208;crosslinked gel polymer electrolyte (SCGPE) with extraordinary stretchability of 970.93&#8201;% and mechanical strength of 1.15&#8197;MPa, which is helpful to buffer the volume change of electrodes and maintain mechanical integrity of the battery structure during cycling. Notably, the PRs structures can provide fast ion transport channels to obtain high ionic conductivity of 1.73&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the strong polar groups in SCGPE restrict the free movement of anions to achieve high lithium&#8208;ion transference number of 0.71, which is favorable to enhance Li+ transport dynamics and induce uniform Li+ deposition. Benefiting from these features, the constructed Li|SCGPE&#8208;3|LFP cells exhibit ultra&#8208;long and stable cycle life over 1000 cycles and high&#8208;capacity retention (89.6&#8201;% after 1000 cycles). Even at a high rate of 16&#8197;C, the cells deliver a high capacity of 79.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The slide&#8208;crosslinking strategy in this work provides a new perspective on the design of advanced GPEs for LMBs.

         <title>Hexa&#8208;atom Pt Catalyst Fabricated by a Ligand Engineering Strategy for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an atomically precise supported Pt6 nanocluster catalyst (Pt6/OCNT) was designed by the ligand engineering strategy. The well&#8208;defined Pt6/OCNT, with fully exposed Pt sites and unique electronic structures, showed superior acidic hydrogen oxidation performance with the highest mass activity compared to those of the corresponding Pt SAC (Pt1/OCNT) and Pt/C.







Abstract
Atomically precise supported nanocluster catalysts (APSNCs), which feature exact atomic composition, well&#8208;defined structures, and unique catalytic properties, offer an exceptional platform for understanding the structure&#8208;performance relationship at the atomic level. However, fabricating APSNCs with precisely controlled and uniform metal atom numbers, as well as maintaining a stable structure, remains a significant challenge due to uncontrollable dispersion and easy aggregation during synthetic and catalytic processes. Herein, we developed an effective ligand engineering strategy to construct a Pt6 nanocluster catalyst stabilized on oxidized carbon nanotubes (Pt6/OCNT). The structural analysis revealed that Pt6 nanoclusters in Pt6/OCNT were fully exposed and exhibited a planar structure. Furthermore, the obtained Pt6/OCNT exhibited outstanding acidic HOR performances with a high mass activity of 18.37&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1 along with excellent stability during a 24&#8197;h constant operation and good CO tolerance, surpassing those of the commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the unique geometric and electronic structures of Pt6 nanoclusters on OCNT altered the hydrogen adsorption energies on catalytic sites and thus lowered the HOR theoretical overpotential. This work presents a new prospect for designing and synthesizing advanced APSNCs for efficient energy electrocatalysis.

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Polyrotaxane Networks with Collective Motions of Multiple Main&#8208;Chain Mechanical Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the microscopic collective motion of mechanical bonds in Type&#8208;II main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane (PR) backbones and the macroscopic mechanical performance of the resulting PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs) have been investigated. The synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of the PRMINs.







Abstract
Type&#8197;I main&#8208;chain polyrotaxanes (PRs) with multiple wheels threaded onto the axle are widely employed to design slide&#8208;ring materials. However, Type&#8197;II main&#8208;chain PRs with axles threading into the macrocycles on the polymer backbones have rarely been studied, although they feature special topological structures and dynamic characteristics. Herein, we report the design and preparation of Type&#8197;II main&#8208;chain PR&#8208;based mechanically interlocked networks (PRMINs), based on which the relationship between microscopic motion of mechanical bonds on the PRs and macroscopic mechanical performance of materials has been revealed. The representative PRMIN&#8208;2 exhibits a robust feature in tensile tests with high stretchability (1680&#8201;%) and toughness (47.5&#8197;MJ/m3). Moreover, it also has good puncture performance with puncture energy of 22.0&#8197;mJ. Detailed rheological measurements and coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation reveal that the embedded multiple [2]rotaxane mechanical bonds on the PR backbones of PRMINs could undergo a synergistic long&#8208;range sliding motion under external force, with the introduction of collective dangling chains into the network. As a result, the synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of PRMINs.

Herein, we report the design and preparation of Type&#8197;II main-chain PR-based mechanically interlocked networks (&lt;sup&gt;PR&lt;/sup&gt;MINs), based on which the relationship between microscopic motion of mechanical bonds on the PRs and macroscopic mechanical performance of materials has been revealed. The representative &lt;sup&gt;PR&lt;/sup&gt;MIN-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a robust feature in tensile tests with high stretchability (1680&#8201;%) and toughness (47.5&#8197;MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, it also has good puncture performance with puncture energy of 22.0&#8197;mJ. Detailed rheological measurements and coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulation reveal that the embedded multiple [2]rotaxane mechanical bonds on the PR backbones of &lt;sup&gt;PR&lt;/sup&gt;MINs could undergo a synergistic long-range sliding motion under external force, with the introduction of collective dangling chains into the network. As a result, the synchronized motions of coherent PR chains can be readily activated to accommodate network deformation and efficiently dissipate energy, thereby leading to enhanced mechanical performances of &lt;sup&gt;PR&lt;/sup&gt;MINs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Active and Regenerable Nanometric High&#8208;Entropy Catalyst for Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In high&#8208;entropy nanoparticles, Pt atoms are fully isolated to form atomically dispersed Pt sites through coordination with other metals, exhibiting higher propane dehydrogenation activity and resistance to sintering. The formation of high&#8208;entropy structures enables reversible regeneration of the catalyst during oxidative and reductive treatments.







Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is crucial for propylene production, but commercially employed Pt&#8208;based catalysts face susceptibility to deactivation due to the Pt sintering during reaction and regeneration steps. Here, we report a SiO2 supported nanometric (MnCoCuZnPt) high&#8208;entropy PDH catalyst with high activity and stability. The catalyst exhibited a super high propane conversion of 56.6&#8201;% with 94&#8201;% selectivity of propylene at 600&#8201;&#176;C. The propylene productivity reached 68.5&#8197;molC3H6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, nearly three times that of Pt/SiO2 (23.5&#8197;molC3H6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gPt&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) under a weight hourly space velocity of 60&#8197;h&#8722;1. In a high&#8208;entropy nanoparticle, Pt atoms were atomically dispersed through coordination with other metals and exhibited a positive charge, thereby showcasing remarkable catalytic activity. The high&#8208;entropy effect contributes to the catalyst a superior stability with a low deactivation constant of 0.0004&#8197;h&#8722;1 during 200&#8197;hours of reaction under the industrial gas composition at 550&#8201;&#176;C. Such high&#8208;entropy PDH catalyst is easy regenerated through simple air combustion of deposited coke. After the fourth consecutive regeneration cycle, satisfactory catalytic stability was observed, and the element distribution of spent catalysts almost returned to their initial state, with no detectable Pt sintering. This work provides new insights into designing active, stable, and regenerable novel PDH catalysts.

         <title>Non&#8208;Ionic Perylene&#8208;Diimide Polymer as Universal Cathode Interlayer for Conventional, Inverted, and Blade&#8208;Coated Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;conjugated PDI polymer PPDINN was designed and synthesized by utilizing oligo (ethylene glycol) (OEG) as linkage, exhibiting pronounced n&#8208;doping effect, improved film&#8208;forming ability and good solvent resistance of the polymer film. By using PPDINN as cathode interlayer, excellent photovoltaic performances were achieved in conventional, inverted and blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells.







Abstract
As a class of predominantly used cathode interlayers (CILs) in organic solar cells (OSCs), perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI)&#8208;based polymers exhibit intriguing characteristics of excellent charge transporting capacity and suitable energy levels. Despite that, PDI&#8208;based CILs with satisfied film&#8208;forming ability and adequate solvent resistance are rather rare, which not only limits the further advance of OSC performances but also hinders the practical use of PDI CILs. Herein, we designed and synthesized two non&#8208;conjugated PDI polymers for achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in diverse types of OSCs. The utilization of oligo (ethylene glycol) (OEG) linkage enhanced the n&#8208;doping effect of PDI polymers, leading to an improved ability of the CIL to reduce work function and improve electron transporting capability. Moreover, the introduction of the non&#8208;ionic OEG chain effectively improve the wetting property and solvent resistance of PDI polymers, so the PPDINN CIL can withstand diverse processing conditions in fabricating different OSCs, including conventional, inverted and blade&#8208;coated devices. The binary OSC with conventional structure using PPDINN CIL showed a PCE of 18.6&#8201;%, along with an improved device stability. Besides, PPDINN is compatible with the large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coating technique, and a PCE of 16.6&#8201;% was achieved in the 1&#8208;cm2 OSC where a blade&#8208;coated PPDINN was used.

         <dc:description>
A series of molecular duplexes stabilized by up to 10 hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs between indolocarbazole and pyridine units have been investigated. In the presence of water, these duplexes transform into hydrated duplexes with water molecules inserted into the hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs in an all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing manner. The two distinct forms can be reversibly switched through temperature changes, with characteristic signals observed spectroscopically.







Abstract
Synthetic duplexes with high stabilities have promising potential for mimicking biomolecular functions and developing supramolecular smart materials. Herein, we describe the synthesis and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties of molecular duplexes derived from indolocarbazole&#8211;pyridine (I&#8722;P) oligomers. These duplexes adopt nonclassical helical structures, stabilized by I&#8722;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pairs in anhydrous chlorinated solvents. Notably, the longest duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 displays remarkable stability, forming twenty hydrogen bonds; its exchange energy barrier was determined to be &#916;G&#8800;=22.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at 75&#8201;&#176;C in anhydrous (CDCl2)2. Upon the addition of water, a hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was formed, with one water molecule inserted between each I&#8722;P hydrogen&#8208;bonding pair. The Hill coefficient (n) for this process is 6.1, demonstrating extremely positive cooperativity. Conversely, the hydrated duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2&#8835;10H2O was completely converted into the original anhydrous duplex 62 (11&#8208;mer)2 when the temperature was increased. Interconversion between these two distinct duplexes can be repeatedly carried out by varying the temperature. Furthermore, reversible switching between hetero&#8208;duplexes and homo&#8208;duplexes was also demonstrated by controlling the temperature, with concomitant changes in the characteristic emission signals.

         <title>Se&#8208;dopant Modulated Selective Co&#8208;Insertion of H+ and Zn2+ in MnO2 for High&#8208;Capacity and Durable Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Selenium doping significantly boosts both the capacity and structural stability of MnO2 as the cathode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. In situ spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that this improvement results from reduced interaction between Zn2+ ions and the MnO2 host, as well as increased interaction between H+ ions and MnO2. These factors alleviate lattice strain during Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation and suppress the formation of the ZnMn2O4 by&#8208;product. Moreover, modified Mn&#8722;O bond lengths upon Zn2+ insertion help alleviate Mn dissolution caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, easing Mn&#8722;O octahedral distortion.







Abstract
MnO2 is commonly used as the cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). The strong Coulombic interaction between Zn ions and the MnO2 lattice causes significant lattice distortion and, combined with the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, results in Mn2+ dissolution and structural collapse. While proton intercalation can reduce lattice distortion, it changes the electrolyte pH, producing chemically inert byproducts. These issues greatly affect the reversibility of Zn2+ intercalation/extraction, leading to significant capacity degradation of MnO2. Herein, we propose a novel method to enhance the cycling stability of &#948;&#8208;MnO2 through selenium doping (Se&#8722;MnO2). Our work indicates that varying the selenium doping content can regulate the intercalation ratio of H+ in MnO2, thereby suppressing the formation of ZnMn2O4 by&#8208;products. Se doping mitigates the lattice strain of MnO2 during Zn2+ intercalation/deintercalation by reducing Mn&#8722;O octahedral distortion, modifying Mn&#8722;O bond length upon Zn2+ insertion, and alleviating Mn dissolution caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect. The optimized Se&#8722;MnO2 (Se concentration of 0.8&#8197;at.%) deposited on carbon nanotube demonstrates a notable capacity of 386&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with exceptional long&#8208;term cycle stability, retaining 102&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 capacity after 5000 cycles at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

     alt="Se-dopant Modulated Selective Co-Insertion of H+ and Zn2+ in MnO2 for High-Capacity and Durable Aqueous Zn-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selenium doping significantly boosts both the capacity and structural stability of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the cathode in aqueous zinc-ion batteries. In situ spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that this improvement results from reduced interaction between Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and the MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; host, as well as increased interaction between H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These factors alleviate lattice strain during Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation/deintercalation and suppress the formation of the ZnMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by-product. Moreover, modified Mn&#8722;O bond lengths upon Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; insertion help alleviate Mn dissolution caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, easing Mn&#8722;O octahedral distortion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is commonly used as the cathode material for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs). The strong Coulombic interaction between Zn ions and the MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lattice causes significant lattice distortion and, combined with the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, results in Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dissolution and structural collapse. While proton intercalation can reduce lattice distortion, it changes the electrolyte pH, producing chemically inert byproducts. These issues greatly affect the reversibility of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation/extraction, leading to significant capacity degradation of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Herein, we propose a novel method to enhance the cycling stability of &#948;-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through selenium doping (Se&#8722;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Our work indicates that varying the selenium doping content can regulate the intercalation ratio of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby suppressing the formation of ZnMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by-products. Se doping mitigates the lattice strain of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation/deintercalation by reducing Mn&#8722;O octahedral distortion, modifying Mn&#8722;O bond length upon Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; insertion, and alleviating Mn dissolution caused by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect. The optimized Se&#8722;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Se concentration of 0.8&#8197;at.%) deposited on carbon nanotube demonstrates a notable capacity of 386&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with exceptional long-term cycle stability, retaining 102&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; capacity after 5000 cycles at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatioselective Occlusion of Copolymer Nanoparticles within Calcite Crystals Generates Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Materials with Controlled Internal Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

This study provides a powerful yet straightforward way to regulate the internal composition and structure of a single calcite crystal, generating a series of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials where the organic additives are preferentially distributed within specific regions of the inorganic host crystals.







Abstract
Efficient occlusion of particulate additives into a single crystal has garnered an ever&#8208;increasing attention in materials science because it offers a counter&#8208;intuitive yet powerful platform to make crystalline nanocomposite materials with emerging properties. However, precisely controlling the spatial distribution of the guest additives within a host crystal remains highly challenging. We herein demonstrate a unique, straightforward method to engineer the spatial distribution of copolymer nanoparticles within calcite (CaCO3) single crystals by judiciously adjusting initial [Ca2+] concentration used for the calcite precipitation. More specifically, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is employed to synthesize well&#8208;defined and highly anionic poly(3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium)41&#8208;block&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate)500 [PSPMA41&#8208;PBzMA500] diblock copolymer nanoparticles, which are subsequently used as model additives during the growth of calcite crystals. Impressively, such guest nanoparticles are preferentially occluded into specific regions of calcite depending on the initial [Ca2+] concentration. These unprecedented phenomena are most probably caused by dynamic change in electrostatic interaction between Ca2+ ions and PSPMA41 chains based on systematic investigations. This study not only showcases a significant advancement in controlling the spatial distribution of guest nanoparticles within host crystals, enabling the internal structure of composite crystals to be rationally tailored via a spatioselective occlusion strategy, but also provides new insights into biomineralization.

         <title>Metabolic Response to Small Molecule Therapy in Colorectal Cancer Tracked with Raman Spectroscopy and Metabolomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite advances in cancer therapies, effective screening tools that a priori predict treatment efficacy remain underdeveloped. Here we demonstrate the utility of Raman spectroscopy to evaluate metabolic changes at the single cell level in response to cytostatic inhibitors in colorectal cancer cells. Classical machine learning approaches applied to Raman data allowed for the differentiation of responders and nonresponders of treatment and a scoring model that could be generalized to new treatment combinations.







Abstract
Despite numerous screening tools for colorectal cancer (CRC), 25&#8201;% of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease. Novel diagnostic technologies that are early, accurate, and rapid are imperative to assess the therapeutic efficacy of clinical drugs and identify new biomarkers of treatment response. Here Raman spectroscopy (RS) was used to track metabolic reprogramming in KRAS&#8208;mutant HCT116 and SW837 cells, and KRAS wild&#8208;type CC cells. RS combined with multivariate analysis methods distinguished nonresponsive, partially responsive, and responsive cells treated with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody for EGFR inhibition, sotorasib, a clinically approved KRAS inhibitor, and various doses of trametinib, an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway. Cells treated with a combination of subtoxic doses of trametinib and BKM120, an inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, showed a synergistic response between the two pathways. Using a supervised machine learning regression model, we established a scoring methodology trained to a priori predict therapeutic response to new treatment combinations. RS metabolites were verified with mass spectrometry, and enrichment pathways were identified, including amino acid, purine, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism that differentiated monotherapy from combination therapy. Our approach may ultimately be applicable to patient&#8208;derived primary cells and cultures of patient tumors to predict effective drugs for individualized care.

         <title>Hierarchical Dual&#8208;Mode Efficient Tunable Afterglow via J&#8208;Aggregates in Single&#8208;Phosphor&#8208;Doped Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coexistence of isolated states and J&#8208;aggregate states in a single&#8208;phosphor&#8208;doped polymeric system has enabled hierarchical dual&#8208;mode organic persistent luminescence to be achieved. The doped polymeric system generates a two&#8208;step temperature&#8208;dependent afterglow color with excitation&#8208; and humidity&#8208;responsiveness.







Abstract
The development of polymer&#8208;based persistent luminescence materials with color&#8208;tunable organic afterglow and multiple responses is highly desirable for applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, flexible displays, and data&#8208;storage. However, achieving efficient persistent luminescence from a single&#8208;phosphor system with multiple responses remains a challenging task. Herein, by doping 9H&#8208;pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]indole (PI2) into an amorphous polyacrylamide matrix, a hierarchical dual&#8208;mode emission system is developed, which exhibits color&#8208;tunable afterglow due to excitation&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, and humidity&#8208;dependence. Notably, the coexistence of the isolated state and J&#8208;aggregate state of the guest molecule not only provides an excitation&#8208;dependent afterglow color, but also leads to a hierarchical temperature&#8208;dependent afterglow color resulting from different thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) behaviors of the isolated and aggregated states. The complex responsiveness based on the hierarchical dual&#8208;mode emission can serve for security features through inkjet printing and ink&#8208;writing. These findings may provide further insight into the regulated persistent luminescence by isolated and aggregated phosphors in doped polymer systems and expand the scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive organic afterglow materials for broader applications.

         <title>Embedding Single Pd Atoms on NiGa Intermetallic Surfaces for Efficient and Selective Alkyne Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Pd is embedded onto the NiGa intermetallic surface to promote alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenations as exemplified by acetylene hydrogenation here. The synergistic effect of single&#8208;atom Pd with the neighbouring Ni sites is shown to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption, which contributes to high activity and selectivity for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Catalytic removal of alkynes is essential in industry for producing polymer&#8208;grade alkenes from steam cracking processes. Non&#8208;noble Ni&#8208;based catalysts hold promise as effective alternatives to industrial Pd&#8208;based catalysts but suffer from low activity. Here we report embedding of single&#8208;atom Pd onto the NiGa intermetallic surface with replacing Ga atoms via a well&#8208;defined synthesis strategy to design Pd1&#8722;NiGa catalyst for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.

     alt="Embedding Single Pd Atoms on NiGa Intermetallic Surfaces for Efficient and Selective Alkyne Hydrogenation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom Pd is embedded onto the NiGa intermetallic surface to promote alkyne semi-hydrogenations as exemplified by acetylene hydrogenation here. The synergistic effect of single-atom Pd with the neighbouring Ni sites is shown to facilitate the &#963;-adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption, which contributes to high activity and selectivity for alkyne semi-hydrogenation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic removal of alkynes is essential in industry for producing polymer-grade alkenes from steam cracking processes. Non-noble Ni-based catalysts hold promise as effective alternatives to industrial Pd-based catalysts but suffer from low activity. Here we report embedding of single-atom Pd onto the NiGa intermetallic surface with replacing Ga atoms via a well-defined synthesis strategy to design Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NiGa catalyst for alkyne semi-hydrogenation. The fabricated Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ensemble sites deliver remarkably higher specific mass activity under superb alkene selectivity of &amp;gt;96&#8201;% than the state-of-the-art catalysts under industry-relevant conditions. Integrated experimental and computational studies reveal that the single-atom Pd synergizes with the neighbouring Ni sites to facilitate the &#963;-adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption. Such synergistic effects confer the single-atom Pd on the NiGa intermetallic with a Midas touch for alkyne semi-hydrogenation, providing an effective strategy for stimulating low active Ni-based catalysts for other selective hydrogenations in industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface Engineering via Manipulating Solvation Chemistry for Liquid Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Operated&#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C</title>

A unique robust organic/inorganic hetero&#8208;interphase, composed of gradient F, B&#8208;rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si&#8208;rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, via regulation of solvation chemistry and addition of functional additives. As a result, liquid LIBs exhibited enhanced performance at ultrahigh temperatures at&#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance and temperature&#8208;resistant lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), which are able to operate at elevated temperatures (i.e., &gt;60&#8201;&#176;C) are highly demanded in various fields, especially in military or aerospace exploration. However, their applications were largely impeded by the poor electrochemical performance and unsatisfying safety issues, which were induced by the severe side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes at high temperatures. Herein, with the synergetic effects of solvation chemistry and functional additive in the elaborately designed weakly solvating electrolyte, a unique robust organic/inorganic hetero&#8208;interphase, composed of gradient F, B&#8208;rich inorganic components and homogeneously distributed Si&#8208;rich organic components, was successfully constructed on both cathodes and anodes, which would effectively inhibit the constant decomposition of electrolytes and dissolution of transition metal ions, thus highly enhancing the high&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance. As a result, both cathodes and anodes, without compromising their low&#8208;temperature performance, can operate at temperatures &#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C, with excellent capacity retentions of 96.1&#8201;% after 500 cycles and 93.5&#8201;% after &#8805;200 cycles, respectively, at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Ah&#8208;level LiCoO2||graphite full cells with a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.3&#8197;V also exhibited superior temperature&#8208;resistance with a capacity retention of 89.9&#8201;% at temperature as high as 120&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the fully charged pouch cells exhibited highly enhanced safety, demonstrating their potentials in practical applications at ultrahigh temperatures.

         <title>Small, Fluorinated Mn2+ Chelate as an Efficient 1H and 19F MRI Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Placed at an appropriate and controlled distance from the paramagnetic Mn2+ ion, 19F atoms in MnL1 experience adequate acceleration of their longitudinal relaxation, while the line&#8208;broadening effect remains moderate. This allows for efficient visualization of this small paramagnetic complex both in 19F and 1H MRI, also in the living mouse.







Abstract
We explore the potential of fluorine&#8208;containing small Mn2+ chelates as alternatives to perfluorinated nanoparticles, widely used as 19F MRI probes. In MnL1, the cyclohexanediamine skeleton and two piperidine rings, involving each a metal&#8208;coordinating amide group and an appended CF3 moiety, provide high rigidity to the complex. This allows for good control of the Mn&#8722;F distance (rMnF=8.2&#177;0.2&#8197;&#197; determined from 19F relaxation data), as well as for high kinetic inertness (a dissociation half&#8208;life of 1285&#8197;h is estimated for physiological conditions). The paramagnetic Mn2+ leads to a ~150&#8208;fold acceleration of the longitudinal 19F relaxation, with moderate line&#8208;broadening effect, resulting in T2/T1 ratios of 0.8 (9.4&#8197;T). Owing to its inner sphere water molecule, MnL1 is a good 1H relaxation agent as well (r1=5.36&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K, 20&#8197;MHz). MnL1 could be readily visualized in 19F MRI by using fast acquisition techniques, both in phantom images and living mice following intramuscular injection, with remarkable signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and short acquisition times. While applications in targeted imaging or cell therapy monitoring require further optimisation of the molecular structure, these results argue for the potential of such small, monohydrated and fluorinated Mn2+ complexes for combined 19F and 1H MRI detection.

         <title>Extremely Active and Robust Ir&#8722;Mn Dual&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction by Oxygen&#8208;Oxygen Radical Coupling Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is rationally designed by the cation exchange method featuring self&#8208;limitation in the precise control over the composition and structure. The short atomic distance and the short&#8208;range cationic order of Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom enable the same spin direction O&#8197;(&#8593;) of the adsorbed *O radicals, promoting an effective oxygen evolution reaction via the oxygen&#8208;oxygen radical coupling mechanism.







Abstract
A novel Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is synthesized by a facile ion&#8208;exchange method by incorporating Ir in SrMnO3, which yields an extremely high activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ion exchange process occurs in a self&#8208;limitation way, which favors the formation of Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom in the IrMnO9 unit. The incorporation of Ir modulates the electronic structure of both Ir and Mn, thereby resulting in a shorter distance of the Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom (2.41&#8197;&#197;) than the Mn&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom (2.49&#8197;&#197;). The modulated Ir&#8722;Mn dual&#8208;atom enables the same spin direction O&#8197;(&#8593;) of the adsorbed *O intermediates, thus facilitating the direct coupling of the two adsorbed *O intermediates to release O2 via the oxygen&#8208;oxygen radical coupling mechanism. Electrochemical tests reveal that the Ir&#8208;SrMnO3 exhibits a superior OER's activity with a low overpotential of 207&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and achieves a mass specific activity of 1100&#8197;A&#8201;gIr&#8722;1 at 1.5&#8197;V. The proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer with the Ir&#8208;SrMnO3 catalyst exhibits a low electrolysis voltage of 1.63&#8197;V at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a stable 2000&#8208;h operation with a decay of only 15&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>A Covalent Organic Nanoribbon: Preparation, Single&#8208;Crystal Structure with Chinese Luban Lock Configuration, and Photocatalytic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;crystal structure of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) with a width of ca. 6&#8197;nm has been shown to exhibit a multiple &#8220;mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon&#8221; like joint 3D network similar to the Chinese traditional Luban lock configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in the metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot tandem hydrogen evolution reaction and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of diphenylacetylene derivatives.







Abstract
The multiple mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint parts are the core factors to provide the structural stability and diversity of Chinese Luban locks; however, constructing such structures is very challenging. Herein, single crystals of a covalent organic nanoribbon (named CityU&#8208;27) are prepared through the assembly of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), 4,4&#8242;&#8208;vinylenedipyridine (BYE), and phenylboronic acid (BA) together through dative boron&#8592;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicates that CityU&#8208;27 has a covalent organic nanoribbon structure, where each nanoribbon forms multiple and tight &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with four neighboring others to generate a Luban lock&#8208;like configuration. CityU&#8208;27 has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst in a one&#8208;pot tandem reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of alkynes in series to produce olefins without any additional photosensitizers and co&#8208;catalysts (metal&#8208;free).

         <title>Quantification of Charge Transport and Mass Deprivation in Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Kinetically&#8208;Stable Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel thermodynamics descriptor, separation factor of solid electrolyte interphase (SSEI) for designing desirable SEI chemistry, is established on the energy of Li+ diffusion (&#916;VLi), electron tunneling (&#934;e), solvent adsorption (Es), and desolvation processes (&#916;Ed), and thus the kinetic stability of charge (Li+/e&#8722;) transport and mass (solvent) deprivation through SEI layer at low temperatures could be quantitatively evaluated.







Abstract
Graphite (Gr)&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries with admirable electrochemical performance below &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C are desired but are hindered by sluggish interfacial charge transport and desolvation process. Li salt dissociation via Li+&#8208;solvent interaction enables mobile Li+ liberation and contributes to bulk ion transport, while is contradictory to fast interfacial desolvation. Designing kinetically&#8208;stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) without compromising strong Li+&#8208;solvent interaction is expected to compatibly improve interfacial charge transport and desolvation kinetics. However, the relationship between physicochemical features and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetics properties of SEI remains vague. Herein, we propose four key thermodynamics parameters of SEI potentially influencing low&#8208;temperature electrochemistry, including electron work function, Li+ transfer barrier, surface energy, and desolvation energy. Based on the above parameters, we further define a novel descriptor, separation factor of SEI (SSEI), to quantitatively depict charge (Li+/e&#8722;) transport and solvent deprivation processes at Gr/electrolyte interface. A Li3PO4&#8208;based, inorganics&#8208;enriched SEI derived by Li difluorophosphate (LiDFP) additive exhibits the highest SSEI (4.89&#215;103) to enable efficient Li+ conduction, e&#8722; blocking and rapid desolvation, and as a result, much suppressed Li&#8208;metal precipitation, electrolyte decomposition and Gr sheets exfoliation, thus improving low&#8208;temperature battery performances. Overall, our work originally provides visualized guides to improve low&#8208;temperature reaction kinetics/thermodynamics by constructing desirable SEI chemistry.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Iron&#8208;Copper Dual&#8208;Metal Sites Synergistically Boost Carbonylation of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>

The 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZSM5&#8208;TF catalyst (where TF indicates template&#8208;free synthesis), featuring spatially adjacent mononuclear Fe and Cu within ZSM&#8208;5 channels, achieves an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C&#8212;more than threefold higher than previous catalysts. The Fe&#8722;Cu synergistic effect promotes the C&#8722;C coupling of &#8901;CH3 radical with CO by retarding the oxidation progress for high&#8208;efficient formation of acetic acid.







Abstract
The direct liquid&#8208;phase oxidative carbonylation of methane, utilizing abundant natural gas, offers a mild and straightforward alternative. However, most catalysts proposed for this process suffer from low acetic acid yields due to few active sites and rapid C1 oxygenate generation, impeding their industrial feasibility. Herein, we report a highly efficient 0.1Cu/Fe&#8208;HZSM&#8208;5&#8208;TF (TF denotes template&#8208;free synthesis) catalyst featuring exclusively mononuclear Fe and Cu anchored in the ZSM&#8208;5 channels. Under optimized conditions, the catalyst achieved an unprecedented acetic acid yield of 40.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;&#176;C, tripling the previous records of 12.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Comprehensive characterization, isotope&#8208;labeled experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the homogeneous mononuclear Fe sites are responsible for the activation and oxidation of methane, while the neighboring Cu sites play a key role in retarding the oxidation process, promoting C&#8722;C coupling for effective acetic acid synthesis. Furthermore, the methyl&#8208;group carbon in acetic acid originates solely from methane, while its carbonyl&#8208;group carbon is derived exclusively from CO, rather than the conversion of other C1 oxygenates. The proposed bimetallic catalyst design not only overcomes the limitations of current catalysts but also generalizes the oxidative carbonylation of other alkanes, demonstrating promising advancements in sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Kinetics of Anionic Redox in O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 through Controlled P2 Intergrowth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biphasic recombination is an effective strategy to boost the electrochemical properties of sodium layered oxides. Here, we deploy a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in the manganese&#8208;enriched O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2 model compound with the overall composition maintained, enabling a high energy density to be achieved.







Abstract
Anionic redox chemistry can surpass theoretical limits of conventional layered oxide cathodes in energy density. A recent model system of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, O3&#8208;NaLi1/3Mn2/3O2, demonstrated full anionic redox capacity but is limited in reversibility and kinetics due to irreversible structural rearrangement and oxygen loss. Solutions to these issues are missing due to the challenging synthesis. Here, we harness the unique structural richness of sodium layered oxides and realize a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in this model compound with the overall composition maintained. The resulted O3 with 27&#8201;% P2 intergrowth structure delivers an excellent initial Coulombic efficiency of 87&#8201;%, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;rich NMCs. This improvement is attributed to the effective suppression of irreversible oxygen release and structural changes, evidenced by operando Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray Diffraction. The as&#8208;prepared intergrowth material, based on the environmentally benign Mn, exhibits a reversible capacity of 226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at C/20 rate with excellent cycling stability stemming from the redox reactions of oxygen and manganese. Our work isolates the role of P2 structural intergrowth and thereby introduces a novel strategy to enhance the reversibility and kinetics of anionic redox reactions in sodium layered cathodes without compromising capacity.

Here, we harness the unique structural richness of sodium layered oxides and realize a controlled ratio of P2 structural intergrowth in this model compound with the overall composition maintained. The resulted O3 with 27&#8201;% P2 intergrowth structure delivers an excellent initial Coulombic efficiency of 87&#8201;%, comparable to the state-of-the-art Li-rich NMCs. This improvement is attributed to the effective suppression of irreversible oxygen release and structural changes, evidenced by operando Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction. The as-prepared intergrowth material, based on the environmentally benign Mn, exhibits a reversible capacity of 226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at C/20 rate with excellent cycling stability stemming from the redox reactions of oxygen and manganese. Our work isolates the role of P2 structural intergrowth and thereby introduces a novel strategy to enhance the reversibility and kinetics of anionic redox reactions in sodium layered cathodes without compromising capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Induced Rh Monocoodination on Diphosphine Ligand Enables Catalytic Hydroformylation of Aliphatic Olefins at Room Temperature and Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust Zr&#8208;MOF, constructed from a conventional chelated diphosphine ligand underwent post&#8208;modification to afford a monophosphine Rh catalyst, which display exceptionally high regioselectivity, reactivity and recyclability in hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins at room temperature and pressure. The structural transformation of the reactive Rh species within the framework during catalysis is elucidated through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
Persistent challenges in hydroformylation of olefins include controlling regioselectivity, particularly for short aliphatic olefins and conducting reactions under ambient conditions. We report here the synthesis of monophosphine&#8211;Rh complexes on a typical chelated diphosphine ligand mediated by a Zr&#8208;MOF through isolating a pair of phosphorus atoms. We demonstrate that single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction can elucidate the structural transformation of the Rh catalyst during olefin hydroformylation, providing valuable information on active site reconstruction during catalysis. The Rh&#8208;MOF catalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic and recyclable performance in the hydroformylation of short aliphatic olefins with linear to branched ratios of up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1. Due to the framework&#8216;s capacity to adsorb and concentrate gases, the catalytic reactions occur under room temperature and pressure, eliminating the need for the high temperature and pressures typically required in homogeneous systems. This study show that Zr&#8211;MOF can be a unique platform for synthesizing unusual catalytic species that cannot exist in solutions for meaningful chemical transformations and elucidate valuable structural information pertaining to metal&#8208;based catalysis.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Tethered (cAAC)&#8212;Copper Complexes: Reactivity for Hydride Transfer and Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis acidic borane was introduced into the secondary coordination sphere of cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) copper complexes, including a cuprous hydride. In contrast to non&#8208;tethered borane capped copper hydrides, the borane&#8208;tethered variant exhibits strong hydricity, attributed to relief of ring&#8208;strain, and improved catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
We present a series of borane&#8208;tethered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC)&#8208;copper complexes, including a borane&#8208;capped Cu(I) hydride. This hydride is unusually hydridic and reacts rapidly with both CO2 and 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenol at room temperature. Its reactivity is distinct from variants without a tethered borane, and the underlying principles governing the enhanced hydricity were evaluated experimentally and theoretically. These stoichiometric results were extended to catalytic CO2 hydrogenation, and the borane&#8208;tethered (intramolecular) system exhibits ~3&#8208;fold enhancement relative to an intermolecular system.

         <title>Spirobipyridine Ligand Enabled Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Activation via Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of spirobipyridine ligands has been developed to achieve remote site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H borylation of alkaloids for iridium catalysis. The &#8220;side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall&#8221; in ligands facilitates specific C&#8722;H bonds of multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives towards the metal center via non&#8208;covalent interactions, while simultaneously blocking other sites. Notably, this approach is applicable to a broad range of alkaloids with diverse functional groups.







Abstract
The selective borylation of specific C&#8722;H bonds in organic synthesis remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we present a novel spirobipyridine ligand that features a binaphthyl backbone. This ligand facilitates the iridium&#8208;catalyzed selective C&#8722;H borylation of benzene derivatives. The ligand is designed with &#8220;side&#8208;arm&#8208;wall&#8221; substituents that allow vicinal di&#8208; or multi&#8208;substituted benzene derivatives to approach metal center and effectively block other reactive sites by non&#8208;covalent interactions with substrates. The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated by the successful selective distal C&#8722;H activation of various alkaloids and its broad compatibility with functional groups.

         <title>Large Molecular Rotation in Crystal Changes the Course of a Topochemical Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction from a Predicted Polymerization to an Unexpected Intramolecular Cyclization</title>

         <dc:description>
Molecular arrangement in crystals can in general be used reliably to predict the product of a topochemical reaction. When there is sufficient free&#8208;space and flexibility, molecules in crystal can make large motions prior to topochemical reaction leading to a different arrangement and yield unexpected products. Our results cautions that the prediction of product structures based on the crystal structure can be misleading.







Abstract
A designed anthracene&#8208;based monomer for topochemical Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition polymerization crystallized with head&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangement of molecules, as revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. The diene and dienophile units of adjacent monomer molecules are aligned at an average distance of 4.6&#8197;&#197;, suggesting a favorable crystalline arrangement for their intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition reaction to form a linear polymer. Surprisingly, heating the monomer crystals at a temperature above 125&#8201;&#176;C resulted in the formation of intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadduct, which could be characterized by various spectroscopy and SCXRD analysis. Various time&#8208;dependent studies such as NMR, PXRD, and DSC, studies established that the reaction followed topochemical pathway. Schmidt's topochemical postulates are generally used to predict the topochemical reactivity and product, by analyzing the crystal structure of the reactant. Though the crystal arrangement predicted polymerization, upon heating, the molecule avoided this pathway by undergoing a large rotation to form an intramolecular cycloadduct. Theoretical calculations supported the feasibility of the rotation, exploiting the flexibility of the molecule and voids present. These findings caution that the reliance on Schmidt's criteria for topochemical reactions may sometimes be misleading, especially in heat&#8208;induced reactions.

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Ring Mobility on the Macroscopic Properties of Doubly Threaded Slide&#8208;Ring Gel Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly threaded slide&#8208;ring gels (dt&#8208;SRGs) exhibit enhanced swelling, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics on account of the mobility of their crosslinking rings. dt&#8208;SRG with larger rings exhibit softer mechanical properties and faster stress relaxation. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of dt&#8208;SRGs can be adjusted by &#8220;locking&#8221; ring mobility through remetalation.







Abstract
The integration of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) into polymeric materials has led to the development of mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs). One class of MIPs that have gained attention in recent years are slide&#8208;ring gels (SRGs), which are generally accessed by crosslinking rings on a main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane.

&lt;p&gt;Doubly threaded slide-ring gels (dt-SRGs) exhibit enhanced swelling, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics on account of the mobility of their crosslinking rings. dt-SRG with larger rings exhibit softer mechanical properties and faster stress relaxation. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of dt-SRGs can be adjusted by &#8220;locking&#8221; ring mobility through remetalation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) into polymeric materials has led to the development of mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs). One class of MIPs that have gained attention in recent years are slide-ring gels (SRGs), which are generally accessed by crosslinking rings on a main-chain polyrotaxane. The mobility of the interlocked crosslinking moieties along the polymer backbone imparts enhanced properties onto these networks. An alternative synthetic approach to SRGs is to use a doubly threaded ring as the crosslinking moiety, yielding doubly threaded slide-ring gel networks (dt-SRGs). In this study, a photo-curable ligand-containing thread was used to assemble a series of metal-templated pseudo[3]rotaxane crosslinkers that allow access to polymer networks that contain doubly threaded interlocked rings. The physicochemical and mechanical properties of these dt-SRGs with varying size of the ring crosslinking moieties were investigated and compared to an entangled gel (EG) prepared by polymerizing the metal complex of the photo-curable ligand-containing thread, and a corresponding covalent gel (CG). Relative to the EG and CG, the dt-SRGs exhibit enhanced swelling behavior, viscoelastic properties, and stress relaxation characteristics. In addition, the macroscopic properties of dt-SRGs could be altered by &#8220;locking&#8221; ring mobility in the structure through remetalation, highlighting the impact of the mobility of the crosslinks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Pendant Groups for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microenvironment near the catalytic sites in covalent organic frameworks is tuned with different pendant groups to improve the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The COF with electron&#8208;donating group (&#8722;CH2NH2) near the active site exhibited superior CO2RR activity and selectivity, compared with the COF with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;CN, &#8722;COOH).







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an effective way of converting CO2 into value&#8208;added products using renewable energy, whose activity and selectivity can be in principle maneuvered by tuning the microenvironment near catalytic sites. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for tuning the microenvironment of CO2RR by learning from the natural chlorophyll and heme. Specifically, the conductive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) linked by piperazine serve as versatile supports for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), and the pendant groups modified on the COFs can be readily tailored to offer different push&#8208;pull electronic effects for tunable microenvironment. As a result, while all the COFs exhibit high chemical structure stability under harsh conditions and good conductivity, the addition of &#8722;CH2NH2 can greatly enhance the activity and selectivity of CO2RR. As proven by experimental characterization and theoretical simulation, the electron&#8208;donating group (&#8722;CH2NH2) not only reduces the surface work function of COF, but also improves the adsorption energy of the key intermediate *COOH, compared with the COFs with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (&#8722;CN, &#8722;COOH) near the active sites. This work provides insights into the microenvironment modulation of CO2RR electrocatalysts at the molecular level.

         <title>Unconventional Electrocatalytic CO Conversion to C2 Products on Single&#8208;Atomic Pd&#8722;Agn Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to the non&#8208;*CO adsorption on Ag surface or over&#8208;strong *CO adsorption on multiple Pd atoms, the single Pd atoms surrounded with multiple Ag sites (denoted as the Pd&#8722;Agn structure) in the Pd1Ag10 catalyst allow to tune the *CO adsorption behavior to promote the *CO surface coverage, and enable efficient C&#8722;C coupling between a Pd&#8208;atop (PdL) and a Pd&#8722;Ag bridge (PdAgB) adsorption sites.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO or CO2 into C2+ products has mostly been focused on Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Although Ag has also been predicted as a possible catalyst for the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion from the thermodynamic point of view, however, due to its weak CO binding strength, CO rapidly desorbs from the Ag surface rather than participates in deep reduction. In this work, we demonstrate that single&#8208;atomic Pd sites doped in Ag lattice can tune the CO adsorption behavior and promote the deep reduction of CO toward C2 products. The monodispersed Pd&#8722;Agn sites enable the CO adsorption with both Pd&#8208;atop (PdL) and Pd&#8722;Ag bridge (PdAgB) configurations, which can increase the CO coverage and reduce the C&#8722;C coupling energy barrier. Under room temperature and ambient pressure, the Pd1Ag10 alloy catalyst exhibited a total CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Faradaic efficiency of ~37&#8201;% at &#8722;0.83&#8197;V, with appreciable current densities and electrochemical stability, thus featuring unconventional non&#8208;Cu electrocatalytic CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion capability.

This work emphasizes the significance of the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites&#8242; intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity.







Abstract
The zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;aromatics (MTA) process is a promising avenue for industrial decarbonization. This process predominantly utilizes 3&#8208;dimensional 10&#8208;member ring (10&#8208;MR) zeolites like ZSM&#8208;5 and ZSM&#8208;11, chosen for their confinement effect essential for aromatization. Current research mainly focuses on enhancing selectivity and mitigating catalyst deactivation by modulating zeolites&#8242; physicochemical properties. Despite the potential, the MTA technology is at a low Technology Readiness Level, hindered by mechanistic complexities in achieving the desired selectivity towards liquid aromatics. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study proposes a roadmap for MTA catalysis by strategically combining controlled catalytic experiments with advanced characterization methods (including operando conditions and &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy). It identifies the descriptor&#8208;role of Koch&#8208;carbonylated intermediates, longer&#8208;chain hydrocarbons, and the zeolites&#8242; intersectional cavities in yielding preferential liquid aromatics selectivity. Understanding these selectivity descriptors and architectural impacts is vital, potentially advancing other zeolite&#8208;catalyzed emerging technologies.

         <title>Reducing Dielectric Confinement Effect Enhances Carrier Separation in Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By substituting the A&#8208;site ions of two&#8208;dimensional OIHPs, we prepared two perovskites with different dielectric constants. Compared with (PEA)2PbBr4, (EOA)2PbBr4 has a larger dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr6]4&#8722; layers, exhibiting a small excitonic binding energy than (PEA)2PbBr4, which promotes the charge transfer and separation. Furthermore, we also demonstrates the application in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) with alternating structure of the organic and inorganic layers have a natural quantum well structure. The difference of dielectric constants between organic and inorganic layers in this structure results in the enhancement of dielectric confinement effect, which exhibits a large exciton binding energy and hinders the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs. Herein, a strategy to reduce the dielectric confinement effect by narrowing the dielectric difference between organic amine molecule and [PbBr6]4&#8722; octahedron is put forward. The Ethanolamine (EOA) contains hydroxyl groups, resulting in the positive and negative charge centers of O and H non&#8208;overlapping, which generated a larger polarity and dielectric constant. The reduced dielectric constant produces a smaller exciton binding energy (71.03&#8197;meV) of (C2H7NO)2PbBr4 ((EOA)2PbBr4) than (C8H11N)2PbBr4 ((PEA)2PbBr4 (156.07&#8197;meV), and promotes the dissociation of electrons and holes. The increasing of lifetime of photogenerated carrier in (EOA)2PbBr4 are proved by femtosecond transient absorption spectra. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have also indicated that the small energy shift of the total density of states (DOS) between the C/H/N and the Pb/Br in (EOA)2PbBr4 favors the separation of electrons and holes. In addition, this work demonstrates the application of (PEA)2PbBr4 and (EOA)2PbBr4 in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

     alt="Reducing Dielectric Confinement Effect Enhances Carrier Separation in Two-Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite Photocatalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By substituting the A-site ions of two-dimensional OIHPs, we prepared two perovskites with different dielectric constants. Compared with (PEA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, (EOA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has a larger dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; layers, exhibiting a small excitonic binding energy than (PEA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which promotes the charge transfer and separation. Furthermore, we also demonstrates the application in the field of photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) with alternating structure of the organic and inorganic layers have a natural quantum well structure. The difference of dielectric constants between organic and inorganic layers in this structure results in the enhancement of dielectric confinement effect, which exhibits a large exciton binding energy and hinders the separation of electron-hole pairs. Herein, a strategy to reduce the dielectric confinement effect by narrowing the dielectric difference between organic amine molecule and [PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; octahedron is put forward. The Ethanolamine (EOA) contains hydroxyl groups, resulting in the positive and negative charge centers of O and H non-overlapping, which generated a larger polarity and dielectric constant. The reduced dielectric constant produces a smaller exciton binding energy (71.03&#8197;meV) of (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;NO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ((EOA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) than (C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;N)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ((PEA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (156.07&#8197;meV), and promotes the dissociation of electrons and holes. The increasing of lifetime of photogenerated carrier in (EOA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are proved by femtosecond transient absorption spectra. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have also indicated that the small energy shift of the total density of states (DOS) between the C/H/N and the Pb/Br in (EOA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; favors the separation of electrons and holes. In addition, this work demonstrates the application of (PEA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and (EOA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in the field of photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Highly Stable and Non&#8208;Flammable Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

In this work, we report a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. Due to the absence of active &#945;&#8208;hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility.







Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are regarded as one of the next&#8208;generation electrolytes to promote the development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to their unparalleled advantages compared to both liquid electrolytes and solid electrolytes. However, its application in LMBs is limited by electrode interface compatibility. Here, we introduce a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)&#8208;based DEE induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. We confirmed that the DMMN molecule can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI by the interaction between the N atom and Li+, and form the hydrogen bond with TFSI&#8722; anion, which can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI to form DEE. More importantly, due to the absence of active &#945;&#8208;hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility. Polymer electrolytes based on this DEE exhibit high ionic conductivity (0.67&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C), high oxidation voltage (5.0&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), favorable interfacial stability, and nonflammability. Li&#8214;LFP and Li&#8214;NCM811 full batteries utilizing this DEE polymer electrolyte exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability and excellent rate performance at high rates. Therefore, the new DMMN&#8208;based DEE overcomes the limitations of traditional electrolytes in electrode interface compatibility and opens new possibilities for improving the performance of LMBs.

         <title>In Vivo Synthetic Anticancer Approach by Resourcing Mouse Blood Albumin as a Biocompatible Artificial Metalloenzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs), capable of in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, were prepared using circulating albumin in the bloodstream, through the reaction with a ruthenium catalyst. The in situ prepared ArM was transported to the cancer and catalyzed a reaction with proapoptotic peptides, effectively suppressing cancer proliferation.







Abstract
Methods for producing drugs directly at the cancer site, particularly using bioorthogonal metal catalysts, are being explored to mitigate the side effects of therapy. Albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) catalyze reactions in living mice while protecting the catalyst in the hydrophobic pocket. Here, we describe the in situ preparation and application of biocompatible tumor&#8208;targeting ArMs using circulating albumin, which is abundant in the bloodstream. The ArM was formed using blood albumin through the intravenous injection of ruthenium conjugated with an albumin&#8208;binding ligand; the tumor&#8208;targeting unit was conjugated to the ArM using its catalytic activity, and the ArM was transported to the cancer site. The delivered ArM catalyzed a second tagging reaction of the proapoptotic peptide on the cancer surface, successfully suppressing cancer proliferation. This approach, which efficiently leveraged the persisting reactivity twice in vivo, holds promise for future in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis utilizing endogenous albumin.

Desymmetrization of 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutanols via asymmetric Cu&#8208;catalyzed borylation creates axially chiral allylboranes in high enantiomeric ratio for both enantiomers. The axial&#8208;to&#8208;chiral transfer is possible through diastereoconvergent allylation with aldehydes, proving the preference for the same diastereoisomeric homoallylic alcohol, creating two new stereocenters and one pseudoasymemtric center with stereoretention for both enantiomers.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic borylation of 3,3&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutan&#8208;1&#8208;ols renders axially chiral allylborane systems, with high asymmetric induction for both enantiomers, by precise selection of the cis or trans substrate. The enantioenriched alkylidenecyclobutanes served as chiral platform to prove the conceptually challenging transference of the axial&#8208;to&#8208;point chirality through two new stereocenters and one pseudoasymmetric carbon generated via diastereoconvergent allylation of aldehydes, without enantioselective erosion.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Deracemization Enabled Enantioselective and Modular Access to Axially Chiral N&#8208;Arylquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces a novel photoredox catalytic strategy for deracemization of axially chiral molecules, overcoming the challenge of relying on energy transfer mechanisms for chiral center removal that necessitate feedstocks with low triplet energy levels. This strategy has been verified by the precise synthesis of valuable and hard&#8208;to&#8208;obtain axially chiral 2&#8208;azaarene&#8208;functionalized quinazolinones.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;driven photocatalytic deracemization is highly esteemed as an ideal tool for organic synthesis due to its exceptional atom economy and synthetic efficiency. Consequently, successful instances of deracemization of allenes have been established, where the activated energy of photosensitizer should surpass that of the substrates, representing an intrinsic requirement. Accordingly, this method is not applicable for axially chiral molecules with significantly high triplet energies. In this study, we present a photoredox catalytic deracemization approach that enables the efficient synthesis of valuable yet challenging&#8208;to&#8208;access axially chiral 2&#8208;azaarene&#8208;functionalized quinazolinones. The substrate scope is extensive, allowing for both 3&#8208;axis and unmet 1&#8208;axis assembly through facile oxidation of diverse central chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolin&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;ones that can be easily prepared and achieve enantiomer enrichment via deracemization. Mechanistic studies reveal the importance of photosensitizer selection in attaining excellent chemoselectivity and highlight the indispensability of a chiral Br&#248;nsted acid in enabling highly enantioselective protonation to accomplish efficient deracemization.

         <title>Highly Reversible Sodium&#8208;ion Storage in A Bifunctional Nanoreactor Based on Single&#8208;atom Mn Supported on N&#8208;doped Carbon over MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional nanoreactor of single&#8208;atom Mn supported on N&#8208;doped carbon is constructed over MoS2 nanosheets. It facilitates the reversible conversion of MoS2 during sodium storage by not only confining the volume change and agglomeration of discharge products but also providing catalytic Mn&#8722;N4 sites for the charging process.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type electrode materials have gained massive research attention in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), but their limited reversibility hampers practical use. Herein, we report a bifunctional nanoreactor to boost highly reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage, wherein a record&#8208;high reversible degree of 85.65&#8201;% is achieved for MoS2 anodes. Composed of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported single atom Mn (NC&#8208;SAMn), this bifunctional nanoreactor concurrently confines active materials spatially and catalyzes reaction kinetics. In situ/ex situ characterizations including spectroscopy, microscopy, and electrochemistry, combined with theoretical simulations containing density functional theory and molecular dynamics, confirm that the NC&#8208;SAMn nanoreactors facilitate the electron/ion transfer, promote the distribution and interconnection of discharging products (Na2S/Mo), and reduce the Na2S decomposition barrier. As a result, the nanoreactor&#8208;promoted MoS2 anodes exhibit ultra&#8208;stable cycling with a capacity retention of 99.86&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles in the full cell. This work demonstrates the superiority of bifunctional nanoreactors with two&#8208;dimensional confined and catalytic effects, providing a feasible approach to improve the reversibility for a wide range of conversion&#8208;type electrode materials, thereby enhancing the application potential for long&#8208;cycled SIBs.

         <title>Modulating Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited States of Multiple Resonance Emitters via Intramolecular Covalent Bond Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular Scholl reaction of two adjacent 3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole moieties in an oligoarylene&#8208;carbazole forms a multiple resonance (MR) emitter m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz with a [1,4]&#8208;diazocine&#8208;embedded core. Here, the charge&#8208;transfer excited state of the MR emitter is modulated by intramolecular covalent bond locking, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of the organic electroluminescent material.







Abstract
Advanced multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with high efficiency and color purity have emerged as a research focus in the development of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we disclose an approach to modulate the charge&#8208;transfer excited states of MR emitters via intramolecular covalent bond locking. This strategy can promote the evolution of strong intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) states into weak ICT states, ultimately narrowing the full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of emitters. To modulate the ICT intensity, two octagonal rings are introduced to yield molecule m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz. Compounds m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit bright light&#8208;green and green fluorescence in toluene, with emission maxima of 504 and 513&#8197;nm, and FWHMs of 28 and 34&#8197;nm, respectively. Sensitized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing emitters m&#8208;CzDAz&#8208;BNCz and m&#8208;DCzDAz&#8208;BNCz exhibit green emission with peaks of 508 and 520&#8197;nm, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.12, 0.65) and (0.19, 0.69), and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 30.2&#8201;% and 32.6&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Healable, Recyclable, and Upcyclable Gel Membranes for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study details the synthesis of an ionogel membrane with copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ionic liquids, enhancing its mechanical strength, self&#8208;healing, recycling, and upcycling capabilities. These enhancements, combined with superior carbon dioxide selectivity, affirm its potential as a sustainable, high&#8208;performance material for efficient gas separation.







Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are prized for their selective dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2), leading to their widespread use in ionogel membranes for gas separation. Despite their advantages, creating sustainable ionogel membranes with high IL contents poses challenges due to limited mechanical strength, leakage risks, and poor recyclability. Herein, we leverage copolymerized and supramolecularly bound ILs to develop ionogel membranes with high mechanical strength, zero leakage, and excellent self&#8208;healing and recycling capabilities. These membranes exhibit superior ideal selectivity for gas separation compared to other reported ionogel membranes, achieving a CO2/nitrogen selectivity of 61.7 and a CO2/methane selectivity of 24.6, coupled with an acceptable CO2 permeability of 186.4 Barrer. Additionally, these gas separation ionogel membranes can be upcycled into ionic skins for sensing applications, further enhancing their utility. This research outlines a strategic approach to molecularly engineer ionogel membranes, offering a promising pathway for developing sustainable, high&#8208;performance materials for advanced gas separation technologies.

         <title>Rapid Aminations of Functionalized Aryl Fluorosulfates in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminations of aryl fluorosulfates, an alternative non&#8208;PFAS pseudohalide, using a novel Pd oxidative addition complex, has been demonstrated. This complex substitutes PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, operates efficiently under aqueous micellar conditions, and is compatible with diverse coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, under mild and environmentally benign conditions.







Abstract
Aryl fluorosulfates of varying complexities have been used in amination reactions in water using a new Pd oxidative addition complex (OAC&#8208;1) developed specifically to match the needs of the fine chemicals industry, not only in terms of functional group tolerance, but also reflecting time considerations associated with these important C&#8722;N couplings. Also especially noteworthy is that they replace both PFAS&#8208;related triflates and nonaflates, which are today out of favor due to recent government regulations. The new complex based on the BippyPhos ligand is used at low loadings and under aqueous micellar conditions. Moreover, it is easily prepared and stable to long term storage. DFT calculations on the OAC precatalyst compare well with the X&#8208;ray structure of the crystals with &#960;&#8208;complexation to the aromatic system of the ligand and also confirm the NMR data showing a mixture of conformers in solution that differ from the X&#8208;ray structure in rotation of the phenyl and t&#8208;butyl ligand substituents. An extensive variety of coupling partners, including pharmaceutically relevant APIs, readily participate under mild and environmentally responsible reaction conditions.

Machine learning models trained on mechanistic datasets created using expert reaction templates demonstrate the ability to successfully predict known reaction mechanisms. This study illustrates how such mechanistic models can explain how reaction outcomes are produced, recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents, and suggest potential side products and impurities.







Abstract
Mechanistic understanding of organic reactions can facilitate reaction development, impurity prediction, and in principle, reaction discovery. While several machine learning models have sought to address the task of predicting reaction products, their extension to predicting reaction mechanisms has been impeded by the lack of a corresponding mechanistic dataset. In this study, we construct such a dataset by imputing intermediates between experimentally reported reactants and products using expert reaction templates and train several machine learning models on the resulting dataset of 5,184,184&#8197;elementary steps. We explore the performance and capabilities of these models, focusing on their ability to predict reaction pathways and recapitulate the roles of catalysts and reagents. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of mechanistic models in predicting impurities, often overlooked by conventional models. We conclude by evaluating the generalizability of mechanistic models to new reaction types, revealing challenges related to dataset diversity, consecutive predictions, and violations of atom conservation.

         <title>Near&#8208;Full&#8208;Spectrum Emission Realized in a Single Lead Halide Perovskite across the Visible&#8208;Light Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;full &#8208;spectrum emissions are achieved in a single component 2D lead halide perovskites by applying hydrostatic pressure.This work establishes a new pathway to achieve the PL full&#8208;spectrum emission and provide valuable insights into the relationship between the HP&#8208;PL emissions and high&#8208;pressure phase transitions.







Abstract
The engineering of tunable photoluminescence (PL) in single materials with a full&#8208;spectrum emission represents a highly coveted objective but poses a formidable challenge. In this context, the realization of near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum PL emission, spanning the visible light range from 424 to 620&#8197;nm, in a single&#8208;component two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid lead halide perovskite, (ETA)2PbBr4 (ETA+=(HO)(CH2)2NH3+), is reported, achieved through high&#8208;pressure treatment. A pressure&#8208;induced phase transition occurs upon compression, transforming the crystal structure from an orthorhombic phase under ambient conditions to a monoclinic structure at high pressure. This phase transition driven by the adaptive and dynamic configuration changes of organic amine cations enables an effective and continuous narrowing of the band gap in this halide crystal. The hydrogen bonding interactions between inorganic layers and organic amine cations (N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br and O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br hydrogen bonds) efficiently modulate the organic amine cations penetration and the octahedral distortion. Consequently, this phenomenon induces a phase transition and results in red&#8208;shifted PL emissions, leading to the near&#8208;full&#8208;spectrum emission. This work opens a possibility for achieving wide PL emissions with coverage across the visible light spectrum by employing high pressure in single halide perovskites.

         <title>Mixed Crystalline Covalent Heptazine Frameworks with Built&#8208;in Heterojunction Structures towards Efficient Photocatalytic Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed crystalline m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 constructed by PHI network and internally embedded phenyl&#8208;linked heptazine framework (CHF&#8722;Ph) is synthesized via an in situ strategy. PHI and CHF&#8722;Ph form built&#8208;in type II heterojunction, and m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 has smaller exciton binding energy than pure PHI. The hydrogen evolution from photocatalytic formic acid dehydrogenation reaches a high apparent quantum yield of 24.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, which surpasses most of the other organic photocatalysts.







Abstract
Covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) are widely utilized in the recent years as potential photocatalysts. However, their limited conjugated structures, low crystallinity and small surface areas have restricted the practical photocatalysis performance. Along this line, we report herein the synthesis of a kind of mixed crystalline CHF (m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1) with built&#8208;in heterojunction structure, which can efficiently catalyze the formic acid dehydrogenation by visible light driven photocatalysis. The m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 is synthesized from 2,5,8&#8208;triamino&#8208;heptazine and dicyanobenzene (DCB) in the molten salts, in which DCB plays as organic molten co&#8208;solvent to promote the rapid and ordered polymerization of 2,5,8&#8208;triamino&#8208;heptazine. The m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 is formed by embedding phenyl&#8208;linked heptazine (CHF&#8722;Ph) units in the poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) network similar to doping. The CHF&#8722;Ph combined with PHI form an effective type II heterojunction structure, which promote the directional transfer of charge carriers. And the integration of CHF&#8722;Ph makes m&#8208;CHF&#8208;1 have smaller exciton binding energy than pure PHI, the charge carriers are more easily dissociated to form free electrons, resulting in higher utilization efficiency of the carriers. The largest hydrogen evolution rate reaches a value of 42.86&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high apparent quantum yield of 24.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm, which surpasses the majority of other organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Bilateral Embedded Anchoring via Tailored Polymer Brush for Large&#8208;Area Air&#8208;Processed Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistical manipulation strategy of bilateral embedded anchoring by planting polymer brush in the inorganic HTL is important to realize air&#8208;processed blue PeLEDs and the highly desirable for large&#8208;area devices. The efficiencies of the achieved air&#8208;processed large&#8208;area blue PeLEDs reached 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure&#8208;bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glove box.







Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) that can be air&#8208;processed promises the development of displaying optoelectronic device, while is challenged by technical difficulty on both the active layer and hole transport layer (HTL) caused by the unavoidable humidity interference. Here, we propose and validate that, planting the polymer brush with tailored functional groups in inorganic HTL, provides unique bilateral embedded anchoring that is capable of simultaneously addressing the n phases crystallization rates in the active layer as well as the deteriorated particulate surface defects in HTL. Exemplified by zwitterionic polyethyleneimine&#8208;sulfonate (PEIS) in present study, its implanting in NiOx HTL offers abundant nuclei sites of amino and sulfonate groups that balance the growth rate of different n phases in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. Moreover, the PEIS effectively nailed the interfacial contact between perovskite and NiOx, and reduced the particulate surface defects in HTL, leading to the enhanced PLQY and stability of large&#8208;area blue perovskite film in ambient air. By virtue of these merits, present work achieves the first demonstration of the air&#8208;processed blue PeLEDs in large emitting area of 1.0&#8197;cm2 with peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure&#8208;bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glovebox.

         <title>Non&#8208;Isocyanate Synthesis of Covalent Adaptable Networks Based on Dynamic Hindered Urea Bonds: Sequential Polymerization and Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;isocyanate synthetic pathway for dynamic hindered urea bonds was demonstrated using a ring&#8208;opening reaction between thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;one and 1,3&#8208;di(piperidin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)propane. The resulting thiol groups formed covalent adaptable networks (CANs) via click reactions. These CANs can be selectively controlled by activating each dynamic bond, providing multiple pathways for reprocessing, chemical recycling, and reutilization.







Abstract
The development of environmentally sustainable processes for polymer recycling is of paramount importance in the polymer industry. In particular, the implementation of chemical recycling for thermoset polymers via covalent adaptable networks (CANs), particularly those based on the dynamic hindered urea bond (HUB), has garnered intensive attention from both the academic and industrial sectors. This interest stems from its straightforward chemical structure and reaction mechanism, which are well&#8208;suited for commercial polyurethane and polyurea applications. However, a substantial drawback of these CANs is the requisite use of toxic isocyanate curing agents for their synthesis. Herein, we propose a new HUB synthesis pathway involving thiazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one and a hindered amine. This ring&#8208;opening reaction facilitates the isocyanate&#8208;free formation of a HUB and enables sequential reactions with acrylate and epoxide monomers via thiol&#8211;Michael and thiol&#8211;epoxy click chemistry. The CANs synthesized using this methodology exhibit superior reprocessability, chemical recyclability, and reutilizability, facilitated by specific catalytic and solvent conditions, through the reversible HUB, thiol&#8211;Michael addition, and transesterification processes.

     alt="Non-Isocyanate Synthesis of Covalent Adaptable Networks Based on Dynamic Hindered Urea Bonds: Sequential Polymerization and Chemical Recycling"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A non-isocyanate synthetic pathway for dynamic hindered urea bonds was demonstrated using a ring-opening reaction between thiazolidine-2-one and 1,3-di(piperidin-4-yl)propane. The resulting thiol groups formed covalent adaptable networks (CANs) via click reactions. These CANs can be selectively controlled by activating each dynamic bond, providing multiple pathways for reprocessing, chemical recycling, and reutilization.

         <title>Four&#8208;Membered Ring&#8208;Embedded Cycloarene Enabling Anti&#8208;Aromaticity and Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene MF2 was synthesized, demonstrating the local anti&#8208;aromaticity and ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit FWHM of only 7&#8197;nm, which sets a new record of FWHM among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules. Here, we provide an innovative design strategy to synthesize ultra&#8208;narrowband emission materials for the OLED display technology.







Abstract
The synthesis of fully fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated cycloarenes embedded with nonbenzenoid aromatics is challenging. In this work, the first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene (MF2) was designed and synthesized in single&#8208;crystal form by macrocyclization and ring fusion strategies. For comparison, single bond&#8208;linked chiral macrocycle MS2 without two fused four&#8208;membered rings and its linear&#8208;shaped polycyclic benzenoid monomer L1 were also synthesized. The pronounced anti&#8208;aromaticity of four&#8208;membered rings significantly adjusts the electronic structures and photophysical properties of cycloarene, resulting in an enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 10.66&#8201;% and 10.74&#8201;% for L1 and MS2, respectively, to 54.05&#8201;% for MF2, which is the highest PLQY among the reported cycloarenes. Notably, owing to the embedded anti&#8208;aromatic four&#8208;membered rings that reduce structural displacements, MF2 exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 7&#8197;nm (0.038&#8197;eV), which sets a new record among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules, and represents the first example of ultra&#8208;narrowband emission in conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) devoid of heteroatoms.

         <title>A Soft, Fatigue&#8208;free, and Self&#8208;healable Ionic Elastomer via the Synergy of Skin&#8208;like Assembly and Bouligand Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of skin&#8208;like functional properties (softness, strain stiffening, self&#8208;healing, and stretchability) together with ultra&#8208;high fracture toughness and fatigue resistance are realized by fusing a unique structural&#8208;compositional design involving dermal binary assembly and Bouligand structure.







Abstract
Soft ionic elastomers that are self&#8208;healable, fatigue&#8208;free, and environment&#8208;tolerant are ideal structural and sensing materials for artificial prosthetics, soft electronics, and robotics to survive unpredictable service conditions. However, most synthetic strategies failed to unite rapid healing, fatigue resistance, and environmental robustness, limited by their singular compositional/structural designs. Here, we present a soft, tough, fatigue&#8208;resistant, and self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer (STFSI elastomer), which fuses skin&#8208;like binary assembly and Bouligand helicoidal structure into a composite of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fibers and a supramolecular ionic biopolymer. The interlocked binary assembly enables skin&#8208;like softness, high stretchability, and strain&#8208;adaptive stiffening through a matrix&#8208;to&#8208;scaffold stress transfer. The Bouligand structure contributes to superhigh fracture toughness (101.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2) and fatigue resistance (4937&#8197;J&#8201;m&#8722;2) via mechanical toughening by interlayer slipping and twisted crack propagation path. Besides, the STFSI elastomer is self&#8208;healable through a &#8220;bridging&#8221; method and environment&#8208;tolerant (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C, strong acid/alkali, saltwater). To demonstrate the versatile structural and sensing applications, we showcase a safety cushion with efficient damping and suppressed rebounding, and a robotic sensor with excellent fatigue crack tolerance and instant sensation recovery upon cutting&#8208;off damage. Our presented synthetic strategy is generalizable to other fiber&#8208;reinforced tough polymers for applications involving demanding mechanical/environmental conditions.

         <title>MXene Supported Electrodeposition Engineering of Layer Double Hydroxide for Alkaline Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene is developed as a functional additive for the modified electrodeposition preparation of nickel cobalt layered double hydroxides. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of active materials, the resulting binder&#8208;free layered double hydroxides electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading with high areal capacity and cycling stability.







Abstract
The main challenges faced by aqueous rechargeable nickel&#8208;zinc batteries are their comparatively low energy density and poor cycling stability, mainly due to the limited capacity and reversibility of existing Ni&#8208;based cathodes. Moreover, the preparation procedures of these cathodes are complex and not easily scalable, which makes them less promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Herein, we utilized MXene as a functional additive to effectively improve the electrodeposition preparation of NiCo layered double hydroxides (LDH). Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam (NF) and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of platting product based on MXene additives, the resulting binder&#8208;free NiCo LDH electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading (~65&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with abundant active surface for redox reactions and maintained short transport pathway for ion diffusion and charge transfer. Furthermore, the as&#8208;fabricated alkaline NiCo LDH&#8208;based battery delivers high discharge capacity, up to 20.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (311&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), accompanied by remarkable rate performance (9.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 or 148&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Due to the high structural and chemical stability of MXenes/LDH&#8208;based electrode, excellent cycling life can also be achieved with 88.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10000 cycles. In addition, ultrahigh areal energy density (31.2&#8197;mWh cm&#8722;2) and gravimetric energy density (465&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) can be simultaneously achieved. This work has inspired the design of advanced cathode materials to develop high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc batteries.

         <title>A General Copper&#8208;Box System for the Asymmetric Arylative Functionalization of Benzylic, Propargylic or Allenylic Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general copper&#8208;Box system was reported for asymmetric three&#8208;component arylative radical cross&#8208;coupling of vinylarenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes, with oxime carbonates and aryl boronic acids.

Radical&#8208;involved arylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions have recently emerged as an attractive strategy to access valuable aryl&#8208;substituted motifs. However, there still exist several challenges such as limited scope of radical precursors/acceptors, and lack of general asymmetric catalytic systems, especially regarding the multicomponent variants. Herein, we reported a general copper&#8208;Box system for asymmetric three&#8208;component arylative radical cross&#8208;coupling of vinylarenes and 1,3&#8208;enynes, with oxime carbonates and aryl boronic acids. The reactions proceed under practical conditions in the absence or presence of visible&#8208;light irradiation, affording chiral 1,1&#8208;diarylalkanes, benzylic alkynes and allenes with good enantioselectivities. Mechanistic studies imply that the copper/Box complexes play a dual role in both radical generation and ensuing asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling. In the cases of 1,3&#8208;enynes, visible&#8208;light irradiation could improve the activity of copper/Box complex toward the initial radical generation, enabling better efficiency match between radical formation and cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Zwitterionic Acridinium Amidate: A Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Radical Catalyst for Photoinduced Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the long and rich history of photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) catalysis, the primary structures of existing catalysts rely on molecular entities containing oxo groups, particularly with aromatic ketones and inorganic polyoxometalates. Here, we disclose zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a photoreactive nitrogen&#8208;centered radical precursors, which exhibit prominent reactivity to cleave aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
The development of small organic molecules that can convert light energy into chemical energy to directly promote molecular transformation is of fundamental importance in chemical science. Herein, we report a zwitterionic acridinium amidate as a catalyst for the direct functionalization of aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This organic zwitterion absorbs visible light to generate the corresponding amidyl radical in the form of excited&#8208;state triplet diradical with prominent reactivity for hydrogen atom transfer to facilitate C&#8722;H alkylation with a high turnover number. The experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the noncovalent interactions between the anionic amidate nitrogen and a pertinent hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, such as hexafluoroisopropanol, are crucial for ensuring the efficient generation of catalytically active species, thereby fully eliciting the distinct reactivity of the acridinium amidate as a photoinduced direct hydrogen atom transfer catalyst.

         <title>Dissecting Exciton Dynamics in pH&#8208;Activatable Long&#8208;Wavelength Photosensitizers for Traceable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers (LET&#8208;R, R = H, Cl, Br, and I) was developed by dissecting exciton dynamics, which could be specifically activated by the acidic tumor microenvironment to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) upon 808&#8197;nm laser excitation, enabling fluorescence (FL)/photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;modal molecular imaging&#8208;escorted efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT).







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;specific activatable long&#8208;wavelength (LW) photosensitizers (PSs) show promise in overcoming the limitations of traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT), such as systemic phototoxicity and shallow tissue penetration. However, their insufficient LW light absorption and low singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934; 1O2) usually require high laser power density to produce thermal energy and synergistically enhance PDT. The strong photothermal radiation causing acute pain significantly reduces patient compliance and hinders the broader clinical application of LW PDT. Through the exciton dynamics dissection strategy, we have developed a series of pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based LW PSs (LET&#8208;R, R = H, Cl, Br, I), among which the activated LET&#8208;I exhibits strong light absorption at 808&#8197;nm and a remarkable 3.2&#8208;fold enhancement in &#934; 1O2 compared to indocyanine green. Transient spectroscopic analysis and theoretical calculations confirmed its significantly promoted intersystem crossing and simultaneously enhanced LW fluorescence emission characteristics. These features enable the activatable fluorescence and photoacoustic dual&#8208;modal imaging&#8208;escorted complete photodynamic eradication of tumors by the folic acid (FA)&#8208;modified LET&#8208;I probe (LET&#8208;I&#8208;FA), under the ultralow 808&#8197;nm laser power density (0.2&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for irradiation, without the need for photothermal energy synergy. This research presents a novel strategy of dissecting exciton dynamics to screen activatable LW PSs for traceable PDT.

         <title>Synergistic Active Heterostructure Design for Enhanced Two Electron Oxygen Reduction via Chemical and Electrochemical Reconstruction of Heterosulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing nickel/indium sulfide heterostructures, we enable enhanced electrochemical and chemical reconstruction processes, resulting in the formation of nickel oxyhydroxides coupled with indium hydroxides. The electrochemical transformation yields abundant bridging oxygen&#8208;deficient [NiO6]&#8208;[InO6] units, promoting the cooperation of active Ni and In sites, and ultimately leading to improved performance for alkaline 2e&#8722; ORR.







Abstract
Transition metal sulfides, particularly heterostructures, represent a promising class of electrocatalysts for two electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR), however, understanding the dynamic structural evolution of these catalysts during alkaline ORR remains relatively unexplored. Herein, NiS2/In2.77S4 heterostructure was synthesized as a precatalyst and through a series of comprehensive ex situ and in situ characterizations, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transient photo&#8208;induced voltage measurements, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and spherical aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy, it was revealed that nickel/indium (oxy)hydroxides (NiOOH/In(OH)3) could be evolved from the initial NiS2/In2.77S4 via both electrochemical and chemical&#8208;driven methods. The electrochemical&#8208;driven phase featured abundant bridging oxygen&#8208;deficient [NiO6]&#8208;[InO6] units at the interfaces of NiOOH/In(OH)3, facilitating a synergistic effect between active Ni and In sites, thus enabling an enhanced alkaline 2e&#8722; ORR capability than that of chemical&#8208;driven process. Remarkably, electrochemically induced NiOOH/In(OH)3 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving H2O2 selectivity of &gt;90&#8201;% across the wide potential window (up to 0.4&#8197;V) with a peak selectivity of &gt;99&#8201;%. Notably, within the three&#8208;electrode flow cell, a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was sustained over 20&#8197;h, together with an impressive Faradaic efficiency of ~90&#8201;% during the whole cycle process.

         <title>[4]Rhombene: Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Application in Distributed Feedback Lasers With Emission Beyond 830&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphene, [4]rhombene, was synthesized by solution&#8208;phase chemistry and isolated in single&#8208;crystal form. It was successfully applied in solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers, showing emission beyond 830&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Graphene&#8208;like molecules with multiple zigzag edges are emerging as promising gain materials for organic lasers. Their emission wavelengths can vary widely, ranging from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR), as the molecular size increases. Specifically, rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphenes with two pairs of parallel zigzag edges, known as [n]rhombenes, are excellent candidates for NIR lasers due to their small energy gaps. However, synthesizing large&#8208;size rhombenes with emission beyond 800&#8197;nm in solution remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthesis of an aryl&#8208;substituted [4]rhombene derivative, [4]RB&#8208;Ar, using a method that combines intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling with Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers. The structure of [4]RB&#8208;Ar was confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis.

     alt="[4]Rhombene: Solution-Phase Synthesis and Application in Distributed Feedback Lasers With Emission Beyond 830&#8197;nm"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rhombus-shaped molecular graphene, [4]rhombene, was synthesized by solution-phase chemistry and isolated in single-crystal form. It was successfully applied in solution-processed distributed feedback lasers, showing emission beyond 830&#8197;nm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphene-like molecules with multiple zigzag edges are emerging as promising gain materials for organic lasers. Their emission wavelengths can vary widely, ranging from visible to near-infrared (NIR), as the molecular size increases. Specifically, rhombus-shaped molecular graphenes with two pairs of parallel zigzag edges, known as [n]rhombenes, are excellent candidates for NIR lasers due to their small energy gaps. However, synthesizing large-size rhombenes with emission beyond 800&#8197;nm in solution remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthesis of an aryl-substituted [4]rhombene derivative, &lt;b&gt;[4]RB-Ar&lt;/b&gt;, using a method that combines intramolecular radical-radical coupling with Bi(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers. The structure of &lt;b&gt;[4]RB-Ar&lt;/b&gt; was confirmed through X-ray crystallographic analysis. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that aromatic sextets are predominantly localized along the molecule's long axis. Significantly, &lt;b&gt;[4]RB-Ar&lt;/b&gt; demonstrates narrow amplified spontaneous emission at around 834&#8197;nm when dispersed in polystyrene thin films. Moreover, solution-processed distributed feedback lasers employing &lt;b&gt;[4]RB-Ar&lt;/b&gt; as the active gain material display tunable narrow emissions in the range of 830 to 844&#8197;nm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent Asymmetric Difunctionalization of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of ligand&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process has been reported, providing an economic approach to valuable chiral &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;allylic boronates. Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
We herein describe the first example of ligand&#8208;controlled, copper&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent asymmetric difunctionalization of terminal alkynes through a cascade hydroboration and hydroallylation process. The catalytic system, consisting of (R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;Segphos and CuBr, could efficiently achieve asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization of aryl terminal alkynes, while ligand switching to (S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE could result in asymmetric 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization exclusively. In addition, alkyl substituted terminal alkynes, especially industrially relevant acetylene and propyne, were also valid feedstocks for asymmetric 1,1&#8208;difunctionalization. This protocol is characterized by good functional group tolerance, a broad scope of substrates (&gt;150&#8197;examples), and mild reaction conditions. We also showcase the value of this method in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complicated bioactive molecules and simplifying the synthetic routes toward the key intermediacy of natural product (bruguierol&#8197;A). Mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations provide insight into the mechanism and origins of this ligand&#8208;controlled regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective isomerization&#8208;hydroamidocarbonylation of amide&#8208;containing alkenes to access chiral &#945;&#8208;alkyl succinimides was developed. The key to success was adopting P&#8208;chirogenic bisphosphine ligand featured with bulky 1&#8208;adamentyl P&#8208;substitution and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethoxyphenyl group to create stronger steric hinderance and deeper catalytic pocket.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric isomerization&#8208;hydroamidocarbonylation of amide&#8208;containing alkenes was developed, affording a variety of chiral &#945;&#8208;alkyl succinimides in moderate to good yields with high enantioselectivities. The key to success was introducing bulky 1&#8208;adamentyl P&#8208;substitution and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethoxyphenyl group into the rigid P&#8208;chirogenic bisphosphine ligand to create stronger steric hinderance and deeper catalytic pocket. By this approach, regio&#8208; or stereo&#8208;convergent synthesis of enantiomeric succinimides from the mixture of olefin isomers was achieved.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Cuprous&#8208;Based Metal Halides with Unique Two&#8208;Dimensional Crystal Structure for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halide, (DFPD)CuX2 (where DFPD+=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium and X&#8722;=Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;), was synthesized. Its conduction band displays enhanced dispersive characteristics with a small effective mass, facilitating higher electron mobility and more efficient electrical injection in light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) applications.







Abstract
Ternary cuprous (Cu+)&#8208;based metal halides, represented by cesium copper iodide (e.g., CsCu2I3 and Cs3Cu2I5), are garnering increasing interest for light&#8208;emitting applications owing to their intrinsically high photoluminescence quantum yield and direct band gap. Toward electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), it is highly desirable for the light emitters to have a high structural dimensionality as it may favor efficient electrical injection. However, unlike lead&#8208;based halide perovskites whose light&#8208;emitting units can be facilely arranged in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ways, to date, nearly all ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides crystallize into 0D or 1D networks of Cu&#8722;X (X=Cl, Br, I) polyhedra, whereas 3D and even 2D structures remain mostly uncharted. Here, by employing a fluorinated organic cation, we report a new kind of ternary Cu+&#8208;based metal halides, (DFPD)CuX2 (DFPD+=4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidinium), which exhibits unique 2D layered crystal structure. Theoretical calculations reveal a highly dispersive conduction band of (DFPD)CuBr2, which is beneficial for charge carrier injection. It is also of particular significance to find that the 2D (DFPD)CuBr2 crystals show appealing properties, including improved ambient stability and an efficient warm white&#8208;light emission, making it a promising candidate for single&#8208;component lighting and display applications.

         <title>Phenyl&#8208;Extended Resorcin[4]arenes: Synthesis and Highly Efficient Iodine Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of synthetic macrocycles, phenyl&#8208;extended resorcin[4]arenes (ExR4), were designed and synthesized. By incorporating unsubstituted phenylene moieties into the resorcin[4]arene scaffold, ExR4 exhibited a flexible backbone. Most importantly, ExR4 displayed remarkable potential in constructing adsorptive materials for iodine capture.







Abstract
The continuous exploration of new analogs of calixarenes and pillararenes unlocks infinite opportunities in supramolecular chemistry and materials. In this work, we introduce a new class of macrocycle, phenyl&#8208;extended resorcin[4]arenes (ExR4), a unique and innovative design that incorporates unsubstituted phenylene moieties into the resorcin[4]arene scaffold. Single&#8208;crystal analysis reveals a chair&#8208;like conformation for per&#8208;methylated ExR4 (Me&#8208;ExR4) and a twisted &#8220;Figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight&#8221; shaped conformation for per&#8208;hydroxylated ExR4 (OH&#8208;ExR4). Notably, OH&#8208;ExR4 demonstrates exceptional adsorption capability toward I3&#8722; ions in an aqueous solution, with a rapid kinetic rate of 1.18&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1. Furthermore, OH&#8208;ExR4 shows excellent recyclability and potential as a stationary phase in column setups. The discovery of ExR4 opens up new avenues for constructing new macrocycles and inspires further research in functional adsorption materials for water pollutant removal.

&lt;p&gt;The continuous exploration of new analogs of calixarenes and pillararenes unlocks infinite opportunities in supramolecular chemistry and materials. In this work, we introduce a new class of macrocycle, phenyl-extended resorcin[4]arenes (&lt;b&gt;ExR4&lt;/b&gt;), a unique and innovative design that incorporates unsubstituted phenylene moieties into the resorcin[4]arene scaffold. Single-crystal analysis reveals a chair-like conformation for per-methylated &lt;b&gt;ExR4&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Me-ExR4&lt;/b&gt;) and a twisted &#8220;Figure-of-eight&#8221; shaped conformation for per-hydroxylated &lt;b&gt;ExR4&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;OH-ExR4&lt;/b&gt;). Notably, &lt;b&gt;OH-ExR4&lt;/b&gt; demonstrates exceptional adsorption capability toward I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions in an aqueous solution, with a rapid kinetic rate of 1.18&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;b&gt;OH-ExR4&lt;/b&gt; shows excellent recyclability and potential as a stationary phase in column setups. The discovery of &lt;b&gt;ExR4&lt;/b&gt; opens up new avenues for constructing new macrocycles and inspires further research in functional adsorption materials for water pollutant removal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable and Totally Renewable Liquid Crystal Networks with Room&#8208;Temperature Programmability and Reconfigurable Functionalities</title>

         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemically recyclable azobenzene&#8208;based dynamic covalent liquid crystal network (Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCN) is reported. The Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCN can be programmed, upon water&#8208;soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light&#8208;driven actuator, which can be depolymerized to recover both monomers in high purity. The recovered monomers can be used to regenerate totally new Azo&#8208;DCv&#8208;LCNs with reconfigured functionalities by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent liquid crystal networks (DCv&#8208;LCNs) with straightforward (re)programmability, reprocessability, and recyclability facilitates the manufacture of sophisticated LCN actuators and intelligent robots. However, the DCv&#8208;LCNs are still limited to heat&#8208;assisted programming and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer reprocessing/recycling, which inevitably lead to deterioration of the LCN structures and the actuation performances after repeated programming/processing treatments, owing to the thermal degradation of the polymer network and/or external agent interference. Here, a totally renewable azobenzene&#8208;based DCv&#8208;LCN with room&#8208;temperature programmability and polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomers chemical recyclability is reported, which was synthesized by crosslinking the azobenzene&#8208;containing dibenzaldehyde monomer and the triamine monomer via the dynamic and dissociable imine bonds. Thanks to the water&#8208;activated dynamics of the imine bonds, the resultant DCv&#8208;LCN can be simply programmed, upon water&#8208;soaking at room temperature, to yield a UV/Vis light&#8208;driven actuator. Importantly, the reported DCv&#8208;LCN undergoes depolymerization in an acid&#8208;solvent medium at room temperature because of the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the imine bonds, giving rise to easy separation and recovery of both monomers in high purity, even with tolerance to additives. The recovered pure monomers can be used to regenerate totally new DCv&#8208;LCNs and actuators, and their functionalities can be reconfigured by removing old and introducing new additives, by implementing the closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;monomers&#8208;polymer recycling.

         <title>Shear&#8208;Strained Pd Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd single atoms suspended on interlayer unsaturated bonds of CuO atoms formed by dislocations (Pd&#8722;CuO) were synthesized through low&#8208;temperature heat treatment. Pd&#8722;CuO introduces the dynamic effects of shear stress and carrier formation into Pd single atoms on dislocations, which can promote water activation and facilitate the hydrogenation of nitrate ions to ammonia.







Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction method (NitRR) is a low&#8208;carbon, environmentally friendly, and efficient method for synthesizing ammonia, which has received widespread attention in recent years. Copper&#8208;based catalysts have a leading edge in nitrate reduction due to their good adsorption of *NO3. However, the formation of active hydrogen (*H) on Cu surfaces is difficult and insufficient, resulting in a large amount of the by&#8208;product NO2&#8722;. In this work, Pd single atoms suspended on the interlayer unsaturated bonds of CuO atoms formed due to dislocations (Pd&#8722;CuO) were prepared by low temperature treatment, and the Pd single atoms located on the dislocations were subjected to shear stress and the dynamic effect of support formation to promote the conversion of nitrate into ammonia. The catalysis had an ammonia yield of 4.2&#8197;mol.&#8201;gcat&#8722;1.&#8201;h&#8722;1, and a Faraday efficiency of 90&#8201;% for ammonia production at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE. Electrochemical in situ characterization and theoretical calculations indicate that the dynamic effects of Pd single atoms and carriers under shear stress obviously promote the production of active hydrogen, reduce the reaction energy barrier of the decision&#8208;making step for nitrate conversion to ammonia, further promote ammonia generation.

Real&#8208;time in vivo metabolic flux tracking in MIA PaCa&#8208;2 human pancreatic xenografts via MRI is made possible with [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate hyperpolarized through Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange in SHield Enables Alignment Transfer to Heteronuclei (SABRE&#8208;SHEATH). The use of a perfluorinated iridium SABRE catalyst in a fluorinated solvent and methanol blend allowed efficient separation from hyperpolarized pyruvate, ensuring biocompatibility and recyclability, and resulting in a 22&#8201;% increase in the hyperpolarized [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate signal. More details can be found in the Research Article by Jessica Ettedgui and co&#8208;workers (e202407349).

An organic zwitterion comprising an acridinium cation and an amidate anion directly linked by an N&#8211;N bond was developed by Takeshi Yanai, Olga Garc&#237;a Manche&#241;o, Kohsuke Ohmatsu, Takashi Ooi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404890). With the aid of hexafluoroisopropanol as a pertinent hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, this zwitterion acts as a trifunctional photocatalyst to achieve efficient functionalization of inert aliphatic C&#8211;H bonds with electron&#8208;deficient olefins under blue&#8208;light irradiation by sequentially engaging in the hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer, single&#8208;electron reduction, and proton transfer.

A pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) is reported by Jing Lin and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202408064). The &#8220;dormant&#8221; PS in normal cells, depicted in gray, transforms into its &#8220;active mode&#8221; (red) upon entering tumor cells through the portal, where it is activated by the acidic tumor microenvironment and generates toxic singlet oxygen under 808&#8197;nm light irradiation, selectively killing tumor cells and minimizing damage to normal tissues.

In aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries , additive molecules with high permanent dipole moment can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8211;dipole interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of the additive molecules also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with the exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Details of this research are reported by Jianwei Li, Guoliang Chai et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407439).

         <title>Substituted Maleimides: Self&#8208;Reportable Linkers and Tags in Bioconjugation, Materials Science, and Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted maleimides are a highly modifiable heterocyclic motif and represent a versatile class of site&#8208;selective linkers characterised by their small size and customisable structures. This minireview encapsulates the evolution of substituted maleimides, detailing their synthetic pathways and specific mechanisms that govern fluorescence. The ongoing development of substituted maleimides aims to expand their applications as next&#8208;generation self&#8208;reportable linkers in bioconjugation, materials science, and nanotechnology.







Abstract
Substituted maleimides are customisable fluorescent linkers and probes with adaptable reactivity and optical properties. Their compact nature and tunability has led to their use in various applications. For example, their solvatochromic properties offer real&#8208;time feedback on linking chemistry and environmental changes, essential for applications in material labelling, drug delivery, and nanoparticle functionalisation. This review focusses on developing, synthesising, and modifying substituted maleimides as environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent linkers and probes. It delves into their photophysical dynamics and strategic applications, highlighting their significant contributions to macromolecule conjugation and the development of self&#8208;reporting materials.

         <title>Artificial Polymerizations in Living Organisms for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review starts with a discussion on the diversity of artificial polymerizations, including those triggered by exogenous and endogenous stimuli, as well as those that occur spontaneously. The review also systematically summarizes the biomedical application scenarios of artificial polymerization including but not limited to safeguarding cells, modulating biological events, improving diagnostic performance, and enhancing therapeutic efficacy.







Abstract
Within living organisms, numerous nanomachines are constantly involved in complex polymerization processes, generating a diverse array of biomacromolecules for maintaining biological activities. Transporting artificial polymerizations from lab settings into biological contexts has expanded opportunities for understanding and managing biological events, creating novel cellular compartments, and introducing new functionalities. This review summarizes the recent advancements in artificial polymerizations, including those responding to external stimuli, internal environmental factors, and those that polymerize spontaneously. More importantly, the cutting&#8208;edge biomedical application scenarios of artificial polymerization, notably in safeguarding cells, modulating biological events, improving diagnostic performance, and facilitating therapeutic efficacy are highlighted. Finally, this review outlines the key challenges and technological obstacles that remain for polymerizations in biological organisms, as well as offers insights into potential directions for advancing their practical applications and clinical trials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer in a [NiFe] Hydrogenase Opens a Photochemical Shortcut for Catalytic Dihydrogen Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic studies performed at different temperatures and illumination conditions revealed light&#8208;driven and temperature&#8208;dependent electron transfer processes in a thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase, thereby demonstrating the potential of manipulating biocatalytic dihydrogen cleavage with light.







Abstract
[NiFe] hydrogenases catalyze the reversible cleavage of molecular hydrogen into protons and electrons. Here, we have studied the impact of temperature and illumination on an oxygen&#8208;tolerant and thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase by IR and EPR spectroscopy. Equilibrium mixtures of two catalytic [NiFe] states, Nia&#8208;C and Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217;, were found to drastically change with temperature, indicating a thermal exchange of electrons between the [NiFe] active site and iron&#8208;sulfur clusters of the enzyme. In addition, IR and EPR experiments performed under illumination revealed an unusual photochemical response of the enzyme. Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217;, a fully reduced hydride intermediate of the catalytic cycle, was found to be reversibly photoconverted into another catalytic state, Nia&#8208;L. In contrast to the well&#8208;known photolysis of the more oxidized hydride intermediate Nia&#8208;C, photoconversion of Nia&#8208;SR&#8217;&#8217; into Nia&#8208;L is an active&#8208;site redox reaction that involves light&#8208;driven electron transfer towards the enzyme's iron&#8208;sulfur clusters. Omitting the ground&#8208;state intermediate Nia&#8208;C, this direct interconversion of these two states represents a potential photochemical shortcut of the catalytic cycle that integrates multiple redox sites of the enzyme. In total, our findings reveal the non&#8208;local redistribution of electrons via thermal and photochemical reaction channels and the potential of accelerating or controlling [NiFe] hydrogenases by light.

&lt;p&gt;Spectroscopic studies performed at different temperatures and illumination conditions revealed light-driven and temperature-dependent electron transfer processes in a thermostable [NiFe] hydrogenase, thereby demonstrating the potential of manipulating biocatalytic dihydrogen cleavage with light.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[NiFe] hydrogenases catalyze the reversible cleavage of molecular hydrogen into protons and electrons.

         <title>Regulating Spin Polarization via Axial Nitrogen Traction at Fe&#8722;N5 Sites Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction for Zn&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the innovative design of a molten salt method, an axial N traction strategy is developed to reduce the spin polarization of the central Fe atom and achieve precise regulation of the atom. The prepared FeN5@DNC material can regulate the formation of *COOH and desorption of *CO in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, achieving ultra&#8208;high selectivity and high current density of 99&#8201;%, and running stably in both flow cell and Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with good performance. It provides a new way to realize the precise regulation of M&#8208;NC catalyst materials.







Abstract
Single Fe sites have been explored as promising catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction to value&#8208;added CO. Herein, we introduce a novel molten salt synthesis strategy for developing axial nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8208;N5 sites on ultrathin defect&#8208;rich carbon nanosheets, aiming to modulate the reaction pathway precisely. This distinctive architecture weakens the spin polarization at the Fe sites, promoting a dynamic equilibrium of activated intermediates and facilitating the balance between *COOH formation and *CO desorption at the active Fe site. Notably, the synthesized FeN5, supported on defect&#8208;rich in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (FeN5@DNC), exhibits superior performance in CO2RR, achieving a Faraday efficiency of 99&#8201;% for CO production (&#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE) in an H&#8208;cell, and maintaining a Faraday efficiency of 98&#8201;% at a current density of 270&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE) in the flow cell. Furthermore, the FeN5@DNC catalyst is assembled as a reversible Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with a cycle durability of 24&#8197;hours. In situ IR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the axial N coordination traction induces a transformation in the crystal field and local symmetry, therefore weakening the spin polarization of the central Fe atom and lowering the energy barrier for *CO desorption.

         <title>A Four&#8208;Coordinate Pr4+ Imidophosphorane Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystallographically characterized Pr4+ imidophosphorane complex is presented, [Pr4+(NPtBu3)4] (where tBu=C(CH3)3), which exhibits a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination geometry in the solid state. The complex exhibits remarkable thermal stability, facilitating rigorous physical characterization that demonstrates the isoelectronic Ce3+ and Pr4+ ions exhibit divergent magnetic properties.







Abstract
The imidophosphorane ligand, [NPtBu3]&#8722; (tBu=tert&#8208;butyl), enables isolation of a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral, tetravalent praseodymium complex, [Pr4+(NPtBu3)4] (1&#8208;Pr), which is characterized by a suite of physical characterization methods including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance, and L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray near&#8208;edge spectroscopies. Variable&#8208;temperature direct&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility data, supported by multiconfigurational quantum chemical calculations, demonstrate that the electronic structure diverges from the isoelectronic Ce3+ analogue, driven by increased crystal field. The four&#8208;coordinate environment around Pr4+ in 1&#8208;Pr, which is unparalleled in reported extended solid systems, provides a unique opportunity to study the interplay between crystal field splitting and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in a molecular tetravalent lanthanide within a pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral coordination geometry.

         <dc:description>
The first example of gold&#8208;catalyzed alkoxy&#8208;carbonylation of aryl and vinyl iodides is reported by utilizing a (P,N)&#8208;ligand&#8208;enabled Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis.

         <title>Synthesis of Long&#8208;Chain Polyamides via Main&#8208;Chain Modification of Polyethyleneketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have synthesized a long&#8208;chain polyamide (polyethyleneamide) from polyethylene bearing in&#8208;chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketone) by the oxime formation and the following Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) worked as a reactive promoter of Beckmann rearrangement to achieve high conversion to amide functional group at mild condition without significant decrease of molecular weight. The formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding in amide group is further confirmed.







Abstract
Long&#8208;chain polyamides (polyethyleneamides) were prepared from polyethylenes bearing in&#8208;chain carbonyl groups (polyethyleneketones) by the oxime formation and successive Beckmann rearrangement. (Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) was utilized as a promoter, which allowed mild conversion of the oxime group in spite of low solubility of the polymers. The polyethyleneamide exhibited different tensile property compared to a commercial HDPE.

(Diethylamino)sulfur trifluoride (DAST) was utilized as a promoter, which allowed mild conversion of the oxime group in spite of low solubility of the polymers. The polyethyleneamide exhibited different tensile property compared to a commercial HDPE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiplexed Shortwave Infrared Imaging Highlights Anatomical Structures in Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) quantum dots (QDs) across shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) imaging window for in vivo anatomical imaging. With a single color, we visualized tortuous network of lymphatic vessels and semi&#8208;quantitatively tracked lymphatic drainage over time. Combining all three QD colors, we demonstrated multiplexed imaging to highlight overlapping vasculature and lymphatic structures with singular 808&#8197;nm excitation.







Abstract
Multiplexed fluorescence in vivo imaging remains challenging due to the attenuation and scattering of visible and traditional near infrared (NIR&#8208;I, 650&#8211;950&#8197;nm) wavelengths. Fluorescence imaging using shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm, a.k.a. NIR&#8208;II) light enables deeper tissue penetration due to reduced tissue scattering as well as minimal background autofluorescence. SWIR&#8208;emitting semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with tunable emission peaks and optical stability are powerful contrast agents, yet few imaging demonstrations exclusively use SWIR emission beyond two&#8208;color imaging schemes. In this study, we engineered three high quality lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide (PbS/CdS) core/shell QDs with distinct SWIR emission peaks ranging from 1100&#8211;1550&#8197;nm for simultaneous three&#8208;color imaging in mice. We first use the exceptional photostability of QDs to non&#8208;invasively track lymphatic drainage with longitudinal imaging, highlighting the detailed networks of lymphatic vessels with widefield imaging over a 2 hr period. We then perform multiplexed imaging with all three QDs to distinctly visualize the lymphatic system and spatially overlapping vasculature networks, including clearly distinguishing the liver and spleen. This work establishes optimized SWIR QDs for next generation multiplexed and longitudinal preclinical imaging, unlocking numerous opportunities for preclinical studies of disease progression, drug biodistribution, and cell trafficking dynamics in living organisms.

         <title>Optimizing Upconversion Quantum Yield via Structural Tuning of Dipyrrolonaphthyridinedione Annihilators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) were explored as annihilators for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) &#8208;tovisible upconversion. Unlike most annihilators, DPNDs can be easily functionalized. This allows us to uncover which structural changes increase annihilator performance. Combining beneficial motifs, we synthesize an optimized annihilator with an upconversion quantum yield almost double that of rubrene, the most commonly used NIR&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) is a photophysical process in which two low&#8208;energy photons are converted into one higher&#8208;energy photon. This type of upconversion requires two species: a sensitizer that absorbs low&#8208;energy light and transfers its energy to an annihilator, which emits higher&#8208;energy light after TTA. In spite of the multitude of applications of TTA&#8208;UC, few families of annihilators have been explored. In this work, we show dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) can act as annihilators in TTA&#8208;UC. We found that structural changes to DPND dramatically increase its upconversion quantum yield (UCQY). Our optimized DPND annihilator demonstrates a high maximum internal UCQY of 9.4&#8201;%, outperforming the UCQY of commonly used near&#8208;infrared&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator rubrene by almost double.

         <title>2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;Naphthalene Bis(dicarboximide) Cyclophane: A Photofunctional Host for Ambient Delayed Fluorescence in Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activating delayed fluorescence from heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under ambient conditions is arduous. Here, we show triplet harvesting via delayed fluorescence in air using a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy forming a rigid host&#8211;guest structure in solution.







Abstract
Harvesting triplet excitons of heavy atom&#8208;free purely organic chromophores under aerated conditions is challenging due to the quenching of long&#8208;lived triplet states by molecular oxygen and vibrational dissipation. Herein, we show a supramolecular approach of triplet harvesting via mitigating quenching pathways of a triplet harvester. Specifically, we used a host&#8211;guest system based on 2,3&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;naphthalene bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;derived cyclophane (NBICy) and carbazole derivative (EtCz). Complexation studies and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis showed the formation of a rigid host&#8211;guest complex (K&#8776;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 in CCl4), resulting in triplet&#8208;exciton stabilization under aerated conditions via mitigating vibrational interference and oxygen quenching. Photophysical studies elucidate the delayed fluorescence emission from the charge&#8208;transfer state (1CT) with a quantum yield (QY) of 6&#8211;8&#8201;% under ambient conditions which increased up to 36&#8201;% in an inert atmosphere.

         <title>Constrained Catalytic Itinerary of a Retaining 3,6&#8208;Anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;Galactosidase, a Key Enzyme in Red Algal Cell Wall Degradation</title>

         <dc:description>
The marine bacterial glycoside hydrolase ZgGH129 proceeds via retention of configuration (depicted is the glycosylation step). The Michaelis complex shows substrate distortion, with both homodimer active sites sitting at the base of a deep crevasse. Trapped complexes with bicyclic&#8208;based molecular tools, kinetics and computational modeling establish an ultra&#8208;constrained hydrolysis mechanism in the southern hemisphere of the Cremer&#8211;Pople sphere.







Abstract
The marine Bacteroidota Zobellia galactanivorans has a polysaccharide utilization locus dedicated to the catabolism of the red algal cell wall galactan carrageenan and its unique and industrially important &#945;&#8208;3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactose (ADG) monosaccharide. Here we present the first analysis of the specific molecular interactions that the exo&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;1,3)&#8208;3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactosidase ZgGH129 uses to cope with the strict steric restrictions imposed by its bicyclic ADG substrate &#8212; which is ring flipped relative to D&#8208;galactose. Crystallographic snapshots of key catalytic states obtained with the natural substrate and novel chemical tools designed to mimic species along the reaction coordinate, together with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) metadynamics methods and kinetic studies, demonstrate a retaining mechanism where the second step is rate limiting. The conformational landscape of the constrained 3,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranose ring proceeds through enzyme glycosylation B1,4&#8594;[E4]&#8800;&#8594;E4/1C4 and deglycosylation E4/1C4&#8594;[E4]&#8800;&#8594;B1,4 itineraries limited to the Southern Hemisphere of the Cremer&#8211;Pople sphere. These results demonstrate the conformational changes throughout catalysis in a non&#8208;standard, sterically restrained, bicyclic monosaccharide, and provide a molecular framework for mechanism&#8208;based inhibitor design for anhydro&#8208;type carbohydrate&#8208;processing enzymes and for future applications involving carrageenan degradation. In addition, our study provides a rare example of distinct niche&#8208;based conformational itineraries within the same carbohydrate&#8208;active enzyme family.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Non&#8208;Canonical C17 Sesquiterpenoids Chlororaphen A and B from Pseudomonas Chlororaphis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenes chlororaphen A and B was investigated in isotopic labelling experiments and by DFT calculations. The results revealed unexpected regular scrambling of 13C&#8208;labelling that can be explained through a late&#8208;stage multistep rearrangement. Up to 14 deuterium atoms were incorporated from D2O, setting a new record in terpene biosynthesis.







Abstract
Chlororaphens A and B are structurally unique non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenoids from Pseudomonas chlororaphis that are made by two SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and a type&#8197;I terpene synthase. This study addresses the mechanism of their formation in isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The results demonstrate an astonishing complexity with distribution of labellings within a cyclopentane core that is reversely connected to two acyclic fragments in chlororaphen A and B. In addition, the uptake of up to 14 deuterium atoms from D2O was observed. These findings are explainable by a repeated late stage multistep rearrangement sequence. The absolute configurations of the chlororaphens and their biosynthetic intermediates were elucidated in stereoselective labelling experiments.

         <title>Molecular Editing of Pyrroles to Benzenes/Naphthalenes by N2O Deletion.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 43, October 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular editing reaction for converting pyrrole rings into benzene rings through a sequential pathway of Diels&#8211;Alder and cheletropic reactions was developed. The nitrogen atom in a N&#8208;bridged intermediate is eliminated in the form of N2O by a strain&#8208;releasing pathway, ultimately leading to the formation of substituted benzene and naphthalene derivatives.







Abstract
Molecular editing promises to facilitate the rapid diversification of complex molecular architectures by rapidly and conveniently altering core frameworks. This approach has the potential to accelerate both drug discovery and total synthesis. In this study, we present a novel protocol for the molecular editing of pyrroles. Initially, N&#8208;Boc pyrroles and alkynes are converted into N&#8208;bridged compounds through a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. These compounds then undergo deprotection of the Boc group, nitrosylation, and cheletropic N2O extrusion to yield benzene or naphthalene products. By using benzyne as a substrate, this method can be conceptually viewed as a fusion of skeletal editing of the pyrrole ring and site&#8208;selective peripheral editing of the benzene ring. Furthermore, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept protocol has demonstrated its potential to transform the (hetero)arene motif from commercially available drugs, offering the possibility of generating new biologically active compounds.
