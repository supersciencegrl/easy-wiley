         <title>A General Concurrent Template Strategy for Ordered Mesoporous Intermetallic Nanoparticles with Controllable Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermetallic nanomaterials with stoichiometrically atomic orderliness have extensive potential applications in catalysis and electrocatalysis. However, the synthesis of intermetallic nanomaterials with precisely controlled macroscopic morphology and mesoscopic structure is still out&#8208;of&#8208;reach, limiting their practical applications to some extent. Here, we report a general concurrent template strategy for precise synthesis of mesoporous Pt&#8208;/Pd&#8208;based intermetallic nanoparticles with desired morphologies and ordered mesostructures, for the first time. The concurrent template not only supplies a mesoporous metal seed for heterogeneous nucleation of atomically ordered intermetallic phases but also provides a nanoconfinement mesoporous environment for nanocasting synthesis of mesoporous nanoparticles with ordered mesostructure and rhombic dodecahedral morphology under elevated temperature. Using the selective hydrogenation of 3&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalytic reaction, mesoporous intermetallic PtSn nanoparticles exhibited a remarkably controllable selectivity towards 3&#8208;nitrostyrene, 3&#8208;aminostyrene, and 3&#8208;aminoethylbenzene, respectively, depending on their atomically ordered intermetallic phases and confined crystalline mesoporosity. This work provides a very powerful strategy for the precise preparation of ordered mesoporous intermetallic nanocrystals for application in selective catalysis and fuel cell electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>The Interplay between Kinetics and Thermodynamics in Furan Diels&#8211;Alder Chemistry for Sustainable Chemicals Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The furan Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) cycloaddition is a powerful green methodology to upgrade bio&#8208;derived resources into valuable, renewable chemical products. The intricate interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics often complicates the understanding of this chemistry. In this review we provide simple structure&#8211;reactivity&#8211;stability relationships to guide future efforts in the design of efficient new synthesis routes based on furan DA reactions.







Abstract
Biomass&#8208;derived furanic platform molecules have emerged as promising building blocks for renewable chemicals and functional materials. To this aim, the Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) cycloaddition stands out as a versatile strategy to convert these renewable resources in highly atom&#8208;efficient ways. Despite nearly a century worth of examples of furan DA chemistry, clear structure&#8211;reactivity&#8211;stability relationships are still to be established. Detailed understanding of the intricate interplay between kinetics and thermodynamics in these very particular [4+2] cycloadditions is essential to push further development and truly expand the scope beyond the ubiquitous addend combinations of electron&#8208;rich furans and electron&#8208;deficient olefins. Herein, we provide pertinent examples of DA chemistry, taken from various fields, to highlight trends, establish correlations and answer open questions in the field with the aim to support future efforts in the sustainable chemicals and materials production.

         <title>Highly Efficient Multiphoton Absorption of Zinc&#8208;AIEgen Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit highly efficient multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MEPL) with concomitant third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG). MEPL parameters of the Zn&#8208;AIEgen hinged MOFs are far superior to some of the best multiphoton absorption (MPA) materials including the perovskite nanocrystals.







Abstract
A series of luminescent frameworks was synthesized from the selective combination of aggregation induced emission (AIE)&#8208;linker tetra&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)ethylene (H4TCPE) and Zn2+. Complex 1 was formed by the close packing of Zn&#8208;TCPE hinge, and isostructural complexes 2&#8211;5 were constructed by the linkage of Zn&#8208;TCPE layer and pillar ligands. These complexes exhibit highly efficient multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MEPL) and concomitant third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG). The multiphoton absorption (MPA) parameters of 1 are superior to other multiphoton emission materials including the perovskite nanocrystals. The incorporation of pillar linkers slows down the charge transfer between layers of Zn&#8208;TCPE, and the aromatic core of pillar linkers has a great influence on the MPA performance of the corresponding frameworks.

         <title>Reactive Extrusion Printing for Simultaneous Crystallization&#8208;Deposition of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive extrusion printing (REP) is demonstrated as an approach to simultaneously crystallize and deposit films of the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Cu3btc2  (btc = 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylate), also known as HKUST&#8208;1. The technique co&#8208;delivers inks of the copper(II) acetate and H  3  btc starting materials directly on&#8208;surface and on&#8208;location for rapid nucleation into films at room temperature. The films were analyzed using PXRD, profilometry, SEM and thermal analysis techniques and confirmed high quality Cu3btc2  films are produced in low&#8208;dispersity interconnected nanoparticulate form. The porosity was examined using gas adsorption which showed REP gives Cu3btc2  films with open interconnected pore structures, demonstrating the method bestows features that traditional synthesis does not. REP is a technique that opens the field to time&#8208;efficient large&#8208;scale fabrication of MOF interfaces and should find use in a wide variety of coating application settings.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Networks Enable Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonyl&#8208;Olefin Metathesis**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;bonding network: Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) can act as a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor to enhance the catalytic efficiency of simple Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts in carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reactions by stabilization of all transition states and intermediates along the reaction pathway.







Abstract
Synthetic chemists have learned to mimic nature in using hydrogen bonds and other weak interactions to dictate the spatial arrangement of reaction substrates and to stabilize transition states to enable highly efficient and selective reactions. The activation of a catalyst molecule itself by hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, in order to enhance its catalytic activity to achieve a desired reaction outcome, is less explored in organic synthesis, despite being a commonly found phenomenon in nature. Herein, we show our investigation into this underexplored area by studying the promotion of carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reactions by hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;assisted Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis, using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) solvent in combination with para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (pTSA). Our experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal not only an interesting role of HFIP solvent in assisting pTSA Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst, but also insightful knowledge about the current limitations of the carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reaction.

         <title>Microfluidics&#8208;Assisted Engineering of pH/Enzyme Dual&#8208;Activatable ZIF@Polymer Nanosystem for Co&#8208;Delivery of Proteins and Chemotherapeutics with Enhanced Deep&#8208;Tumor Penetration</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel pH/enzyme dual&#8208;activatable nanoplatform (ZIF@DG) was developed via in&#8197;situ encapsulation of therapeutics into a zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF&#8208;8, combined with microfluidics&#8208;assisted preparation of a DG polymer coating. The nanoplatform can co&#8208;deliver the protein drug ribonuclease A and the small&#8208;molecule drug doxorubicin with controlled drug release to deep tumor regions for synergistic cancer therapy.







Abstract
The impermeable barriers of solid tumors restrict the co&#8208;delivery of protein&#8208;based drugs and chemotherapeutics for cancer treatment. Therefore, we developed a ZIF&#8208;DOX/RA@DG nanosystem that encapsulates ribonuclease A (RA) and doxorubicin (DOX) in a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) core, with a dextran&#8208;based coating (DG). The nanosystem exhibits dual&#8208;responsiveness due to &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase&#8208;activatable cationization and acidic microenvironment&#8208;triggered degradation. The DG&#8208;coating process was achieved using a microfluidic approach, which stabilized the polymer responsiveness, ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based structure, and bioactivity of the encapsulated therapeutics. In&#8197;vivo results confirmed that the nanosystem could co&#8208;deliver RA and DOX to deep impermeable lesions with a synergistic anticancer therapeutic effects. Such a multi&#8208;drug delivery system based on an intelligent&#8208;responsive design and a microfluidics&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy shows great clinical prospects.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Component Excitonic Switch Utilizing High&#8208;Performance Diarylethenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly methylated diarylethenes derived from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine are reported with high thermal stability, fatigue resistance, and fluorogenicity. With these, an all&#8208;optical excitonic switch consisting of two oligonucleotides has been designed: one containing the fluorogenic diarylethene as a fluorescence donor and the other a tricyclic cytidine (tC) as acceptor, which together form an efficient conditional F&#246;rster&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Energy&#8208;Transfer pair.







Abstract
Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) are an emerging class of photochromes but have rarely been used in materials science. Here, we have developed doubly methylated DAEs derived from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine with high thermal stability and fatigue resistance. These new photoswitches not only outperform their predecessors but also rival classical non&#8208;nucleosidic DAEs. To demonstrate the utility of these new DAEs, we have designed an all&#8208;optical excitonic switch consisting of two oligonucleotides: one strand containing a fluorogenic double&#8208;methylated 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine as a fluorescence donor and the other a tricyclic cytidine (tC) as acceptor, which together form a highly efficient conditional F&#246;rster&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Energy&#8208;Transfer (FRET) pair. The system was operated in liquid and solid phases and showed both strong distance&#8208; and orientation&#8208;dependent photochromic FRET. The superior ON/OFF contrast was maintained over up to 100 switching cycles, with no detectable fatigue.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Biodegradable Nanoagents Based on Lanthanide Nucleotide Self&#8208;Assemblies toward Precise Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled lanthanide nucleotide nanoparticles (LNNPs) with tunable size (4.6&#8211;105.7&#8197;nm) are developed by employing nanomicelles as a template. High&#8208;resolution spectra at 10&#8197;K are provided for the first time to unravel the local site symmetry of Ln3+ inside the LNNPs. The ultrasmall DOX@LNNPs can achieve rapid renal clearance and unique tumor accumulation, thus enabling efficient tumor&#8208;specific therapy with negligible long&#8208;term toxicity.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoagents, which simultaneously satisfy normal tissue clearance and tumor&#8208;specific responsive treatment, are highly attractive for precise cancer theranostics. Herein, we develop a unique template&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy for the exquisitely controlled synthesis of self&#8208;assembled lanthanide (Ln3+) nucleotide nanoparticles (LNNPs) with amorphous structure and tunable size from sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm to 105&#8197;nm. By virtue of the low&#8208;temperature (10&#8197;K) and high&#8208;resolution spectroscopy, the local site symmetry of Ln3+ in LNNPs is unraveled for the first time. The proposed LNNPs are further demonstrated to possess the ability for highly efficient loading and tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive release of doxorubicin. Particularly, sub&#8208;5&#8197;nm LNNPs not only exhibit excellent biocompatibility and predominant renal&#8208;clearance performance, but also enable efficient tumor retention. These findings reveal the great potential of LNNPs as a new generation of therapeutic platform to overcome the dilemma between efficient therapy and long&#8208;term toxicity of nanoagents for future clinical applications.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Crystalline Covalent Triazine Frameworks via a Polycondensation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 3D crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) were synthesized by a reversible/irreversible polycondensation approach by using Td symmetrical tetrahedral amidine hydrochloride and aldehyde. The 3D CTFs adopt ctn topology, and have moderate crystallinity, relatively large surface area (ca. 2000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), high CO2 uptake capacity (23.61&#8197;wt.%), and excellent thermal and chemical stability.







Abstract
The growth of crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) is still considered as a great challenge due to the less reversible covalent bonds of triazine linkages. The research studies of crystalline CTFs to date have been limited to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structures, and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crystalline CTFs have never been reported before. Herein we report the design and synthesis of two 3D crystalline CTFs, termed 3D CTF&#8208;TPM and 3D CTF&#8208;TPA through a reversible/irreversible polycondensation approach. The targeted 3D CTFs adopt ctn topology, and show moderate crystallinity, relatively large surface area (ca. 2000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high CO2 uptake capacity (23.61&#8197;wt.%). Moreover, these 3D CTFs exhibit ultrastability in the presence of boiling water, strong acid (1&#8197;M HCl) and strong base (1&#8197;M NaOH). This contribution represents the first report of 3D crystalline CTFs, which not only extends their structural diversity but also offers a synthetic strategy and structural basis for expanding practical applications of CTF materials.

         <title>A Metallofullertube of Ce2@C100 with a Carbon Nanotube Segment: Synthesis, Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance and Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallofullertube Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 with a carbon nanotube segment and two fullerene end&#8208;caps was synthesized and characterized. Notably, Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 shows high single&#8208;molecule conductivity and unique supramolecular assembly.







Abstract
Tubular fullerenes can be considered as end&#8208;capped carbon nanotubes with accurate structure, which are promising nanocarbon materials for advanced single&#8208;molecule electronic devices. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a metallofullertube Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100, which has a tubular C100 cage with a carbon nanotube segment and two fullerene end&#8208;caps. As there are structure correlations between tubular Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 and spherical Ce2@Ih&#8208;C80, their structure&#8211;property relationship has been compared by means of experimental and theoretical methods. Notably, single&#8208;molecule conductance measurement determined that the conductivity of Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 was up to eight times larger than that of Ce2@Ih&#8208;C80. Furthermore, supramolecular assembly of Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 and a [12]CPP nanohoop was investigated, and theoretical calculations revealed that metallofullertube Ce2@D5(450)&#8208;C100 adopted a &#8220;standing&#8221; configuration in the cavity of [12]CPP. These results demonstrate the special nature of this kind of metallofullertube.

&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(450)-C&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt; with a carbon nanotube segment and two fullerene end-caps was synthesized and characterized. Notably, Ce&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(450)-C&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt; shows high single-molecule conductivity and unique supramolecular assembly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tubular fullerenes can be considered as end-capped carbon nanotubes with accurate structure, which are promising nanocarbon materials for advanced single-molecule electronic devices. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a metallofullertube Ce&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(450)-C&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt;, which has a tubular C&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt; cage with a carbon nanotube segment and two fullerene end-caps. As there are structure correlations between tubular Ce&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(450)-C&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt; and spherical Ce&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@&lt;i&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;, their structure&#8211;property relationship has been compared by means of experimental and theoretical methods. Notably, single-molecule conductance measurement determined that the conductivity of Ce&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(450)-C&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt; was up to eight times larger than that of Ce&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, supramolecular assembly of Ce&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(450)-C&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt; and a [12]CPP nanohoop was investigated, and theoretical calculations revealed that metallofullertube Ce&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(450)-C&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt; adopted a &#8220;standing&#8221; configuration in the cavity of [12]CPP. These results demonstrate the special nature of this kind of metallofullertube.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Metal Electrodeposition Revealed by In Situ Optical Imaging and Theoretical Modeling towards Fast&#8208;Charging Zn Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast metal electrodeposition in fast&#8208;charging Zn batteries was investigated by in situ optical imaging and theoretical modeling. The critical parameters governing the electrodeposition stability of the metallic Zn electrode were uncovered, guided by which a highly reversible Zn metal electrode in an aqueous battery with a depth of discharge of 66.7&#8201;% at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved.







Abstract
Metallic Zn is a preferred anode material for rechargeable aqueous batteries towards a smart grid and renewable energy storage. Understanding how the metal nucleates and grows at the aqueous Zn anode is a critical and challenging step to achieve full reversibility of Zn battery chemistry, especially under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Here, by combining in situ optical imaging and theoretical modeling, we uncover the critical parameters governing the electrodeposition stability of the metallic Zn electrode, that is, the competition among crystallographic thermodynamics, kinetics, and Zn2+&#8208;ion diffusion. Moreover, steady&#8208;state Zn metal plating/stripping with Coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% is achieved at 10&#8211;100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a reasonably high concentration (3&#8197;M) ZnSO4 electrolyte. Significantly, a long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stable Zn metal electrode is realized with a depth of discharge of 66.7&#8201;% under 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in both Zn||Zn symmetrical cells and MnO2||Zn full cells.

         <title>Oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) as a Peptide&#8208;Based Molecular Scaffold with a Minimal Structure and High Density of Functionalizable Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) (oligo&#8208;NMA) is proposed as a peptide&#8208;based molecular scaffold with a minimal structure and a high density of functionalizable sites. Computational and NMR spectroscopic analysis suggested that the backbone structure of oligo&#8208;NMA is not largely affected by functionalization. Moreover, the usefulness of oligo&#8208;NMA as a molecular scaffold was demonstrated by the design of protein ligands.







Abstract
Functionalizable synthetic molecules with nanometer sizes and defined shapes in water are useful as molecular scaffolds to mimic the functions of biomacromolecules and develop chemical tools for manipulating biomacromolecules. Herein, we propose oligo(N&#8208;methylalanine) (oligo&#8208;NMA) as a peptide&#8208;based molecular scaffold with a minimal structure and a high density of functionalizable sites. Oligo&#8208;NMA forms a defined shape in water without hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks or ring constraints, which enables the molecule to act as a scaffold with minimal atomic composition. Furthermore, functional groups can be readily introduced on the nitrogens and &#945;&#8208;carbons of oligo&#8208;NMA. Computational and NMR spectroscopic analysis suggested that the backbone structure of oligo&#8208;NMA is not largely affected by functionalization. Moreover, the usefulness of oligo&#8208;NMA was demonstrated by the design of protein ligands. The ease of synthesis, minimal structure, and high functionalization flexibility makes oligo&#8208;NMA a useful scaffold for chemical and biological applications.

         <title>Dual Active Centers Bridged by Oxygen Vacancies of Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Hybrids Supported on Molybdenum Oxide for Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;SA (single atom)/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids with abundant of Mon+ species neighboring oxygen vacancies are synthesized via a H&#8208;spillover process. More importantly, Ru&#8208;SA/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids can quantitatively produce NH3 from N2 and H2 by the effect of dual active centers (Ru SA and Mon+).







Abstract
Photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia (NH3) holds significant potential compared with the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, the reported photocatalysts suffer from low efficiency owing to localized electron deficiency. Herein, Ru&#8208;SA (single atoms)/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids with abundant of Mon+ (4&lt;n&lt;6) species neighboring oxygen vacancies (OV) are synthesized via a H&#8208;spillover process. Detailed characterizations demonstrate that Ru&#8208;SA/HxMoO3&#8722;y hybrids can quantitatively produce NH3 from N2 and H2 through the presence of dual active centers (Ru SA and Mon+). The Ru SA boost the activation and migration of H2, and Mon+ species act as the trapping sites of localized electrons and the adsorption and dissociation sites of N2, finally leading to NH3 synthesis on Mon+&#8722;OH. The NH3 generation rate is up to 4.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, accompanied by an apparent quantum efficiency over 6.0&#8201;% at 650&#8197;nm.

         <title>Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Platinum Supernanoparticles for Urinary Microfluidic Monitoring of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypoxia&#8208;triggered platinum supernanoparticles dissociated into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters, which could be cleared by the kidney through urine, in response to the tumor microenvironment. After collection of the excreted nanosensors, the disease status was monitored visually and quantitatively by using a microfluidic chip.







Abstract
Cancer has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and there is an increasing need for versatile tools to enable sensitive, simple and early cancer monitoring. Here, we report platinum supernanoparticles as an exogenous nanosensor which can dissociate into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters (PtNCs) under tumor&#8208;specific hypoxia conditions. The resulting PtNCs can be filtered through the kidney as urinary reporters to be quantified by a companion volumetric bar&#8208;chart chip (V&#8208;Chip) for point&#8208;of&#8208;care analysis. The V&#8208;Chip signals of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and its lung metastasis mouse model showed a significant increase compared to healthy mice. Our nanosensor can also noninvasively monitor the course of treatment, which is significant for screening tumor recurrence and individualized evaluation of pharmacological and follow&#8208;up efficacy. Importantly, this strategy could be adapted for various diseases to form a common diagnostic platform by changing responsive linkers.

Here, we report platinum supernanoparticles as an exogenous nanosensor which can dissociate into ultrasmall platinum nanoclusters (PtNCs) under tumor-specific hypoxia conditions. The resulting PtNCs can be filtered through the kidney as urinary reporters to be quantified by a companion volumetric bar-chart chip (V-Chip) for point-of-care analysis. The V-Chip signals of triple-negative breast cancer and its lung metastasis mouse model showed a significant increase compared to healthy mice. Our nanosensor can also noninvasively monitor the course of treatment, which is significant for screening tumor recurrence and individualized evaluation of pharmacological and follow-up efficacy. Importantly, this strategy could be adapted for various diseases to form a common diagnostic platform by changing responsive linkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular and Spin Structures of a Through&#8208;Space Conjugated Triradical System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formally equilateral triradical with D3h symmetry is subject to Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion to create two distorted C2v structures (i.e., acute and obtuse forms) and these two distorted forms are reversibly interconverted in the solution and solid states.







Abstract
A through&#8208;space conjugated multi&#8208;phenalenyl triradical 1&#8201;a has been prepared and characterized. Partial occupancy of doubly degenerate molecular orbitals in 1&#8201;a leads to Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, creating a molecular skeleton in which C2v doublet states are lower in energy than undistorted D3h doublet and quartet states. Triradical 1&#8201;a exists in an acute form in the solution state, whereas it adopts a preferred obtuse form in the solid state. The results of the investigation show that these two distorted forms are reversibly interconverted by thermal energy.

         <title>Dynamic Timing Control over Multicolor Molecular Emission by Temporal Chemical Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor molecular emission is controlled in a dynamic timing manner by introducing a temporal chemical lock. The temporal life&#8208;time of the systems can be encoded by molecularly engineering the structural information.







Abstract
Dynamic control over molecular emission, especially in a time&#8208;dependent manner, holds great promise for the development of smart luminescent materials. Here we report a series of dynamic multicolor fluorescent systems based on the time&#8208;encoded locking and unlocking of individual vibrational emissive units. The intramolecular cyclization reaction driven by adding chemical fuel acts as a chemical lock to decrease the conformational freedom of the emissive units, thus varying the fluorescence wavelength, while the resulting chemically locked state can be automatically unlocked by the hydrolysis reaction with water molecules. The dynamic molecular system can be driven by adding chemical fuels for multiple times. The emission wavelength and lifetime of the locking states can be readily controlled by elaborating the molecular structures, indicating this strategy as a robust and versatile way to modulate multi&#8208;color molecular emission in a time&#8208;encoded manner.

         <title>Selective Fluorescence Imaging of Cancer Cells Based on ROS&#8208;Triggered Intracellular Cross&#8208;Linking of Artificial Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial enzyme that responds to intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was designed through introducing a catalytic histidine residue at one of the thiols of pentaerythritol tetra(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate). The artificial enzyme could in&#8197;situ cross&#8208;link to form an assembled structure that could trigger the cleavage of the ester bond of pro&#8208;fluorophore and activate the turn&#8208;on fluorescence inside cancer cells for selective diagnosis.







Abstract
Inside living cells, regulation of catalytic activity of artificial enzymes remains challenging due to issues such as biocompatibility, efficiency, and stability of the catalyst, by which the practical applications of artificial enzymes have been severely hindered. Here, an artificial enzyme, PTT&#8208;SGH, with responsiveness to reactive oxygen species (ROS), was obtained by introducing a catalytic histidine residue to pentaerythritol tetra(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate) (PTT). The artificial enzyme formed large aggregates in cells via the intracellular ROS&#8208;mediated oxidation of thiol groups. The process was significantly facilitated in tumor cells because of the higher ROS concentration in the tumor microenvironment. The catalytic activity of this artificial enzyme was intensively enhanced through deprotonation of cross&#8208;linked PTT&#8208;SGH, which showed typical esterase activities. Selective fluorescence imaging of tumor cells was achieved using the artificial enzyme to trigger the cleavage of the ester bond of the caged fluorophore inside living cells.

         <title>Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polyzwitterionic hydrogel with efficient atmospheric water harvesting is developed based on anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte effects. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel could achieve 0.62&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 water vapor sorption within 120&#8197;minutes at 30&#8201;% relative humidity and produce 5.87&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 freshwater per day. This tactful designed polyzwitterionic hydrogel provides new insight on how to fabricate efficient atmospheric water harvesting materials.







Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is regarded as one of the promising strategies for freshwater production desirable to provide sustainable water for landlocked and arid regions. Hygroscopic materials have attracted widespread attention because of their water harvesting performance. However, the introduction of many inorganic salts often leads to aggregation and leakage issues in practical use. Here, polyzwitterionic hydrogels are developed as an effective AWH material platform. Via anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte effects, the hygroscopic salt coordinated with polymer chains could capture moisture and enhance the swelling property, leading to a strong moisture sorption capacity. The hydrogel shows superior AWH performance (0.62&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1, 120&#8197;minutes for equilibrium at 30&#8201;% relative humidity) and produces 5.87&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 freshwater per day. It is anticipated that the polyzwitterionic hydrogels with unique salt&#8208;responsive properties could provide new insights into the design and synthesis of next&#8208;generation AWH materials.

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3: Neutral Metalloid Radical Precursors upon Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 was proven to be an effective radical precursor under visible&#8208;light photocatalysis. The metalloid nature of Ge allows single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) at the neutral Ge center and leads to advantages in separation and derivatization.







Abstract
Single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) oxidation of ionic hypervalent complexes, in particular alkyltrifluoroborates (Alkyl&#8208;BF3&#8722;) and alkylbis(catecholato)silicates (Alkyl&#8208;Si(cat)2&#8722;), have contributed substantially to alkyl radical generation compared to alkali or alkaline earth organometallics because of their excellent activity&#8211;stability balance. Herein, another proposal is reported by using neutral metalloid compounds, Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3, as radical precursors. Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 shows comparable activity to that of Alkyl&#8208;BF3&#8722; and Alkyl&#8208;Si(cat)2&#8722; in radical addition reactions. Moreover, Alkyl&#8208;GeMe3 is the first successful group&#8197;14 tetraalkyl nucleophile in nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling. Meanwhile, the neutral nature of these organogermanes offset the limitation of ionic precursors in purification and derivatization. A preliminary mechanism study suggests that an alkyl radical is generated from a tetraalkylgermane radical cation with the assistance of a nucleophile, which may also result in the development of more non&#8208;ionic alkyl radical precursors with a metalloid center.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and Alkyl-Si(cat)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in radical addition reactions. Moreover, Alkyl-GeMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the first successful group&#8197;14 tetraalkyl nucleophile in nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling. Meanwhile, the neutral nature of these organogermanes offset the limitation of ionic precursors in purification and derivatization. A preliminary mechanism study suggests that an alkyl radical is generated from a tetraalkylgermane radical cation with the assistance of a nucleophile, which may also result in the development of more non-ionic alkyl radical precursors with a metalloid center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Enzyme&#8208;Cleavable Oligonucleotides by Automated Solid&#8208;Phase Incorporation of Cathepsin B Sensitive Dipeptide Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathepsin B&#8208;sensitive dipeptide phosphoramidites were developed for automated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;cleavable oligonucleotides. The enzymatic cleavage of Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 by cathepsin B is efficient in the context of single&#8208;stranded DNA, but is sterically hindered by double&#8208;stranded DNA and short hairpin loops. The design of Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone allows the construction of oligonucleotide&#8211;drug conjugates which release their small&#8208;molecule payload after enzymatic cleavage.







Abstract
Oligonucleotides containing cleavable linkers have emerged as versatile tools to achieve stimulus&#8208;responsive and site&#8208;specific cleavage of DNA. However, the limitations of previously reported cleavable linkers including photolabile and disulfide linkers have restricted their applications in vivo. Inspired by the cathepsin B&#8208;sensitive dipeptide linkers in antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) such as Adcetris, we have developed Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 and Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone phosphoramidites for the automated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;cleavable oligonucleotides. Cathepsin B digests Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 and Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone linkers efficiently, enabling cleavage of oligonucleotides into two components or release of small&#8208;molecule payloads. Based on the prior success of dipeptide linkers in ADCs, we believe that these dipeptide linker phosphoramidites will promote new clinical applications of therapeutic oligonucleotides.

         <title>A Calix[3]acridan&#8208;Based Host&#8722;Guest Cocrystal Exhibiting Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A supramolecular strategy to construct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials through host&#8722;guest charge transfer interactions was proposed. Consequently, a new class of macrocycle namely calix[3]acridan was conveniently synthesized in 90% yield. The host&#8208;guest cocrystal formed by calix[3]acridan and 1,2&#8208;dicyanobenzene exhibited efficient TADF property due to intense intermolecular change transfer interactions. Moreover, the spatially separated highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital resulted in a very small single&#8208;triplet energy gap of 0.014 eV and hence guaranteed an efficient reverse intersystem crossing for TADF. Especially, a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 70% was achieved and it represented the highest value among the reported intermolecular donor&#8208;acceptor TADF materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report on the reversible uptake of carbon dioxide by dimetallynes featuring ancillary hemi&#8208;labile pincer ligands. Insertion into the Ge&#8211;Ge/Sn&#8211;Sn bonds yields species containing an E(CO  2  )E unit, with the mode of ligation of the CO  2  fragment determined crystallographically being found to be dependent on the identity of the group 14 element. The thermodynamics of CO  2  uptake/loss can be established through VT&#8208;NMR (&#916;H&#176; = +24.6(2.3) kJ mol  &#8208;1  , &#916;S&#176; = +64.9(3.8) J mol  &#8208;1  K  &#8208;1  , &#916;G&#176;  298  = +5.3(1.9) kJ mol  &#8208;1  for the loss of CO  2  in the Ge case), and the chemical consequences of reversibility demonstrated by thermodynamically&#8208;controlled exchange reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination and Betaine Modification Augment the Blood&#8208;Brain Barrier&#8208;Crossing Ability of Cylindrical Polymer Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB)&#8208;crossing ability of drugs is of paramount importance for the treatments of central nervous system diseases. However, the known methods for drug transport across BBB are generally complicated and inefficient, and exhibit serious side effects in some cases. Herein, we report an exciting finding that fluorination and betaine modification can significantly augment the BBB&#8208;crossing ability of cylindrical polymer brushes (CPBs), which was demonstrated by the comparison with the CPBs modified with alkyl and poly(ethylene glycol) chains, respectively. We surmise that fluorination enhances the BBB penetration of the CPBs by increasing the hydrophobicity and reducing the surface energy, and betaine medication achieves this function via the betaine transporter BGT1 expressed on brain capillaries. By means of in vitro BBB model, we demonstrated that the CPBs penetrated BBB through transendothelial transport. This work provides a novel strategy for enhancing the BBB&#8208;crossing ability of nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Co&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fenton reactions have been recently applied in tumor catalytic therapy, whose efficacy suffers from the unsatisfactory reaction kinetics of Fe3+ to Fe2+ conversion. Here we introduce a co&#8208;catalytic concept in tumor catalytic therapy by using a two&#8208;dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheet atomically dispersed with Fe species. The single&#8208;atom Fe species act as active sites for triggering Fenton reactions, while the abundant sulfur vacancies generated on the nanosheet favor electron capture by hydrogen peroxide for promoting hydroxyl radical production. Moreover, the 2D MoS2 support also acts as a co&#8208;catalyst to accelerate the conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+ by the oxidation of active Mo4+ sites to Mo6+, thereby promoting the whole catalytic process. The 2D nanocatalyst exhibits a desirable catalytic performance, as well as a significantly enhanced anticancer efficacy both in vitro and in vivo, which indicates the feasibility for applying such a co&#8208;catalytic concept in tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In the past years, Pd  0  &#8208;catalyzed C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activation provided efficient and step&#8208;economical methods to synthesize carbo&#8208; and heterocycles via direct C(sp  2  )&#8211;C(sp  3  ) bond formation. We report herein that 1,4&#8208;Pd shift allows access to N&#8208;heterocycles which are difficult to build via a direct reaction. It is shown that  o  &#8208;bromo&#8208;  N  &#8208;methylanilines undergo 1,4&#8208;Pd shift at the  N  &#8208;methyl group, followed by intramolecular trapping by C(sp  2  )&#8211;H or C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activation at another nitrogen substituent and remote C&#8211;C bond formation to generate biologically relevant isoindolines and &#946;&#8208;lactams.

         <title>Green Carbon Science: Efficient Carbon Resource Processing, Utilization, and Recycling towards Carbon Neutrality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient utilization and recycling of carbon resources, which contain mainly the elements C, H, and O, is an effective way to minimize CO2 emission. In this Minireview, green carbon science is discussed in combination with related fields, including petroleum refining and the production of liquid fuels, chemicals, and materials from coal, methane, CO2, biomass, and waste plastics.







Abstract
Green carbon science is defined as the &#8220;study and optimization of the transformation of carbon&#8208;containing compounds and the relevant processes involved in the entire carbon cycle from carbon resource processing, carbon energy utilization, CO2 fixation, and carbon recycling to utilize carbon resources efficiently and minimize the net CO2 emission.[1] Green carbon science is related closely to carbon neutrality, and relevant fields have developed quickly in the last decade. In this Minireview, we propose the concept of carbon energy index, and the recent progress in petroleum refining, and the production of liquid fuels, chemicals, and materials using coal, methane, CO2, biomass, and waste plastics is highlighted in combination with green carbon science. An outlook for these important fields is provided in the final section.

         <title>Master of Chaos and Order: Opposite Microstructures of PCL&#8208;co&#8208;PGA&#8208;co&#8208;PLA Accessible by a Single Catalyst**

Opposite microstructures accessible by a single catalyst: An iron guanidine complex produces defined block copolymers of lactide, &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone and glycolide under solvent&#8208;free conditions at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Increasing the reaction temperature leads to enhanced transesterifications producing random&#8208;like copolymers. &#1013;&#8208;Caprolactone was identified as crucial driver to obtain polymer chains with highly dispersed repeating unit distributions.







Abstract
One catalyst, two reaction set&#8208;ups, three monomers and unlimited macromolecular microstructural designs: The iron guanidine complex [FeCl2(TMG5NMe2asme)] (1) polymerizes lactide faster than the industrially used Sn(Oct)2 and shows high activity towards glycolide and &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone. Its distinguished features enable the synthesis of both block and random&#8208;like copolymers in the melt by a simple change of the polymerization set&#8208;up. Sequential addition of monomers yields highly ordered block copolymers including the symmetrical PLA&#8208;b&#8208;PGA&#8208;b&#8208;PCL&#8208;b&#8208;PGA&#8208;b&#8208;PLA pentablock copolymers, while polymerizations of monomer mixtures feature enhanced transesterifications and pave the way to di&#8208; and terpolymers with highly dispersed repeating unit distributions. A robust catalyst active under industrially applicable conditions and producing copolymers with desired microstructures is a major step towards biocompatible polymers with tailor&#8208;made properties as alternatives for traditional plastics on the way towards a sustainable, circular material flow.

         <title>Engineering MoOx/MXene Hole Transfer Layers for Unexpected Boosting Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of semiconductor photoanodes is of great practical interest for the realization of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Herein, zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) MXene quantum dots (MQD) or two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene nanosheets (MN) were grafted on BiVO4  substrate, then as&#8208;assemblied MoOx  layer by combining ultrathin oxyhydroxide oxygen evolution cocatalyst (OEC) was constructed as a promising model system of integrated photoanodes. As&#8208;prepared OEC/MoOx/MQD/BiVO4  array not only achieves a current density of 5.85 mA cm&#8208;2  at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), but also remarkably enhances photostability. From electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations, high PEC performance is ascribed to the incorporation of MoOx/MQD as hole transfer layers, retarding charge recombination, promoting hole transfer and accelerating water splitting kinetics. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle work not only demonstrates the potential utilization of hole transfer layers, but also sheds light on rational design and fabrication of integrated photoanodes for feasible solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing GLUT1 Targeted Pro&#8208;oxidant Ascorbate for Synergistic Phototherapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite extensive efforts to realize effective photodynamic therapy (PDT), there is still a lack of therapeutic approaches concisely&#8208;structured to mitigate major obstacles of PDT in clinical applications. Herein, we report a molecular strategy exploiting ascorbate chemistry to enhance the efficacy of PDT in cancer cells overexpressing glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). AA&#8208;EtNBS, a 5&#8208;O&#8208;substituted ascorbate&#8208;photosensitizer (PS) conjugate, undergoes a reversible structural conversion of the ascorbate moiety in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH), thereby promoting its uptake in GLUT1&#8208;overexpressed KM12C colon cancer cells and perturbing tumor redox homeostasis, respectively. Due to the peculiar pro&#8208;oxidant role of ascorbate in tumour environments, AA&#8208;EtNBS effectively sensitised KM12C cancer cells prior to PS&#8208;mediated superoxide radical generation under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) illumination. AA&#8208;EtNBS successfully exhibited GLUT1&#8208;targeted synergistic therapeutic efficacy during PDT both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, this study outlines a promising strategy employing ascorbate both as a targeting unit for GLUT1&#8208;overexpressed cancer cells and redox homeostasis destruction agent, thereby enhancing therapeutic responses towards anticancer treatment when used in conjunction with conventional PDT.</dc:description>

Synthetic photoelectrochemistry (PEC) offers new prospects for the generation and handling of reactive intermediates. PEC permits selective single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reactions in a much greener way and broadens the redox window of possible transformations. This Review discusses the combination of PEC with other reactivity paradigms, scalability up to multigram scale, novel selectivities in SET super&#8208;oxidations/reductions and the importance of precomplexation.







Abstract
Synthetic photoelectrochemistry (PEC) is receiving increasing attention as a new frontier for the generation and handling of reactive intermediates. PEC permits selective single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reactions in a much greener way and broadens the redox window of possible transformations. Herein, the most recent contributions are reviewed, demonstrating exciting new opportunities, namely, the combination of PEC with other reactivity paradigms (hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer, radical polar crossover, energy transfer sensitization), scalability up to multigram scale, novel selectivities in SET super&#8208;oxidations/reductions and the importance of precomplexation to temporally enable excited radical ion catalysis.

         <title>Inter&#8208;relationships between Oxygen Evolution and Iridium Dissolution Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The storage of excess renewable energy in the form of hydrogen depends on the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and thus the rational design of novel iridium&#8208;based catalysts with improved electrocatalytic properties. To achieve this, it is necessary to understand both the OER and dissolution mechanisms as well as their inter&#8208;relationship. This Minireview gathers state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art information of these phenomena on different Ir catalysts.

The widespread utilization of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers currently remains uncertain, as they rely on the use of highly scarce iridium as the only viable catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is known to present the major energy losses of the process. Understanding the mechanistic origin of the different activities and stabilities of Ir&#8208;based catalysts is, therefore, crucial for a scale&#8208;up of green hydrogen production. It is known that structure influences the dissolution, which is the main degradation mechanism and shares common intermediates with the OER. In this Minireview, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art understanding of dissolution and its relationship with the structure of different iridium catalysts is gathered and correlated to different mechanisms of the OER. A perspective on future directions of investigation is also given.

     alt="Inter-relationships between Oxygen Evolution and Iridium Dissolution Mechanisms"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storage of excess renewable energy in the form of hydrogen depends on the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and thus the rational design of novel iridium-based catalysts with improved electrocatalytic properties. To achieve this, it is necessary to understand both the OER and dissolution mechanisms as well as their inter-relationship. This Minireview gathers state-of-the-art information of these phenomena on different Ir catalysts.

         <title>Silaborative Assembly of Allenamides and Alkynes: Highly Regio&#8208; and Stereocontrolled Access to Bi&#8208; or Trimetallic Skipped Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly stereo&#8208; and regiocontrolled multicomponent approach to skipped 1,4&#8208;dienes decorated with one boryl and two silyl functionalities is described. This Pd&#8208;catalyzed atom&#8208;economical union of allenamides, alkynes, and Me  2  PhSiBpin (or Et  3  SiBpin) proceeds without the use of phosphine ligands, instead relying on chelation through the internal amide group of the allenamide sulfonyl. A variety of alkynes, including those derived from complex bioactive molecules, can be efficiently coupled with allenamides and Me  2  PhSiBpin in good yields and with excellent selectivity. The synthetic potential was demonstrated through multiple valuable chemoselective transformations, establishing new disconnections for functionalized dienes. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the reaction first proceeded through borylation of the allenamide, followed by silylation of the alkyne and then reductive elimination, which convergently assemble the skipped 1,4&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

         <title>Trapping&#8208;Enrichment Multidimensional Liquid Chromatography with On&#8208;Line Deuterated Solvent Exchange for Streamlined Structure Elucidation at the Microgram Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At the forefront of chemistry and biology research, development timelines are fast&#8208;paced and large quantities of pure targets are rarely available. Herein, we introduce a new framework, which is built upon an automated, online trapping&#8208;enrichment multi&#8208;dimensional liquid chromatography platform (TE&#8208;  Dt  &#8208;mDLC) that enables: 1) highly efficient separation of complex mixtures in a first dimension (  1  D  &#8208;UV); 2) automated peak trapping&#8208;enrichment and buffer removal achieved through a sequence of H  2  O and D  2  O washes using an independent pump setup; and 3) a second dimension separation (  2  D  &#8208;UV&#8208;MS) with fully deuterated mobile phases and fraction collection to minimize protic residues for immediate NMR analysis while bypassing tedious drying processes and minimizing analyte degradation. Diverse examples of target isolation and characterization from organic synthesis and natural product chemistry laboratories are illustrated, demonstrating recoveries above 90% using as little as a few micrograms of material.</dc:description>

         <title>A Kinetic and Fluorogenic Enhancement Strategy for Labeling of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modification of nucleic acids in living cells can be sterically hindered by tight packing of bioorthogonal functional groups in chromatin. To address this limitation, we report here a dual enhancement strategy for nucleic acid&#8208;templated reactions utilizing a fluorogenic intercalating agent capable of undergoing inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder (IEDDA) reactions with DNA containing 5&#8208;vinyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine (VdU) or RNA containing 5&#8208;vinyl&#8208;uridine (VU). Reversible high&#8208;affinity intercalation of a novel acridine&#8208;tetrazine conjugate &#8220;PINK&#8221; (Kd&#160;= 5&#160;&#177;&#160;1&#160;&#956;M) increases the reaction rate of tetrazine&#8208;alkene IEDDA on duplex DNA by 60,000&#8208;fold (590 M&#8208;1&#160;s&#8208;1) as compared to the non&#8208;templated reaction. At the same time, loss of tetrazine&#8208;acridine fluorescence quenching renders the reaction highly fluorogenic and detectable under no&#8208;wash conditions. This strategy enables live&#8208;cell dynamic imaging of acridine&#8208;modified nucleic acids in dividing cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversibly Photoswitching Upconversion Nanoparticles for Super&#8208;sensitive Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacoustic (PA) imaging uses light excitation to generate the acoustic signal for detection and improves tissue penetration depth and spatial resolution in the clinically relevant depth of living subjects. However, strong background signals from blood and pigments have significantly compromised the sensitivity of PA imaging with exogenous contrast agents. Here we report a nanoparticle&#8208;based probe design that uses light to reversibly modulate the PA emission to enable photoacoustic photoswitching imaging (PAPSI) in living mice. Such a nanoprobe is built with upconverting nanocrystals and photoswitchable small molecules and can be switched on by NIR light through upconversion to UV energy. Reversibly photoswitching of the nanoprobe reliably removed strong tissue background, increased the contrast&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and thus improved imaging sensitivity. We have shown that PAPSI can image 0.05 nM of the nanoprobe in hemoglobin solution and 10  4  labeled cancer cells after implantation in living mice using a commercial PA imager.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic Hole Mobility in Luminescent Metal&#8208;organic Framework and Its Application in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) lack charge mobility, which is crucial for realizing their use in optoelectronic applications. This work proposes the design of MOF using triarylamine&#8208;based ligands (Zr&#8208;NBP) as the lone pair electron spacer to enhance the hole mobility in MOF while maintaining the luminescent properties. Zr&#8208;NBP has strong fluorescence with a good hole mobility of 1.05 x 10  &#8208;6  cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , which is comparable to organic materials used in optoelectronic devices. We also employed a Zr&#8208;NBP nanofilm in the pure phase as both a non&#8208;doped emissive layer and a hole&#8208;transporting layer of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In particular, the obtained OLED device produced a bright green light with a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.9 V. This work represents an advance in developing electronic properties of MOF from the chemical properties of its building blocks and would inspire the further design of MOF materials as active layers in optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Luciferin Synthesis and Pesticide Detection by Luminescence Enzymatic Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>D&#8208;Luciferin (D&#8208;LH2), a substrate of firefly luciferase (Fluc), is important for a wide range of bioluminescence applications. This work reports a new and green method using enzymatic reactions (HELP, HadA Enzyme for Luciferin Preparation) to convert 19 phenolic derivatives to 8 D&#8208;LH2 analogues with ~ 51 % yield. The method can synthesize the novel 5&#8217;&#8208;methyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2 and 4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2, which have never been synthesized or found in nature. 5&#8217;&#8208;Methyl&#8208;D&#8208;LH2 emits brighter and longer wavelength light than the D&#8208;LH2. Using HELP, we further developed LUMOS (Luminescence Measurement of Organophosphate and Derivatives) technology for in situ detection of organophosphate pesticides (OPs) including parathion, methyl parathion, EPN, profenofos and fenitrothion by coupling the reactions of OPs hydrolase and Fluc. The LUMOS technology can detect these OPs at parts per trillion (ppt) levels. The method can directly detect OPs in food and biological samples without requiring sample pretreatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating the Crystallization of Zeolite SSZ&#8208;13 with Polyamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tailoring processes of nucleation and growth to achieve desired material properties is a pervasive challenge in synthetic crystallization. In systems where crystals form via nonclassical pathways, engineering materials often requires the controlled assembly and structural evolution of colloidal precursors. In this study, we examine zeolite SSZ&#8208;13 crystallization and show that several polyquaternary amines function as efficient accelerants of nucleation, and, in select cases, tune crystal size by orders of magnitude. Among the additives tested, polydiallyldimethylammonium (PDDA) was found to have the most pronounced impact on the kinetics of SSZ&#8208;13 formation, leading to a 4&#8208;fold reduction in crystallization time. Our findings also reveal that enhanced nucleation occurs at an optimal PDDA concentration where a combination of light scattering techniques demonstrate these conditions lead to polymer&#8208;induced aggregation of amorphous precursors and the promotion of (alumino)silicate precipitation from growth solution. Here, we show that relatively low concentrations of polymer additives can be used in unique ways to dramatically enhance SSZ&#8208;13 crystallization rates, thereby improving the overall efficiency of zeolite synthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In vivo  microelectrodes are essential for neuroscience studies. However, development of microelectrodes with both flexibility and multifunctionality for recording chemical and electrical signals in the same extracellular microspace and modulating neural activity remains challenging. Here, we find that pure PEDOT:PSS fibers (i.e., support&#8208;free) exhibit high conductivity, fast  heterogeneous electron transfer, and suitable charge storage and injection capabilities  , and can thus directly act as microelectrodes not only for chemical and  electrophysiological  recording in the same extracellular microspace, but also for electromodulation of neural microcircuit activity. Moreover, the microelectrodes  mechanically match with neural tissues  , exhibiting less foreign body responses. Given  the multifunctionality  , flexibility, and biocompatibility, the support&#8208;free PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based microelectrodes  offer a new avenue to microelectrode technology for neuroscience research, diagnostics and therapeutics.</dc:description>

Multifunctional microrobots, made of Ni@Pt microrockets, CdS quantum dots, and a host &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin selector, have been engineered that simultaneously exhibit i) self&#8208;propulsion, ii)&#8197;fluorescence, and iii)&#8197;magnetic properties in combination with iv) supramolecular chiral recognition for &#8220;enantiorecognition&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; approaches. As a model chiral target, tryptophan enantiomers have been discriminated using a bimodal (optical and electrical) readout.







Abstract
Herein, a general procedure for the synthesis of multifunctional MRs, which simultaneously exhibit i) chiral, ii)&#8197;magnetic, and iii)&#8197;fluorescent properties in combination with iv) self&#8208;propulsion, is reported. Self&#8208;propelled Ni@Pt superparamagnetic microrockets have been functionalized with fluorescent CdS quantum dots carrying a chiral host biomolecule as &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD). The &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; chiral recognition potential of MRs has been interrogated by taking advantage of the &#946;&#8208;CD affinity to supramolecularly accommodate different chiral biomolecules (i.e., amino acids). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, tryptophan enantiomers have been discriminated with a dual&#8208;mode (optical and electrochemical) readout. This approach paves the way to devise intelligent cargo micromachines with &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; chiral supramolecular recognition capabilities to elucidate the concept of &#8220;enantiorecognition&#8208;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221;, which might be facilely customized by tailoring the supramolecular host&#8211;guest encapsulation.

         <title>Fold&#8208;in Synthesis of a Pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pentabenzopentaaza[10]circulene, the largest hetero[n]circulene, has been synthesized by a fold&#8208;in approach, as reported by Takayuki Tanaka et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202116789). The molecule exhibits a saddle&#8208;distorted structure in the solid&#8208;state, reminiscent of a camel back. The dynamic behavior was analyzed experimentally and theoretically, revealing a low transition state for the saddle&#8208;to&#8208;saddle inversion. In contrast, a planar, star&#8208;shaped conformer is energetically much higher, like a star in the sky.

The molecule exhibits a saddle-distorted structure in the solid-state, reminiscent of a camel back. The dynamic behavior was analyzed experimentally and theoretically, revealing a low transition state for the saddle-to-saddle inversion. In contrast, a planar, star-shaped conformer is energetically much higher, like a star in the sky.

         <title>Gating Effects for Ion Transport in Three&#8208;Dimensional Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crown ether&#8208;functionalized 3D COFs can efficiently gate ion transport with an excellent gating ratio up to 23.6 are reported, which is among the highest values in metal ion&#8208;activated solid&#8208;state nanochannels reported so far.







Abstract
The development of bioinspired nano/subnano&#8208;sized (&lt;2&#8197;nm) ion channels is still considered a great challenge due to the difficulty in precisely controlling pore's internal structure and chemistry. Herein, for the first time, we report that three&#8208;dimensional functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can act as an effective nanofluidic platform for intelligent modulation of the ion transport. By strategic attachment of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 groups to the monomers as ion&#8208;driver door locks, we demonstrate that gating effects of functionalized COFs can be activated by lithium ions. The obtained materials exhibit an outstanding selective ion transmission performance with a high gating ratio (up to 23.6 for JUC&#8208;590), which is among the highest values in metal ion&#8208;activated solid&#8208;state nanochannels reported so far. Furthermore, JUC&#8208;590 offers high tunability, selectivity, and recyclability of ion transport proved by the experimental and simulated studies.

         <title>A Facile Potential Hold Method for Fostering an Inorganic Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile potential hold process fosters the growth of a more inorganic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) for anode&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Owing to the various decomposition potentials of the Li&#8208;solvation structures, salt anion&#8208;derived SEI was preferentially established on the current collector while reducing the components from organic solvents.







Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium batteries are regarded as an ultimate form of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, irreversible lithium loss during cycling plays a major role in degrading the overall cell performance in the anode&#8208;free configuration. To alleviate the deterioration, building a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interface on an anode current collector is an indispensable requirement. Here, we present a facile in&#8208;situ electrochemical method of a potential hold during the first charge to guide more salt&#8208;derived (less solvent&#8208;derived) decomposition on the anode interface. We show the distinctive decomposition potential of lithium salts and ether/carbonate solvents, where the Li&#8208;solvation structures with salt contact&#8208;ion&#8208;pairs preferentially decompose to form LiF&#8208;rich and less organic components, leading to enhanced lithium Coulombic efficiency in Li||Cu cells as well as mitigating the capacity fade of Cu||LiFePO4 and Cu||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cells.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Organic Reactions by Resonant Acoustic Mixing**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM) enables mechanochemical organic synthesis that avoids milling or crushing media, as well as bulk solvents. The RAM methodology enables significant simplification and improvement of mechanochemical olefin metathesis, the first mechanochemical strategy for ene&#8208;yne metathesis, and permits the direct, 200&#8208;fold scaling&#8208;up of the mechanochemical synthesis of pharmaceutically active sulfonylureas, without any significant changes to reaction conditions or conversion.







Abstract
We demonstrate catalytic organic synthesis by Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM): a mechanochemical methodology that does not require bulk solvent or milling media. Using as model reactions ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing metathesis and copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonamide&#8208;isocyanate coupling, RAM mechanosynthesis is shown to be faster, operationally simpler than conventional ball&#8208;milling, while also providing the first example of a mechanochemical strategy for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ene&#8208;yne metathesis. Reactions by RAM are readily and directly scaled&#8208;up without any significant changes in reaction conditions, as shown by the straightforward 200&#8208;fold scaling&#8208;up of the synthesis of the antidiabetic drug Tolbutamide, from hundreds of milligrams directly to 30&#8197;grams.

         <title>Preparation of Primary and Secondary Dialkylmagnesiums by a Radical I/Mg&#8208;Exchange Reaction Using sBu2Mg in Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Primary and secondary dialkylmagnesium reagents were prepared in toluene by the reaction of sBu2Mg with alkyl iodides (25&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8211;4&#8197;h). Stereoconvergent I/Mg&#8208;exchanges were observed for secondary cyclohexyl iodides leading after quenching reactions to products with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, including homo&#8208;aldol products. Mechanistic studies confirmed radical pathways for these exchanges.







Abstract
The treatment of primary or secondary alkyl iodides with sBu2Mg in toluene (25&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C, 2&#8211;4&#8197;h) provided dialkylmagnesiums that underwent various reactions with aldehydes, ketones, acid chlorides or allylic bromides. 3&#8208;Substituted secondary cyclohexyl iodides led to all&#8208;cis&#8208;3&#8208;cyclohexylmagnesium reagents under these exchange conditions in a highly stereoconvergent manner. Enantiomerically enriched 3&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;substituted secondary alkyl iodides gave after an exchange reaction with sBu2Mg stereodefined dialkylmagnesiums that after quenching with various electrophiles furnished various 1,3&#8208;stereodefined products including homo&#8208;aldol products (99&#8201;% dr and 98&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies confirmed a radical pathway for these new iodine/magnesium&#8208;exchange reactions.

         <title>Dehydrated UiO&#8208;66(SH)2: The Zr&#8722;O Cluster and Its Photocatalytic Role Mimicking the Biological Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dehydrated Zr&#8208;based MOF, UiO&#8208;66(SH)2, was found to show efficient conversion of N2 into NH3 under visible light. The revealed synergetic action of the photoelectron supported by the proton was analogous to that in molybdenum nitrogenase, however, with characteristic &#956;&#8208;N&#8722;Zr type interactions inside the [Zr6O6] cluster, which sheds new light on understanding the mechanism of nitrogenase.







Abstract
This work reports the dehydrated Zr&#8208;based MOF UiO&#8208;66(SH)2 as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalyst to mimic the biological N2 fixation process. The 15N2 and other control experiments demonstrated that the new photocatalyst is highly efficient in converting N2 to ammonia. In&#8208;situ TGA, XPS, and EXAFS as well as first&#8208;principles simulations were used to demonstrate the role of the thermal treatment and the changes of the local structures around Zr due to the dehydration. It was shown that the dehydration opened a gate for the entry of N2 molecules into the [Zr6O6] cluster where the strong N&#8801;N bond was broken stepwise by &#956;&#8208;N&#8722;Zr type interactions driven by the photoelectrons aided by the protonation. This mechanism was discussed in comparison with the Lowe&#8211;Thorneley mechanism proposed for the MoFe nitrogenase, and with emphasis on the [Zr6O6] cluster effect and the leading role of photoelectrons over the protonation. The results shed new light on understanding the catalytic mechanism of biological N2 fixation and open a new way to fix N2 under mild conditions.

The revealed synergetic action of the photoelectron supported by the proton was analogous to that in molybdenum nitrogenase, however, with characteristic &#956;-N&#8722;Zr type interactions inside the [Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] cluster, which sheds new light on understanding the mechanism of nitrogenase.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work reports the dehydrated Zr-based MOF UiO-66(SH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a visible-light-driven photocatalyst to mimic the biological N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation process. The &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other control experiments demonstrated that the new photocatalyst is highly efficient in converting N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ammonia. In-situ TGA, XPS, and EXAFS as well as first-principles simulations were used to demonstrate the role of the thermal treatment and the changes of the local structures around Zr due to the dehydration. It was shown that the dehydration opened a gate for the entry of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules into the [Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] cluster where the strong N&#8801;N bond was broken stepwise by &#956;-N&#8722;Zr type interactions driven by the photoelectrons aided by the protonation. This mechanism was discussed in comparison with the Lowe&#8211;Thorneley mechanism proposed for the MoFe nitrogenase, and with emphasis on the [Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] cluster effect and the leading role of photoelectrons over the protonation. The results shed new light on understanding the catalytic mechanism of biological N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation and open a new way to fix N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anchoring Ionic Liquid in Copper Electrocatalyst for Improving CO2 Conversion to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ionic liquid 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium nitrate (BmimNO3) was anchored into Cu, through which the atomic coordination and electronic properties of Cu can be optimized to facilitate C&#8722;C coupling. This electrocatalyst can reduce CO2 to C2H4 with high selectivity. The Faradaic efficiency of C2H4 reaches 77.3&#8201;% at &#8722;1.49&#8197;V (vs. RHE) in KHCO3 aqueous solution using a H&#8208;type cell, much higher than that over pure Cu catalyst (31.2&#8201;%).







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to valuable fuels is appealing for CO2 fixation and energy storage. The Cu&#8208;based catalysts feature unique superiorities, but achieving high ethylene selectivity is still restricted. In this study, we propose the anchoring of an ionic liquid (IL) on a Cu electrocatalyst for improving the electrochemical CO2 reduction to ethylene. In a water&#8208;based electrolyte and a commonly used H&#8208;type cell, a high ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 77.3&#8201;% was achieved at &#8722;1.49&#8197;V (vs. RHE). Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that an IL can modify the electronic structure of a Cu catalyst through its interaction with Cu, making it more conducive to *CO dimerization for ethylene formation.

Click On! &#951;6&#8208;Coordination of cationic cyclopentadienylruthenium(II) moieties is demonstrated to be a convenient, quantitative method for the click&#8208;like activation of aryl iodides as halogen bond donors. Photochemical demetalation using violet LEDs in MeCN returns the metal to its starting material form and supresses halogen bonding functionality. The cycle provides a reversible &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switch for controlling the halogen bond donor strength of aryl iodides.







Abstract
&#951;6&#8208;Metalated aryl halides are recognized as a class of halogen bond (XB) donors. Click&#8208;like &#951;6&#8208;metalation/demetalation of aryl iodides by cyclopentadienylruthenium(II) ([CpRuII]+) is shown to turn ON/OFF (amplify/suppress) XB donor functionality. [CpRu(MeCN)3][PF6] is shown to react quantitatively with iodobenzenes (ArIn, n=1,2) to yield [CpRu(&#951;6&#8208;ArIn)][PF6] compounds. Photochemical demetalation (405&#8197;nm) quantitatively reverts these compounds to ArIn and [CpRu(MeCN)3][PF6]. Crystal structures of [CpRu(ArXn)]+ salts show that the [CpRu(ArIn)]+ cations are strong, charge&#8208;assisted XB donors analogous to iodopyridinium cations. XB&#8208;induced association of [CpRu(C6H5I)]+ with diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) is established by NMR spectroscopy. [CpRu(C6H5I)][BPh4] and [CpRu(1,4&#8208;C6H4I2)][BPh4] co&#8208;crystallize with DABCO and the structure of [CpRu(1,4&#8208;C6H4I2)][BPh4]&#8901;DABCO&#8901;Et2O is reported. DFT calculations support amplification of the XBing capabilities of aryl iodides upon [CpRu]+&#8208;metalation.

         <title>Protein&#8211;Protein Communication Mediated by an Antibody&#8208;Responsive DNA Nanodevice**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the highly regulated networks of living systems, two antibody&#8208;responsive DNA&#8208;based devices are proposed that enable communication between two otherwise non&#8208;interacting proteins.







Abstract
We report here the rational design and optimization of an antibody&#8208;responsive, DNA&#8208;based device that enables communication between pairs of otherwise non&#8208;interacting proteins. The device is designed to recognize and bind a specific antibody and, in response, undergo a conformational change that leads to the release of a DNA strand, termed the &#8220;translator,&#8221; that regulates the activity of a downstream target protein. As proof of principle, we demonstrate antibody&#8208;induced control of the proteins thrombin and Taq DNA polymerase. The resulting strategy is versatile and, in principle, can be easily adapted to control protein&#8211;protein communication in artificial regulatory networks.

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;Assembly of an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene on Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible self&#8208;assembly of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene mediated by conformational switching can be tuned via controllable experimental conditions, leaving behind different largely ordered structures. Such method provides a new alternative and convenient method to influence the self&#8208;assembled structure of NHC&#8208;metal monolayers, a still missing but essential tool towards catalytic applications.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of cyclohexyl cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (cyCAAC) can be realized and reversibly switched from a close&#8208;packed trimer phase to a chainlike dimer phase, enabled by the ring&#8208;flip of the cyclohexyl wingtip. Multiple methods including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations identified a distinct isomer (axial or equatorial chair conformer) in each phase, and consequently support the conclusion regarding the determination of molecular surface geometry on the self&#8208;assembly of cyCAAC. Moreover, various substrates such as Ag (111) and Cu (111) are tested to elucidate the importance of cyCAAC&#8208;surface interactions on cyCAAC based nanopatterns. These investigations of patterned surfaces prompted a deep understanding of cyCAAC binding mode, surface geometry and reversible self&#8208;assembly, which are of paramount significance in the areas of catalysis, biosensor design and surface functionalization.

         <title>A Cholesterol Dimer Stabilizes the Inactivated State of an Inward&#8208;Rectifier Potassium Channel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of a cholesterol dimer&#8208;inward rectifier (Kir) channel complex using solid&#8208;state NMR and simulated annealing calculations is solved. The identified cholesterol binding pocket is directly linked to the mechanism of cholesterol&#8208;mediated inactivation of Kir channels. This work is one of the most detailed structural&#8208;functional studies of cholesterol dimer&#8208;protein interactions within a biological membrane.







Abstract
Cholesterol oligomers reside in multiple membrane protein X&#8208;ray crystal structures. Yet, there is no direct link between these oligomers and a biological function. Here we present the structural and functional details of a cholesterol dimer that stabilizes the inactivated state of an inward&#8208;rectifier potassium channel KirBac1.1. K+ efflux assays confirm that high cholesterol concentration reduces K+ conductance. We then determine the structure of the cholesterol&#8208;KirBac1.1 complex using Xplor&#8208;NIH simulated annealing calculations driven by solid&#8208;state NMR distance measurements. These calculations identified an &#945;&#8211;&#945; cholesterol dimer docked to a cleft formed by adjacent subunits of the homotetrameric protein. We compare these results to coarse grain molecular dynamics simulations. This is one of the first examples of a cholesterol oligomer performing a distinct biological function and structural characterization of a conserved promiscuous lipid binding region.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Indolenine and Indoline Ring Systems by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Dearomatization of Indoles**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular asymmetric spiroannulation of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles with internal alkynes was developed for the efficient construction of indoline structures with a C2&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. A stereospecific aza&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement was achieved to afford diverse indolenine products bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter.







Abstract
Dearomatized indole derivatives bearing a C3&#8208; or C2&#8208;stereocenter exist ubiquitously in natural products and biologically active molecules. Despite remarkable advances in their synthesis, stereoselective and regio&#8208;divergent methods are still in a high demand. Herein, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular asymmetric spiroannulation of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles with internal alkynes has been developed for the efficient construction of indoline structures with a C2&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. Stereospecific aza&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement of these indoline derivatives under acidic conditions afforded indolenine products bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter, where the migrating group could be controlled by the reaction sequence. The asymmetric spiroannulation together with the subsequent aza&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement enabled a divergent access to dearomatized indole derivatives with either a C3&#8208; or a C2&#8208;quaternary stereocenter.

         <title>A Multiplexed Cell&#8208;Free Assay to Screen for Antimicrobial Peptides in Double Emulsion Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel microfluidic system for the cell&#8208;free production and screening of antimicrobial peptides for their membrane specificity is introduced. On the device, the peptides are cell&#8208;free produced within water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water double emulsion droplets. Within each droplet, the peptides can interact with different liposomes, generating a membrane&#8208;specific fluorescent signal. The droplets can be analyzed via fluorescence microscopy of flow cytometry.







Abstract
The global surge in bacterial resistance against traditional antibiotics triggered intensive research for novel compounds, with antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) identified as a promising candidate. Automated methods to systematically generate and screen AMPs according to their membrane preference, however, are still lacking. We introduce a novel microfluidic system for the simultaneous cell&#8208;free production and screening of AMPs for their membrane specificity. On our device, AMPs are cell&#8208;free produced within water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water double emulsion droplets, generated at high frequency. Within each droplet, the peptides can interact with different classes of co&#8208;encapsulated liposomes, generating a membrane&#8208;specific fluorescent signal. The double emulsions can be incubated and observed in a hydrodynamic trapping array or analyzed via flow cytometry. Our approach provides a valuable tool for the discovery and development of membrane&#8208;active antimicrobials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Analyzing complex single&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;polymorphism (SNP) combinations in the genome is important for research and clinical applications, given that different SNP combinations can generate different phenotypic consequences. Recent works have shown that DNA&#8208;based molecular computing is powerful for simultaneously sensing and analyzing complex molecular information. Here, we designed a switching circuit&#8208;based DNA computational scheme that can integrate the sensing of multiple SNPs and simultaneously perform logical analysis of the detected SNP information to directly report clinical outcomes. As a demonstration, we successfully achieved automatic and accurate identification of 21 different blood group genotypes from 83 clinical blood samples with 100% accuracy compared to sequencing data in a more rapid manner (3 hours). Our method enables a new mode of automatic and logical sensing and analyzing subtle molecular information for clinical diagnosis, as well as guiding personalized medication.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymerization of a donor&#8208;acceptor bisterpyridine (BTP) equipped with an electron rich carbazole unit is observed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)|solution interface. It is shown that two&#8208;dimensional crystals of supramolecular (co)polymers are formed by chain growth polymerization, which in turn can be described by copolymerization statistics.

         <title>The Electronic Origin of Far&#8208;Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Oxygenic Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosystem&#8208;II uses sunlight to trigger charge separation and catalyze water oxidation. Intrinsic properties of chlorophyll a pigments define a natural &#8220;red limit&#8221; of photosynthesis at ~680 nm. Nevertheless, charge separation can be triggered with far&#8208;red photons up to 800 nm, without altering the nature of light&#8208;harvesting pigments. Here we identify the electronic origin of this remarkable phenomenon using quantum chemical and multiscale simulations on a native Photosystem&#8208;II model. We find that the reaction center is preorganized for charge separation in the far&#8208;red region by specific chlorophyll&#8211;pheophytin pairs, potentially bypassing the light&#8208;harvesting apparatus. Charge transfer can occur along two distinct pathways with one and the same pheophytin acceptor (PheoD1). The identity of the donor chlorophyll (ChlD1 or PD1) is wavelength&#8208;dependent and conformational dynamics broaden the sampling of far&#8208;red by the two charge&#8208;transfer states. The two pathways rationalize spectroscopic observations and underpin designed extensions of the photosynthetically active radiation limit.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallization&#8208;Driven Controlled Two&#8208;Dimensional (2D) Assemblies from Chromophore&#8208;Appended Poly(L&#8208;lactide)s: Highly Efficient Energy Transfer on a 2D Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rational approach towards precision two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assemblies by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of poly(L&#8208;lactides) (PLLAs), end&#8208;capped with dipolar dyes like merocyanine (MC) or naphthalene monoimide (NMI) and hydrophobic pyrene (PY) or benzene (Bn) is described. PLLA chains crystallize into diamond&#8208;shaped platelets in isopropanol, which forces the terminal dyes to assemble into 2D array on the platelet surface by either dipolar interactions or &#960;&#8208;stacking and exhibit tunable emission. Dipolar dyes play a critical role in imparting colloidal stability and structural uniformity to the 2D crystals, which is partly compromised for hydrophobic ones. Co&#8208;crystallization between NMI&#8208; and PY&#8208;labeled PLLAs yields similar diamond&#8208;shaped co&#8208;platelets with highly efficient (~80%) F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer on the 2D surface. Further, &#8220;living&#8221; CDSA method confers enlarged, segmented block co&#8208;platelets using one of the homopolymers as &#8220;seed&#8221; and the other as &#8220;unimer&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <title>Local Symmetry Breaking Suppresses the Thermal Conductivity in Crystalline Solid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the correlations of both the local and global structures with lattice dynamics is critical in achieving low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) in crystalline materials. Herein, we demonstrate local cationic off&#8208;centring within the global rock&#8208;salt structure of AgSbSe2 by using synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis and unravel the origin of its ultralow &#954;lat ~0.4 W/mK at 300 K. The cations are locally off&#8208;centered along the crystallographic &#12296;100&#12297; direction by about ~0.2 &#197;, which averages out as the rock&#8208;salt structure on the global scale. Phonon dispersion obtained within density functional theory (DFT) shows weak instabilities that cause local off&#8208;centering distortions within an anharmonic double&#8208;well potential. The local structural distortion arises from the stereochemically active 5s2 lone pairs of Sb. Our findings open an avenue for understanding how the local structure influences the phonon transport and facilitate the design of next generation crystalline materials with tailored thermal properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;directed Chemical Modification of Amyloid by Polyoxometalates for Inhibition of Protein Misfolding and Aggregation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) of protein can significantly change protein conformation and function. Inspired by the natural PTM, we present a new assay to inhibit amyloid aggregation by chemical PTM modification. Polyoxometalates (POMs), a kind of inhibitors to &#946;&#8208;amyloid peptide (A&#946;) aggregation, are used as an example to exhibit the chemical PTM methods. After thiazolidinethione (TZ) was modified on POM, the POM derivatives (POMD&#8208;TZ) became a chemical PTM agent and could site&#8208;selectively covalent modify on A&#946; at Lys16. Multiple biophysical techniques and biochemical assays have been employed to show the superiority of the chemical PTM method to traditional A&#946; inhibitors. Since A&#946; oligomers are more cytotoxic, we further functionalized POMD&#8208;TZ with an A&#946;&#8208;targeted peptide and fluorescent probe to obtain an &#8220;A&#946; oligomer sensitized&#8221; probe. Our work provides a new way to regulate amyloid aggregation by using PTM agents for site&#8208;directed chemical modification of proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Construction of Biomimetic Nanosensors for Electrochemical Monitoring of Intracellular Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The current strategies for nanoelectrode functionalization usually involve sophisticated modification procedures, uncontrollable and unstable modifier assembly, as well as a limited variety of modifiers. To address this issue, we propose a versatile strategy for large&#8208;scale synthesis of biomimetic molecular catalysts (BMCs) modified nanowires (NWs) to construct functionalized electrochemical nanosensors. This design protocol employs an easy, controllable and stable assembly of diverse BMCs&#8208;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) composites on conductive NWs. The intrinsic catalytic activity of BMCs combined with outstanding electron transfer ability of conductive polymer enables the nanosensors to sensitively and selectively detect various biomolecules. Further application of sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine functionalized nanosensors achieves real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of intracellular glutathione levels and its redox homeostasis in single living cells for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Super&#8208;robust Xanthine&#8208;Sodium Complexes on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A widely&#8208;accepted theory is that life originated from the hydrothermal environment in the primordial ocean. Nevertheless, the low desorption temperature from inorganic substrates and the fragileness of hydrogen&#8208;bonded nucleobases do not support the required thermal stability in such an environment. Herein, we report the super&#8208;robust complexes of xanthine, one of the precursors for the primitive nucleic acids, with Na. We demonstrate that the well&#8208;defined xanthine&#8208;Na complexes can only form when the temperature is &#8805;430 K, and the complexes keep adsorbed even at ~720 K, presenting as the most thermally stable organic polymer ever reported on Au(111). This work not only justifies the necessity of high&#8208;temperature, Na&#8208;rich environment for the prebiotic biosynthesis but also reveals the robustness of the xanthine&#8208;Na complexes upon the harsh environment. Moreover, the complexes can induce significant electron transfer with the metal as inert as Au and hence lift the Au atoms up.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Damage&#8208;Response&#8208;Targeting Mitochondria&#8208;Activated Multifunctional Prodrug Strategy for Self&#8208;defensive Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel multifunctional construct, M1, designed explicitly to target the DNA damage response in cancer cells. M1 contains both a floxuridine (FUDR) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor combined with a GSH&#8208;sensitive linker. Further conjugation of the triphenylphosphonium moiety allows M1 to undergo specific activation in the mitochondria, where mitochondria&#8208;mediated apoptosis is observed. Moreover, M1 has enormous effects on genomic DNA ascribed to FUDR's primary function of impeding DNA/RNA synthesis combined with diminishing PP2A&#8208;activated DNA repair pathways. Importantly, mechanistic studies highlight the PP2A obtrusion in FUDR/5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) therapy and underscore the importance of its inhibition to harbor therapeutic potential. HCT116 cell xenograft&#8208;bearing mice that have a low response rate to 5&#8208;FU show a prominent effect with M1, emphasizing the importance of DNA damage response targeting strategies using tumor&#8208;specific microenvironment&#8208;activatable systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;powered Ion Pumping in a Cation&#8208;selective Conducting Polymer Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The simulation of the ion pumping against a proton gradient energized by light in the photosynthesis is of significant importance for the energy conversion in a non&#8208;biological environment. Herein, we report a light&#8208;powered ion pumping in a polystyrene sulfonate anions (PSS) doped polypyrrole (PPy) conducting polymer membrane (PSS&#8208;PPy) with a symmetric geometry. This PSS&#8208;PPy conducting polymer membrane exhibits a cationic selectivity and a light&#8208;responsive surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion transport attributed to the negatively charged PSS groups. An asymmetric visible irradiation on one side of PSS&#8208;PPy membrane induces a built&#8208;in electric field across the membrane due to the intrinsic photoelectronic property of PPy, which drives the cationic transport against the concentration gradient, demonstrating an ion pumping effect. This work is a prototype that uses a geometry&#8208;symmetric conducting polymer membrane as a light&#8208;powered artificial ion pump for active ion transport, which exhibits potential applications in nanofluidic energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Iterative Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxyoligosaccharides Enabled by Stereoselective Visible&#8208;Light Promoted Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoinitiated intramolecular hydroetherification of alkenols has been used to form C&#8208;O bonds, but the intermolecular hydroetherification of alkenes with alcohols remains an unsolved challenge. We herein report the visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted 2&#8208;deoxyglycosylation of alcohols with glycals. The glycosylation reaction was completed within 2 min in a high quantum yield (&#966; = 28.6). This method was suitable for a wide array of substrates and displayed good reaction yields and excellent stereoselectivity. The value of this protocol was further demonstrated by the iterative synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxyglycans with &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglycosidic linkages up to a 20&#8208;mer in length and digoxin with &#946;&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglycosidic linkages. Mechanistic studies indicated that this reaction involved a glycosyl radical cation intermediate and a photoinitiated chain process.</dc:description>

         <title>Competitive Doping Chemistry for Nickel&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modification of electrode materials by heteroatom dopants is crucial for improving storage performance in rechargeable batteries.   Electron configurations of different dopants significantly influence the chemical interactions inbetween and the chemical bonding with the host material, yet the mechanism underneath remains unclear.  We revealed competitive doping chemistry of Group IIIA elements (boron and aluminum) taking nickel&#8208;rich cathode materials as a model. A notable difference between atomic radii of B and Al accounts for different spatial configurations of hybridized orbital in bonding with lattice oxygen. Density functional theory calculations reveal, Al is preferentially bonded to oxygen and vice versa, and shows much lower diffusion barrier than B(III). In case of Al&#8208;preoccupation, the bulk diffusion of B(III) is hindered. In this way, a B&#8208;rich surface and Al&#8208;rich bulk is formed, which helps to synergistically stabilize the structural evolution and surface chemistry of the cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Coal&#8208;Bed Methane Purification with Record&#160;CH4/N2 Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enrichment and purification of coal&#8208;bed methane provide a source of energy and help offset global warming. In this work, we demonstrate a strategy involving the regulation of the pore size and pore chemistry to promote the separation of CH  4  /N  2  mixtures in four nickel&#8208;based coordination networks, named  Ni(ina)  2  ,  Ni(3&#8208;ain)  2  ,  Ni(2&#8208;ain)  2  , and  Ni(pba)  2  , (where  ina  = isonicotinic acid,  3&#8208;ain  = 3&#8208;aminoisonicotinic acid,  2&#8208;ain  = 2&#8208;aminoisonicotinic acid, and  pba  = 4&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzoic acid). Among them,  Ni(ina)  2  and  Ni(3&#8208;ain)  2  can effectively separate CH  4  from N  2  with top&#8208;performing performance because of the suitable pore size (~0.6 and 0.5 nm) and pore environment. Explicitly,  Ni(ina)  2  exhibits the highest ever reported CH  4  /N  2  selectivity of 15.8 and excellent CH  4  uptake (40.8 cm  3  g  &#8208;1  ) at ambient conditions, thus setting new benchmarks for all reported MOFs and traditional adsorbents. The exceptional CH  4  /N  2  separation performance of  Ni(ina)  2  is confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Under different CH  4  /N  2  ratios,  Ni(ina)  2  selectively extracts methane from the gaseous blend and produces a high purity of CH  4  (99%). Theoretical calculations and CH  4  &#8208;loading single&#8208;crystal structure analysis provide critical insight into the adsorption/separation mechanism.  Ni(ina)  2  and  Ni(3&#8208;ain)  2  can form rich intermolecular interactions with methane, indicating a strong adsorption affinity between pore walls and CH  4  molecules. Importantly,  Ni(ina)  2  has good thermal and moisture stability and can easily be scaled up at a low cost ($25 per kilogram), which will be valuable for potential industrial applications. Overall, this work provides a powerful approach for the selective adsorption of CH  4  from coal&#8208;bed methane.</dc:description>

         <title>A Reversible Chemogenetic Switch for Chimeric Antigen Receptor T&#8197;Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy suffers from complications including cytokine release syndromes and T cell exhaustion. To curb these drawbacks, Jianfeng Zhou, Wenshe&#8197;Ray Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202109550) reported a chemogenetic switch that can be reversibly turned on and off to control the expression of CAR using a clinical approved small&#8208;molecule drug, asunaprevir. This novel technique will potentially enable delicate modulation of CAR&#8208;T activation during cancer treatment.

         <dc:description>
We present evidence that the dual emission of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vinylimine boron compounds consisting of fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence in solution is caused by the experimental artifact, where bright emission intensity saturates the detection dynamic range of the fluorimeter.







Abstract
A series of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vinylimine boron compounds 1&#8211;7 have been reported to exhibit unique dual emission, consisting of fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in solution. This finding triggered intensive research of RTP in &#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vinylimine boron derivatives. Herein, we show clear evidence that the associated dual emission, especially RTP, is caused by the experimental artifact, where bright emission intensity saturates the detection dynamic range of the fluorimeter.

         <title>A Nuclear&#8208;Targeted AIE Photosensitizer for Enzyme Inhibition and Photosensitization in Cancer Cell Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nucleus is considered the ideal target for anti&#8208;tumor therapy because DNA and some enzymes in the nucleus are the main causes of cell canceration and malignant proliferation. However, nuclear target drugs with good biosafety and high efficiency in cancer treatment are rare. Herein, a nuclear&#8208;targeted material MeTPAE with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics was developed based on a triphenylamine structure skeleton. MeTPAE can not only interact with histone deacetylases (HDACs) to inhibit cell proliferation but also damage telomere and nucleic acids precisely through photodynamic treatment (PDT). The cocktail strategy of MeTPAE caused obvious cell cycle arrest and showed excellent PDT antitumor activity, which offered new opportunities for the effective treatment of malignant tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Insights into the Notorious CO Poisoning of Platinum Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon monoxide (CO) is notorious for its strong adsorption to poison platinum group metal catalysts in chemical industry. Here, we conceptually distinguish and quantify the effects of the occupancy and energy of d electrons, emerging as the two vital factors in d&#8208;band theory, on CO poisoning of Pt nanocatalysts. The stepwise defunctionalization of carbon support is adopted to fine&#8208;tune the 5d electronic structure of supported Pt nanoparticles. Excluding other promotional mechanisms, the increase of Pt 5d band energy strengthens the competitive adsorption of hydrogen against CO for the preferential oxidation of CO, affording the scaling relationship between Pt 5d band energy and CO/H2 adsorption energy difference. The decrease of Pt 5d band occupancy lowers CO site coverage to promote its association with oxygen for the total oxidation of CO, giving the scaling relationship between Pt 5d occupancy and activation energy. The above insights draw a molecular&#8208;level understanding of CO poisoning.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis and reactivity of disilicon(0) complexes are of fundamental and application importance. Herein, we report the development of an N&#8208;heterocyclic imino substituted silylene (1), which has strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability and is significantly sterically hindered. The one&#8208;pot reaction of this silylene with [IPr&#8594;SiCl2] (IPr = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and KC8 (2 equiv.) in THF at &#8208;30 &#186;C leads to a silylene ligated disilicon(0) complex (2), isolated as red crystals in 60% yield. Characterization data and DFT calculations show that the trans&#8208;bent Si4 skeleton in 2 features a Si(0)=Si(0) double bond with a significant &#960;&#8722;&#960; bonding and one lone pair of electrons on each of these two Si(0) atoms. Complex 2 reacts readily with phenylacetylene, producing a structurally intriguing silatricyclic complex 6,8&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,2,5&#8208;trisilatricyclo&#8208;[3.2.1.02,7]&#8208;oct&#8208;3&#8208;ene (3), and revealing new aspects of low valent silicon chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the circular polarization capacity from chiral cellulose nanocrystal films for photo&#8208;controlled chiral helix of supramolecular polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized light (CPL) is key to asymmetric photochemistry as it could impart the chiral organization information into chemical products. Here, we demonstrate the circular polarization capacity from chiral cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) films to trigger photo&#8208;alignment of achiral supramolecular polymers into helical structures. Right&#8208;handed transmitted (T&#8208;) CPL was generated from self&#8208;assembled CNC films, which induced amorphous azobenzene (Azo) supramolecular polymers into chiral structures. The chiral induction effect of T&#8208;CPL is enhanced on Azo polymers with longer spacers. The absorptive dissymmetry factor (g  abs  ) values of liquid crystal supramolecular polymers can be amplified significantly (over 10 times) after T&#8208;CPL irradiation. Moreover, by integrating carbon dots into CNC films, CPL emission with considerable luminescence dissymmetry factor (g  lum  ) up to &#8208;0.66 was achieved, and it could be used for the photo&#8208;alignment of Azo polymers with high chiroptical property. This work provides new insight for the photo modulation of supramolecular polymers by CPL&#8208;active materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of Spatial and Temporal Control in Precision Cyclic Vinyl Polymer Synthesis by Lewis Pair Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In typical cyclic polymer synthesis via ring&#8208;closure, chain growth and cyclization events are competing with each other, thus affording cyclic polymers with uncontrolled molecular weight or ring size and high dispersity. Here we uncover a mechanism by which Lewis pair polymerization (LPP) operates on polar vinyl monomers that allows the control of where and when cyclization takes place, thereby achieving spatial and temporal control to afford precision cyclic vinyl polymers or block copolymers with predictable molecular weight and low dispersity (~1.03). A combined experimental and theoretical study demonstrates that cyclization occurs only after all monomers have been consumed (when) via conjugate addition of the propagating chain end to the specific site of the initiating chain end (where), allowing the cyclic polymer formation steps to be regulated and executed with precision in space and time.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;mediated protein shuttling between coacervate&#8208;based artificial cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of protein uptake and secretion is crucial for (inter)cellular signaling. Mimicking these molecular events is essential when engineering synthetic cellular systems. A first step towards achieving this goal is obtaining control over the uptake and release of proteins from synthetic cells in response to an external trigger. Herein, we have developed an artificial cell that sequesters and releases proteinaceous cargo upon addition of a coded chemical signal: single&#8208;stranded DNA oligos (ssDNA) were employed to independently control the localization of a set of three different ssDNA&#8208;modified proteins. The molecular coded signal allows for multiple iterations of triggered uptake and release, regulation of the amount and rate of protein release and the sequential release of the three different proteins. This signaling concept was furthermore used to directionally transfer a protein between two artificial cell populations, providing novel directions for engineering lifelike communication pathways inside higher order (proto)cellular structures.</dc:description>

         <title>MOF&#8208;hosted enzymes for continuous flow catalysis in aqueous and organic solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fully exploiting the potential of enzymes in cell&#8208;free biocatalysis requires a stabilization of the catalytically active proteins and their integration into efficient reactor systems. Although in recent years initial steps towards the immobilization of such biomolecules in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been taken, these demonstrations have been limited to batch experiments and to aqueous conditions. Here we demonstrate a continuous MOF&#8208;based continuous flow enzyme reactor system, with high productivity and stability, which is also suitable for organic solvents. Under aqueous conditions, the stability of the enzyme was increased by 30&#8208;fold, and the space&#8208;time yield exceeded that obtained with other enzyme immobilization strategies by an order of magnitude. Importantly, the infiltration of the proteins into the MOF did not require additional functionalization, thus allowing for a time and cost&#8208;efficient fabrication of the biocatalysts using label&#8208;free enzymes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Ni,Fe&#8208;containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs) catalyze the reversible reduction of CO2 to CO. Several anaerobic microorganisms encode multiple CODHs in their genome, of which some, despite being annotated as CODHs, lack a cysteine of the canonical binding motif for the active site Ni,Fe&#8208;cluster.

         <title>Extraordinary p&#8211;d Hybridization Interaction in Heterostructural Pd&#8208;PdSe Nanosheets Boosts C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage of Ethylene Glycol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tensile strain effect and extraordinary p&#8211;d hybridization interaction that co&#8208;exist on Pd&#8208;PdSe heterostructural nanosheets could effectively boost the C&#8722;C bond breaking in the ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and enhance the catalytic performance.







Abstract
Advanced electrocatalysts for complete oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) in direct EG fuel cells are strongly desired owing to the higher energy efficiency. Herein, Pd&#8208;PdSe heterostructural nanosheets (Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs) have been successfully fabricated via a one&#8208;step approach. These Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs feature unique electronic and geometrical structures, in which unconventional p&#8211;d hybridization interactions and tensile strain effect co&#8208;exist. Compared with commercial Pd/C and Pd NSs catalysts, Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs display 5.5 (6.6) and 2.5 (2.6) fold enhancement of specific (mass) activity for the EG oxidation reaction (EGOR). Especially, the optimum C1 pathway selectivity of Pd&#8208;PdSe HNSs reaches 44.3&#8201;%, illustrating the superior C&#8722;C bond cleavage ability. Electrochemical in situ FTIR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the extraordinary p&#8211;d hybridization interaction and tensile strain effect could effectively reduce the activation energy of C&#8722;C bond breaking and accelerate CO* oxidation, boosting the complete oxidation of EG and improving the catalytic performance.

&lt;p&gt;Advanced electrocatalysts for complete oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) in direct EG fuel cells are strongly desired owing to the higher energy efficiency. Herein, Pd-PdSe heterostructural nanosheets (Pd-PdSe HNSs) have been successfully fabricated via a one-step approach. These Pd-PdSe HNSs feature unique electronic and geometrical structures, in which unconventional p&#8211;d hybridization interactions and tensile strain effect co-exist. Compared with commercial Pd/C and Pd NSs catalysts, Pd-PdSe HNSs display 5.5 (6.6) and 2.5 (2.6) fold enhancement of specific (mass) activity for the EG oxidation reaction (EGOR). Especially, the optimum C1 pathway selectivity of Pd-PdSe HNSs reaches 44.3&#8201;%, illustrating the superior C&#8722;C bond cleavage ability. Electrochemical in situ FTIR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the extraordinary p&#8211;d hybridization interaction and tensile strain effect could effectively reduce the activation energy of C&#8722;C bond breaking and accelerate CO* oxidation, boosting the complete oxidation of EG and improving the catalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Real&#8208;time Observation of Structural Dynamics Triggering Excimer Formation in a Perylene Bisimide Folda&#8208;dimer by Ultrafast Time&#8208;Domain Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The term &#8220;excimer&#8221;, a contraction of an excited dimer, is the most classical photoproduct in organic materials. In this work, vibrational snapshots showing ultrafast structural dynamics triggering the excimer formation and its relaxation are presented based on ultrafast time&#8208;domain Raman spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that interchromophore vibrational modes are related to perturbing the excited&#8208;state potential surface of a dimer stack.







Abstract
In &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic photovoltaic materials, an excimer state has been generally regarded as a trap state which hinders efficient excitation energy transport. But despite wide investigations of the excimer for overcoming the undesirable energy loss, the understanding of the relationship between the structure of the excimer in stacked organic compounds and its properties remains elusive. Here, we present the landscape of structural dynamics from the excimer formation to its relaxation in a co&#8208;facially stacked archetypical perylene bisimide folda&#8208;dimer using ultrafast time&#8208;domain Raman spectroscopy. We directly captured vibrational snapshots illustrating the ultrafast structural evolution triggering the excimer formation along the interchromophore coordinate on the complex excited&#8208;state potential surfaces and following evolution into a relaxed excimer state. Not only does this work showcase the ultrafast structural dynamics necessary for the excimer formation and control of excimer characteristics but also provides important criteria for designing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic molecules.

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of P&#8208;Chiral Aminophosphinites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of P&#8208;chiral aminophosphinites with esters of hydroxylamines is achieved by means of the dynamic kinetic transformation of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines. A two&#8208;electron redox process is proposed for this reaction based on mechanistic studies.







Abstract
Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of diarylphosphines and O&#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamines is developed. In the cases of symmetrical diarylphosphines, a series of aminophosphinites is prepared in high yields. In the cases of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines, an array of P&#8208;chiral aminophosphinites is synthesized in high yields with high enantioselectivity by using a copper(I)&#8208;(R,RP)&#8208;Ph&#8208;FOXAP complex as a chiral catalyst. Based on several control experiments and 31P&#8197;NMR studies, a two&#8208;electron redox mechanism involving the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines is proposed for the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction. Finally, one representative P&#8208;chiral phosphoric amide generated through the oxidation with H2O2 is transformed to a chiral diarylphosphinate in high yield with retained enantioselectivity, which allows further transformations towards various P&#8208;chiral tertiary phosphines.

         <title>Phosphonate/Phosphine Oxide Dyad Additive for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;in&#8208;one dyad additive combining phosphonate and phosphine oxide groups for efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is demonstrated. Owing to its dual roles of passivating defects and enhancing carrier radiative recombination, quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional green PeLEDs with maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.1&#8201;% is obtained.







Abstract
Additives play a critical role for efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Here, we report a novel phosphonate/phosphine oxide dyad molecular additive (PE&#8208;TPPO), with unique dual roles of passivating defects and enhancing carrier radiative recombination, to boost the device efficiency of metal&#8211;halide perovskites. In addition to the defect passivation effect of the phosphine oxide group to enhance the photoluminescence intensity and homogeneity of perovskite film, the phosphonate group with strong electron affinity can capture the injected electrons to increase local carrier concentration and accelerate the carrier radiative recombination in the electroluminescence process. Owing to their synergistic enhancement on device efficiency, quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional green PeLEDs modified by this dyad additive exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency, current efficiency, and power efficiency of 25.1&#8201;%, 100.5&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and 98.7&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, respectively, which are among the reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiencies.

         <title>The Role of Copper Salts and O2 in the Mechanism of C&#8801;N Bond Activation for Facilitating Nitrogen Transfer Reactions**
</title>

         <dc:description>
A detailed theoretical study on the intricate mechanism and electron transfer landscape of oxygen&#8208;assisted copper&#8208;promoted formation of aryl nitrile species starting from aryl aldehyde. In this reaction the major driving force is the redox cycle of the copper center (CuII/CuI), which acts as the electron source and sink whenever necessary along the course of reaction.







Abstract
C&#8801;N bond scission can be a potential avenue for the functionalization of chemical bonds. We have conducted a computational study, using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio multireference CASSCF methods, to unravel the intricate mechanistic pathways traversed in the copper&#8208;promoted, dioxygen&#8208;assisted reaction for the formation of aryl isocyanate species from aryl aldehyde. This aryl isocyanate species acts as an active species for C&#8801;N bond cleavage of coordinated cyanide anion enabling nitrogen transfer to various aldehydes. Electronic structure analysis revealed that under all the reaction conditions radical&#8208;based pathways are operative, which is in agreement with the experimental findings. The major driving force is a CuII/I redox cycle initiated by single&#8208;electron transfer from the carbon center of the nitrile moiety. Our study reveals that the copper salts act as the &#8220;electron pool&#8221; in this unique nitrogen transfer reaction forming an aryl isocyanate species from aryl aldehydes.

         <title>A Facile and Unprecedented Route to a Library of Thermostable Formaldehyde&#8208;Derived Polyesters: Highly Active and Selective Copolymerization of Cyclic Acetals and Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work discloses the alternating copolymerization of cyclic acetals and anhydrides for the first time, using 5 cyclic acetals and 9 cyclic anhydrides to afford 45 unprecedented polyesters that can flow at ambient temperature.







Abstract
The development of new strategies for producing polyesters can expand the category of biodegradable materials. Here, we disclose the alternating copolymerization of cyclic acetals (made from formaldehyde and diols) and anhydrides for the first time, using 5 cyclic acetals and 9 anhydrides to afford 45 unprecedented polyesters.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of new strategies for producing polyesters can expand the category of biodegradable materials. Here, we disclose the alternating copolymerization of cyclic acetals (made from formaldehyde and diols) and anhydrides for the first time, using 5 cyclic acetals and 9 anhydrides to afford 45 unprecedented polyesters. At a wide range of reaction temperatures (25 to 140&#8201;&#176;C), diverse metal-free Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acids are highly active catalysts for these copolymerizations via the cationic mechanism. Of interest, kinetic studies indicate that the copolymerization of cyclic acetals and anhydrides shifts the chemical equilibrium of &#8220;cyclic acetals &#8652; polyacetals&#8221; to the left, thus yielding polyesters with up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;% alternating degree.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D COFs with a non&#8208;interpenetrated hea net, JUC&#8208;596 and JUC&#8208;597, are designed and successfully synthesized for the first time. Remarkably, JUC&#8208;596 exhibits an exceptional performance in H2 adsorption up to 305&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (or 2.72&#8197;wt%) at 77&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, which is higher than previous benchmarks from porous organic polymers reported so far.







Abstract
Owing to the finite building blocks and difficulty in structural identification, it remains a tremendous challenge to elaborately design and synthesize three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with predetermined topologies. Herein, we report the first two cases of 3D COFs with the non&#8208;interpenetrated hea net, termed JUC&#8208;596 and JUC&#8208;597, by using the combination of tetrahedral and triangular prism building units. Due to the presence of triptycene functional groups and fluorine atoms, JUC&#8208;596 exhibits an exceptional performance in the H2 adsorption up to 305&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (or 2.72&#8197;wt%) at 77&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, which is higher than previous benchmarks from porous organic materials reported so far. Furthermore, the strong interaction between H2 and COF materials is verified through the DFT theoretical calculations. This work represents a captivating example of rational design of functional COFs based on a reticular chemistry guide and demonstrates its promising application in clean energy storage.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Stannate(II): A Tetraamido Tin(II) Dianion and Strong Metal&#8208;Centered &#963;&#8208;Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The macrocyclic calix[4]pyrrole enables the synthesis of the first tetraamido tin(II) dianion. The compound is a very strong metal&#8208;centered &#963;&#8208;donor with a Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) value exceeding that of carbenes and electron&#8208;rich phosphines. The coordinative and nucleophilic features are demonstrated with transition metals and organic substrates.







Abstract
Anionic, metal&#8208;centered nucleophiles are emerging compounds with unique reactivities. Here, we describe the isolation and full characterization of the first tetraamido tin(II) dianion, its behavior as ligand towards transition metals, and its reactivity as a tin&#8208;centered nucleophile. Experimental values such as the Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) and computations attest tin&#8208;located &#963;&#8208;donor ability exceeding that of carbenes or electron&#8208;rich phosphines. Against transition metals, the stannate(II) can act as &#951;1&#8208; or &#951;5&#8208;type ligand. With aldehydes, it reacts by hydride substitution to give valuable acyl stannates. The reductive dehalogenation of iodobenzene indicates facile redox pathways mediated by halogen bond interaction. Calix[4]pyrrolato stannate(II) represents the first example of this macrocyclic ligand in low&#8208;valent p&#8208;block element chemistry.

         <title>Dissection of Light&#8208;Induced Charge Accumulation at a Highly Active Iron Porphyrin: Insights in the Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptionally high performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photocatalytic reduction displayed by an iron&#8211;porphyrin bearing urea groups in the second coordination sphere is the result of the interaction of CO2 with the catalyst prior to the occurrence of the second electron uptake in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
Iron porphyrins are among the best molecular catalysts for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Powering these catalysts with the help of photosensitizers comes along with a couple of unsolved challenges that need to be addressed with much vigor. We have designed an iron porphyrin catalyst decorated with urea functions (UrFe) acting as a multipoint hydrogen bonding scaffold towards the CO2 substrate. We found a spectacular photocatalytic activity reaching unreported TONs and TOFs as high as 7270 and 3720&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively. While the Fe0 redox state has been widely accepted as the catalytically active species, we show here that the FeI species is already involved in the CO2 activation, which represents the rate&#8208;determining step in the photocatalytic cycle. The urea functions help to dock the CO2 upon photocatalysis. DFT calculations bring support to our experimental findings that constitute a new paradigm in the catalytic reduction of CO2.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peripheral substitution of a &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrin with bulky groups produces a curved chromophore with four helical stereogenic units. The curvature and stereochemistry of such porphyrins can be controlled by varying the substituents, coordinated metal ions, and apical ligands. In particular, when the achiral saddle&#8208;shaped free bases are treated with large metal ions, i.e., Cd  II  or Hg  II  , the resulting complexes switch to chiral propeller&#8208;like configurations. X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses show that apical coordination of a water molecule is sufficient to induce a notable bowl&#8208;like distortion of the cadmium complex, which however retains its chiral structure. For phenyl&#8208; and tolyl&#8208;substituted derivatives, the switching is thermodynamically controlled, whereas complexes bearing bulky 4&#8208;(  tert  &#8208;butyl)phenyl groups switch to their chiral forms upon heating. In the latter case, the chiral Hg porphyrin was converted into the corresponding free base and other metal complexes without any loss of configurational purity, ultimately providing access to stable, enantiopure porphyrin propellers.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational development of anion templation strategy in the construction of macrocycles has been historically limited to small anions, but large polyoxoanions can offer unmatched structural diversity and ample binding sites. Here we report the formation of a {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle by using the Preyssler anion, [NaP5W30O110]14&#8211; ({P5W30}), as a supramolecular template. The {Mo22Fe8} macrocycle displays selective anion binding behavior in solution. In the solid state, the 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex, {P5W30}2&#8834;{Mo22Fe8}, transports protons more effectively, through extended hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, than a related 1:1 complex where the guest is completely encapsulated. The results highlight the great potential this anion templation approach has in producing macrocyclic systems for selective anion recognition and proton conduction purposes.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of Hyperforin and Pyrohyperforin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Capitalizing on the late&#8208;stage diversification of an essential 1,3&#8208;diene intermediate, we describe herein a 9&#8208;step enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;hyperforin and (+)&#8208;pyrohyperforin, starting from commercially available allylacetone. Our convergent synthesis features a series of critical reactions: (1) an enantioselective deconjugative &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acid using chiral lithium amides as noncovalent stereodirecting auxiliaries; (2) a HfCl  4  mediated carbonyl &#945;&#8208;  tert  &#8208;alkylation to forge the intricate bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane framework; (3) an abiotic cascade pyran formation; and (4) a selective 1,4&#8208;semihydrogenation of polyenes. During the course of our synthesis, we also identified a 1,2cyclopropanediol overbred intermediate which was responsible for the 1,3&#8208;diene precursor formation through a controlled fragmentation.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Disassembly of Elemental Sulfur: An Approach to the Precise Synthesis of Polydisulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The usage of elemental sulfur (S  8  ) for constructing sulfur&#8208;containing polymers is of great significance in terms of sulfur resource utilization or fabricating high&#8208;performance polymers. Currently, the random disassembly of S  8  hinders its direct use in the precise synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers. Herein, we provide an effective strategy for controlling the dismantlement of S  8  to synthesize polydisulfides, a promising category of dynamic bonds containing polymers. In this strategy, the completely alternating copolymerization of one sulfur atom, which is orderly derived from S  8  , with episulfides is achieved with MTBD (7&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene) as catalyst and [PPN]SbF  6  ([PPN]  +  is bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium) as cocatalyst. Delightedly, the living polymerization feature, and the good monomer compatibility allows for the access to diverse polydisulfides. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) was employed to elaborate the copolymerization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Wrinkled Titanium Carbide (MXene) with Surface Charge Polarizations through Chemical Etching for Superior Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the high conductivity of two&#8208;dimensional laminated transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) contributes to outstanding electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding by the reflection of electromagnetic waves (EWs), it is difficulty to improve EMI shielding by pursuing higher conductivity due to the limitation of intrinsic properties. Here, we achieve the superior EMI shielding by introducing the absorption of EWs in MXenes with micro&#8208;sized wrinkles which is induced by abundant Ti vacancies under the chemical etching. The shielding effectiveness is up to 107 dB at 20 &#181;m&#8208;thickness. Combining with atomic&#8208;scale structure observation and the first&#8208;principles calculations, it is concluded that the promotion of EMI shielding originates from the resonant absorption of formed electric dipoles induced by the asymmetrical distribution of charge densities near Ti vacancies. Our results could open a new vista for developing two&#8208;dimensional EMI shielding materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO/CH4 using Metal&#8208;Organic &#8216;Soft&#8217; Coordination Polymer Gel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of well&#8208;defined and astutely designed, low molecular weight gelator (LMWG) based linker with a suitable metal ion is a promising method for preparing photocatalytically active coordination polymer gels. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and gelation behaviour of a tetrapodal LMWG based on a porphyrin core connected to four terpyridine units (TPY&#8208;POR) through amide linkages. The self&#8208;assembly of TPY&#8208;POR LMWG with Ru  II  ions results in a Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR coordination polymer gel (CPG), with a nanoscroll morphology. Ru&#8208;TPY&#8208;POR CPG exhibits efficient CO  2  photoreduction to CO (3.5 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ) with &gt;99% selectivity in the presence of triethylamine (TEA) as sacrificial electron donor. Interestingly, in the presence of 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) with TEA as the sacrificial electron donor, the 8e  &#8208;  /8H  +  photoreduction of CO  2  to CH  4  is realized with &gt;95 % selectivity (6.7 mmol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ). In CPG, porphyrin acts as a photosensitizer and covalently attached [Ru(TPY)  2  ]  2+  acts as a catalytic center as demonstrated by femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. Further, combining information from the  in situ  DRIFT spectroscopy and DFT calculation, a possible reaction mechanism for CO  2  reduction to CO and CH  4  was outlined.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Allylic C&#8211;H Alkylation Enabled by a Dual&#8208;Function&#160;Cobalt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct functionalization of allylic C&#8211;H bonds with nucleophiles minimizes pre&#8208;functionalization and converts inexpensive, abundantly available materials to value&#8208;added alkenyl&#8208;substituted products but remains challenging. Here we report an electrocatalytic allylic C&#8211;H alkylation reaction with carbon nucleophiles employing an easily available cobalt&#8208;salen complex as the molecular catalyst. These C(sp3)&#8211;H/C(sp3)&#8211;H cross&#8208;coupling reactions proceed through H2 evolution and require no external chemical oxidants. Importantly, the mild conditions and unique electrocatalytic radical process ensure excellent functional group tolerance and substrate compatibility with both linear and branched terminal alkenes. The synthetic utility of the electrochemical method is highlighted by its scalability (up to 200 mmol scale) under low loading of electrolyte (down to 0.05 equiv) and its successful application in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Oriented Nanoarchitectonics of Bacteriorhodopsin for Enhancement of ATP Generation of FoF1&#8208;ATPase Based Assembly System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The energy conversion plays an important role in the metabolism of the photosynthesis organisms. Improving energy transformation by promoting proton gradient, has been a great challenge for a long time. In the present work, we realize a proton directional migration by building oriented bacteriorhodopsin (BR) microcapsules coated by F  o  F  1  &#8208;ATPase molecular motors through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) assembly. The conformation changes of BR under illumination lead to proton transfer in radial direction, which generates a higher proton gradient to drive F  o  F  1  &#8208;ATPase for the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Furthermore, to promote the photosynthetic activity, the optically matched quantum dots are introduced into the artificial co&#8208;assembly system of BR and F  o  F  1  &#8208;ATPase. Such a design creates a new path for the light energy usage.</dc:description>

Improving energy transformation by promoting proton gradient, has been a great challenge for a long time. In the present work, we realize a proton directional migration by building oriented bacteriorhodopsin (BR) microcapsules coated by F  o  F  1  -ATPase molecular motors through layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly. The conformation changes of BR under illumination lead to proton transfer in radial direction, which generates a higher proton gradient to drive F  o  F  1  -ATPase for the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Furthermore, to promote the photosynthetic activity, the optically matched quantum dots are introduced into the artificial co-assembly system of BR and F  o  F  1  -ATPase. Such a design creates a new path for the light energy usage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluoro&#8208;nitrogen Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first structural characterizations of these simple fluoro&#8208;nitrogen cations have been accomplished. It is shown that the hybridization of the central nitrogen atom and of the number of fluorine substituents are the determining factors governing the N&#8722;F bond lengths which decrease from 1.40&#8197;&#197; to 1.26&#8197;&#197; with increasing fluorine substitution and increasing s&#8208;character of the nitrogen atom.







Abstract
The crystal structures of [NH3F]+[CF3SO3]&#8722;, [NH2F2]+[SbF6]&#8722;, and [N2F3]+[Sb3F16]&#8722; have been determined, representing the first structural characterizations of these simple fluoro&#8208;nitrogen cations. The influences of the hybridization of the central nitrogen atom and of the number of fluorine substituents on the N&#8722;F bond lengths are evaluated for the series N2F+, N2F3+, NF2O+, NH3F+, NH2F2+, and NF4+. It is shown that the N&#8722;F bond length decreases from 1.40&#8197;&#197; to 1.26&#8197;&#197; with increasing fluorine substitution and increasing s&#8208;character of the nitrogen atom, and that unusual N&#8722;F bond lengths reported in the previous literature are caused by disorder problems

         <title>Cutting COF&#8208;like C4N to Give Colloidal Quantum Dots: Towards Optical Encryption and Bidirectional Sulfur Chemistry via Functional Group and Edge Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of colloidal carbon&#8208;nitride&#8208;like quantum dots, C4NQDs, and their functional composites have been introduced. They show interesting fluorescence/room&#8208;temperature&#8208;phosphorescence dual&#8208;mode emission for advanced optical encryption. They also show edge&#8208;selective adsorption&#8208;catalysis toward sulfur chemistry in Li&#8722;S cells by exploiting the functional group and edge effects of quantum dots.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first synthesis of colloidal C4N quantum dots (QDs) and their functional composites and explore their optical activities and edge&#8208;selective polysulfide adsorption&#8208;catalysis. As&#8208;obtained C4NQDs are rich in carbonyl groups and edges, allowing good solution processability and facile assembly with other moieties for creating functionalities. While C4NQDs show normal fluorescence (FL), the QD/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) composites give FL/room&#8208;temperature&#8208;phosphorescence (RTP) dual&#8208;mode emission, enabling the corresponding solution to be used as an encryption ink. The QDs anchored onto carbon nanotubes can be used as a barrier layer to decorate commercial separators, endowing a Li&#8722;S cell with excellent cycling stability, high rate capability, and large areal capacity. Computation and experiment studies show that edge sites in C4N favor polysulfide adsorption and catalysis and the enriched edges and carbonyl groups in QDs synergically promotecatalytic conversion of sulfur species.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Lignin&#8208;Based Triblock Copolymers as High&#8208;Temperature and UV&#8208;Blocking Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208;initiating frustrated Lewis pairs promoted compounded sequence control to achieve one&#8208;step synthesis of the well&#8208;defined triblock copolymers. The resulting thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) exhibit much superior mechanical properties to those of methyl methacrylate&#8208;based TPEs and maintain TPEs properties at temperatures as high as 180&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
This work utilizes frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of tethered bis&#8208;organophosphorus superbases and a bulky organoaluminum to furnish the highly efficient synthesis of well&#8208;defined triblock copolymers via one&#8208;step block copolymerization of lignin&#8208;based syringyl methacrylate and n&#8208;butyl acrylate, through di&#8208;initiation and compounded sequence control. The resulting thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) exhibit microphase separation and much superior mechanical properties (elongation at break up to 2091&#8201;%, tensile strength up to 11.5&#8197;MPa, and elastic recovery up to 95&#8201;% after 10 cycles) to those of methyl methacrylate&#8208;based TPEs. More impressively, lignin&#8208;based tri&#8208;BCPs can maintain TPEs properties up to 180&#8201;&#176;C, exhibit high transparency and nearly 100&#8201;% UV shield, suggesting potential applications in temperature&#8208;resistant and optical devices.

         <title>Polyacrylonitrile&#8208;Coordinated Perovskite Solar Cell with Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Exceeding 1.23&#8197;V</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyacrylonitrile which has C&#8801;N groups was introduced to passivate the uncoordinated lead cations in perovskite films. The coordination of C&#8801;N with the lead cation was much stronger than that of the normally used C=O group. It could also reduce the I/Pb ratio at the film surface. The device efficiency was improved from 21.58&#8201;% to 23.71&#8201;%, with the open&#8208;circuit voltage enhanced from 1.12&#8197;V to 1.23&#8197;V.







Abstract
In solution&#8208;processed organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskite films, halide&#8208;anion related defects including halide vacancies and interstitial defects can easily form at the surfaces and grain boundaries. The uncoordinated lead cations produce defect levels within the band gap, and the excess iodides disturb the interfacial carrier transport. Thus these defects lead to severe nonradiative recombination, hysteresis, and large energy loss in the device. Herein, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was introduced to passivate the uncoordinated lead cations in the perovskite films. The coordinating ability of cyano group was found to be stronger than that of the normally used carbonyl groups, and the strong coordination could reduce the I/Pb ratio at the film surface. With the PAN perovskite film, the device efficiency improved from 21.58&#8201;% to 23.71&#8201;% and the open&#8208;circuit voltage from 1.12&#8197;V to 1.23&#8197;V, the ion migration activation energy increased, and operational stability improved.

Ab initio prediction of thermodynamic parameters leads to a predictive synthesis strategy utilizing solid carbon for facile preparation of a series of magnesium vanadate compounds. 25Mg solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy of these compounds is shown to be a practical way for characterizing their local Mg structures.







Abstract
Many technologically relevant materials for advanced energy storage and catalysis feature reduced transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxides that are often nontrivial to prepare because of the need to control the reducing nature of the atmosphere in which they are synthesized. Herein, we show that an ab&#8197;initio predictive synthesis strategy can be used to produce multi&#8208;gram&#8208;scale products of various MgVxOy&#8208;type phases (&#948;&#8208;MgV2O5, spinel MgV2O4, and MgVO3) containing V3+ or V4+ relevant for Mg&#8208;ion battery cathodes. Characterization of these phases using 25Mg solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy illustrates the potential of 25Mg NMR for studying reversible magnesiation and local charge distributions. Rotor&#8208;assisted population transfer (RAPT) is used as a much&#8208;needed signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise enhancement technique. The ab&#8197;initio guided synthesis method is seen as a step forward towards a predictive synthesis strategy for targeting specific complex TM oxides with variable oxidation states of technological importance.

         <title>Cyclodextrins with Multiple Pyrenyl Groups: An Approach to Organic Molecules Exhibiting Bright Excimer Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrins with multiple pyrene units exhibited bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Owing to their good molar extinction coefficients (&#1013;&#8776;105 M&#8208;1&#8201;cm&#8208;1), polarized emission with a good dissymmetry factor (|glum|&#8776;10&#8208;2), and quantum yield (&#934;f&#8776;0.5), the CPL brightness (BCPL) reached 340&#8197;M&#8208;1&#8201;cm&#8208;1.







Abstract
We report a simple and effective approach to organic molecules exhibiting bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) by combining a chiral cyclic molecular scaffold and multiple excimer&#8208;enabling moieties. An &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CyD) scaffold was modified with six pyrenyl groups to obtain pyrene&#8211;cyclodextrins (PCDs) in a one&#8208;step synthesis from commercially available compounds. The PCDs exhibited high molar extinction coefficients (&#1013;&#8776;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1), polarized emission with a good dissymmetry factor (|glum|&#8776;10&#8722;2), and quantum yield (&#934;f&#8776;0.5). Owing to the excellent photophysical properties of the PCDs, the circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) reached 340&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Photophysical and chiroptical studies of the PCDs with only five pyrene units and with linkers of various lengths connecting the CyD with the pyrene units revealed that the formation of a pyrene excimer in a spatially crowded environment is crucial for CPL anisotropy. This study paves the way for the development of bright CPL organic molecules.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Reliant Dynamic Properties and Elasto&#8208;Plastic to Plastic Crystal (Rotator) Phase Transition in a Metal Oxyacid Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical mechanical responses, from elastic and elasto&#8208;plastic bending to exceptional malleability, have been realized at different stress and temperature conditions in crystals of a rhenium oxyacid salt. The extent of the molecular rotations/translations in the mechanism is governed by the crystal structure.







Abstract
Although, dynamic crystals are attractive for use in many technologies, molecular level mechanisms of various solid&#8208;state dynamic processes and their interdependence, remain poorly understood. Here, we report a rare example of a dynamic crystal (1), involving a heavy transition metal, rhenium, with an initial two&#8208;face elasticity (within &#8776;1&#8201;% strain), followed by elasto&#8208;plastic deformation, at room temperature. Further, these crystals transform to a rotator (plastic) crystal phase at &#8776;105&#8201;&#176;C, displaying exceptional malleability. Qualitative and quantitative mechanical tests, X&#8208;ray diffraction, &#956;&#8208;Raman and polarized light microscopy experiments reveal that the elasto&#8208;plastic deformation involves both partial molecular rotations and slip, while malleability in the rotator phase is facilitated by reorientational motions and increased symmetry (slip planes). Our work, connecting the plastically bendable (1D or 2D) crystals with the rotator phases (3D), is important for designing multi&#8208;functional dynamic crystals.

         <title>Thermo&#8208; and Mechanochromic Camouflage and Self&#8208;Healing in Biomimetic Soft Actuators Based on Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>

A multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive tetraarylsuccinonitrile (TASN) chromophore is chemically introduced into a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) network through a facile thiol&#8208;ene photoaddition method. The obtained TASN&#8208;LCE soft actuators not only exhibit reversible shape&#8208;morphing and reversible color&#8208;changing behavior in response to heat and mechanical compression, but also have excellent self&#8208;healing, reprogramming and recycling characteristics.







Abstract
In nature, many mysterious creatures capable of deformation camouflage, color camouflage, and self&#8208;healing have inspired scientists to develop various biomimetic soft robots. However, the systematic integration of all the above functionalities into a single soft actuator system still remains a challenge. Here we chemically introduce a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive tetraarylsuccinonitrile (TASN) chromophore into a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) network through a facile thiol&#8208;ene photoaddition method. The obtained TASN&#8208;LCE soft actuators not only exhibit reversible shape&#8208;morphing and reversible color&#8208;changing behavior in response to heat and mechanical compression, but also show excellent self&#8208;healing, reprogramming and recycling characteristics. We hope that such a TASN&#8208;LCE actuator system endowed with dynamic distortion, thermo&#8208; and mechano&#8208;chromic camouflage, and self&#8208;healing functionalities would pave the way for further development of multifunctional biomimetic soft robotic devices.

The coordination of monomeric LiCH2R (R=H, CH3) and LiC6H5 molecules to a Mo2 core is reported. The molecular structures of the new complexes were analyzed both in solution by NMR spectroscopic techniques and in the solid state and gas phase by X&#8208;ray and computational studies.

Due to steric hindrance, only one molecule of LiC6H5 adds to 1&#8901;thf generating the complex [Mo2(H){&#956;&#8208;HLi(thf)C6H5}(&#956;&#8208;AdDipp2)2], (4&#8901;LiC6H5). Computational studies disclose the existence of five&#8208;center six&#8208;electron bonding within the H&#8722;Mo&#8803;Mo&#8722;C&#8722;Li metallacycles, with a mostly covalent H&#8722;Mo&#8803;Mo&#8722;C group and predominantly ionic Li&#8722;C and Li&#8722;H interactions. However, the latter bonds exhibit non&#8208;negligible covalency, as indicated by X&#8208;ray, computational data and the large one&#8208;bond 6,7Li,1H and 6,7Li,13C NMR coupling constants found for the three&#8208;atom H&#8722;Li&#8722;C chains. By contrast, the phenyl group in 4&#8901;LiC6H5 coordinates in an &#951;2 fashion to the lithium atom through the ipso and one of the ortho carbon atoms.

&lt;p&gt;The coordination of monomeric LiCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R (R=H, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and LiC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; molecules to a Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core is reported. The molecular structures of the new complexes were analyzed both in solution by NMR spectroscopic techniques and in the solid state and gas phase by X-ray and computational studies.

High&#8208;performance asymmetric supercapacitors based on hierarchical&#8208;ordered ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx core&#8211;sheath fibers have been developed by microfluidic assembly and microchannel reaction methods. Due to an in situ Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Zn/Ti&#8722;F&#8722;Zn bonding bridge, well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;/mesoporosity and fast interfacial charge transfer, supercapacitors deliver high energy density, large capacitance, long&#8208;term stability and natural sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;powered applications.







Abstract
We report hierarchical&#8208;ordered ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx MXene core&#8211;sheath fibers, in which a ZIF&#8722;L(Zn) nanowall array sheath is grown vertically on an anisotropic Ti3C2Tx core by Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Zn/Ti&#8722;F&#8722;Zn chemical bonds. Through highly efficient microfluidic assembly and microchannel reactions, ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx exhibits well&#8208;developed micro&#8208;/mesoporosity, ordered ionic pathways, fast interfacial electron conduction and large&#8208;scale fabrication, significantly boosting charges dynamic transport and intercalation. The resultant ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber presents large capacitance (1700&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and outstanding rate performance in a 1&#8197;M H2SO4 electrolyte. Additionally, ZIF&#8722;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber&#8208;based solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitors deliver high energy density (19.0&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3), excellent capacitance (854&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3), large deformable/wearable capabilities and long&#8208;time cyclic stability (20&#8201;000 cycles), which realize natural sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;powered applications to drive water level/earthquake alarm devices.

         <title>Chemically Engineered Porous Molecular Coatings as Reactive Oxygen Species Generators and Reservoirs for Long&#8208;Lasting Self&#8208;Cleaning Textiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of solution&#8208;processable, crystalline porous materials were prepared and used as textiles coatings to spontaneously convert absorbed oxygen from air into reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon absorption of daylight, and long&#8208;termly store ROS in dark conditions. This work paves the way for further developing self&#8208;cleaning textile coatings for the rapid deactivation of highly infectious pathogenic bacteria under both daylight and light&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Wearable personal protective equipment that is decorated with photoactive self&#8208;cleaning materials capable of actively neutralizing biological pathogens is in high demand. Here, we developed a series of solution&#8208;processable, crystalline porous materials capable of addressing this challenge. Textiles coated with these materials exhibit a broad range of functionalities, including spontaneous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation upon absorption of daylight, and long&#8208;term ROS storage in dark conditions. The ROS generation and storage abilities of these materials can be further improved through chemical engineering of the precursors without altering the three&#8208;dimensional assembled superstructures. In comparison with traditional TiO2 or C3N4 self&#8208;cleaning materials, the fluorinated molecular coating material HOF&#8208;101&#8208;F shows a 10&#8208; to 60&#8208;fold enhancement of ROS generation and 10&#8208; to 20&#8208;fold greater ROS storage ability. Our results pave the way for further developing self&#8208;cleaning textile coatings for the rapid deactivation of highly infectious pathogenic bacteria under both daylight and light&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>K&#8208;Chabazite Zeolite Nanocrystal Aggregates for Highly Efficient Methane Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seed iteration method to synthesize macro&#8211;meso&#8211;micro hierarchical K&#8208;Chabazite nanocrystal (&#8776;50&#8197;nm) aggregates with enhanced mass transfer rate and adsorption capacity of CH4 to effectively separate CH4/N2 is reported, which has significant potential for low&#8208;concentrated coalbed methane enrichment.







Abstract
Methane (CH4) enrichment and purification is of great significance for increasing the heating value of unconventional natural gas sources and curtailing its effect on global warming. For a long time, commercial adsorbents for CH4 separation have been hampered by low adsorption capacities, sub&#8208;optimal adsorption selectivities, or slow diffusion rates, which have significantly restricted separation productivity. Herein, we report a facile and green seed&#8208;passaging method to fabricate donut&#8208;like macro&#8211;meso&#8211;micro hierarchical zeolite K&#8208;Chabazite nanocrystal aggregates. This consecutive seed&#8208;inducing method requires no organic template. By utilizing this unique nanocrystallization technique, the CH4 adsorption capacity, gas diffusion rate, and separation productivity of the resultant material are dramatically increased compared with those of commercially available adsorbents, thus setting a new benchmark in CH4/N2 separation. More importantly, production of this adsorbent can be easily scaled&#8208;up to the order of 100&#8197;kg using readily available raw materials in this environmentally friendly synthetic route, enabling potential industrial implementation.

By utilizing this unique nanocrystallization technique, the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity, gas diffusion rate, and separation productivity of the resultant material are dramatically increased compared with those of commercially available adsorbents, thus setting a new benchmark in CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation. More importantly, production of this adsorbent can be easily scaled-up to the order of 100&#8197;kg using readily available raw materials in this environmentally friendly synthetic route, enabling potential industrial implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functional Characterization and Protein Engineering of a Triterpene 3&#8208;/6&#8208;/2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Glycosyltransferase Reveal a Conserved Residue Critical for the Regiospecificity</title>

We characterized the first plant cycloartane glycosyltransferase AmGT8 from A. membranaceus. Its mutants A394F, A394D, and T131V were discovered using semi&#8208;rational design, which showed specific 6&#8208;O, 3&#8208;O, and 2&#8242;&#8208;O glycosylation activities, respectively. This study uncovered a conserved residue critical for the regiospecificity of plant glycosyltransferases.







Abstract
Engineering the function of triterpene glucosyltransferases (GTs) is challenging due to the large size of the sugar acceptors. In this work, we identified a multifunctional glycosyltransferase AmGT8 catalyzing triterpene 3&#8208;/6&#8208;/2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation from the medicinal plant Astragalus membranaceus. To engineer its regiospecificity, a small mutant library was built based on semi&#8208;rational design. Variants A394F, A394D, and T131V were found to catalyze specific 6&#8208;O, 3&#8208;O, and 2&#8242;&#8208;O glycosylation, respectively. The origin of regioselectivity of AmGT8 and its A394F variant was studied by molecular dynamics and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Residue 394 is highly conserved as A/G and is critical for the regiospecificity of the C&#8208; and O&#8208;GTs TcCGT1 and GuGT10/14. Finally, astragalosides III and IV were synthesized by mutants A394F, T131V and P192E. This work reports biocatalysts for saponin synthesis and gives new insights into protein engineering of regioselectivity in plant GTs.

         <title>Modification of Multi&#8208;Component Building Blocks for Assembling Giant Chiral Lanthanide&#8208;Titanium Molecular Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modification procedure on a 15&#8208;component building block of achiral Ln24Ti8 wheel&#8208;like assemblies has been developed to obtain new accessible building blocks, resulting in a pair of new chiral enantiomers in elusive Ln&#8211;Ti systems.







Abstract
Building blocks with multiple components are promising for the synthesis of complex molecular assemblies, but are rarely available. Herein, we report a modification procedure for a multi&#8208;component building block [Ln3Ti(HSA)6(SA)4(H2O)]&#8722; ({Ln3Ti&#8208;SA}, H2SA=salicylic acid, Ln=Eu/Gd) to form new building blocks {Ln3Tix&#8208;MSA} (H2MSA=5&#8208;methoxysalicylic acid, x=1, 2, 3) by constructing [Ti(MSA)3]2&#8722; units. The obtained {Ln3Tix&#8208;MSA} can further assemble into a chiral Ln22Ti14 ring with the formulae [Eu22Ti14(MSA)48(HMSA)22(CH3COO)4(H2O)10(iPrOH)] and [Gd22Ti14(MSA)46(HMSA)26(CH3COO)4(H2O)8]. Parallel experiments without Ti4+ result in linear Ln chains. Detailed analysis shows that the [Ti(MSA)4]4&#8722; unit makes the originally variable Ln chains become available building blocks and the modified [Ti(MSA)3]2&#8722; further triggers interesting chiral&#8208;sorting behavior. Finally, the electronic adsorption and magneto&#8208;optic responses of these molecular rings are investigated.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Biocatalytic In Vivo Methylation&#8208;Hydroamination of Bioderived Lignin Monomers to Generate a Key Precursor to L&#8208;DOPA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>

Protein and strain engineering combined. The combination of two engineered enzymes (a methyltransferase and an ammonia lyase) and an engineered E.&#8197;coli strain (for regeneration of the SAM cofactor) has been developed to enable a fully biocatalytic one&#8208;pot methylation&#8211;hydroamination cascade. As an example, the synthesis of l &#8208;veratrylglycine from renewable lignin&#8208;derived ferulic acid has been demonstrated, in high yield and excellent ee.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;rich phenolic substrates can be derived from the depolymerisation of lignin feedstocks. Direct biotransformations of the hydroxycinnamic acid monomers obtained can be exploited to produce high&#8208;value chemicals, such as &#945;&#8208;amino acids, however the reaction is often hampered by the chemical autooxidation in alkaline or harsh reaction media. Regioselective O&#8208;methyltransferases (OMTs) are ubiquitous enzymes in natural secondary metabolic pathways utilising an expensive co&#8208;substrate S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) as the methylating reagent altering the physicochemical properties of the hydroxycinnamic acids. In this study, we engineered an OMT to accept a variety of electron&#8208;rich phenolic substrates, modified a commercial E.&#8197;coli strain BL21 (DE3) to regenerate SAM in&#8197;vivo, and combined it with an engineered ammonia lyase to partake in a one&#8208;pot, two whole cell enzyme cascade to produce the l&#8208;DOPA precursor l&#8208;veratrylglycine from lignin&#8208;derived ferulic acid.

         <title>Smart Nano&#8208;PROTACs Reprogram Tumor Microenvironment for Activatable Photo&#8208;metabolic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The smart nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) are developed for photo&#8208;metabolic cancer immunotherapy. SPNCOX&#8208;mediated therapy can not only improve tumor immunogenicity but also induce targeted intratumoral degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system, leading to the depletion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and reprogramming of the immunosuppressive TME to inhibit tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence.







Abstract
Protease inhibitors can modulate intratumoral metabolic processes to reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which however suffer from the limited efficacy and off&#8208;targeted side effects. We report smart nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) with phototherapeutic ablation and cancer&#8208;specific protein degradation to reprogram the TME for photo&#8208;metabolic cancer immunotherapy. This nano&#8208;PROTAC has a semiconducting polymer backbone linked with a cyclooxygenase 1/2 (COX&#8208;1/2)&#8208;targeting PROTAC peptide (CPP) via a cathepsin B (CatB)&#8208;cleavable segment. CPP can be activated by the tumor&#8208;overexpressed CatB to induce the degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. The persistent degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 depletes their metabolite prostaglandin E2 which is responsible for activation of immune suppressor cells. Such a smart PROTAC strategy synergized with phototherapy specifically reprograms the immunosuppressive TME and reinvigorates antitumor immunity.

SPN&lt;sub&gt;COX&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated therapy can not only improve tumor immunogenicity but also induce targeted intratumoral degradation of COX-1/2 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, leading to the depletion of prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and reprogramming of the immunosuppressive TME to inhibit tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protease inhibitors can modulate intratumoral metabolic processes to reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which however suffer from the limited efficacy and off-targeted side effects. We report smart nano-proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano-PROTACs) with phototherapeutic ablation and cancer-specific protein degradation to reprogram the TME for photo-metabolic cancer immunotherapy. This nano-PROTAC has a semiconducting polymer backbone linked with a cyclooxygenase 1/2 (COX-1/2)-targeting PROTAC peptide (CPP) via a cathepsin B (CatB)-cleavable segment. CPP can be activated by the tumor-overexpressed CatB to induce the degradation of COX-1/2 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The persistent degradation of COX-1/2 depletes their metabolite prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is responsible for activation of immune suppressor cells. Such a smart PROTAC strategy synergized with phototherapy specifically reprograms the immunosuppressive TME and reinvigorates antitumor immunity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Degradable Vinyl Random Copolymers via Photocontrolled Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Cascade Copolymerization**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers via photocontrolled radical ring&#8208;opening cascade copolymerization (rROCCP) is developed. A variety of acrylates or acrylamides can be copolymerized with the macrocyclic allylic sulfone with near&#8208;unity comonomer reactivity ratios at all feed compositions. The unusual reversible inhibition of chain propagation by sulfur dioxide in rROCCP was resolved by reducing the solubility of sulfur dioxide.







Abstract
Degradable vinyl polymers by radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization are promising solutions to the challenges caused by non&#8208;degradable vinyl plastics. However, achieving even distributions of labile functional groups in the backbone of degradable vinyl polymers remains challenging. Herein, we report a photocatalytic approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers via radical ring&#8208;opening cascade copolymerization (rROCCP). The rROCCP of macrocyclic allylic sulfones and acrylates or acrylamides mediated by visible light at ambient temperature achieved near&#8208;unity comonomer reactivity ratios over the entire range of the feed compositions. Experimental and computational evidence revealed an unusual reversible inhibition of chain propagation by in situ generated sulfur dioxide (SO2), which was successfully overcome by reducing the solubility of SO2. This study provides a powerful approach to degradable vinyl random copolymers with comparable material properties to non&#8208;degradable vinyl polymers.

         <title>A Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;Anchored Rhenium(I) Photosensitizer Evokes Pyroptosis for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;anchored photosensitizer CA&#8208;Re was developed. It is capable of inducing and self&#8208;reporting membrane rupture upon irradiation, as well as evoking pyroptosis to activate anti&#8208;tumor immunity.







Abstract
An ideal cancer treatment should not only destroy primary tumors but also improve the immunogenicity of the tumor microenvironment to achieve a satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor immune effect. We designed a carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;anchored rhenium(I) photosensitizer, named CA&#8208;Re, that not only performs type&#8208;I and type&#8208;II photodynamic therapy (PDT) with high efficiency under hypoxia (nanomolar&#8208;level phototoxicity), but also evokes gasdermin D (GSDMD) mediated pyroptotic cell death to effectively stimulate tumor immunogenicity. CA&#8208;Re could disrupt and self&#8208;report the loss of membrane integrity simultaneously. This promoted the maturation and antigen&#8208;presenting ability of dendritic cells (DCs), and fully activated T cells dependent adaptive immune response in vivo, eventually eliminating distant tumors at the same time as destroying primary tumors. To the best of our knowledge, CA&#8208;Re is the first metal complex&#8208;based pyroptosis inducer.

         <title>Aquimarins, Peptide Antibiotics with Amino&#8208;Modified C&#8208;Termini from a Sponge&#8208;Derived Aquimarina sp. Bacterium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potion from the ocean: New peptide antibiotics from a sponge&#8208;derived bacterium are reported, featuring chlorination and an unusual amino&#8208;capped C&#8208;terminus. Studies on isolation, structure elucidation, biosynthesis, total synthesis, and structure&#8211;activity relationships are presented.







Abstract
Genome mining and bioactivity studies suggested the sponge&#8208;derived bacterium Aquimarina sp. Aq135 as a producer of new antibiotics. Activity&#8208;guided isolation identified antibacterial peptides, named aquimarins, featuring a new scaffold with an unusual C&#8208;terminal amino group and chlorine moieties. Responsible for the halogenation is the FeII/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent chlorinase AqmA that halogenates up to two isoleucine residues in a carrier protein&#8208;dependent fashion. Total syntheses of two natural aquimarins and eight non&#8208;natural variants were developed. Structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) studies with these compounds showed that the synthetically more laborious chlorinations are not required for antibacterial activity but enhance cytotoxicity. In contrast, variants lacking the C&#8208;terminal amine were virtually inactive, suggesting diamines similar to the terminal aquimarin residue as candidate building blocks for new peptidomimetic antibiotics.

         <title>Regeneration of Phytochemicals by Structure&#8208;Driven Organization of Microbial Biosynthetic Steps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enable access to hypericin, a phytochemical with promising medicinal properties but low natural abundance, a strategy involving structure&#8208;based modification and organization of the microbial biosynthetic steps was developed without knowing its biosynthetic pathway in native plants. The designed consecutive reactions (see scheme) occurred in repurposed cells, thus circumventing the complex plant secondary metabolism.







Abstract
Medicinal phytochemicals, such as artemisinin and taxol, have impacted the world, and hypericin might do so if its availability issue could be addressed. Hypericin is the hallmark component of Saint John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.), an approved depression alleviator documented in the US, European, and British pharmacopoeias with its additional effectiveness against diverse cancers and viruses. However, the academia&#8208;to&#8208;industry transition of hypericin remain hampered by its low in planta abundance, unfeasible bulk chemical synthesis, and unclear biosynthetic mechanism. Here, we present a strategy consisting of the hypericin&#8208;structure&#8208;centered modification and reorganization of microbial biosynthetic steps in the repurposed cells that have been tamed to enable the designed consecutive reactions to afford hypericin (43.1&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1), without acquiring its biosynthetic knowledge in native plants. The study provides a synthetic biology route to hypericin and establishes a platform for biosustainable access to medicinal phytochemicals.

         <title>The First Sulfate&#8208;Pillared Hybrid Ultramicroporous Material, SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, and Its Acetylene Capture Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prototypal member of a new family of hybrid ultramicroporous material, SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, uses earth&#8208;friendly sulfate anions to selectively capture C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 mixtures, enabling recovery of both gases at high purities even from trace mixtures.







Abstract
Hybrid ultramicroporous materials, HUMs, are comprised of metal cations linked by combinations of inorganic and organic ligands. Their modular nature makes them amenable to crystal engineering studies, which have thus far afforded four HUM platforms (as classified by the inorganic linkers).

&lt;p&gt;The prototypal member of a new family of hybrid ultramicroporous material, &lt;b&gt;SOFOUR-1-Zn&lt;/b&gt;, uses earth-friendly sulfate anions to selectively capture C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures, enabling recovery of both gases at high purities even from trace mixtures.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid ultramicroporous materials, HUMs, are comprised of metal cations linked by combinations of inorganic and organic ligands. Their modular nature makes them amenable to crystal engineering studies, which have thus far afforded four HUM platforms (as classified by the inorganic linkers). HUMs are of practical interest because of their benchmark gas separation performance for several industrial gas mixtures. We report herein design and gram-scale synthesis of the prototypal sulfate-linked HUM, the &lt;b&gt;fsc&lt;/b&gt; topology coordination network (&lt;b&gt;[Zn(tepb)(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;/b&gt;

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Structured Upconversion/Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanoparticles for Anticounterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An up&#8208;conversion nanoparticles and MnII&#8208;based perovskite core&#8211;shell heterostructures nanocomposite was successfully synthesized for the first time, which showed dual&#8208;color emissions under the excitation of UV light and IR laser. This work suggests its potential in high&#8208;quality optical anticounterfeiting.







Abstract
In view of their excellent luminescence properties, nanocrystalline metal halide perovskites have diverse optoelectronic applications, including those related to anticounterfeiting. However, high&#8208;quality optical anticounterfeiting typically requires multiple encryptions relying on several optical modes to ensure information security. Herein, an efficient anticounterfeiting strategy based on dual optical encryption is realized by combining up&#8208; and downconversion luminescence in a nanocomposite with NaYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Er3+,Yb3+ as core and a CsMnCl3 as shell. The emission color of this nanocomposite depends on the penetration depth of incident radiation and can be changed by varying the excitation source (980&#8197;nm laser or UV light) to produce different luminescent patterns. This feature allows one to effectively improve the anticounterfeiting index and fabricate professional anticounterfeiting materials.

         <title>Ordered PtFeIr Intermetallic Nanowires Prepared through a Silica&#8208;Protection Strategy for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered PtFeIr intermetallic nanowires supported on commercial carbon were synthesized. Coating with SiO2 and the addition of Ir enabled the integrity of the nanowire structure to be maintained during their transformation from a disordered fcc&#8208;phase to an ordered fct&#8208;phase. The fct&#8208;phase nanowires exhibited much better ORR activity and structural and electrochemical stability than the fcc&#8208;phase ones.







Abstract
Developing efficient and stable Pt&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is a way to promote the large&#8208;scale application of fuel cells. Pt&#8208;based alloy nanowires are promising ORR catalysts, but their application is hampered by activity loss caused by structural destruction during long&#8208;term cycling. Herein, the preparation of ordered PtFeIr intermetallic nanowire catalysts with an average diameter of 2.6&#8197;nm and face&#8208;centered tetragonal structure (fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C) is reported. A silica&#8208;protected strategy prevents the deformation of PtFeIr nanowires during the phase transition at high temperature. The as&#8208;prepared fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C exhibited superior mass activity for ORR (2.03&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) than disordered PtFeIr nanowires with face&#8208;centered cubic structure (1.11&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) and commercial Pt/C (0.21&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1). Importantly, the structure and electrochemical performance of fct&#8208;PtFeIr/C were maintained after stability tests, showing the advantages of the ordered structure.

         <title>Enhanced Selectivity and Stability of Finned Ferrierite Catalysts in Butene Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of finned ferrierite produces a zeolite with reduced mass transport limitations, thereby enhancing its catalyst lifetime and increasing its selectivity to isobutene in tests of 1&#8208;butene isomerization. These findings highlight the advantages of introducing fins through facile and tunable post&#8208;synthesis modification to impart material properties that are otherwise unattainable by conventional synthesis methods.







Abstract
Designing zeolite catalysts with improved mass transport properties is crucial for restrictive networks of either one&#8208; or two&#8208;dimensional pore topologies. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of finned ferrierite (FER), a commercial zeolite with two&#8208;dimensional pores, where protrusions on crystal surfaces behave as pseudo nanoparticles. Catalytic tests of 1&#8208;butene isomerization reveal a 3&#8208;fold enhancement of catalyst lifetime and an increase of 12&#8201;% selectivity to isobutene for finned samples compared to corresponding seeds. Electron tomography was used to confirm the identical crystallographic registry of fins and seeds. Time&#8208;resolved titration of Br&#248;nsted acid sites confirmed the improved mass transport properties of finned ferrierite compared to conventional analogues. These findings highlight the advantages of introducing fins through facile and tunable post&#8208;synthesis modification to impart material properties that are otherwise unattainable by conventional synthesis methods.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemistry of Single Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC) was systematically investigated on a single nanoparticle level using nanoparticle impact electrochemistry, which enables in&#8208;depth understanding of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the system, allowing quantitative analysis of the increased reaction possibility and the decreased activation energy. This work reveals the intrinsic physicochemical information at the nano&#8208;confined domains.







Abstract
The structure&#8211;function relationship of plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC) is of great importance for the design of efficient PEEC catalysts, but is rarely investigated at single nanoparticle level for the lack of an efficient nanoscale methodology. Herein, we report the utilization of nanoparticle impact electrochemistry to allow single nanoparticle PEEC, where the effect of incident light on the plasmonic Ag/Au nanoparticles for accelerating cobalt metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (Co&#8208;MOFNs) catalyzed hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is systematically explored. It is found that the plasmon&#8208;excited hot carrier injection can lower the reaction activation energy, resulting in a much promoted reaction probability and the integral charge generated from individual collisions. Besides, a plasmonic nanoparticle filtering method is established to effectively distinguish different plasmonic nanoparticles. This work provides a unique view in understanding the intrinsic physicochemical properties for PEEC at the nano&#8208;confined domains.

         <title>A Nanohook&#8208;Equipped Bionanocatalyst for Localized Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Bacterial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanohook&#8208;equipped bionanocatalyst can firstly hook to bacteria and biofilm, then catalyze H2O2 to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals for localized disinfection. Upon the near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation, the bionanocatalyst can generate heat, which simultaneously accelerates the catalytic therapy and enables the heat ablation against bacteria.







Abstract
Novel bionanocatalysts have opened a new era in fighting multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria. They can kill bacteria by elevating the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of chemicals like H2O2. However, ROSs&#8217; ultrashort diffusion distance limit their bactericidal activity. We present a nanohook&#8208;equipped bionanocatalyst (Ni@Co&#8208;NC) with bacterial binding ability that shows robust ROS&#8208;generating capacity under physiological H2O2 levels. The Ni@Co&#8208;NC's pH&#8208;dependent performance confines its effects to the biofilm microenvironment, leaving healthy tissue unaffected. Furthermore, it can generate heat upon NIR laser irradiation, enhancing its catalytic performance while achieving heat ablation against bacteria. With the Ni@Co&#8208;NC's synergistic effects, bacterial populations fall by &gt;99.99&#8201;%. More surprisingly, the mature biofilm shows no recurrence after treatment with the Ni@Co&#8208;NC, demonstrating its tremendous potential for treating MDR bacterial related infections.

         <title>Hindered Tetraphenylethylene Helicates: Chiral Fluorophores with Deep&#8208;Blue Emission, Multiple&#8208;Color CPL, and Chiral Recognition Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates, with a completely immobilized propeller&#8208;like conformation through substitution at the 2,6&#8208;positions of the phenyl rings, were prepared by a short synthetic route. These helicates, with their many modification positions, show deep&#8208;blue to violet emission, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) that can be tuned over a wide range, and highly enantioselective chiral recognition.







Abstract
New hindered tetraphenylethylene (TPE) helicates with substitution at 2,6&#8208;position of phenyl rings were designed and synthesized. Due to the increased hindrance, the TPE helicates emit strong deep&#8208;blue to violet fluorescence both in the solid state and in solution, and could be resolved into enantiomers that emit strong and multicolor circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and exhibit a high enantioselective recognition of chiral tartaric acid and its derivatives. Surprisingly, the derived helicate tetramines possess amino groups with an unpredented planar structure and sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen, arousing the change between AIE effect and ACQ phenomenon through photoinduced electron transfer (PET). With advantages of short synthetic route, many modification positions, deep&#8208;blue to violet emission, wide CPL tuning, and high chiral recognition ability, the hindered TPE helicates show broad prospects as chiral materials.

         <title>Stabilization of Polyoxometalate Charge Carriers via Redox&#8208;Driven Nanoconfinement in Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wide applicability of the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation of polyoxometalates (POMs) within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes is shown, demonstrating that the level of carbon oxidation and the efficacy of the filling are determined by the frontier orbital energies of the POM. Nanoencapsulation is found to confer significant stability to polyoxomolybdates despite their inherent lability.







Abstract
We describe the preparation of hybrid redox materials based on polyoxomolybdates encapsulated within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Polyoxomolybdates readily oxidize SWNTs under ambient conditions in solution, and here we study their charge&#8208;transfer interactions with SWNTs to provide detailed mechanistic insights into the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation of these and similar nanoclusters. We are able to correlate the relative redox potentials of the encapsulated clusters with the level of SWNT oxidation in the resultant hybrid materials and use this to show that precise redox tuning is a necessary requirement for successful encapsulation. The host&#8211;guest redox materials described here exhibit exceptional electrochemical stability, retaining up to 86&#8201;% of their charge capacity over 1000 oxidation/reduction cycles, despite the typical lability and solution&#8208;phase electrochemical instability of the polyoxomolybdates we have explored. Our findings illustrate the broad applicability of the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation approach to the design and fabrication of tunable, highly conductive, ultra&#8208;stable nanoconfined energy materials.

         <title>Implementation of Quantum Level Addressability and Geometric Phase Manipulation in Aligned Endohedral Fullerene Qudits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Toward molecular quantum computing, the system needs to have good coherence, scalability, and addressability. Using endohedral nitrogen fullerenes with long coherence time, this work tackled the remaining two challenges by molecular modification and ensemble alignment. The refined molecular system scales up to four addressable quantum levels and enables the first implementation of geometric phase manipulation using pure electron paramagnetic resonance.







Abstract
Endohedral nitrogen fullerenes have been proposed as building blocks for quantum information processing due to their long spin coherence time. However, addressability of the individual electron spin levels in such a multiplet system of 4S3/2 has never been achieved because of the molecular isotropy and transition degeneracy among the Zeeman levels. Herein, by molecular engineering, we lifted the degeneracy by zero&#8208;field splitting effects and made the multiple transitions addressable by a liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;assisted method. The endohedral nitrogen fullerene derivatives with rigid addends of spiro structure and large aspect ratios of regioselective bis&#8208;addition improve the ordering of the spin ensemble. These samples empower endohedral&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based qudits, in which the transitions between the 4 electron spin levels were respectively addressed and coherently manipulated. The quantum geometric phase manipulation, which has long been proposed for the advantages in error tolerance and gating speed, was implemented in a pure electron spin system using molecules for the first time.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Manipulation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Enhanced Metal&#8211;Oxygen Covalency for Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiIII&#8208;NCF with enhanced nickel&#8211;oxygen covalency is obtained by manipulating the spin state of Ni2+ in NiII&#8208;NCF, which facilitates formation of nanosheet&#8208;like Li2O2 among NiIII&#8208;NCF nanowire arrays upon discharging. This enables small charge/discharge overvoltages, superior rate capability, and long cycling stability.







Abstract
Aprotic Li&#8722;O2 batteries have attracted extensive attention in the past decade owing to their high theoretical energy density; however, they are obstructed by the sluggish reaction kinetics at the cathode and large voltage hysteresis. We regulate the spin state of partial Ni2+ metal centers (t2g6eg2) of conductive nickel catecholate framework (NiII&#8208;NCF) nanowire arrays to high&#8208;valence Ni3+ (t2g6eg1) for NiIII&#8208;NCF. The spin&#8208;state modulation enables enhanced nickel&#8211;oxygen covalency in NiIII&#8208;NCF, which facilitates electron exchange between the Ni sites and oxygen adsorbates and accelerates the oxygen redox kinetics. Upon discharging, the high affinity of Ni3+ sites with the intermediate LiO2 promotes formation of nanosheet&#8208;like Li2O2 in the void space among NiIII&#8208;NCF nanowires. The Li&#8722;O2 battery based on NiIII&#8208;NCF offers remarkably reduced discharge/charge voltage gaps, superior rate capability, and a long cycling stability of over 200 cycles. This work highlights the importance of electron spin state on the redox kinetics and will provide insight into electronic structure regulation of electrocatalysts for Li&#8722;O2 batteries and beyond.

&lt;p&gt;Ni&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-NCF with enhanced nickel&#8211;oxygen covalency is obtained by manipulating the spin state of Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-NCF, which facilitates formation of nanosheet-like Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; among Ni&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-NCF nanowire arrays upon discharging. This enables small charge/discharge overvoltages, superior rate capability, and long cycling stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aprotic Li&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries have attracted extensive attention in the past decade owing to their high theoretical energy density; however, they are obstructed by the sluggish reaction kinetics at the cathode and large voltage hysteresis. We regulate the spin state of partial Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; metal centers (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of conductive nickel catecholate framework (Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-NCF) nanowire arrays to high-valence Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) for Ni&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-NCF. The spin-state modulation enables enhanced nickel&#8211;oxygen covalency in Ni&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-NCF, which facilitates electron exchange between the Ni sites and oxygen adsorbates and accelerates the oxygen redox kinetics. Upon discharging, the high affinity of Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; sites with the intermediate LiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; promotes formation of nanosheet-like Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the void space among Ni&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-NCF nanowires. The Li&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery based on Ni&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-NCF offers remarkably reduced discharge/charge voltage gaps, superior rate capability, and a long cycling stability of over 200 cycles. This work highlights the importance of electron spin state on the redox kinetics and will provide insight into electronic structure regulation of electrocatalysts for Li&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Configurationally Chiral SuFEx&#8208;Based Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically chiral SuFEx (sulfur&#8211;fluorine exchange) click reaction was used to produce a series of configurationally chiral high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers. This step&#8208;growth polymerization occurs with high efficiency and enantiospecifically (ee&gt;98&#8201;%).







Abstract
Novel methods to make synthetic chiral polymers are highly desirable given their potential in a rapidly increasing number of bio&#8208;inspired applications. The enantiospecific sulfur&#8211;fluorine exchange (SuFEx) reaction of chiral di&#8208;sulfonimidoyl fluorides (di&#8208;SFs) with diphenols, was used to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight chiral polymers with configurational backbone chirality. The resulting new class of polymers, polysulfonimidates, can be efficiently produced via this step&#8208;growth mechanism for a wide range of di&#8208;SFs and diphenols, yielding MnPS up to 283&#8197;kDa with a typical dispersity &#272; around 1.6. The optical activity of the resulting chiral polymers is largely due to the intrinsic asymmetry of the S atoms (configurational chirality). Finally, the enantiospecificity (ee&gt;98&#8201;%) of the polymerization reaction was demonstrated by the degradation of a disulfide&#8208;containing polysulfonimidate. This novel route towards configurational main&#8208;chain chirality opens up new approaches towards tailor&#8208;made chiral polymers with precisely defined properties.

         <title>TMSCF2Br&#8208;Enabled Fluorination&#8211;Aminocarbonylation of Aldehydes: Modular Access to &#945;&#8208;Fluoroamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthesis of &#945;&#8208;fluoroamides from easily available aldehydes and tertiary amines has been developed, in which the multiple roles of the unique difluorocarbene reagent TMSCF2Br (TMS=trimethylsilyl) is the key to the success of this multicomponent process.







Abstract
A protocol for the modular assembly of the &#945;&#8208;fluoroamide motif has been developed, which provides a practical method for the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;fluoroamides from easily available aldehydes and tertiary amines through a three&#8208;component fluorination&#8211;aminocarbonylation process. The key to the success of this process is taking advantage of the multiple roles of the unique difluorocarbene reagent TMSCF2Br (TMS=trimethylsilyl). The mechanism of the process involves the 1,2&#8208;fluorine and oxygen migrations of the in situ formed TMS&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;aminodifluoromethyl carbinol intermediates, which represents a new type of deoxyfluorination reaction.

         <title>Coordinated Anionic Inorganic Module&#8212;An Efficient Approach Towards Highly Efficient Blue&#8208;Emitting Copper Halide Ionic Hybrid Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and facile strategy for the design and synthesis of highly luminescent copper halide hybrid structures by fabricating a coordinated anionic inorganic module in these ionic species is reported. By using this approach, a family of strongly blue&#8208;emitting copper halide hybrid ionic structures has been prepared with high internal quantum yields (IQYs) up to 98&#8201;%.







Abstract
Copper halide based organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid semiconductors exhibit great potential as light&#8208;emitting materials with excellent structural variety and optical tunability. Among them, copper halide hybrid molecular compounds with discrete inorganic modules are particularly interesting due to their high quantum efficiency. However, synthesizing highly efficient blue&#8208;emitting molecular clusters remains challenging. Here, we report a novel and facile strategy for the design and synthesis of highly luminescent copper halide hybrid structures by fabricating coordinated anionic inorganic modules in these ionic species. By using this approach, a family of strongly blue&#8208;emitting copper halide hybrid ionic structures has been prepared with high internal quantum yields up to 98&#8201;%. Strong luminescence from the combination of ionic and covalent bonds in these compounds make them ideal candidates as alternative, rare&#8208;earth&#8208;element free light&#8208;emitting materials for possible use in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Symmetric All&#8208;Organic Proton Battery in Mild Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric all&#8208;organic proton battery is developed in mild ZnSO4 electrolyte, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and broadens proton&#8208;based battery chemistry.







Abstract
All&#8208;organic proton batteries are attracting extensive attention due to their sustainability merits and excellent rate capability. Generally, strong acids (e.g. H2SO4) have to be employed as the electrolytes to provide H+ for all&#8208;organic proton batteries due to the high H+ intercalation energy barrier. Until now, the design of all&#8208;organic proton batteries in mild electrolytes is still a challenge. Herein, a poly(2,9&#8208;dihydroquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;b]phenazine) (PO) molecule was designed and synthesized, where the adjacent C=N groups show two different chemical environments, resulting in two&#8208;step redox reactions. Moreover, the two reactions possess considerable voltage difference because of the large LUMO energy gap between PO and its reduction product. More impressively, the C=N groups endow the &#960;&#8208;conjugated PO molecule with H+ uptake/removal in the ZnSO4 electrolyte. As a result, a symmetric all&#8208;organic proton battery is achieved in a mild electrolyte for the first time, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and also broadens the chemistry of proton&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Mesoporosity&#8208;Enabled Selectivity of Mesoporous Palladium&#8208;Based Nanocrystals Catalysts in Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporosity engineering is demonstrated as an efficient route for boosting catalytic selectivity of Pd&#8208;based nanobundle catalysts in the semihydrogenation of alkynes. Mechanistic studies reveal that the continuous crystalline framework and penetrated mesoporous channel of mesoporous Pd&#8208;based catalysts synergistically weaken the adsorption and binding strength of alkenes and energetically disable further over&#8208;hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes.







Abstract
We reported mesoporosity engineering as a general strategy to promote semihydrogenation selectivity of palladium (Pd)&#8208;based nanobundles catalysts. The best mesoporous PdP displayed full conversion, remarkable activity, excellent selectivity, and high stability in semihydrogenation of 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;propyne, all of which are remarkably better than commercial Lindlar catalysts. Mechanistic investigations ascribed high semihydrogenation selectivity to the continuous crystalline framework and penetrated mesoporous channel of catalysts that weakened the adsorption and interaction capacity of alkenes and thus inhibited over&#8208;hydrogenation of alkenes to industrially unfavorable alkanes. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrated that convex crystalline mesoporosity of nanobundles catalysts electronically optimized the coordination environment of Pd active sites and energetically changed hydrogenation trends, resulting in a superior semihydrogenation selectivity to targeted alkenes.

         <title>Multiple Wavelength Photopolymerization of Stable Poly(Catecholamines)&#8208;DNA Origami Nanostructures**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami nanostructures have been decorated with photosensitive reaction centers that produce reactive oxygen species at their individual characteristic wavelengths. In this way, polymerization of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine is induced and independent polymer patterning on the DNA origami template can be directed. In addition, the polymer rings alter the interaction of DNA origami objects and cell membranes, thereby promoting their cellular uptake.







Abstract
The synthesis of multicomponent polymer hybrids with nanometer precision is chemically challenging in the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of complex nanostructures. Here, we leverage the fidelity of the DNA origami technique to install a multiple wavelength responsive photopolymerization system with nanometer resolution. By precisely immobilizing various photosensitizers on the origami template, which are only activated at their respective maximum wavelength, we can control sequential polymerization processes. In particular, the triggered photosensitizers generate reactive oxygen species that in turn initiate the polymerization of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine. We imprint polymeric layers at designated positions on DNA origami, which modifies the polyanionic nature of the DNA objects, thus promoting their uptake into living cells while preserving their integrity. Our herein proposed method provides a rapid platform to access complex 3D nanostructures by customizing material and biological interfaces.

         <title>A Near&#8208;Infrared Absorbing and Emissive Quadruple Helicene Enabled by the Scholl Reaction of Perylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quadruple helicene having two [6] and two [7]helicene moieties fused in a contorted framework was synthesized by the Scholl reaction of a perylene&#8208;containing substrate. The quadruple helicene exhibits unusual near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission and its isolated enantiomers exhibit electronic circular dichroism in the near&#8208;infrared and visible&#8208;light regions.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis, structural analysis, optical and chiroptical properties of a novel quadruple helicene, which has two [6] and two [7]helicene moieties fused in a contorted framework of 92 sp2 carbon atoms. It was synthesized by the Scholl reaction of a perylene&#8208;containing substrate with the formation of eight carbon&#8208;carbon bonds on the perylene unit in a single synthetic operation. Chemical oxidation of the quadruple helicene with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate resulted in an air&#8208;stable dication, which exhibits the same helicity in its four helicene moieties as unambiguously identified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The quadruple helicene exhibits unusual near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission with absorption and emission maxima at 848&#8197;nm and 977&#8197;nm, respectively, and its isolated enantiomers exhibit electronic circular dichroism in the near&#8208;infrared and visible&#8208;light regions.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Tunable Persistent Luminescent Materials via Radiative Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal, feasible, and simple approach for dynamic tunable afterglow systems based on a simple radiative energy transfer mechanism is presented. The persistent luminescence (&#964;&gt;0.7&#8197;s) can be reversibly converted between different colors in the solid, solution, and gel states by controlling the isomerization of the energy acceptor through a simple radiative energy transfer (reabsorption) mechanism.







Abstract
In this work, a universal strategy for solid, solution, or gel state organic persistent luminescent materials via radiative energy transfer is proposed. The persistent luminescence (&#964;&gt;0.7&#8197;s) could be remotely regulated between different colors by controlling the isomerization of the energy acceptor. The function relies on the simple radiative energy transfer (reabsorption) mechanism, rather than the complicated communication between the excited state of the molecules such as F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer or Dexter energy transfer. And the &#8220;apparent lifetime&#8221; for the energy acceptor is the same as the lifetime of the energy donor, which was different with a traditional radiative energy transfer process. The simple working principle endows this strategy with huge universality, flexibility, and operability. This work offers a simple, feasible, and universal way to construct various persistent luminescent materials in solid, solution, and gel states.

         <title>Geometrically Constrained Cationic Low&#8208;Coordinate Tetrylenes: Highly Lewis Acidic &#963;&#8208;Donor Ligands in Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In stark contrast to poorly electrophilic classical &#963;&#8208;donating spectator ligands, we show that geometrically constrained low&#8208;coordinate, cationic GeII and SnII ligands remain highly electrophilic in the coordination sphere of Ni0, despite being &#963;&#8208;donors; binding of nucleophiles and fluoride abstraction at the donor atom is demonstrated, alongside the capacity to catalyse the hydrosilylation of alkenes and alkynes.







Abstract
A novel non&#8208;innocent ligand class, namely cationic single&#8208;centre ambiphiles, is reported in the phosphine&#8208;functionalised cationic tetrylene Ni0 complexes, [PhRDippENi(PPh3)3]+ (4&#8201;a/b (Ge) and 5 (Sn); PhRDipp={[Ph2PCH2SiR2](Dipp)N}&#8722;; R=Ph, iPr; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). The inherent electronic nature of low&#8208;coordinate tetryliumylidenes, combined with the geometrically constrained [N&#8722;E&#8722;Ni] bending angle enforced by the chelating phosphine arm in these complexes, leads to strongly electrophilic EII centres which readily bind nucleophiles, reversibly in the case of NH3. Further, the GeII centre in 4&#8201;a/b readily abstracts the fluoride ion from [SbF6]&#8722; to form the fluoro&#8208;germylene complex PhRDippGe(F)Ni(PPh3)3 9, despite this GeII centre simultaneously being a &#963;&#8208;donating ligand towards Ni0. Alongside the observed catalytic ability of 4 and 5 in the hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes, this forms an exciting introduction to a multi&#8208;talented ligand class in cationic single&#8208;centre ambiphiles.

Alongside the observed catalytic ability of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; in the hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes, this forms an exciting introduction to a multi-talented ligand class in cationic single-centre ambiphiles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Pyroptosis is a unique form of programmed cell death that is essentially proinflammatory and critical for immunity. In their Research Article(e202115800), Qian Cao, Zong&#8208;Wan Mao, and co&#8208;workers developed a carbonic anhydrase&#8197;IX (CAIX)&#8208;anchored photosensitizer, CA&#8208;Re, that is capable of inducing and self&#8208;reporting membrane rupture upon irradiation, as well as evoking pyroptosis to activate antitumor immunity. CA&#8208;Re is the first metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based pyroptosis inducer, and this work provides a promising avenue for cancer metalloimmunotherapy.

Copper halide based organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid structures exhibit great potential as light&#8208;emitting materials. In their Research Article (e202115225), Wei Liu, Gangfeng Ouyang et&#8197;al. report a facile strategy for the synthesis of highly luminescent copper halide hybrid structures by fabricating a coordinated anionic inorganic module with a neutral organic ligand molecule. By using this approach, a family of blue&#8208;emitting copper halide hybrid ionic structures have been prepared with high internal quantum yields of up to 98&#8201;%.

A new class of supramolecules could open a new frontier in science through creation of unexplored quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanomaterials, which are considered as both continuous systems and molecular systems. In their Communication (e202114353), Kimihisa Yamamoto and co&#8208;workers developed a new synthetic method using huge dendritic supramolecular capsules constructed only by self&#8208;assembly based on coordination chemistry and polymer chemistry, and successfully demonstrate the first&#8208;ever precise synthesis of quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanomaterials.

Gene fusion is an important natural process to create new enzymes from simpler ancestors. Gerrit&#8197;J. Poelarends and co&#8208;workers have adopted this strategy in their Communication (e202113970) to evolve a promiscuous homohexameric 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) into an efficient enzyme for enantioselective Michael reactions. They designed a tandem fused 4&#8208;OT that has reduced structural symmetry, expanding its optimization potential by allowing independent sequence diversification of adjacent subunits, and thus enlarging the protein sequence space that can be travelled by directed evolution.

         <title>A Molecular Pump Facilitates Mechanical Adsorption Away from Equilibrium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Attaching or embedding biological or artificial molecular pumps to or into a surface or interface to achieve compartmentalization enables their unidirectional molecular motion to be organized in a confined environment. This approach led to the discovery of the phenomenon of mechanisorption and paves the way towards building highly complex organized molecular architectures.







Abstract
Artificial molecular pumps that perform unidirectional motion on the molecular scale have been used to design systems operating away from equilibrium. Crafting such pumps onto a surface allows their unidirectional movement to be organized in a confined environment as well as the active pumping of adsorbents from the bulk solution to the surface. This study led to the discovery of the phenomenon of mechanisorption and paves the way for the construction of highly complex organized molecular architectures.

         <title>Fighting Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Bacteria: Promising Strategies Orchestrated by Molecularly Imprinted Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persistent infections and deaths caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria are a worldwide health issue. Molecularly imprinted polymers that are antibody mimics with selective recognition sites for a target molecule can fight these bacteria on several fronts. The targets range from endotoxins, &#946;&#8208;lactamase and adhesins to biofilm components and quorum sensing messengers.







Abstract
Infections caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria are difficult and sometimes impossible to treat, making them one of the major public health problems of our time. We highlight how one unique material, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), can orchestrate several strategies to fight this serious societal issue. MIPs are tailor&#8208;made biomimetic supramolecular receptors that recognize and bind target molecules with high affinity and selectivity, comparable to those of antibodies. While research on MIPs for combatting cancer has flourished, comprehensive work on their involvement in combatting resistant superbugs has been rather scarce. This review aims at filling this gap. We will describe the causes of bacterial resistance and at which level MIPs can deploy their weapons. MIPs&#8217; targets can be biofilm constituents, quorum sensing messengers, bacterial surface proteins and antibiotic&#8208;deactivating enzymes, among others. We will conclude with the current challenges and future developments in this field.

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acids in Nuclear Medicine Imaging: Shedding Light on Nano&#8211;Bio Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of framework nucleic acids (FNAs) has been advancing in biomedicine over the past decade. Its recent integration with nuclear medicine imaging has broadened our understanding of the bio&#8208;interfacing of FNAs. In this Minireview, we survey and discuss nuclear imaging of FNAs in&#8197;vivo with the aim of highlighting outstanding questions on nano&#8211;bio interactions and potential directions for translation.







Abstract
Framework nucleic acids (FNAs) represent nanoscale oligonucleotide assemblies with unique physical, chemical, and biological properties that are different from their building blocks. Following simple Watson&#8211;Crick base&#8208;pairing rules, arbitrary DNA frameworks with diverse shapes, sizes, and dimensions can be prepared with high reproducibility and stability. The programmable assembly of nucleic acids into FNAs presents a highly controllable model for studies on nano&#8211;bio interactions and allows scrutiny of &#8220;nanostructure&#8208;activity relationships.&#8221; Herein, we present an overview of recent progress with FNAs in the hope of deepening our understanding of nano&#8211;bio interfacing. We summarize the biological profiles and immune responses of various FNAs as functions of their shape, sizes, and surface charges. We then highlight recent efforts to apply FNAs for biomedical applications and discuss the challenges of FNAs for potential clinical translation. We believe that this Minireview can bring up&#8208;to&#8208;date information on FNAs and shed light on how their design may be harnessed for selective biomedical applications.

         <title>Gene Fusion and Directed Evolution to Break Structural Symmetry and Boost Catalysis by an Oligomeric C&#8722;C Bond&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Less symmetry, more diversity: Here we show that gene duplication and fusion to break structural symmetry, allowing independent sequence diversification of neighboring subunits by directed evolution, is a powerful strategy to boost catalysis by a promiscuous homohexameric 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT), enabling efficient asymmetric Michael additions.







Abstract
Gene duplication and fusion are among the primary natural processes that generate new proteins from simpler ancestors. Here we adopted this strategy to evolve a promiscuous homohexameric 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) into an efficient biocatalyst for enantioselective Michael reactions. We first designed a tandem&#8208;fused 4&#8208;OT to allow independent sequence diversification of adjacent subunits by directed evolution. This fused 4&#8208;OT was then subjected to eleven rounds of directed evolution to give variant 4&#8208;OT(F11), which showed an up to 320&#8208;fold enhanced activity for the Michael addition of nitromethane to cinnamaldehydes. Crystallographic analysis revealed that 4&#8208;OT(F11) has an unusual asymmetric trimeric architecture in which one of the monomers is flipped 180&#176; relative to the others. This gene duplication and fusion strategy to break structural symmetry is likely to become an indispensable asset of the enzyme engineering toolbox, finding wide use in engineering oligomeric proteins.

         <title>Dearomative Cyclopropanation of Naphthols via Cyclopropene Ring&#8208;Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rhodium&#8208; and acid&#8208;catalyzed dearomative cyclopropanation of naphthols from cyclopropene ring&#8208;opening has been described. The reaction is scalable and highly chemoselective, and the vinyl cyclopropane products can be uniquely diversified. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.







Abstract
The dearomatization of 2&#8208;naphthols represents a simple method for the construction of complex 3D structures from simple planar starting materials. We describe a cyclopropanation of 2&#8208;naphthols that proceeds via cyclopropene ring&#8208;opening using rhodium and acid catalysis under mild conditions. The vinyl cyclopropane molecules were formed with high chemoselectivity and scalability, which could be further functionalized at different sites. Both computational and experimental evidence were used to elucidate the reaction mechanism.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dearomatization of 2-naphthols represents a simple method for the construction of complex 3D structures from simple planar starting materials. We describe a cyclopropanation of 2-naphthols that proceeds via cyclopropene ring-opening using rhodium and acid catalysis under mild conditions. The vinyl cyclopropane molecules were formed with high chemoselectivity and scalability, which could be further functionalized at different sites. Both computational and experimental evidence were used to elucidate the reaction mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Accurate Synthesis of Quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanoparticles by Dendron&#8208;assembled Supramolecular Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Dendron&#8208;assembled supramolecules&#8221; constructed by self&#8208;assembly based on coordination chemistry and polymer chemistry serve as flexibly designable supramolecular huge templates and demonstrate the first&#8208;ever precise synthesis of quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanomaterials. This concept for the creation of larger inorganic nanomaterials using even larger organic molecules will provide a crucial key to exploring the last frontier in nanoscience.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanomaterials (1&#8211;3&#8197;nm) have been predicted to exhibit unique properties originating from the gray structures considered both bulk solids and molecules, while their synthesis is extremely difficult. The present study describes a new template synthesis method for quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanosized materials using a combination of coordination chemistry and polymer chemistry. Utilizing self&#8208;assembly of guest basic phenylazomethine dendron units onto host acidic core units with six tritylium cations, the dendron&#8208;assembled supramolecules were constructed easily and quantitatively without costly techniques. This huge supramolecular capsule accumulating multiple acidic rhodium salts in its basic ligands enabled a precise synthesis of rhodium particles via formation of multinuclear complexes. The obtained particles (Rh84, &#8776;1.5&#8197;nm) have particle sizes within 1&#8211;3&#8197;nm range and were larger than conventional sub&#8208;nanoparticles (Rh14, &#8776;0.85&#8197;nm), therefore the precise template synthesis of quasi&#8208;sub&#8208;nanoparticles was successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Transformer&#8208;Induced Metamorphosis of Polymeric Nanoparticle Shape at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The shape of nanoparticles is a crucial parameter that affects their fundamental properties. Herein, we report a straightforward approach wherein addition of a small organic molecule (transformer) can induce metamorphosis of the nanoparticle shape without altering the chemical structure of the constituent polymers. Importantly, this method is applicable to various block copolymers without requiring the synthesis of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers.







Abstract
Controlled polymerizations have enabled the production of nanostructured materials with different shapes, each exhibiting distinct properties. Despite the importance of shape, current morphological transformation strategies are limited in polymer scope, alter the chemical structure, require high temperatures, and are fairly tedious. Herein we present a rapid and versatile morphological transformation strategy that operates at room temperature and does not impair the chemical structure of the constituent polymers. By simply adding a molecular transformer to an aqueous dispersion of polymeric nanoparticles, a rapid evolution to the next higher&#8208;order morphology was observed, yielding a range of morphologies from a single starting material. Significantly, this approach can be applied to nanoparticles produced by disparate block copolymers obtained by various synthetic techniques including emulsion polymerization, polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly and traditional solution self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Electrical Reverse Shift: Sustainable CO2 Valorization for Industrial Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrified reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (eRWGS&#8482;) enables production of sustainable carbon&#8208;based chemicals from CO2 compatible with existing industrial processes. Herein we demonstrate the advantages of a methanation active catalyst, including superior activity, favorable temperature profile, and suppression of carbon formation.







Abstract
Utilization of CO2 is a requirement for a sustainable production of carbon&#8208;based chemicals. The reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (RWGS) can valorize CO2 by reaction with hydrogen to produce a synthesis gas compatible with existing industrial infrastructure. Fully electrified reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (eRWGS&#8482;) was achieved using integrated ohmic heating and a nickel&#8208;type catalyst at industrially relevant conditions. Using a feed of H2&#8201;:&#8201;CO2 in a ratio of 2.25 at 10&#8197;barg, utilizing high temperature operation at 1050&#8201;&#176;C allowed for production of a synthesis gas with a H2/CO ratio of 2.0 and no detectable methane, ideal for production of sustainable fuel by e.g. the Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis. Facilitating RWGS through CH4 as intermediate was found superior to the selective RWGS route, due to higher activity and suppression of carbon formation. The eRWGS&#8482; catalyst is found to provide a preferential emissions&#8208;free route for production of synthesis gas for any relevant H2/CO ratio, enabling production of sustainable carbon&#8208;based chemicals from CO2 and renewable electricity with high hydrogen and carbon efficiency.

         <title>Hydrogenative Cycloisomerization and Sigmatropic Rearrangement Reactions of Cationic Ruthenium Carbenes Formed by Catalytic Alkyne gem&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two unprecedented hydrogenation reactions are disclosed, commencing with geminal delivery of both H&#8208;atoms of H2 to the triple bond of a propargyl alcohol derivative. When catalyzed with cationic ruthenium complexes, the resulting pianostool carbenes are so &#8220;hot&#8221; that they are readily intercepted by tethered nucleophiles, resulting in cycloisomerization or [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement reactions.







Abstract
gem&#8208;Hydrogenation of propargyl alcohol derivatives with [CpXRu(MeCN)3]PF6 (CpX=substituted cyclopentadienyl) as catalysts affords cationic pianostool ruthenium carbene complexes which are so electrophilic that they attack a tethered olefin to furnish cyclopentene products; cyclopropanation or metathesis do not compete with this novel transformation. If the transient carbenes carry appropriate propargylic substituents, however, they engage in ([2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic) rearrangements to give enol esters (carbonates, carbamates, sulfonates) or alkenyl halides. Both pathways are unprecedented in the vast hydrogenation literature. The proposed mechanistic scenarios are in line with labeling experiments and spectroscopic data; most notably, PHIP NMR spectroscopy (PHIP=parahydrogen induced polarization) provides compelling evidence that the reactions are indeed triggered by highly unorthodox gem&#8208;hydrogenation events.

         <title>A Mechanistically Inspired Halenium Ion Initiated Spiroketalization: Entry to Mono&#8208; and Dibromospiroketals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halenium affinity (HalA) guided design leads to stereoselective bromospiroketalization of alkyl ketones, templated by a tethered 2&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl(THP)&#8208;protected alcohol. Subtle alteration of the reaction conditions provides either the bromospiroketals or the dibromospiroketals.







Abstract
Employing halenium affinity (HalA) as a guiding tool, the weak nucleophilic character of alkyl ketones was modulated by the templating effect of a tethered 2&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl(THP)&#8208;protected alcohol towards realizing a bromenium ion initiated spiroketalization cascade. Addition of ethanol aided an early termination of the cascade by scavenging the THP group after the halofunctionalization stage, furnishing monobromospiroketals. Alternatively, exclusion of ethanol from the reaction mixture biased the transient oxocarbenium towards &#945;&#8208;deprotonation that precedes a second bromofunctionalization event thus, furnishing dibrominated spiroketals. The regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity exploited in the current methodology provides a novel and rapid access to the dibrominated spiroketal motifs exhibited by several natural products.

&lt;p&gt;Halenium affinity (&lt;i&gt;HalA&lt;/i&gt;) guided design leads to stereoselective bromospiroketalization of alkyl ketones, templated by a tethered 2-tetrahydropyranyl(THP)-protected alcohol. Subtle alteration of the reaction conditions provides either the bromospiroketals or the dibromospiroketals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing halenium affinity (&lt;i&gt;HalA&lt;/i&gt;) as a guiding tool, the weak nucleophilic character of alkyl ketones was modulated by the templating effect of a tethered 2-tetrahydropyranyl(THP)-protected alcohol towards realizing a bromenium ion initiated spiroketalization cascade. Addition of ethanol aided an early termination of the cascade by scavenging the THP group after the halofunctionalization stage, furnishing monobromospiroketals. Alternatively, exclusion of ethanol from the reaction mixture biased the transient oxocarbenium towards &#945;-deprotonation that precedes a second bromofunctionalization event thus, furnishing dibrominated spiroketals. The regio- and stereoselectivity exploited in the current methodology provides a novel and rapid access to the dibrominated spiroketal motifs exhibited by several natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling Chemoselectivity of Catalytic Hydroboration with Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;controllable, chemoselective hydroboration of ketoacids is reported using a well&#8208;defined cobalt hydride catalyst. Excellent selectivities can be achieved, with acids reacting in the dark and ketones in the light. This approach can be further extended to other functional groups.







Abstract
The ability to selectively react one functional group in the presence of another underpins efficient reaction sequences. Despite many designer catalytic systems being reported for hydroboration reactions, which allow introduction of a functional handle for cross&#8208;coupling or act as mild method for reducing polar functionality, these platforms rarely deal with more complex systems where multiple potentially reactive sites exist. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the ability to use light to distinguish between ketones and carboxylic acids in more complex molecules. By taking advantage of different activation modes, a single catalytic system can be used for hydroboration, with the chemoselectivity dictated only by the presence or absence of visible light.

         <title>Controlled In&#8208;Cell Generation of Active Palladium(0) Species for Bioorthogonal Decaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, cell&#8208;permeable source of PdII is intracellularly reduced to the catalytically active Pd0 through the addition of sodium ascorbate. Controlled in&#8208;cell generation of Pd0 enables Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal intracellular activation of caged cytotoxic drugs and fluorophores in cancer cells.







Abstract
Owing to their bioorthogonality, transition metals have become very popular in the development of biocompatible bond&#8208;cleavage reactions. However, many approaches require design and synthesis of complex ligands or formulation of nanoparticles which often perform poorly in living cells. This work reports on a method for the generation of an active palladium species that triggers bond&#8208;cleaving reactions inside living cells. We utilized the water&#8208;soluble Na2PdCl4 as a simple source of PdII which can be intracellularly reduced by sodium ascorbate to the active Pd0 species. Once generated, Pd0 triggers the cleavage of allyl ether and carbamate caging groups leading to the release of biologically active molecules. These findings do not only expand the toolbox of available bioorthogonal dissociative reactions but also provide an additional strategy for controlling the reactivity of Pd species involved in Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal reactions.

         <title>Vectorial Catalysis in Surface&#8208;Anchored Nanometer&#8208;Sized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks&#8208;Based Microfluidic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling multiple reactions in a programmed manner and defined spatial localization is a key goal in catalysis, which is referred to as vectorial catalysis. We realized a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based vectorial catalysis system by anchoring two different nano&#8208;MOFs at precise spatial positions in the microfluidic device and tested their performance in the catalysis of a two&#8208;step reaction sequence.







Abstract
Vectorial catalysis&#8212;controlling multi&#8208;step reactions in a programmed sequence and by defined spatial localization in a microscale device&#8212;is an enticing goal in bio&#8208;inspired catalysis research. However, translating concepts from natural cascade biocatalysis into artificial hierarchical chemical systems remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate integration of two different surface&#8208;anchored nanometer&#8208;sized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in a microfluidic device for modelling vectorial catalysis. Catalyst immobilization at defined sections along the microchannel and a two&#8208;step cascade reaction was conducted with full conversion after 30&#8197;seconds and high turnover frequencies (TOF&#8776;105&#8197;h&#8722;1).

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Triggered Dynamic Disulfide Bond Self&#8208;Heals Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 8, February 14, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functionalized polyurethane is used as an additive to self&#8208;heal a CsPbIBr2 film by a disulfide&#8208;exchange reaction upon heat treatment. The inorganic CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cell achieves a champion efficiency of 10.61&#8201;% with efficiency recovery after heat treatment.







Abstract
One great challenge for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) lies in their poor operational stability under harsh stimuli by humidity, heat, light, etc. Herein, a thermal&#8208;triggered self&#8208;healing polyurethane (PU) is tailored to simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability of inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSCs. The dynamic covalent disulfide bonds between adjacent molecule chains in PU at high temperatures self&#8208;heal the in&#8208;service formed defects within the CsPbIBr2 perovskite film. Finally, the best device free of encapsulation achieves a champion efficiency up to 10.61&#8201;% and an excellent long&#8208;term stability in an air atmosphere over 80&#8197;days and persistent heat attack (85&#8201;&#176;C) over 35&#8197;days. Moreover, the photovoltaic performances are recovered by a simple heat treatment.

         <title>12b,24b&#8208;Diborahexabenzo[a,c,fg,l,n,qr]pentacene: A Low&#8208;LUMO Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon</title>

         <dc:description>
A doubly B&#8208;doped hexabenzopentacene was designed based on presynthetic DFT calculations, predicting intriguing optoelectronic properties. Subsequently, the electron&#8208;deficient, NIR&#8208;emitting B&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon was prepared via six net C&#8722;H borylations from an unfunctionalized alkene in a two&#8208;pot synthetic procedure. The structure obtained by X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed an enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation upon cyclization compared to non&#8208;fused derivatives.







Abstract
Herein we devise and execute a new synthesis of a pristine boron&#8208;doped nanographene. Our target boron&#8208;doped nanographene was designed based on DFT calculations to possess a low LUMO energy level and a narrow band gap derived from its precise geometry and B&#8208;doping arrangement. Our synthesis of this target, a doubly B&#8208;doped hexabenzopentacene (B2&#8208;HBP), employs six net C&#8722;H borylations of an alkene, comprising consecutive hydroboration/electrophilic borylation/dehydrogenation and BBr3/AlCl3/2,6&#8208;dichloropyridine&#8208;mediated C&#8722;H borylation steps. As predicted by our calculations, B2&#8208;HBP absorbs strongly in the visible region and emits in the NIR up to 1150&#8197;nm in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene solutions. Furthermore, B2&#8208;HBP possesses a very low LUMO level, showing two reversible reductions at &#8722;1.00&#8197;V and &#8722;1.17&#8197;V vs. Fc+/Fc.

     alt="12b,24b-Diborahexabenzo[a,c,fg,l,n,qr]pentacene: A Low-LUMO Boron-Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A doubly B-doped hexabenzopentacene was designed based on presynthetic DFT calculations, predicting intriguing optoelectronic properties. Subsequently, the electron-deficient, NIR-emitting B-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon was prepared via six net C&#8722;H borylations from an unfunctionalized alkene in a two-pot synthetic procedure. The structure obtained by X-ray crystallography confirmed an enhanced &#960;-conjugation upon cyclization compared to non-fused derivatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Herein we devise and execute a new synthesis of a pristine boron-doped nanographene. Our target boron-doped nanographene was designed based on DFT calculations to possess a low LUMO energy level and a narrow band gap derived from its precise geometry and B-doping arrangement. Our synthesis of this target, a doubly B-doped hexabenzopentacene (&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;-HBP&lt;/b&gt;), employs six net C&#8722;H borylations of an alkene, comprising consecutive hydroboration/electrophilic borylation/dehydrogenation and BBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/2,6-dichloropyridine-mediated C&#8722;H borylation steps. As predicted by our calculations, &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;-HBP&lt;/b&gt; absorbs strongly in the visible region and emits in the NIR up to 1150&lt;/i&gt;&#8197;&lt;i&gt;nm in o-dichlorobenzene solutions. Furthermore, &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
   &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;-HBP&lt;/b&gt; possesses a very low LUMO level, showing two reversible reductions at &#8722;1.00&lt;/i&gt;&#8197;&lt;i&gt;V and &#8722;1.17&lt;/i&gt;&#8197;&lt;i&gt;V vs. Fc&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fc.

         <title>Thionolactone as Resin Additive to Prepare (bio)degradable 3D Objects via VAT Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3D printing and especially VAT photopolymerization leads to cross&#8208;linked materials with high thermal, chemical and mechanical properties. Nevertheless, such stability is incompatible with degradability and re/upcyclability. We showed here that thionolactone and especially dibenzo[c,e]&#8208;oxepane&#8208;5&#8208;thione (DOT) could be used as an additive (2 wt%) to acrylate&#8208;based resins to introduce weak bonds into the network via a radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization process. The low amount of additive allows to only slightly modify the printability of the resin, keep intact its resolution and maintain the mechanical properties of the 3D object. The resin with additive was used in UV microfabrication and 2&#8208;photon stereolithography setup and commercial 3D printers. The fabricated objects were shown to degrade in basic solvent as well in a home&#8208;made compost. The rate of degradation is nonetheless dependent of the size of the object. This feature was used to prepare 3D objects with support structures that could be easily solubilized.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Chemistry Triggers Ultrafast Radiative Recombination in Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial chemistry strategy is developed to dramatically increase radiative recombination of perovskites. The oxide&#8208;bonded perovskite has a large exciton binding energy and a high localized density of electronic state, exhibiting an unprecedented 5000 fold increase in the radiative recombination rate. The enormously enhanced radiative recombination promises to significantly promote the perovskite optoelectronic performance.







Abstract
Efficient radiative recombination is essential for perovskite luminescence, but the intrinsic radiative recombination rate as a basic material property is challenging to tailor. Here we report an interfacial chemistry strategy to dramatically increase the radiative recombination rate of perovskites. By coating aluminum oxide on the lead halide perovskite, lead&#8211;oxygen bonds are formed at the perovskite&#8208;oxide interface, producing the perovskite surface states with a large exciton binding energy and a high localized density of electronic state. The oxide&#8208;bonded perovskite exhibits a &#8776;500 fold enhanced photoluminescence with a &#8776;10 fold reduced lifetime, indicating an unprecedented &#8776;5000 fold increase in the radiative recombination rate. The enormously enhanced radiative recombination promises to significantly promote the perovskite optoelectronic performance.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Fluorescent Block Copolymer Micelles with Responsive Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Responsive fluorescent materials offer a high potential for sensing and (bio&#8208;)imaging applications. To investigate new concepts for such materials and to broaden their applicability, the previously reported non&#8208;fluorescent zinc(II) complex  [Zn(L)]  that shows coordination&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on emission was encapsulated into a family of non&#8208;fluorescent polystyrene&#8208;  block  &#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (PS&#8208;  b  &#8208;P4VP) diblock copolymer micelles leading to brightly emissive materials. Coordination&#8208;induced  turn&#8208;on  emission upon incorporation and ligation of the  [Zn(L)]  in the P4VP core outperform parent  [Zn(L)]  in pyridine solution with respect to lifetimes, quantum yields, and temperature resistance. The quantum yield can be easily tuned by tailoring the selectivity of the employed solvent or solvent mixture and, thus, the tendency of the PS&#8208;  b  &#8208;P4VP diblock copolymers to self&#8208;assemble into micelles. A medium&#8208;dependent  off&#8208;on  sensor upon micelle formation could be established by suppression of non&#8208;micelle&#8208;borne emission background pertinent to chloroform through controlled acidification indicating an additional pH&#8208;dependent process.</dc:description>

To investigate new concepts for such materials and to broaden their applicability, the previously reported non-fluorescent zinc(II) complex  [Zn(L)]  that shows coordination-induced turn-on emission was encapsulated into a family of non-fluorescent polystyrene-  block  -poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-  b  -P4VP) diblock copolymer micelles leading to brightly emissive materials. Coordination-induced  turn-on  emission upon incorporation and ligation of the  [Zn(L)]  in the P4VP core outperform parent  [Zn(L)]  in pyridine solution with respect to lifetimes, quantum yields, and temperature resistance. The quantum yield can be easily tuned by tailoring the selectivity of the employed solvent or solvent mixture and, thus, the tendency of the PS-  b  -P4VP diblock copolymers to self-assemble into micelles. A medium-dependent  off-on  sensor upon micelle formation could be established by suppression of non-micelle-borne emission background pertinent to chloroform through controlled acidification indicating an additional pH-dependent process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous Counting of Molecules in the Halo and Dense&#8208;Core of Nanovesicles by Regulating Dynamics of Vesicle Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the discovery that in the presence of chaotropic anions (SCN&#8722;) the opening of nanometer biological vesicles at an electrified interface often becomes a two&#8208;step process (around 30% doublet peaks). We have then used this to independently count molecules in each subvesicular compartment, the halo and protein dense&#8208;core, and the fraction of catecholamine binding to the dense&#8208;core is 68%. Moreover, we differentiated two distinct populations of large dense&#8208;core vesicles (LDCVs) and quantified their content, which might correspond to immature (43%) and mature (30%) LDCVs, to reveal differences in their biogenesis. We speculate this is caused by an increase in the electrostatic attraction between protonated catecholamine and the negatively charged dense&#8208;core following adsorption of SCN&#8722;.</dc:description>

         <title>Coloration in Supraparticles Assembled from Polyhedral Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supraparticles are spherical colloidal crystals prepared by confined self&#8208;assembly processes. A particularly appealing property of these microscale structures is their structural color arising from interference of light with their building blocks. Here, we assemble supraparticles with high structural order that exhibit coloration from uniform, polyhedral metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) particles. We analyse the structural coloration as a function of the size of these anisotropic building blocks and their internal structure. We attribute the angle&#8208;dependent coloration of the MOF supraparticles to the presence of ordered, onion&#8208;like layers at the outermost regions. Surprisingly, even though different shapes of the MOF particles have different propensities to form these onion layers, all supraparticle dispersions show well&#8208;visible macroscopic coloration, indicating that local ordering is sufficient to generate interference effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;imprinting of the helical organization in liquid crystal networks using achiral monomers and circularly polarized light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control over molecular motion is facilitated in materials with highly ordered nanoscale structures. Here we report on the fabrication of cholesteric liquid crystal networks by circularly polarized light irradiation, without the need for chiral dopant or plasticizer. The polymer network is obtained by photopolymerization of a smectic achiral diacrylate mesogen consisting of an azobenzene core and discrete oligodimethylsiloxane tails. The synchronous helical photoalignment and photopolymerization originate from the cooperative movement of the mesogens ordered in well&#8208;defined responsive structures, together with the flexibility of the oligodimethylsiloxane blocks. The resulting thin films show excellent thermal stability and light&#8208;induced memory features with reversible responses. Additionally, we demonstrate the fabrication of photo&#8208;patterned films of liquid crystal networks with opposite helical senses. These findings provide a new method to make light&#8208;controllable chiroptical materials with exciting applications in optics and photonics.</dc:description>

         <title>Overturned Loading of Inert CeO2 to Active Co3O4 for Unusually Improved Catalytic Activity in Fenton&#8208;like Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past decades, numerous efforts have been devoted to improving the catalytic activity of nanocomposites by either exposing more active sites or regulating the interaction between the support and nanoparticles while keeping the structure of the active sites unchanged. Here, we report the fabrication of a Co3O4&#8208;CeO2 nanocomposite via overturning the loading direction, i.e., loading an inert CeO2 support onto active Co3O4 nanoparticles. The resultant catalyst exhibits unexpectedly higher activity and stability in peroxymonosulfate&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like reactions than its analog prepared by the traditional impregnation method. Abundant oxygen vacancies (Ov with a Co&#8230;Ov&#8230;Ce structure instead of Co&#8230;Ov) are generated as new active sites to facilitate the cleavage of the peroxide bond to produce SO4&#8226;&#8208; and accelerate the rate&#8208;limiting step, i.e., the desorption of SO4&#8226;&#8208;, affording improved activity. This strategy is a new direction for boosting the catalytic activity of the Co3O4 composite catalysts in various scenarios, including environmental remediation and energy applications</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical transformations offer environmentally benign synthesis routes, whilst enhancing both the speed and selectivity of reactions. In this light, mechanochemistry promises to transform the way in which chemistry is done in both academia and industry but is greatly hindered by a current lack in mechanistic understanding. The continued development and use of time&#8208;resolved  in situ  (TRIS) approaches to monitor mechanochemical reactions provides a new dimension to elucidate these fascinating transformations. We here discuss recent trends in method development that have pushed the boundaries of mechanochemical research. New features of mechanochemical reactions obtained by TRIS techniques are subsequently discussed, shedding light on how different TRIS approaches have been used. Emphasis is placed on the strength of combining complementary techniques. Finally, we outline our views for the potential of TRIS methods in mechanochemical research, towards establishing a new, environmentally benign paradigm in the chemical sciences.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Wearable Silver Nanowire Decorated Leather Nanocomposites for Joule Heating, Electromagnetic Interference Shielding and Piezoresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multifunctional wearable electronic devices based on natural materials are highly desirable for versatile applications of energy conversion, electronic skin and artificial intelligence. Herein, multifunctional wearable silver nanowire decorated leather (AgNW/leather) nanocomposites with hierarchical structures for integrated visual Joule heating, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and piezoresistive sensing are fabricated via the facile vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration process. The AgNWs penetrate the micro&#8208;nano porous structures in the corium side of leather constructing highly&#8208;efficient conductive networks.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multifunctional wearable electronic devices based on natural materials are highly desirable for versatile applications of energy conversion, electronic skin and artificial intelligence. Herein, multifunctional wearable silver nanowire decorated leather (AgNW/leather) nanocomposites with hierarchical structures for integrated visual Joule heating, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and piezoresistive sensing are fabricated via the facile vacuum-assisted filtration process. The AgNWs penetrate the micro-nano porous structures in the corium side of leather constructing highly-efficient conductive networks. The resultant flexible and mechanically strong AgNW/leather nanocomposites exhibit extremely low sheet resistance of 0.8 &#937;/sq, superior visual Joule heating temperatures up to 108&#176;C at low supplied voltage of 2.0 V due to efficient energy conversion, excellent EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of ~55 dB and outstanding piezoresistive sensing ability in human motion detection.

         <title>Crystalline Neutral Diboron Analogues of Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although Schleyer's computations in 1979 predicted that the ground state of parent diborirane features a planar&#8208;tetracoordinate carbon atom (anti van't Hoff&#8208;Le Bel geometry), this work demonstrates that substitution of C coupled with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) coordination provides access to isolable diborirane derivatives  3  and  4  with van't Hoff&#8208;Le Bel geometry. Species  3  and  4  are isoelectronic with cyclopropane and the highly strained B  2  C rings feature 2c&#8208;2e bent &#963; bonds. Consequently, the B&#8722;B and B&#8722;C bonds in  3  are cleaved in the presence of hydride, proton, and chalcogens. The former two reactions gave NHC&#8208;coordinated fluorenyldihydridoborane  5  and dichlorofluorenylborane  6  , respectively, whereas the latter transformations afforded novel thiaborirane  8  and selenaborirane  9  . In addition, transfer hydrogenation of  3  with ammonia borane (H  3  N&#8226;BH  3  ) led to the formation of (&#956;&#8208;hydrido)diborane  7  via selective cleavage of the B&#8722;B bond. These reactivities show potential for their future application in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Reduction&#8208;Induced Hydrogenation of a Helical Bilayer Nanographene with K and Rb Metals: Electron Multiaddition and Selective Rb+ Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reduction&#8208;induced hydrogenation of a helical bilayer nanographene (C138H120) with K or Rb in 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 is reported by Israel Fern&#225;ndez, Marina&#8197;A. Petrukhina, Nazario Mart&#237;n et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115747). DFT calculations predict that localization of the first two electrons in the helicene moiety leads to a site&#8208;specific hydrogenation at the carbon atoms located on the edge of the central [6]helicene backbone (pink hydrogens). The third electron forms a radical trianion on the HBC leading to a final Rb&#8208;complex.

         <title>Mechanism of the Bifunctional Multiple Product Sesterterpene Synthase AcAS from Aspergillus calidoustus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sesterterpene synthase from Aspergillus calidoustus was characterised that produces calidoustene, a compound with a new skeleton, besides five known compounds. A deep mechanistic investigation through isotopic labelling experiments, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and DFT calculations is presented. The substrate analog 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;FPP was converted into several oxygenated terpenoids.







Abstract
The multiproduct chimeric sesterterpene synthase AcAS from Aspergillus calidoustus yielded spirocyclic calidoustene, which exhibits a novel skeleton, besides five known sesterterpenes. The complex cyclisation mechanism to all six compounds was investigated by isotopic labelling experiments in combination with DFT calculations. Chemically synthesised 8&#8208;hydroxyfarnesyl diphosphate was converted with isopentenyl diphosphate and AcAS into four oxygenated sesterterpenoids that structurally resemble cytochrome&#8197;P450 oxidation products of the sesterterpene hydrocarbons. Protein engineering of AcAS broadened the substrate scope and gave significantly improved enzyme yields.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Synthesis of (R)&#8208;Tamsulosin Utilizing Sequential Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a multistep continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of (R)&#8208;tamsulosin, three C&#8722;N bond formation/cleavage reactions with hydrogen gas over heterogeneous catalysts enabled the efficient construction of the key skeleton. Two different polysilane&#8208;modified Pd catalysts were developed for these transformations, which were followed by a deprotection step under homogeneous catalysis to provide tamsulosin in 60&#8201;% overall yield in a flow stream.







Abstract
We describe the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of (R)&#8208;tamsulosin, a blockbuster therapeutic drug employed for dysuria associated with urinary stones and benign prostatic hyperplasia, by utilizing sequential heterogeneous catalysis. Two heterogeneous catalysts have been developed for the synthesis, and the key step involves reductive amination of nitriles using dimethylpolysilane&#8208;modified Pd on activated carbon/calcium phosphate. Overall, (R)&#8208;tamsulosin was obtained in 60&#8201;% yield and 64&#8201;% ee (99&#8201;% ee after recrystallization) in a flow stream through four catalytic transformations without the need for the isolation or purification of any intermediates or byproduct.

     alt="Continuous-Flow Synthesis of (R)-Tamsulosin Utilizing Sequential Heterogeneous Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a multistep continuous-flow synthesis of (R)-tamsulosin, three C&#8722;N bond formation/cleavage reactions with hydrogen gas over heterogeneous catalysts enabled the efficient construction of the key skeleton. Two different polysilane-modified Pd catalysts were developed for these transformations, which were followed by a deprotection step under homogeneous catalysis to provide tamsulosin in 60&#8201;% overall yield in a flow stream.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe the continuous-flow synthesis of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-tamsulosin, a blockbuster therapeutic drug employed for dysuria associated with urinary stones and benign prostatic hyperplasia, by utilizing sequential heterogeneous catalysis. Two heterogeneous catalysts have been developed for the synthesis, and the key step involves reductive amination of nitriles using dimethylpolysilane-modified Pd on activated carbon/calcium phosphate. Overall, (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-tamsulosin was obtained in 60&#8201;% yield and 64&#8201;% ee (99&#8201;% ee after recrystallization) in a flow stream through four catalytic transformations without the need for the isolation or purification of any intermediates or byproduct.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Containing Nucleic Acid&#8208;Based Energy&#8208;Storage Nanoagent for Continuously Photo&#8208;Induced Oxidative Stress Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The siRNA&#8208;aptamer&#8208;ferrocene modified persistent luminescence nanoparticle (siRNA&#8208;ApFe&#8208;PLNP) was designed as an energy&#8208;storage nanoagent to achieve continuous amplification of oxidative stress after photo&#8208;activation, eliminating the need for constant light irradiation and further avoiding the photo&#8208;induced tissue damage.







Abstract
Regulation of cellular oxidative stress plays a critical role in revealing the molecular mechanisms of cellular activities and thus is a potential strategy for tumor treatment. Optical methods have been employed for intelligent regulation of oxidative stress in tumor regions. However, long&#8208;time continuous irradiation inevitably causes damage to normal tissues. Herein, a ferrocene&#8208;containing nucleic acid&#8208;based energy&#8208;storage nanoagent was designed to achieve the continuous photo&#8208;regulation of cellular oxidative stress in the dark. Specifically, the photoenergy stored in the agent could convert effectively and accelerate Fenton&#8208;like reaction continuously, augmenting cellular oxidative stress. This nanoagent could also silence oxidative damage repair genes to further amplify oxidative stress. This strategy not only provides oxidative stress regulation for studying the molecular mechanisms of biological activities, but also offers a promising step toward tumor microenvironment modulation.

         <title>Rational Design of Zinc/Zeolite Catalyst: Selective Formation of p&#8208;Xylene from Methanol to Aromatics Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow triple&#8208;shelled Zn/MFI single crystals not only exhibit a significantly long lifetime but also an enhanced shape selectivity for p&#8208;xylene in the methanol to aromatics (MTA) reaction. The Zn species were directly imaged in the micropores of only the ZSM&#8208;5 layer and the specific structure and anchor location of the Zn species was determined.







Abstract
The production of p&#8208;xylene from the methanol to aromatics (MTA) reaction is challenging. The catalytic stability, which is inversely proportional to the particle size of the zeolite, is not always compatible with p&#8208;xylene selectivity, which is inversely proportional to the external acid sites. In this study, based on a nano&#8208;sized zeolite, we designed hollow triple&#8208;shelled Zn/MFI single crystals using the ultra&#8208;dilute liquid&#8208;phase growth technique. The obtained composites possessed one ZSM&#8208;5 layer (&#8776;30&#8197;nm) in the middle and two silicalite&#8208;1 layers (&#8776;20&#8197;nm) epitaxially grown on two sides of ZSM&#8208;5, which exhibited a considerably long lifetime (100&#8201;% methanol conversion &gt;40&#8197;h) as well as an enhanced shape selectivity of p&#8208;xylene (&gt;35&#8201;%) with a p&#8208;xylene/xylene ratio of &#8776;90&#8201;%. Importantly, using this sandwich&#8208;like zeolite structure, we directly imaged the Zn species in the micropores of only the ZSM&#8208;5 layer and further determined the specific structure and anchor location of the Zn species.

         <title>Highly Efficient Conversion of Propargylic Alcohols and Propargylic Amines with CO2 Activated by Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Catalyst Cu2O@ZIF&#8208;8</title>

         <dc:description>
The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst Cu2O@ZIF&#8208;8 with a yolk&#8211;shell structure was synthesized, and it represents the first noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst that can effectively catalyze both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 under mild conditions.







Abstract
The cyclization reactions of propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 are important in industrial applications, but it was a great challenge that non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts catalyzed both reactions under mild conditions. Herein, the catalyst Cu2O@ZIF&#8208;8 was prepared by encapsulating Cu2O nanoparticles into robust ZIF&#8208;8, and it can effectively catalyze the cyclization of both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 into valuable &#945;&#8208;alkylidene cyclic carbonates and oxazolidinones with turnover numbers (TONs) of 12.1 and 19.6, which can be recycled at least five times. The mechanisms were further uncovered by NMR, FTIR, 13C isotope&#8208;labeling experiments and DFT calculations, in which Cu2O and DBU can synergistically activate the C&#8801;C bond and the hydroxy/amino group of substrates. Importantly, it is the first example of a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst that can catalyze both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 simultaneously.

         <title>Thermal Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing Supramolecular Dopant Towards Efficient and Stable Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic supramolecular adhesives with low glass transition temperature and massive hydrogen bonds were designed by random copolymerization of acrylamide and n&#8208;butyl acrylate. The adhesive dopant facilitates a dynamic thermal self&#8208;healing effect at only 70&#8201;&#176;C and contributes to efficient and highly flexible perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) have attracted great attention due to their advantageous traits such as low cost, portability, light&#8208;weight, etc. However, mechanical stability is still the weak point in their practical application. Herein, we prepared efficient FPSCs with remarkable mechanical stability by a dynamic thermal self&#8208;healing effect, which can be realized by the usage of a supramolecular adhesive. The supramolecular adhesive, which was obtained by random copolymerization of acrylamide and n&#8208;butyl acrylate, is amphiphilic, has a proper glass transition temperature and a high density of hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and receptors, providing the possibility of thermal dynamic repair of mechanical damage in FPSCs. The adhesive also greatly improves the leveling property of the precursor solution on the hydrophobic poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)]amine (PTAA) surface. PSCs containing this adhesive achieve more than a 20&#8201;% power conversion efficiency (PCE) on flexible substrates and a 21.99&#8201;% PCE on rigid substrates (certified PCE of 21.27&#8201;%), with improved electron mobility and reduced defect concentration.
