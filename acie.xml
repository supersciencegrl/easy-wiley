         <title>The Role of Copper Salts and O2 in the Mechanism of C&#926;N Bond Activation for Facilitating Nitrogen Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8801;N bond scission can be a potential avenue for functionalization of chemical bonds. We have conducted a computational study, using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio multireference CASSCF method, to unravel the intricate mechanistic pathways traversed in the copper&#8208;promoted, dioxygen assisted reaction for formation of aryl isocyanate species from aryl aldehyde. This aryl isocyanate species acts as an active species for C&#8801;N bond cleavage of coordinated cyanide anion enabling nitrogen transfer to various aldehydes. Electronic structure analysis revealed that in all the reaction conditions radical&#8208;based pathways are operatives, which is in sound agreement with the experimental findings. The major driving force is CuII/I redox cycle initiated by single electron transfer from the carbon centre of the nitrile moiety. Our study revealed that the copper salts act as the &#8220;electron pool&#8221; in this unique nitrogen transfer reaction forming an aryl isocyanate species from aryl aldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structurally Nontraditional Bipolar Hosts for RGB Phosphorescent OLEDs: Boosted by a &#8220;Butterfly&#8208;Shaped&#8221; Medium&#8208;Ring Acceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emitting layer based on host&#8208;guest system plays a crucial role in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). While emitters have witnessed rapid progress in structural diversity, hosts still rely heavily on traditional structures and are underdeveloped. Herein, a &#8220;medium&#8208;ring&#8221; strategy has been put forward to design structurally nontraditional host molecules, which is not only rotatable enough to suppress close &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, thus reducing exciton annihilation, but also rigid enough to prevent excessive conformational flipping, thus inhibiting non&#8208;radiative decay. Accordingly, a brand&#8208;new type of bipolar hosts with a twisted &#8220;butterfly&#8208;shaped heptagonal acceptor (  EtBP  ), which features an electron&#8208;deficient benzophenone fragment with a flexible ethylidene bridge, have been developed. With satisfactory morphological stability and well&#8208;balanced hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting property, the  EtBP  &#8208;based bipolar hosts enable high&#8208;performance RGB phosphorescent OLEDs with small efficiency roll&#8208;off, which are superior to those of acyclic benzophenone&#8208;based devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective and Chemodivergent Allenylic Alkylation of Vinyl Azides for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Allenylic Amides and Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first enantioselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;allenylic amides and ketones through allenylic alkylation of vinyl azides is reported. In these chemodivergent reactions, cooperatively catalyzed by a Ir(I)/(phosphoramidite,olefin) complex and Sc(OTf)3, vinyl azides act as the surrogate for both amide enolates and ketone enolates. The desiccant (molecular sieves) plays a crucial role in controlling the chemodivergency of this enantioconvergent and regioselective reaction: Under otherwise identical reaction conditions, the presence of the desiccant led to &#945;&#8208;allenylic amides while its absence resulted in &#945;&#8208;allenylic ketones. Utilizing racemic allenylic alcohols as the alkylating agent, the overall process represents a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT), where both the products are formed with the same absolute configuration. To our knowledge, this is the first example of the use of vinyl azide as the ketone enolate surrogate in an enantioselective transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Sodium&#8208;ion Battery with a Wide Operation&#8208;Temperature Range from &#8722;70 to 100 &#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), as one of the potential candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems, are required to tackle extreme weather conditions.&#160;However, the all&#8208;weather SIBs with a wide operation&#8208;temperature range are rarely reported. Herein, we propose a wide&#8208;temperature SIB, which involves a carbon&#8208;coated Na  4  Fe  3  (PO  4  )  2  P  2  O  7  (NFPP@C) cathode, a Bismuth (Bi) anode, and a diglyme&#8208;based electrolyte.&#160;We demonstrate that solvated Na  +  can be directly stored by the Bi anode via an alloying reaction without the de&#8208;solvent process.&#160;&#160;Furthermore, the NFPP@C cathode exhibits a high Na  +  diffusion coefficient at low temperature.&#160;As a result, the Bi//NFPP@C battery exhibits perfect low&#8208;temperature behavior.&#160;Even at &#8722;70 &#176;C, this battery still delivers 70.19% of the room&#8208;temperature capacity.&#160;Furthermore, benefitting from the high boiling point of the electrolyte, this battery also works well at a high temperature up to 100 &#176;C.&#160;These encourage results might shed light on the exploration of wide&#8208;temperature SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Sulfinates as Source of Alkyl Radicals in the Photo&#8208;Enantiocontrolled &#946;&#8208;Functionalization of Enals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented use of gem&#8208;difluoro sulfinates in visible&#8208;light photocatalysis for the construction of new C&#8722;C bonds in a chiral fashion is presented. This was tackled by rerouting the chemical pathway of alkyl sulfonyl radicals from traditional sulfonylation to alkylation performance. The efficacy of these sulfinates for assisting SO2 extrusion is shown by allowing the installation of CF2&#8208;bearing scaffolds, a modern task in the pharmaceutical arena.







Abstract
The generation of sulfonyl radicals has long been known as a flexible strategy in a wide range of different sulfonylative transformations. Meanwhile their use in alkylation processes has been somehow limited due to their inherent difficulty in evolving to less&#8208;stable radicals after sulfur dioxide extrusion. Herein we report a convenient strategy that involves gem&#8208;difluorinated sulfinates as an &#8220;upgrading&#8208;mask&#8221;, allowing these precursors to decompose into their corresponding alkyl radicals. The electron&#8211;donor character of sulfinates in the formation of an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex with transient iminium ions is displayed, achieving the first example of a stereocontrolled light&#8208;driven insertion of gem&#8208;difluoro derivatives into unsaturated aldehydes. This methodology is compatible with flow conditions, maintaining identical levels of enantiocontrol.

         <title>Chiral 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolium Salt Catalyzed Asymmetric Mono&#8208; and Dialkylation of 2,5&#8208;Diketopiperazines with the Construction of Tetrasubstituted Carbon Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Chiral spirocyclic&#8208;amide&#8208;derived triazolium salts were used as new phase&#8208;transfer organocatalysts for asymmetric alkylation to construct 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine motifs containing one or two tetrasubstituted carbon centers in high yields with excellent cis&#8208;diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. Control experiments and DFT calculations revealed the possible reaction mechanism and the origins of the exceptional diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Novel asymmetric mono&#8208; and dialkylation reactions of &#945;&#8208;substituted 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazines catalyzed by new chiral spirocyclic&#8208;amide&#8208;derived triazolium organocatalysts have been developed, resulting in a range of enantioenriched 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine derivatives containing one or two tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenters. The reactions feature high yields (up to 98%), and excellent cis&#8208;diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr, &gt;99&#8201;% ee), and they provide a new asymmetric synthetic approach to important functionalized 2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine skeletons. Furthermore, a possible reaction mechanism was proposed based on both control experiments and extensive DFT calculations.

         <title>The Assembly and Jamming of Nanoparticle Surfactants at Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The attachment mechanism of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs), which are generated by the interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and polymeric ligands at the interface, is demonstrated. The binding energy of the NPS to the interface can be adjusted, and a size&#8208;dependent assembly of NPSs at the interface can be triggered or suppressed by controlling the packing state of NPSs.







Abstract
Using the interactions between nanoparticles (NPs) and polymeric ligands to generate nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface, the binding energy of the NP to the interface can be significantly increased, irreversibly binding the NPSs to the interface. By designing a simplified NPS model, where the NP size can be precisely controlled and the characteristic fluorescence of the NPs be used as a direct probe of their spatial distribution, we provide new insights into the attachment mechanism of NPSs at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface. We find that the binding energy of NPSs to the interface can be reduced by competitive ligands, resulting in the dissociation and disassembly of NPSs at the interface, and allowing the construction of responsive, reconfigurable all&#8208;liquid systems. Smaller NPSs that are loosely packed (unjammed) and irreversibly bound to the interface can be displaced by larger NPSs, giving rise to a size&#8208;dependent assembly of NPSs at the interface. However, when the smaller size NPSs are densely packed and jam at the interface, the size&#8208;dependent assembly of NPSs at the interface can be completely suppressed.

         <title>Mechanochemical Grignard Reactions with Gaseous CO2 and Sodium Methyl Carbonate**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grignard&#8208;type reactions have been performed in ball mills providing carboxylic acids from organobromides with gaseous CO2 or sodium methyl carbonate (SMC) as C1&#8208;synthon. The transformations are solvent&#8208;free and occur in the presence of LiOH under liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG) conditions with 2&#8197;equivalents of 2&#8208;MeTHF as ethereal additive.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step protocol for the preparation of Grignard reagents from organobromides in a ball mill and their subsequent reactions with gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) or sodium methyl carbonate providing aryl and alkyl carboxylic acids in up to 82&#8201;% yield is reported. Noteworthy are the short reaction times and the significantly reduced solvent amounts [2.0&#8197;equiv. for liquid assisted grinding (LAG) conditions]. Unexpectedly, aryl bromides with methoxy substituents lead to symmetric ketones as major products.

         <title>Insight into Structural Evolution, Active Sites, and Stability of Heterogeneous Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural evolution is crucial to the development of active sites for renewable energy&#8208;conversion technologies involving heterogeneous electrocatalysis. In this Minireview, fundamental concepts related to structural evolution are described. A critical overview of multiple triggers, reversibility and operando characterizations is presented, and the application of structural evolution in important electrocatalytic reactions is presented.







Abstract
Studying structure&#8211;activity correlations of electrocatalysts is essential for improving the conversion of electrical to chemical energy. Recently, increasing evidence obtained by operando characterization techniques reveal that the structural evolution of catalysts caused by the interplay with electric fields, electrolytes and reactants/intermediates brings about the formation of real active sites. Hence, it is time to summarize structural evolution related research advances and envisage future developments. In this Minireview, we first introduce the fundamental concepts associated with structural evolution (e.g., catalysts, active sites/centers and stability/lifetime) and their relevance. Then, the multiple triggers of structural evolution and advanced operando characterizations are discussed. Significantly, a brief overview of structural evolution and its reversibility in heterogeneous electrocatalysis is provided, especially for the representative electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) processes. Lastly, key challenges and opportunities in this exciting field are highlighted.

         <title>Halogen Bonding in Perovskite Solar Cells: A New Tool for Improving Solar Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites hold great potential for next&#8208;generation solar cells. However, their poor stability in air and moisture still hinders their practical implementation. Preliminary data have shown that halogen bonding affords improved crystallization and stability, reduction of the surface trap states, and the possibility of forming ordered structures, paving the way towards the development of highly stable PSCs.







Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites (HOIHPs) have recently emerged as a flourishing area of research. Their easy and low&#8208;cost production and their unique optoelectronic properties make them promising materials for many applications. In particular, HOIHPs hold great potential for next&#8208;generation solar cells. However, their practical implementation is still hindered by their poor stability in air and moisture, which is responsible for their short lifetime. Optimizing the chemical composition of materials and exploiting non&#8208;covalent interactions for interfacial and defects engineering, as well as defect passivation, are efficient routes towards enhancing the overall efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Due to the rich halogen chemistry of HOIHPs, exploiting halogen bonding, in particular, may pave the way towards the development of highly stable PSCs. Improved crystallization and stability, reduction of the surface trap states, and the possibility of forming ordered structures have already been preliminarily demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites hold great potential for next-generation solar cells. However, their poor stability in air and moisture still hinders their practical implementation. Preliminary data have shown that halogen bonding affords improved crystallization and stability, reduction of the surface trap states, and the possibility of forming ordered structures, paving the way towards the development of highly stable PSCs.

         <title>Layered Biomimetic Composites from MXenes with Sequential Bridging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered nanocomposites fabricated by techniques other than layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly (e.g. vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration and blade coating) contain voids in their structure, which reduces their performance. Cheng and co&#8208;workers have now found that the problem of voids in Ti3C2Tx MXene composites can be solved by sequential bridging of MXEne platelets with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose combined with covalent bridging by borate ions.







Abstract
Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) assembly is a widely used technique for the self&#8208;assembly of layered nanocomposites from clay sheets, carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, nanoparticles, and other materials. Other approaches for fabricating layered nanocomposites include vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration and blade coating. They are simpler than LbL assembly, but they all introduce voids into the layered structure, thereby reducing the performance of the resulting nanocomposites. A team from Beihang University evaluated the void structure in Ti3C2Tx MXene composites and found that the fundamental problem with voids can be solved by the sequential nanoscale bonding of MXEne platelets with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose combined with covalent bridging with borate ions, thereby opening a new path to self&#8208;assemble two&#8208;dimensional platelets into continuous high&#8208;performance layered nanocomposites.

         <title>A Metallofullertube of Ce2@C100 with Carbon Nanotube Segment: Synthesis, Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance and Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tubular fullerenes can be considered as end&#8208;capped carbon nanotubes with accurate structure, which are promising nanocarbon materials for advanced single&#8208;molecule electronic devices. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterizations of a metallofullertube Ce  2  @  D  5  (450)&#8208;C  100  , which has a tubular C  100  cage with a carbon nanotube segment and two fullerene end&#8208;caps. As there are structure correlations between tubular Ce  2  @  D  5  (450)&#8208;C  100  and spherical Ce  2  @  I  h  &#8208;C  80  , the structure&#8208;property relationship has been compared for them by means of experimental and theoretical methods. Notably, single&#8208;molecule conductance measurement determined that the conductivity of Ce  2  @  D  5  (450)&#8208;C  100  was up to eight times larger than that of Ce  2  @  I  h  &#8208;C  80  . Furthermore, supramolecular assembly of Ce  2  @  D  5  (450)&#8208;C  100  and [12]CPP nanohoop was investigated, and theoretical calculations revealed that metallofullertube Ce  2  @  D  5  (450)&#8208;C  100  adopted a &#8220;standing&#8221; configuration in the cavity of [12]CPP. These results demonstrate the special nature of this kind of metallofullertube.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;natural protein&#8208;protein communication mediated by a DNA&#8208;based, antibody&#8208;responsive device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here the rational design and optimization of an antibody responsive, DNA&#8208;based device that enables communication between pairs of otherwise non&#8208;interacting proteins. The device is designed to recognize and bind a specific antibody and, in response, undergo a conformational change that leads to the release of a DNA strand, termed the &#8220;translator,&#8221; that regulates the activity of a downstream target protein. As proof of principle, we demonstrate antibody&#8208;induced control of the proteins thrombin and Taq DNA polymerase. The resulting strategy is versatile and, in principle, can be easily adapted to control artificial protein&#8208;protein communication in artificial regulatory networks.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We developed a nickel&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric reductive cyclization/coupling of 1,6&#8208;dienes. The reaction provides an efficient method for constructing a chiral tertiary alcohol and a quaternary stereocenter by a single operation. The method has excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantioselectivity, a broad substrate scope, as well as good tolerance of functional groups. Preliminary mechanism studies show that alkyl nickel(I) species are&#160;involved in the reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The treatment of primary or secondary alkyl iodides with  sBu2Mg in toluene (25&#8208;40 &#176;C, 2&#8208;4 h) provided dialkylmagnesiums that underwent various reactions with aldehydes, ketones, acid chlorides or allylic bromides. 3&#8208;Substituted secondary cyclohexyl iodides led to all&#8208;cis&#8208;3&#8208;cyclohexylmagnesium reagents under these exchange conditions in a highly stereoconvergent manner. Enantiomerically enriched 3&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;substituted secondary alkyl iodides gave after an exchange reaction with  sBu2Mg stereodefined dialkylmagnesiums that after quenching with various electrophiles furnished various 1,3&#8208;stereodefined products including homo&#8208;aldol products (99% dr and 98%  ee  ).

         <title>Engineering the Local Atomic Environments of Indium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical Production of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The in&#8208;depth understanding of local atomic environments&#8208;property relationships on p&#8208;block metal single&#8208;atom catalyst toward 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is rarely reported. Here, guided by first&#8208;principles calculations, we develop a heteroatom&#8208;modified In&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework&#8208;assisted approach to accurately synthesize an optimal catalyst, in which single In atoms are anchored by combined N, S&#8208;dual first coordination and B second coordination supported by the hollow carbon rods (In SAs/NSBC).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The in-depth understanding of local atomic environments-property relationships on p-block metal single-atom catalyst toward 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is rarely reported. Here, guided by first-principles calculations, we develop a heteroatom-modified In-based metal&#8722;organic framework-assisted approach to accurately synthesize an optimal catalyst, in which single In atoms are anchored by combined N, S-dual first coordination and B second coordination supported by the hollow carbon rods (In SAs/NSBC). The In SAs/NSBC exhibits a high H2O2 selectivity of above 95% in a wide range of pH. Furthermore, the In SAs/NSBC-modified natural air diffusion electrode exhibits an unprecedented production rate of 6.49 peroxide gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte and 6.71 mol peroxide gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in 0.1 M PBS electrolyte, respectively.

         <title>Fighting Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Bacteria: Promising Strategies Orchestrated by Molecularly Imprinted Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persistent infections and deaths caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria are a worldwide health issue. Molecularly imprinted polymers that are antibody mimics with selective recognition sites for a target molecule can fight these bacteria on several fronts. The targets range from endotoxins, &#946;&#8208;lactamase and adhesins to biofilm components and quorum sensing messengers.







Abstract
Infections caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria are difficult and sometimes impossible to treat, making them one of the major public health problems of our time. We highlight how one unique material, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), can orchestrate several strategies to fight this serious societal issue. MIPs are tailor&#8208;made biomimetic supramolecular receptors that recognize and bind target molecules with high affinity and selectivity, comparable to those of antibodies. While research on MIPs for combatting cancer has flourished, comprehensive work on their involvement in combatting resistant superbugs has been rather scarce. This review aims at filling this gap. We will describe the causes of bacterial resistance and at which level MIPs can deploy their weapons. MIPs&#8217; targets can be biofilm constituents, quorum sensing messengers, bacterial surface proteins and antibiotic&#8208;deactivating enzymes, among others. We will conclude with the current challenges and future developments in this field.

         <title>Inhibition of ACE2&#8208;Spike interaction by an ACE2 binder suppresses SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 entry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants is a significant concern in developing effective therapeutics and vaccines in the middle of the ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Here, we identified a novel small molecule that inhibited the interactions between SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike RBDs and ACE2 by modulating ACE2 without impairing its enzymatic activity necessary for normal physiological functions. Furthermore, the identified compounds suppressed viral infection in cultured cells by inhibiting the entry of ancestral and variant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Our study suggests that targeting ACE2 could be a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 entry into host cells and prevent the development of COVID&#8208;19.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anode&#8208;free lithium batteries are regarded as an ultimate form of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, irreversible lithium loss during cycling plays a major role in degrading the overall cell performance in the anode&#8208;free configuration. To alleviate the deterioration, building a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interface on an anode current collector is an indispensable requirement. Here, we present a facile in&#8208;situ electrochemical method of a potential hold during the first charge to guide more salt&#8208;derived (less solvent&#8208;derived) decomposition on the anode interface. We show the distinctive decomposition potential of lithium salts and ether/carbonate solvents, where the Li&#8208;solvation structures with salt contact&#8208;ion&#8208;pairs preferentially decompose to form LiF&#8208;rich and less organic components, leading to enhanced lithium Coulombic efficiency in Li||Cu cells as well as mitigating the capacity fade of Cu||LiFePO4 and Cu||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report a series of CuPd catalysts for electrochemical hydrogenation (ECH) of furfural to 2&#8208;methylfuran (MF or FurCH  3  where Fur = furyl) in aqueous 0.1 M acetic acid (pH 2.9). The highest faradaic efficiency (FE) for MF reached 75 % at &#8208;0.58 V  vs  . reversible hydrogen electrode with an average partial current density of 4.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  .  In situ  surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic and kinetic isotopic experiments&#160;suggested that electrogenerated adsorbed hydrogen (H  ads  ) was involved in the reaction and incorporation of Pd enhanced the surface coverage of H  ads  and optimized the adsorption pattern of furfural, leading to a higher FE for MF.&#160;Density functional theory calculations revealed that Pd incorporation reduced the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of FurCH  2  *  to FurCH  3  *  . Our study demonstrates that catalyst surface structure/composition plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity in ECH and provides a new strategy for designing advanced catalysts for ECH of bio&#8208;derived oxygenates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Anisotropic Janus (&#8220;snowman&#8221;) nanoparticles with a single protrusion are currently made via the solvent swelling&#8208;induced method. Here, we demonstrate without the aid of toxic solvents a generally applicable method for the formation of anisotropic polymer nanoparticles directly in water by controlling polymer mobility through tuning its glass transition temperature (T  g  ). Spherical structures formed immediately after the emulsion polymerization transformed into uniform tadpoles (with head diameter ~ 60 nm and tail length ~130 nm) through the protrusion of a single cylindrical tail when cooled to a temperature above the T  g  of the polymer. Cooling the spheres to below the T  g  produced kinetically trapped kettlebell structures that could be freeze&#8208;dried and rehydrated without any structural change. These unique kettlebells could transform into uniform tadpoles by heating above the T  g  , representing a triggered and on&#8208;demand structural reorganization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Class of Rigid&#8208;Flexible Coupling Crystalline Crosslinked Polymers as Vapomechanical Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating mechanically responsive actuators that can efficiently convert external stimuli into mechanical work is of great significance for real&#8208;world applications. Herein, we rationally design a class of rigid&#8208;flexible coupling crystalline crosslinked polymers (CCPs) to fabricate vapomechanically responsive actuators. Interfacial condensation reactions of flexible macromers with rigid monomers afford a series of freestanding CCP membranes. Notably, it is the first example that crosslinked polymers show high crystallinity and porosity. Moreover, CCP membranes exhibit good mechanical properties and interesting vapor&#8208;triggered actuation performance, which is reversible and repeatable. We find that the unusual polymer structures, high vapor sorption, and anisotropic membranes contribute to the directional deformation performance of CCP actuators. The synthesis approach in this work provides new insights into the design and fabrication of smart materials for advanced applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Itaconation of Complex Peptides by Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox catalysis has emerged as a powerful approach for site&#8208;selective peptide functionalization. Herein, we report a highly N&#8208;termini&#8208;specific method to rapidly access itaconated peptide derivatives under mild photoredox conditions. Distinct from conventional methods that rely on residue nucleophilicity, this method proceeds through a highly reactive carbamoyl radical intermediate to achieve excellent selectivity. Itaconated peptides can be further functionalized to access peptide&#8208;protein conjugates.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective peptide functionalization provides a straightforward and cost&#8208;effective access to diversify peptides for biological studies. Among many existing non&#8208;invasive peptide conjugations methodologies, photoredox catalysis has emerged as one of the powerful approaches for site&#8208;specific manipulation on native peptides. Herein, we report a highly N&#8208;termini&#8208;specific method to rapidly access itaconated peptides and their derivatives through a combination of transamination and photoredox conditions. This strategy exploits the facile reactivity of peptidyl&#8208;dihydropyridine in the complex peptide settings, complementing existing approaches for bioconjugations with excellent selectivity under mild conditions. Distinct from conventional methods, this method utilizes the highly reactive carbamoyl radical derived from a peptidyl&#8208;dihydropyridine. In addition, this itaconated peptide can be further functionalized as a Michael acceptor to access the corresponding peptide&#8208;protein conjugate.

         <title>Diammonium Molecular Configuration&#8208;Induced Regulation of Crystal Orientation and Carrier Dynamics for Highly Efficient and Stable 2D/3D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various diammonium spacer cations are used to construct 2D/3D perovskite. The mechanism of molecular configuration&#8208;induced regulation of crystal orientation and carrier dynamics is investigated. 2D/3D perovskite solar cells based on 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) achieve a device efficiency of 22.68&#8201;% and excellent moisture stability, retaining 82&#8201;% of initial efficiency after aging at 50&#177;5&#8201;% relative humidity for 1560&#8197;h.







Abstract
The effects from the molecular configuration of diammonium spacer cations on 2D/3D perovskite properties are still unclear. Here, we investigated systematically the mechanism of molecular configuration&#8208;induced regulation of crystallization kinetic and carrier dynamics by employing various diammonium molecules to construct Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ)&#8208;type 2D/3D perovskites to further facilitating the photovoltaic performance. The minimum average Pb&#8208;I&#8208;Pb angle leads to the smallest octahedral tilting of [PbX6]4&#8722; lattice in optimal diammonium molecule&#8208;incorporated DJ&#8208;type 2D/3D perovskite, which enables suitable binding energy and hydrogen&#8208;bonding between spacer cations and inorganic [PbX6]4&#8722; cages, thus contributing to the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite film with vertical crystal orientation, mitigatory lattice distortion and efficient carrier transportation. As a consequence, a dramatically improved device efficiency of 22.68&#8201;% is achieved with excellent moisture stability.

         <title>A Conjugated Figure&#8208;of&#8208;Eight Oligoparaphenylene Nanohoop with Adaptive Cavities Derived from Cyclooctatetrathiophene Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on strained oligoparaphenylene loops and a flexible cyclooctatetrathiophene moiety, a fully conjugated bis&#8208;macrocycle is efficiently constructed, and possesses rigid and guest&#8208;adaptive cavities. Its peanut&#8208;like 1:2 host&#8211;guest complexes with C60 or C70 have been isolated and characterized, respectively.







Abstract
A fully conjugated figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight nanohoop is presented with facile synthesis. The molecule's lemniscular skeleton features the combination of two strained oligoparaphenylene loops and a flexible cyclooctatetrathiophene core. Its rigid yet guest&#8208;adaptive cavities enable the formation of the peanut&#8208;like 1:2 host&#8211;guest complexes with C60 or C70, which have been confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and characterized in solution. Further computational studies suggest notable geometric variations and non&#8208;covalent interactions of the cavities upon binding with different fullerenes, as well as overall conjugation comparable to cycloparaphenylenes.

         <title>Binding of Natural Peptide Ligands to the Neuropeptide Y5 Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complementary biochemical methods and molecular modeling reveal how NPY and its natural analogues bind to the Y5 GPCR, filling in the gap in the knowledge of the Y multiligand/multireceptor system. This provides the first base for the rational design of selective Y5R ligands with therapeutic potential.







Abstract
The binding mode of natural peptide ligands to the Y5 G protein&#8208;coupled receptor (Y5R), an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity, is largely unknown. Here, we apply complementary biochemical and computational approaches, including scanning of the receptor surface with a genetically encoded crosslinker, Ala&#8208;scanning of the ligand and double&#8208;cycle mutagenesis, to map interactions in the ligand&#8208;receptor interface and build a structural model of the NPY&#8208;Y5R complex guided by the experimental data. In the model, the carboxyl (C)&#8208;terminus of bound NPY is placed close to the extracellular loop (ECL) 3, whereas the characteristic &#945;&#8208;helical segment of the ligand drapes over ECL1 and is tethered towards ECL2 by a hydrophobic cluster. We further show that the other two natural ligands of Y5R, peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) dock to the receptor in a similar pose.

Here, we apply complementary biochemical and computational approaches, including scanning of the receptor surface with a genetically encoded crosslinker, Ala-scanning of the ligand and double-cycle mutagenesis, to map interactions in the ligand-receptor interface and build a structural model of the NPY-Y&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;R complex guided by the experimental data. In the model, the carboxyl (C)-terminus of bound NPY is placed close to the extracellular loop (ECL) 3, whereas the characteristic &#945;-helical segment of the ligand drapes over ECL1 and is tethered towards ECL2 by a hydrophobic cluster. We further show that the other two natural ligands of Y&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;R, peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) dock to the receptor in a similar pose.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Trifluoroethanol as a Unique Additive for the Chemoselective Electrooxidation of Enamines to Access Unsymmetrically Substituted NH&#8208;Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoselective electrooxidative heterocoupling of two different enamines is reported for the synthesis of unsymmetrically substituted NH&#8208;pyrroles. A &#8220;magic effect&#8221; of the additive trifluoroethanol is utilized to achieve the desired chemoselectivity by tuning the oxidation potentials and controlling the activation energy of the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
An electrochemical method for the synthesis of unsymmetrically substituted NH&#8208;pyrroles is described. The synthetic strategy comprises a challenging heterocoupling between two structurally diverse enamines via sequential chemoselective oxidation, addition, and cyclization processes. A series of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted enamines were effectively cross&#8208;coupled from an equimolar mixture to synthesize various unsymmetrical pyrrole derivatives up to 84&#8201;% yield. The desired cross&#8208;coupling was achieved by tuning the oxidation potential of the enamines by utilizing a &#8220;magic effect&#8221; of the additive trifluoroethanol (TFE). Additionally, extensive computational studies reveal the unique role of TFE in promoting the heterocoupling process by regulating the activation energies of the reaction steps through H&#8208;bonding and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. Importantly, the developed electrochemical protocol was found to be equally efficient for the homocoupling of enamines to form symmetric pyrroles up to 92&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Creating Dynamic Nanospaces in Solution by Cationic Cages as Multirole Catalytic Platform for Unconventional C(sp)&#8722;H Activation Beyond Enzyme Mimics</title>

The generation of permeable porous&#8208;cage nanospaces in solution by a highly charged cationic [Pd6(RuL3)8]28+ cage for multirole and multi&#8208;way supramolecular catalysis is reported.







Abstract
Herein we demonstrate that, based on the creation of dynamic nanospaces in solution by highly charged positive coordination cage of [Pd6(RuL3)8]28+, multirole and multi&#8208;way cage&#8208;confined catalysis is accomplishable for versatile functions and anomalous reactivities with the aid of the biomimetic cage effect. The high cationic&#8208;host charges drive partial deprotonation of 24 imidazole&#8208;NHs on cage sphere alike imidazole&#8208;residuals in proteins, generating amphoteric heterogeneity in solution to enforce effective cavity&#8208;basicity against solution&#8208;acidity. Synergistic actions arisen from cage hydrophobicity, host&#8208;guest electrostatic interactions and imidazole&#8208;N coordination facilitate C(sp)&#8722;H activation and carbanionic intermediate stabilization of terminal alkynes to achieve unusual H/D&#8208;exchange and Glaser coupling under acidic conditions, and enable phase transfers of water&#8208;insoluble substrates/products/co&#8208;catalysts to make immiscible&#8208;phase and bi&#8208;phase catalysis feasible, thus providing a useful catalytic protocol to combine merits from homogeneous, heterogeneous, enzymatic and phase transfer catalysis.

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Sensitization of &#946;&#8208;Dicarbonyl Compounds&#8212;Access to Medium&#8208;Sized Rings by De&#8197;Mayo&#8208;Type Ring Expansion</title>

         <dc:description>
A photocatalyzed ring expansion procedure for a two&#8208;carbon homologation of cyclic carbonyl compounds, towards medium&#8208;sized ring systems, is introduced. Key to success is the catalyst fac&#8208;[Ir(CF3&#8208;pmb)3] (ET=73.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), which allows for selective activation of the substoichiometric enol species. The mechanism has been corroborated by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy and enabled a full kinetic analysis of the dynamic kinetic sensitization scenario.







Abstract
Herein, we present a photocatalyzed two&#8208;carbon ring expansion of &#946;&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with unactivated olefins that provides facile access to medium&#8208;sized rings. Selective sensitization of the substoichiometric enol tautomer enables reactivity of substrates incompatible with the classical De&#8197;Mayo reaction conditions. Key to success is the identification of the metal&#8208;based sensitizer fac&#8208;[Ir(CF3&#8208;pmb)3], which can be excited using common near&#8208;visible LEDs, and possesses a high triplet excited state energy of 73.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This exactly falls in the range between the triplet energies of the enol and keto tautomer, thereby enabling a dynamic kinetic sensitization. Demonstrating the applicability of fac&#8208;[Ir(CF3&#8208;pmb)3] as a photocatalyst in organic synthesis for the first time, we describe a two&#8208;step photocycloaddition&#8208;ring&#8208;opening cascade with &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, &#8208;diketones, and &#8208;ketoamides. The mechanism has been corroborated by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, as well as further experimental and computational studies.

We describe Apotracker Red as a single fluorescent activatable probe for robust quantification of cancer cell death in fluorescence&#8208;based assays and in&#8197;vivo using multiphoton intravital imaging in mouse models of breast cancer.







Abstract
The detection and quantification of apoptotic cells is a key process in cancer research, particularly during the screening of anticancer therapeutics and in mechanistic studies using preclinical models. Intravital optical imaging enables high&#8208;resolution visualisation of cellular events in live organisms; however, there are few fluorescent probes that can reliably provide functional readouts in&#8197;situ without interference from tissue autofluorescence. We report the design and optimisation of the fluorogenic probe Apotracker Red for real&#8208;time detection of cancer cell death. The strong fluorogenic behaviour, high selectivity, and excellent stability of Apotracker Red make it a reliable optical reporter for the characterisation of the effects of anticancer drugs in cells in&#8197;vitro and for direct imaging of chemotherapy&#8208;induced apoptosis in&#8197;vivo in mouse models of breast cancer.

A short and flexible total synthesis of antifungal and antiparasitic sphingofungins&#8197;A&#8211;D and congeners was developed by combining a versatile decarboxylative coupling reaction and a cross metathesis protocol.







Abstract
Sphingofungins are fungal natural products known to inhibit the biosynthesis of sphingolipids which play pivotal roles in various cell functions. Here, we report a short and flexible synthetic approach towards the sphingofungin family. Key step of the synthesis was a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction of chiral sulfinyl imines with a functionalized tartaric acid derivative, which yielded the core motif of sphingofungins carrying four consecutive stereocenters and a terminal double bond. Subsequent metathesis reaction allowed for the introduction of different side chains of choice resulting in a total of eight sphingofungins, including for the first time sphingofungin&#8197;C (eight steps from commercially available protected tartaric acid with an overall yield of 6&#8201;%) and sphingofungin&#8197;A (ten steps). All newly synthesized derivatives were tested for their antifungal, cell&#8208;proliferative and antiparasitic activity unraveling their structure&#8211;activity relations.

         <title>Bimetallic Copper/Ruthenium/Osmium Complexes: Observation of Conformational Differences Between the Solution Phase and Solid State by Atomic Pair Distribution Function Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solution phase structure of five bimetallic CuI/RuII/OsII complexes was revealed by high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray scattering and pair distribution function analysis (HEXS/PDF). Assisted by computational simulation, conformational differences of the complexes in the solution and solid states were identified with sub&#8208;&#197;ngstr&#246;m resolution.







Abstract
High&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray scattering and pair distribution function analysis (HEXS/PDF) is a powerful method to reveal the structure of materials lacking long&#8208;range order, but is underutilized for molecular complexes in solution. We demonstrate the application of HEXS/PDF with 0.26&#8197;&#197; resolution to uncover the solution structure of five bimetallic CuI/RuII/OsII complexes. HEXS/PDF of each complex in acetonitrile solution confirms the pairwise distances in the local coordination sphere of each metal center as well as the metal&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;metal distances separated by over 12&#8197;&#197;. The metal&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;metal distance detected in solution is compared with that from the crystal structure and molecular models to confirm that distortions to the metal bridging ligand are unique to the solid state. This work presents the first example of observing sub&#8208;&#197;ngstr&#246;m conformational differences by direct comparison of solution phase and solid&#8208;state structures and shows the potential for HEXS/PDF in the determination of solution structure of single molecules.

         <title>Stable Isotope Phosphate Labelling of Diverse Metabolites is Enabled by a Family of 18O&#8208;Phosphoramidites**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of 18O2&#8208;phosphoramidites facilitates synthetic access on gram&#8208;scale to various isotopically pure 18O&#8208;labelled phosphate products, like nucleotides, inositol phosphates, polyphosphates, and DNA. The utility of these 18O&#8208;natural products is underlined in the assignment of various metabolites from biological matrices using capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionisation triple quadrupole mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Stable isotope labelling is state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in quantitative mass spectrometry, yet often accessing the required standards is cumbersome and very expensive. Here, a unifying synthetic concept for 18O&#8208;labelled phosphates is presented, based on a family of modified 18O2&#8208;phosphoramidite reagents. This toolbox offers access to major classes of biologically highly relevant phosphorylated metabolites as their isotopologues including nucleotides, inositol phosphates, &#8208;pyrophosphates, and inorganic polyphosphates. 18O&#8208;enrichment ratios &gt;95&#8201;% and good yields are obtained consistently in gram&#8208;scale reactions, while enabling late&#8208;stage labelling. We demonstrate the utility of the 18O&#8208;labelled inositol phosphates and pyrophosphates by assignment of these metabolites from different biological matrices. We demonstrate that phosphate neutral loss is negligible in an analytical setup employing capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionisation triple quadrupole mass spectrometry.

         <title>Directed Evolution of Artificial Metalloenzymes in Whole Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Whole&#8208;cell E. coli platform enables directed evolution campaigns with ArMs containing an abiotic Ir&#8208;porphyrin cofactor involving the generation of more than 4000 mutants to develop an enantioselective insertion of a simple acyclic carbene from a diazo ester into the N&#8722;H bond of N&#8208;methyl aniline that has formed product with poor enantioselectivity when catalyzed by prior enzyme systems.







Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs), created by introducing synthetic cofactors into protein scaffolds, are an emerging class of catalyst for non&#8208;natural reactions. Although many classes of ArMs are known, in vitro reconstitution of cofactors and proteins has been a limiting step in the high&#8208;throughput screening and directed evolution of ArMs because purification of individual host proteins is time&#8208;consuming. We describe the application of a platform to combine mutants of the P450 enzyme CYP119 and the cofactor Ir(Me)MPIX in vivo, by coexpression of the CYP119 mutants with the heme transporter encoded by the hug operon, to the directed evolution of ArMs containing Ir(Me)MPIX in whole cells. We applied this platform to the development an ArMs catalyzing the insertion of the acyclic carbene from &#945;&#8208;diazopropanoate esters (Me&#8208;EDA) into the N&#8722;H bonds of N&#8208;alkyl anilines, a combination of carbene and amine classes for which mutant enzymes of natural hemoproteins previously reacted with low enantioselectivity. The mutants of the artificial metalloenzyme Ir(Me)CYP119 identified by an evolution campaign involving more than 4000 mutants are shown to catalyze the reaction of Me&#8208;EDA with N&#8208;methyl anilines to form chiral chiral amino esters with high TON and good enantioselectivity, thereby demonstrating that the directed evolution of ArMs can rival that of natural enzymes in vivo.

         <title>Abiotic Formation of an Amide Bond via Surface&#8208;Supported Direct Carboxyl&#8211;Amine Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined scanning tunneling microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies provide evidence for thermally activated abiotic formation of amide bonds between adsorbed precursors through direct carboxyl&#8211;amine coupling under ultrahigh&#8208;vacuum conditions by means of on&#8208;surface synthesis.







Abstract
Amide bond formation is one of the most important reactions in biochemistry, notably being of crucial importance for the origin of life. Herein, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies to provide evidence for thermally activated abiotic formation of amide bonds between adsorbed precursors through direct carboxyl&#8211;amine coupling under ultrahigh&#8208;vacuum conditions by means of on&#8208;surface synthesis. Complementary insights from temperature&#8208;programmed desorption measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal the competition between cross&#8208;coupling amide formation and decarboxylation reactions on the Au(111) surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate the critical influence of the employed metal support: whereas on Au(111) the coupling readily occurs, different reaction scenarios prevail on Ag(111) and Cu(111). The systematic experiments signal that archetypical bio&#8208;related molecules can be abiotically synthesized in clean environments without water or oxygen.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Neutral Homocyclic Silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The neutral homocyclic silylene 2 was obtained from a bicyclic silicon(I) amide J. This reaction proceeds via the anionic homoaromatic ring compound 1. The two&#8208;coordinate Si&#8208;atom in 1 is stabilized via a 3&#8208;center 2&#8208;electron &#960;&#8208;bond and that in 2 via an allyl&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. Compound 2 undergoes cycloadditions with alkenes and alkynes and oxidative addition with methanol. The reaction with ethylene yields a tricyclic ring species.







Abstract
Isolation of the neutral homocyclic silylene 2 is possible via amine ligand abstraction with potassium graphite (KC8) and subsequent reaction with SiMe3Cl from a bicyclic silicon(I) amide J. This reaction proceeds via an anionic homoaromatic silicon ring compound 1 as an intermediate. The twofold&#8208;coordinated silicon atom in the homocyclic silylene 2 is stabilized by an allyl&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. 2 reacts in an oxidative addition with two equivalents of MeOH and in cycloadditions with ethene, phenylacetylene, diphenylacetylene and with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene to afford novel functionalized ring compounds.

         <title>From Impossible to Possible: Atom&#8208;Economic Polymerization of Low Strain Five&#8208;Membered Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;economic polymerization of five&#8208;membered propylene carbonate (PC) for preparation of polyester and polycarbonate simultaneously is reported. The key premise of our strategy is the careful elaboration of the mechanism of direct ring&#8208;opening polymerization of PC, which emphasizes the importance of the in situ released propylene oxide.







Abstract
The direct ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of propylene carbonate (PC) only affords oligomers with substantial unidentified by&#8208;products, which hinders the efficient utilization of PC. Through detailed studies, for the first time, a careful mechanism involving the in situ release of propylene oxide (PO) from PC decarboxylation is proposed. Further, we report a novel strategy of copolymerization of PC/cyclic anhydrides via in situ capture of the formed intermediates. Results show that PC is successfully transformed into polyesters. Especially for the ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization (ROAC) of PC/phthalic anhydride (PA), a variety of advantages are manifold: i) slow&#8208;release of PO ensuring a perfectly alternating structure; ii) quantitative and fast transformation of PC; iii) visualization of polymerization process by a CO2 pressure gauge. Of importance, through tandem polymerizations, PC is fully transformed into polyesters and polycarbonates concurrently, thus achieving PC utilization with a high atom&#8208;economy.

         <title>Linear Extension of Anthracene via B&#8592;N Lewis Pair Formation: Effects on Optoelectronic Properties and Singlet O2 Sensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linearly B&#8592;N Lewis pair extended anthracenes are prepared by highly regioselective N&#8208;directed electrophilic borylation. Their LUMOs are higher in energy and their HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps are significantly larger compared to those of the respective laterally functionalized species. Photooxygenation studies reveal effective singlet oxygen sensitization with a largely reduced tendency for self&#8208;sensitized endoperoxide formation.







Abstract
The functionalization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) via B&#8592;N Lewis pair formation offers an opportunity to judiciously fine&#8208;tune the structural features and optoelectronic properties, to suit the demands of applications in organic electronic devices, bioimaging, and as sensitizers for singlet oxygen generation. We demonstrate that the N&#8208;directed electrophilic borylation of 2,6&#8208;di(pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;yl)anthracene offers access to linearly extended acene derivatives Py&#8208;BR (R=Et, Ph, C6F5). In comparison to indeno&#8208;fused 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene, the formal &#8220;BN for CC&#8221; replacement in Py&#8208;BR selectively lowers the LUMO, resulting in a much reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. An even more extended conjugated system with seven six&#8208;membered rings in a row (Qu&#8208;BEt) is obtained by borylation of 2,6&#8208;di(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)anthracene. Fluorinated Py&#8208;BPf shows particularly advantageous properties, including relatively lower&#8208;lying HOMO and LUMO levels, strong yellow&#8208;green fluorescence, and effective singlet oxygen sensitization, while resisting self&#8208;sensitized conversion to its endoperoxide.

         <title>Controlling Oxidative Addition and Reductive Elimination at Tin(I) via Hemi&#8208;Lability</title>

         <dc:description>
A distannyne supported by a pincer ligand featuring pendant CH2NiPr2 arms is capable of reversibly activating E&#8722;H bonds at one or both of the tin centres through dissociation of the hemi&#8208;labile N&#8211;Sn donor/acceptor interactions. This chemistry can be exploited to sequentially (and reversibly) assemble mixed&#8208;valence chains of tin atoms of the type ArSn{Sn(Ar)H}nSnAr (n=1,2).







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of a distannyne supported by a pincer ligand bearing pendant amine donors that is capable of reversibly activating E&#8208;H bonds at one or both of the tin centres through dissociation of the hemi&#8208;labile N&#8208;Sn donor/acceptor interactions. This chemistry can be exploited to sequentially (and reversibly) assemble mixed&#8208;valence chains of tin atoms of the type ArSn{Sn(Ar)H}nSnAr (n=1, 2). The experimentally observed (decreasing) propensity towards chain growth with increasing chain length can be rationalized both thermodynamically and kinetically by the electron&#8208; withdrawing properties of the &#8208;Sn(Ar)H&#8208; backbone units generated via oxidative addition.

         <title>Janus Photonic Microspheres with Bridged Lamellar Structures via Droplet&#8208;Confined Block Copolymer Co&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new complex photonic structure, bridged lamellae, with intriguing color reflections is successfully fabricated through well&#8208;controlled co&#8208;assembly of lipophilic and amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers within shrinking droplets. Self&#8208;assembled Janus microspheres with precisely tunable dual light reflections are facilely obtained through the manipulation of the co&#8208;assembly at a molecular level.







Abstract
Artificial self&#8208;assembly systems typically exhibit limited capability in creating nature&#8208;inspired complex materials with advanced functionalities. Here, an effective co&#8208;assembly strategy is demonstrated for the facile creation of complex photonic structures with intriguing light reflections. Two different lipophilic and amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (BCPs) are placed within shrinking droplets to enable a cooperative working mechanism of microphase segregation and organized spontaneous emulsification, respectively. Layer assemblies of the lipophilic BCP and uniform water nanodroplets stabilized by the bottlebrush surfactant are both generated, and co&#8208;assembled into a bridged lamellar structure with the alternating arrangement of layers and closely packed nanodroplet arrays. Janus microspheres with diverse dual optical characteristics are successfully fabricated, and reflected wavelengths of light are highly tunable simply by changing the formulation or molecular weight of BCP.

&lt;p&gt;A new complex photonic structure, bridged lamellae, with intriguing color reflections is successfully fabricated through well-controlled co-assembly of lipophilic and amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers within shrinking droplets. Self-assembled Janus microspheres with precisely tunable dual light reflections are facilely obtained through the manipulation of the co-assembly at a molecular level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial self-assembly systems typically exhibit limited capability in creating nature-inspired complex materials with advanced functionalities. Here, an effective co-assembly strategy is demonstrated for the facile creation of complex photonic structures with intriguing light reflections. Two different lipophilic and amphiphilic bottlebrush block copolymers (BCPs) are placed within shrinking droplets to enable a cooperative working mechanism of microphase segregation and organized spontaneous emulsification, respectively. Layer assemblies of the lipophilic BCP and uniform water nanodroplets stabilized by the bottlebrush surfactant are both generated, and co-assembled into a bridged lamellar structure with the alternating arrangement of layers and closely packed nanodroplet arrays. Janus microspheres with diverse dual optical characteristics are successfully fabricated, and reflected wavelengths of light are highly tunable simply by changing the formulation or molecular weight of BCP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tunable Amine&#8208;Reactive Electrophiles for Selective Profiling of Lysine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable and hydrolytically stable electrophiles are reported for the chemo&#8208;selective labeling of lysine with mass sensitive probes. These tunable amine&#8208;reactive electrophiles (TAREs) were used to label proteins in various subcellular compartments inside cells and for global identification of lysine in the human proteome.







Abstract
Proteome profiling by activated esters identified &gt;9000 ligandable lysines but they are limited as covalent inhibitors due to poor hydrolytic stability. Here we report our efforts to design and discover a new series of tunable amine&#8208;reactive electrophiles (TAREs) for selective and robust labeling of lysine. The major challenges in developing selective probes for lysine are the high nucleophilicity of cysteines and poor hydrolytic stability. Our work circumvents these challenges by a unique design of the TAREs that form stable adducts with lysine and on reaction with cysteine generate another reactive electrophiles for lysine. We highlight that TAREs exhibit substantially high hydrolytic stability as compared to the activated esters and are non&#8208;cytotoxic thus have the potential to act as covalent ligands. We applied these alternative TAREs for the intracellular labeling of proteins in different cell lines, and for the selective identification of lysines in the human proteome on a global scale.

         <title>Generation of Oxyphosphonium Ions by Photoredox/Cobaloxime Catalysis for Scalable Amide and Peptide Synthesis in Batch and Continuous&#8208;Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic method for the synthesis of amides and peptides is reported. Synergistic cooperation between a cobaloxime and a photoredox catalyst removes the elements of H2O through the use of PPh3 as a gentle organic reductant. The deoxygenative method is compatible with gram&#8208;scale peptide synthesis and applicable to peptide fragment condensation and SPPS, which may find applications in both organic synthesis and pharmaceutical production.







Abstract
Phosphine&#8208;mediated deoxygenative nucleophilic substitutions, such as the Mitsunobu reaction, are of great importance in organic synthesis. However, the conventional protocols require stoichiometric oxidants to trigger the formation of the oxyphosphonium intermediates for the subsequent nucleophilic additions. Through dual catalysis of photoredox and cobaloxime, we realized a radical strategy for the catalytic formation of acyloxyphosphonium ions that enables direct amidation. The deoxygenative protocol exhibits a broad scope and has been used in the late&#8208;stage amidation of drug molecules. In addition to batch reactions, a continuous&#8208;flow reactor was developed, enabling rapid peptide synthesis on gram scale. The successful assembly of a tetrapeptide on the solid support further demonstrated the versatility of this photocatalytic system. Moreover, experimental and computational studies are consistent with the hypothesis of acyloxyphosphonium ions being formed as the key intermediates.

         <title>Imparting CO2 Electroreduction Auxiliary for Integrated Morphology Tuning and Performance Boosting in a Porphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>

A kind of functionalizing exfoliation agent has been selected to simultaneously modify and exfoliate bulk COFs into functional nanosheets and the obtained materials can be applied in highly selective CO2 electroreduction into CH4.







Abstract
Strategies that enable simultaneous morphology&#8208;tuning and electroreduction performance boosting are much desired for the exploration of covalent organic frameworks in efficient CO2 electroreduction. Herein, a kind of functionalizing exfoliation agent has been selected to simultaneously modify and exfoliate bulk COFs into functional nanosheets and investigate their CO2 electroreduction performance. The obtained nanosheets (Cu&#8722;Tph&#8722;COF&#8722;Dct) with large&#8208;scale (&#8776;1.0&#8197;&#956;m) and ultrathin (&#8776;3.8&#8197;nm) morphology enable a superior FECH4 (&#8776;80&#8201;%) (almost doubly enhanced than bare COF) with large current&#8208;density (&#8722;220.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V. The boosted performance can be ascribed to the immobilized functionalizing exfoliation agent (Dct groups) with integrated amino and triazine groups that strengthen CO2 absorption/activation, stabilize intermediates and enrich the CO concentration around the Cu active sites as revealed by DFT calculations. The point&#8208;to&#8208;point functionalization strategy for modularly assembling Dct&#8208;functionalized COF catalyst for CO2 electroreduction will open up the attractive possibility of developing COFs as efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts.

         <dc:description>
A metallacycle&#8208;based supramolecular photosensitizer (1&#8835;2) for in vivo image&#8208;guided photodynamic inactivation of bacteria is reported. Through host&#8208;guest interaction, the assembly 1&#8835;2, with improved fluorescence signals and ROS production capabilities, is employed for in vivo fluorescence tracking as well as accurate image&#8208;guided treatment of S. aureus infection without noticeable side effects.







Abstract
Bacterial infection is one of the greatest threats to public health. In vivo real&#8208;time monitoring and effective treatment of infected sites through non&#8208;invasive techniques, remain a challenge. Herein, we designed a PtII metallacycle&#8208;based supramolecular photosensitizer through the host&#8208;guest interaction between a pillar[5]arene&#8208;modified metallacycle and 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;[4&#8208;(diphenylamino)styryl]pyridinium. Leveraging the aggregation&#8208;induced emission supramolecular photosensitizer, we improved fluorescence performance and antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation. In vivo studies revealed that it displayed precise fluorescence tracking of S. aureus&#8208;infected sites, and in situ performed image&#8208;guided efficient PDI of S. aureus without noticeable side effects. These results demonstrated that metallacycle combined with host&#8208;guest chemistry could provide a paradigm for the development of powerful photosensitizers for biomedicine.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot&#8208;electron transfer at Au&#8211;graphene interfaces has been investigated in&#8197;situ with atomic layer accuracy, and it is shown that hot electrons can be injected from plasmonic Au nanoparticles to graphene and penetrate up to four layers of graphene.







Abstract
Plasmonic metals under photoexcitation can generate energetic hot electrons to directly induce chemical reactions. However, the capability and fundamental insights of the transportation of these hot electrons at plasmonic metal&#8208;2D material interfaces remain unclear. Herein, hot&#8208;electron transfer at Au&#8208;graphene interfaces has been in situ studied using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with atomic layer accuracy. Combining in situ SERS studies with density functional theory calculations, it is proved that hot electrons can be injected from plasmonic Au nanoparticles to graphene and directly penetrate graphene to trigger photocatalytic reactions. With increasing graphene layers, the transportation of hot electrons decays rapidly and would be completely blocked after five layers of graphene. Moreover, the transfer of hot electrons can be modulated by applying an external electric field, and the hot&#8208;electron transfer efficiency under electrochemical conditions is improved by over three times in the presence of a monolayer of graphene.

         <title>Enhanced Reactivity of Accessible Protons in Sodalite Cages of Faujasite Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Faujasite (FAU) zeolites (with Si/Al ratio of ca. 1.7) undergo mild dealumination at moderate ion exchange conditions (0.01 to 0.6&#8197;M of NH4NO3 solutions) resulting in protons circumscribed by sodalite cages becoming accessible for reaction. The ratio of protons in sodalite cages (HSOD) to supercages (HSUP) can be manipulated by adjusting ammonium concentrations used in ion exchange.







Abstract
Faujasite (FAU) zeolites (with Si/Al ratio of ca. 1.7) undergo mild dealumination at moderate ion exchange conditions (0.01 to 0.6&#8197;M of NH4NO3 solutions) resulting in protons circumscribed by sodalite cages becoming accessible for reaction without conspicuous changes to bulk crystallinity. The ratio of protons in sodalite cages (HSOD) to supercages (HSUP) can be systematically manipulated from 0 to ca. 1 by adjusting ammonium concentrations used in ion exchange. The fraction of accessible protons in the sodalite cages is assessed by virtue of infrared spectra for H&#8208;D exchange of deuterated propane based on the band area ratio of OD2620/OD2680 (ODSOD/ODSUP). Protons in sodalite cages (HSOD) show higher rate constants of propane dehydrogenation (kD) and cracking (kC) than protons in supercages (HSUP) plausibly due to confinement effects being more prominent in smaller voids. Rate constants of dehydrogenation and cracking including kD/kC ratios are also augmented as the fraction of accessible protons in the sodalite cages is enhanced. These effects of accessibility and reactivity of protons in sodalite cages hitherto inconspicuous are revealed herein via methods that systematically increase accessibility of cations located in sodalite cages.

         <title>Biasing the Hierarchy Motifs of Nanotoroids: from 1D Nanotubes to 2D Porous Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The steric demand exerted by the peripheral side chains of the reported azobenzene dyads impedes their hierarchical self&#8208;assembly from nanotoroids into nanotubes. In contrast, they organize into 2D porous networks on substrate upon solution processing. Photoisomerization of azobenzene moieties allows efficient dissociation/reorganization of nanotoroids in solution, demonstrating their potential as photoresponsive 2D porous nanosheets.







Abstract
Hierarchical organization of self&#8208;assembled structures into superstructures is omnipresent in Nature but has been rarely achieved in synthetic molecular assembly due to the absence of clear structural rules. We herein report on the self&#8208;assembly of scissor&#8208;shaped azobenzene dyads which form discrete nanotoroids that further organize into 2D porous networks. The steric demand of the peripheral aliphatic units diminishes the trend of the azobenzene dyad to constitute stackable nanotoroids in solution, thus affording isolated (unstackable) nanotoroids upon cooling. Upon drying, these nanotoroids organize at graphite surface to form well&#8208;defined 2D porous networks. The photoirradiation with UV and visible light enabled reversible dissociation and reconstruction of nanotoroids through the efficient trans&#8596;cis isomerization of azobenzene moieties in solution.

         <title>A Nanographene&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework as a Stable and Efficient Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks form 2D ABC stacking sp2 carbon lattices with robust olefin linkage. The resulting 2D unique structure exhibits high photoconductivity, charge&#8208;carrier mobility and photocatalytic activity in hydroxylation attributed to the narrow&#8208;energy&#8208;gap nanographene cores as active sites.







Abstract
Synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with desirable organic units furnishes advanced materials with unique functionalities. As an emerging class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs, sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated COFs provide a facile platform to build highly stable and crystalline porous polymers. Herein, a 2D olefin&#8208;linked COF was prepared by employing nanographene, namely, dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene (DBOV), as a building block. The DBOV&#8208;COF exhibits unique ABC&#8208;stacked lattices, enhanced stability, and charge&#8208;carrier mobility of &#8776;0.6&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 inferred from ultrafast terahertz photoconductivity measurements. The ABC&#8208;stacking structure was revealed by the high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. DBOV&#8208;COF demonstrated remarkable photocatalytic activity in hydroxylation, which was attributed to the exposure of narrow&#8208;energy&#8208;gap DBOV cores in the COF pores, in conjunction with efficient charge transport following light absorption.

         <title>Local Environment Determined Reactant Adsorption Configuration for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Acetone Hydrogenation to Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For acetone to propane electrohydrogenation, we unveiled how the local environmental pH determines the adsorption configuration of acetone, and further, the efficiency of the catalytic process. Moreover, it is shown that the reaction efficiency of the reaction can be improved by simply adjusting local pH instead of complex catalyst engineering.







Abstract
We demonstrate a widely applicable method to alter the adsorption configuration of multi&#8208;carbon containing reactants by no catalyst engineering but simply adjusting the local reaction environment of the catalyst surface. Using electrocatalytic acetone to propane hydrogenation (APH) as a model reaction and common commercial Pt/Pt&#8208;based materials as catalysts, we found local H+ concentration can significantly influence the adsorption mode of acetone reactant, for example, in vertical or flat mode, and target product selectivity. Electrocatalytic measurement combined with in situ spectroscopic characterizations reveals that the vertically adsorbed acetone is favorable for propane production while the flatly adsorbed mode suppresses the reaction. DFT calculations indicate that the H coverage on catalyst surface plays a decisive role in the adsorption configuration of acetone. The increased local acidity can facilitate the adsorption configuration of acetone from flat to vertical mode and suppress the competing hydrogen evaluation reaction, which consequently enhances the APH selectivity.

         <title>Photophysics of Perylene Diimide Dianions and Their Application in Photoredox Catalysis</title>

The two&#8208;electron reduced, luminescent forms of perylene diimides can be employed for thermodynamically challenging photoredox reactions in aqueous and in organic solution.







Abstract
The two&#8208;electron reduced forms of perylene diimides (PDIs) are luminescent closed&#8208;shell species whose photochemical properties seem underexplored. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study demonstrates that straightforward (single) excitation of PDI dianions with green photons provides an excited state that is similarly or more reducing than the much shorter&#8208;lived excited states of PDI radical monoanions, which are typically accessible after biphotonic excitation with blue photons. Thermodynamically demanding photocatalytic reductive dehalogenations and reductive C&#8722;O bond cleavage reactions of lignin model compounds have been performed using sodium dithionite acts as a reductant, either in aqueous solution or in biphasic water&#8211;acetonitrile mixtures in the presence of a phase transfer reagent. Our work illustrates the concept of multi&#8208;electron reduction of a photocatalyst by a sacrificial reagent prior to irradiation with low&#8208;energy photons as a means of generating very reactive excited states.

         <title>Unexpectedly High Capacitance of the Metal Nanoparticle/Water Interface: Molecular&#8208;Level Insights into the Electrical Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry revealed an anomalously high capacitance for Pt nanoparticles and to a lower extent for Au nanoparticles at potentials more negative than their potential of zero charge. MD calculations showed that the strong interaction of metal with water molecules leads to water chemisorption and accumulation of ions in the Helmholtz layer beyond expectation, resulting in a higher interface charge storage ability.







Abstract
The electrical double&#8208;layer plays a key role in important interfacial electrochemical processes from catalysis to energy storage and corrosion. Therefore, understanding its structure is crucial for the progress of sustainable technologies. We extract new physico&#8208;chemical information on the capacitance and structure of the electrical double&#8208;layer of platinum and gold nanoparticles at the molecular level, employing single nanoparticle electrochemistry. The charge storage ability of the solid/liquid interface is larger by one order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude than predicted by the traditional mean&#8208;field models of the double&#8208;layer such as the Gouy&#8211;Chapman&#8211;Stern model. Performing molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the possible relationship between the measured high capacitance and adsorption strength of the water adlayer formed at the metal surface. These insights may launch the active tuning of solid&#8211;solvent and solvent&#8211;solvent interactions as an innovative design strategy to transform energy technologies towards superior performance and sustainability.

         <title>Green&#8208;Chemistry&#8208;Inspired Synthesis of Cyclobutane&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Selective Materials for Highly Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>

A molecularly engineered cyclobutane&#8208;based hole&#8208;transporting material synthesised using simple and green&#8208;chemistry&#8208;inspired protocols achieves an impressive efficiency of 21&#8201;% in perovskite solar cells and over 19&#8201;% in perovskite solar module with an active area of 30.24&#8197;cm2.







Abstract
Hybrid lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as potential competitors to silicon&#8208;based solar cells with an unprecedented increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE), nearing the breakthrough point toward commercialization. However, for hole&#8208;transporting materials, it is generally acknowledged that complex structures often create issues such as increased costs and hazardous substances in the synthetic schemes, when translated from the laboratory to manufacture on a large scale. Here, we present cyclobutane&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective materials synthesized using simple and green&#8208;chemistry inspired protocols in order to reduce costs and adverse environmental impact. A series of novel semiconductors with molecularly engineered side arms were successfully applied in perovskite solar cells. V1366&#8208;based PSCs feature impressive efficiency of 21&#8201;%, along with long&#8208;term operational stability under atmospheric environment. Most importantly, we also fabricated perovskite solar modules exhibiting a record efficiency over 19&#8201;% with an active area of 30.24&#8197;cm2.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Independent Molecular Weight Determination of Polymers Based on a Truly Universal Calibration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal calibration curve for molecular weight determination is presented. Diffusion coefficients of poly(styrene) and poly(ethylene glycol) standards are measured via diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy. These diffusion/molecular weight relationships are calibrated to be solvent&#8208;independent. This universal calibration creates a novel platform wherein molecular weights of unknown polymers can be found using the universal calibration curve independent of what solvent is used.







Abstract
Diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) allows for accurate molecular weight calibration and determination that can be corrected for solvent influences. Polystyrene and poly(ethylene glycol) standards have been used to calibrate DOSY diffusion data for a variety of solvents, showing a high correlation of data when the bulk viscosity of the solvent is accounted for following the Stokes&#8211;Einstein equation. In this way, a type of universal calibration is introduced that allows for determinations of average molecular weight that are at least as accurate as those of traditional size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (SEC), if not better. Further, we demonstrate that DOSY calibrations can be used between laboratories, hence removing the need for individual calibration of setups as currently done.

         <title>Control over Multiple Nano&#8208; and Secondary Structures in Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

We describe the nanostructural and conformational versatility of the biologically active peptide PEP&#8208;1, which self&#8208;assembles into up to six different aggregate morphologies and forms up to four different secondary structures in a controlled manner depending on pH, concentration, and temperature.







Abstract
Herein, we report the rich morphological and conformational versatility of a biologically active peptide (PEP&#8208;1), which follows diverse self&#8208;assembly pathways to form up to six distinct nanostructures and up to four different secondary structures through subtle modulation in pH, concentration and temperature. PEP&#8208;1 forms twisted &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structures and nanofibers at pH&#8197;7.4, which transform into fractal&#8208;like structures with strong &#946;&#8208;sheet conformations at pH&#8197;13.0 or short disorganized elliptical aggregates at pH&#8197;5.5. Upon dilution at pH&#8197;7.4, the nanofibers with twisted &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structural elements convert into nanoparticles with random coil conformations. Interestingly, these two self&#8208;assembled states at pH&#8197;7.4 and room temperature are kinetically controlled and undergo a further transformation into thermodynamically stable states upon thermal annealing: whereas the twisted &#946;&#8208;sheet structures and corresponding nanofibers transform into 2D sheets with well&#8208;defined &#946;&#8208;sheet domains, the nanoparticles with random coil structures convert into short nanorods with &#945;&#8208;helix conformations. Notably, PEP&#8208;1 also showed high biocompatibility, low hemolytic activity and marked antibacterial activity, rendering our system a promising candidate for multiple bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>Zinc Containing Small&#8208;Pore Zeolites for Capture of Low Concentration Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low concentration CO2 is adsorbed in zinc containing CHA&#8208;type zeolites with a high capacity of 0.67&#8197;mmol CO2/g&#8208;zeolite. The materials exhibit higher CO2 capacity, faster kinetics, lower desorption energy than low&#8208;silica 13X zeolites. Zeolite framework and the states and locations of zinc ions play crucial roles in the adsorption performance.







Abstract
The capture of low concentration CO2 presents numerous challenges. Here, we report that zinc containing chabazite (CHA) zeolites can realize high capacity, fast adsorption kinetics, and low desorption energy when capturing ca. 400&#8197;ppm CO2. Control of the state and location of the zinc ions in the CHA cage is critical to the performance. Zn2+ loaded onto paired anionic sites in the six&#8208;membered rings (6MRs) in the CHA cage are the primary sites to adsorb ca. 0.51&#8197;mmol CO2/g&#8208;zeolite with Si/Al=ca. 7, a 17&#8208;fold increase compared to the parent H&#8208;form. The capacity is increased further to ca. 0.67&#8197;mmol CO2/g&#8208;zeolite with Si/Al=ca. 2 due to more paired sites for zinc exchange. Zeolites with double six&#8208;membered rings (D6MRs) that orient 6MRs into the cages give enhanced uptakes for CO2 adsorption with zinc exchange. The results reveal that zinc exchanged CHA and several other small pore, cage containing zeolites merit further investigation for the capture of low concentration CO2.

         <title>Molecular Transition Metal Oxide Electrocatalysts for the Reversible Carbon Dioxide&#8211;Carbon Monoxide Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthesis of trimetallo&#8208;substituted polyanions enables the preparation of designer catalysts. Here this approach was used to prepare electrocatalysts for the selective reduction of CO2 to CO using a tri&#8208;copper&#8208;substituted polyanion. In contrast, Fe&#8211;Ni&#8208;substituted polyanions preferably catalyzed the oxidation of CO to CO2, showing a reactivity profile reminiscent of the reactivity of Fe&#8211;Ni&#8208;based carbon monoxide dehydrogenase enzymes.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) enzymes are active for the reversible CO oxidation&#8211;CO2 reduction reaction and are of interest in the context of CO2 abatement and carbon&#8208;neutral solar fuels. Bioinspired by the active&#8208;site composition of the CODHs, polyoxometalates triply substituted with first&#8208;row transition metals were modularly synthesized. The polyanions, in short, {SiM3W9} and {SiM&#8242;2M&#8242;&#8242;W9}, M, M&#8242;, M&#8242;&#8242;=CuII, NiII, FeIII are shown to be electrocatalysts for reversible CO oxidation&#8211;CO2 reduction. A catalytic Tafel plot showed that {SiCu3W9} was the most reactive for CO2 reduction, and electrolysis reactions yielded significant amounts of CO with 98&#8201;% faradaic efficiency. In contrast, Fe&#8211;Ni compounds such as {SiFeNi2W9} preferably catalyzed the oxidation of CO to CO2 similar to what is observed for the [NiFe]&#8208;CODH enzyme. Compositional control of the heterometal complexes, now and in the future, leads to control of reactivity and selectivity for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction.

18O&#8208;labelled condensed phosphates can be synthesized with a family of 18O&#8208;phosphoramidite reagents, as reported by Henning&#8197;J. Jessen and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202112457). &#8220;Heavy&#8221; phosphoramidites, based on a 4&#8208;hydroxyphenol core, are equipped with 18O&#8208;isotopes derived from H218O. The toolbox includes a versatile array of protecting groups, removable by acid, base, or fluoride upon self&#8208;immolation of a quinone methide. Straightforward access to major classes of biologically relevant 18O&#8208;phosphorylated metabolites is demonstrated, including nucleotides, inositol phosphates, and inorganic polyphosphates.

Single&#8208;molecule tracking is used to follow the motion of individual molecules. In their Communication (e202114388), Bert&#8197;M. Weckhuysen and co&#8208;workers compare the molecules&#8217; motion behavior in different zeolite channel geometries at the single&#8208;molecule level. This approach provides mechanistic insight into the channel geometry&#8211;diffusivity relationships and the enhancement of diffusion in hierarchical zeolites.

The solution&#8208;phase molecular structure of five redox&#8208; and photo&#8208;active bimetallic complexes was directly probed using high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray scattering and atomic pair distribution function analysis in the Research Article by Xiaosong Li, Karen&#8197;L. Mulfort et&#8197;al. (e202111764). The analysis reveals significant conformational differences between the solution&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;state structures of these complexes that may be relevant for interactions between the two metal centers.

Amides are ubiquitous in biological and medicinal chemistry. In their Research Article (e202112668), Jiannan Zhao and co&#8208;workers report an &#8220;oxidation&#8211;reduction condensation&#8221; reaction through the use of PPh3 as an organic reductant. Synergistic cooperation between a Co(III) and an Ir(III) photoredox catalyst captures electrons from phosphorus and facilitates the formation of acyloxyphosphonium species, which enable direct amidation. The synthetic utility of this photocatalytic method is highlighted by rapid gram&#8208;scale peptide synthesis and successful assembly of a tetrapeptide through SPPS.

         <title>Atomic Level Insights into Metal Halide Perovskite Materials by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy are powerful techniques to visualize the topographic and electronic structures of metal halide perovskites with atomic&#8208;level resolution. These techniques can also be used to reveal the dynamics of surface defects and charge carriers as well as on&#8208;surface reactions and optoelectronic properties at the surface and interfaces of perovskite materials.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskite materials (MHPMs) have attracted significant attention because of their superior optoelectronic properties and versatile applications. The power conversion efficiency of MHPM solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed to 25.5&#8201;%. Although the performance of PSCs is already competitive, several important challenges still need to be solved to realize commercial applications. A thorough understanding of surface atomic structures and structure&#8211;property relationships is at the heart of these remaining issues. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) can be used to characterize the surface properties of MHPMs, which can offer crucial insights into MHPMs at the atomic scale. This Review summarizes recent progress in STM and STS studies on MHPMs, with a focus on the surface properties. We provide understanding from the comparative perspective of several different MHPMs. We also highlight a series of novel phenomena observed by STM and STS. Finally, we outline a few research topics of primary importance for future studies.

         <title>Metathesis by Partner Interchange in &#963;&#8208;Bond Ligands: Expanding Applications of the &#963;&#8208;CAM Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights advances in the characterization and dynamic rearrangements of &#963;&#8208;bond complexes, most notably alkane and zincane complexes, but also different geometries of silane and borane complexes. We set out a selection of catalytic and stoichiometric examples of the &#963;&#8208;complex assisted metathesis mechanism that are supported by strong experimental and/or computational evidence.







Abstract
In 2007 two of us defined the &#963;&#8208;Complex Assisted Metathesis mechanism (Perutz and Sabo&#8208;Etienne, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2007, 46, 2578&#8211;2592), that is, the &#963;&#8208;CAM concept. This new approach to reaction mechanisms brought together metathesis reactions involving the formation of a variety of metal&#8211;element bonds through partner&#8208;interchange of &#963;&#8208;bond complexes. The key concept that defines a &#963;&#8208;CAM process is a single transition state for metathesis that is connected by two intermediates that are &#963;&#8208;bond complexes while the oxidation state of the metal remains constant in precursor, intermediates and product. This mechanism is appropriate in situations where &#963;&#8208;bond complexes have been isolated or computed as well&#8208;defined minima. Unlike several other mechanisms, it does not define the nature of the transition state. In this review, we highlight advances in the characterization and dynamic rearrangements of &#963;&#8208;bond complexes, most notably alkane and zincane complexes, but also different geometries of silane and borane complexes. We set out a selection of catalytic and stoichiometric examples of the &#963;&#8208;CAM mechanism that are supported by strong experimental and/or computational evidence. We then draw on these examples to demonstrate that the scope of the &#963;&#8208;CAM mechanism has expanded to classes of reaction not envisaged in 2007 (additional &#963;&#8208;bond ligands, agostic complexes, sp2&#8208;carbon, surfaces). Finally, we provide a critical comparison to alternative mechanisms for metathesis of metal&#8211;element bonds.

         <title>Clinical Development of Metal Complexes as Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photodynamic therapy has complemented traditional cancer treatment modalities. Despite its success, the clinically applied photosensitizers are not ideal. To overcome their limitations increasing research efforts have been devoted towards the incorporation of a metal ion. In this Minireview, the clinical status of metal&#8208;containing compounds as photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy is reviewed.







Abstract
Cancer has emerged over the last decades as one of the deadliest diseases in the world. Among the most commonly used techniques (i.e. surgery, immunotherapy, radiotherapy or chemotherapy), increasing attention has been devoted towards photodynamic therapy. However, the vast majority of clinically applied photosensitizers are not ideal and associated with several limitations including poor aqueous solubility, poor photostability and slow clearance from the body, causing photosensitivity. In an effort to overcome these drawbacks, much attention has been devoted towards the incorporation of a metal ion. Herein, the clinical development of metal&#8208;containing compounds including Purlytin&#174;, Lutrin&#174;/Antrin&#174;, Photosens&#174;, TOOKAD&#174; soluble or TLD&#8208;1433 is critically reviewed.

         <title>Orienting an Organic Semiconductor into DNA 3D Arrays by Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The orienting of an organic semiconductor, a heptamer of poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (HPV), into DNA 3D arrays was achieved by rational design. Addressed with covalent bonds in a DNA tensegrity triangle motif, the quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional molecules were well&#8208;aligned inside the crystalline lattices, as indicated by polarized fluorescent emission. This experiment demonstrated a simple approach to constructing photonic crystals with DNA&#8208;templated band&#8208;gap materials.







Abstract
A quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional organic semiconductor, hepta(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (HPV), was incorporated into a DNA tensegrity triangle motif using a covalent strategy. 3D arrays were self&#8208;assembled from an HPV&#8208;DNA pseudo&#8208;rhombohedron edge by rational design and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Templated by the DNA motif, HPV molecules exist as single&#8208;molecule fluorescence emitters at the concentration of 8&#8197;mM within the crystal lattice. The anisotropic fluorescence emission from HPV&#8208;DNA crystals indicates HPV molecules are well aligned in the macroscopic 3D DNA lattices. Sophisticated nanodevices and functional materials constructed from DNA can be developed from this strategy by addressing functional components with molecular accuracy.

         <title>Catalysis&#8208;Enabled Concise and Stereoselective Total Synthesis of the Tricyclic Prostaglandin D2 Metabolite Methyl Ester</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clinically important tricyclic prostaglandin D2 metabolite (PGDM) methyl ester was synthesized in eight steps from a readily available known compound. The synthesis features Z&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis to form the challenging Z &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ester, palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative spirolactonization to build the oxaspirolactone moiety, and nickel&#8208;catalyzed Ueno&#8211;Stork&#8208;type dicarbofunctionalization to form two key C&#8722;C bonds and stereocenters.







Abstract
A concise and stereoselective total synthesis of the clinically relevant tricyclic prostaglandin D2 metabolite (tricyclic&#8208;PGDM) methyl ester in racemic form was accomplished in eight steps from a readily available known cyclopentene&#8208;diol derivative. The synthesis features a nickel&#8208;catalyzed Ueno&#8211;Stork&#8208;type dicarbofunctionalization to generate two consecutive stereocenters, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative spirolactonization to build the core oxaspirolactone, and a Z&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis to introduce the (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;butenoate side chain, a group challenging to introduce through traditional Wittig protocols and troublesome for the two previous total syntheses. A general Z&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis protocol to construct (Z)&#8208;&#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated esters was also developed that has broad functional group tolerance and high stereoselectivity. Additionally, our synthesis already accumulated 75&#8197;mg of valuable material for an 18O&#8208;tricyclic&#8208;PGDM&#8208;based assay used in clinical settings for inflammation.

         <title>Unravelling Channel Structure&#8211;Diffusivity Relationships in Zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 at the Single&#8208;Molecule Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microscopic channel structure&#8211;diffusivity relationships in zeolites were unraveled using a combination of single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy and uniformly oriented zeolite thin films. New insights into the mechanism of the enhanced diffusion in hierarchical zeolites were obtained.







Abstract
The development of improved zeolite materials for applications in separation and catalysis requires understanding of mass transport. Herein, diffusion of single molecules is tracked in the straight and sinusoidal channels of the industrially relevant ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites using a combination of single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy and uniformly oriented zeolite thin films. Distinct motion behaviors are observed in zeolite channels with the same geometry, suggesting heterogeneous guest&#8211;host interactions. Quantification of the diffusion heterogeneities in the sinusoidal and straight channels suggests that the geometry of zeolite channels dictates the mobility and motion behavior of the guest molecules, resulting in diffusion anisotropy. The study of hierarchical zeolites shows that the addition of secondary pore networks primarily enhances the diffusivity of sinusoidal zeolite channels, and thus alleviating the diffusion limitations of microporous zeolites.

         <title>Modulating the Excited State Chirality of Dynamic Chemical Reactions in Chiral Micelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrophobic cavity of chiral spherical micelles was used as the chiral space to encapsulate hydrophobic emitters and endow them with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties in the aqueous phase. Particularly, through breaking the &#8220;C=N&#8221; bonds of Nile Red molecules, we have observed white CPL emission.







Abstract
Chirality generation and transfer is not only of critical importance in resolving the origin of biological homochirality, but also is of great significance for exploring the chirality&#8208;related functionalities in nanomaterials and supramolecular systems. Although modulating the ground state chirality in chiral nanomaterials has been widely demonstrated, it remains a big challenge to steer the excited state chirality (circularly polarized luminescence, CPL). Herein, we present a kind of chiral spherical micelles constructed by chiral cationic gemini surfactants, whose surfaces and cavities could co&#8208;assemble with hydrophilic and hydrophobic emitters concurrently. Subsequently, the hydrophilic and hydrophobic emitters could be endowed with CPL activity in the aqueous phase. Additionally, the cavities of such micelles can be regarded as the powerful chiral confined space, which could effectively modulate the excited state chirality of dynamic chemical reactions, enabling color&#8208;adjustable CPL emission.

         <title>A Bright, Renal&#8208;Clearable NIR&#8208;II Brush Macromolecular Probe with Long Blood Circulation Time for Kidney Disease Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bright NIR&#8208;II brush macromolecular fluorophores (FBP) with high renal&#8208;clearance efficiency and long&#8208;blood circulation time has been developed. These achieve real&#8208;time in vivo NIR&#8208;II imaging of renal ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury, tumor passive targeted imaging and renal cell carcinoma active targeted imaging with higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and extended retention time.







Abstract
Early detection of kidney disease is of vital importance due to its current prevalence worldwide. Fluorescence imaging, especially in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) has been regarded as a promising technique for the early diagnosis of kidney disease due to the superior resolution and sensitivity. However, the reported NIR&#8208;II organic renal&#8208;clearable probes are hampered by their low brightness (&#1013;max&#934;f&gt;1000&#8197;nm&lt;10&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and limited blood circulation time (t1/2&lt;2&#8197;h), which impede the targeted imaging performance. Herein, we develop the aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) brush macromolecular probes (Fudan BDIPY Probes (FBP 912)) with high brightness (&#1013;max&#934;f&gt;1000&#8197;nm&#8776;60&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), which is about 10&#8208;fold higher than that of previously reported NIR&#8208;II renal&#8208;clearable organic probes. FBP 912 exhibits an average diameter of &#8776;4&#8197;nm and high renal clearance efficiency (&#8776;65&#8201;% excretion through the kidney within 12&#8197;h), showing superior performance for non&#8208;invasively diagnosis of renal ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (RIR) earlier than clinical serum&#8208;based protocols. Additionally, the high molecular weight polymer brush enables FBP 912 with prolonged circulation time (t1/2&#8776;6.1&#8197;h) and higher brightness than traditional PEGylated renal&#8208;clearable control fluorophores (t1/2&lt;2&#8197;h), facilitating for 4T1 tumor passive targeted imaging and renal cell carcinoma active targeted imaging with higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and extended retention time.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Sonodynamic Activity of Phthalocyanine&#8211;Artesunate Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interesting aggregation&#8208;enhanced sonodynamic activity (AESA) effect was first observed based on the studies of phthalocyanine&#8211;artesunate conjugates and common organic sonosensitizers, which arose from boosted ultrasonic cavitation caused by nanostructured aggregates. We believed that the AESA effect in this work could open up a new avenue for the development of efficient sonosensitizers.







Abstract
The clinical prospect of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has not been fully realized due to the scarcity of efficient sonosensitizers. Herein, we designed phthalocyanine&#8211;artesunate conjugates (e.g. ZnPcT4A), which could generate up to ca. 10&#8208;fold more reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the known sonosensitizer protoporphyrin&#8197;IX. Meanwhile, an interesting and significant finding of aggregation&#8208;enhanced sonodynamic activity (AESA) was observed for the first time. ZnPcT4A showed about 60&#8208;fold higher sonodynamic ROS generation in the aggregated form than in the disaggregated form in aqueous solutions. That could be attributed to the boosted ultrasonic cavitation of nanostructures. The level of the AESA effect depended on the aggregation ability of sonosensitizer molecules and the particle size of their aggregates. Moreover, biological studies demonstrated that ZnPcT4A had high anticancer activities and biosafety. This study thus opens up a new avenue the development of efficient organic sonosensitizers.

         <title>A Reconstructed Cu2P2O7 Catalyst for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical in&#8197;situ reconstruction of Cu2P2O7 during CO2 electroreduction generates highly porous Cu with abundant defects and low&#8208;coordinated sites, which facilitate CO adsorption with bridge and atop configurations, thus resulting in a high&#8208;rate production of C2+ fuels and chemicals.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) over Cu&#8208;based catalysts shows great potential for converting CO2 into multicarbon (C2+) fuels and chemicals. Herein, we introduce an A2M2O7 structure into a Cu&#8208;based catalyst through a solid&#8208;state reaction synthesis method. The Cu2P2O7 catalyst is electrochemically reduced to metallic Cu with a significant structure evolution from grain aggregates to highly porous structure under CO2RR conditions. The reconstructed Cu2P2O7 catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 73.6&#8201;% for C2+ products at an applied current density of 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, remarkably higher than the CuO counterparts. The reconstructed Cu2P2O7 catalyst has a high electrochemically active surface area, abundant defects, and low&#8208;coordinated sites. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that CO adsorption with bridge and atop configurations is largely improved on Cu with defects and low&#8208;coordinated sites, which decreased the energy barrier of the C&#8722;C coupling reaction for C2+ products.

         <title>Rational Design of a Two&#8208;Photon Fluorescent Probe for Human Cytochrome&#8197;P450 3A and the Visualization of Mechanism&#8208;Based Inactivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe for CYP3A was developed using a rational design strategy that optimized the key binding domain of the fluorophore. The probe semi&#8208;quantitatively detects and images CYP3A activity in various living systems, thereby providing a high&#8208;throughput screening system facilitating the evaluation of MBI&#8208;associated hepatotoxicity by CYP3A.







Abstract
Mechanism&#8208;based inactivation (MBI) can mediate adverse reactions and hepatotoxicity from drugs, which is a result of their conversion into highly reactive metabolites catalyzed by enzymes such as cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A). In the present research, we optimized the key interaction domain of the fluorophore with the target protein to develop a two&#8208;photon fluorescent probe for CYP3A that is involved in the metabolism of more than half of all clinical drugs. The developed BN&#8208;1 probe exhibited appropriate selectivity and sensitivity for the semi&#8208;quantitative detection and imaging of endogenous CYP3A activity in various living systems, thereby providing a high&#8208;throughput screening system enabling evaluation of MBI&#8208;associated hepatotoxicity by CYP3A. Using BN&#8208;1 as a fluorescent molecular tool facilitates the efficient discovery and characterization of CYP3A&#8208;induced MBI in natural systems.

         <title>Entropy Versus Enthalpy Controlled Temperature/Redox Dual&#8208;Triggered Cages for Selective Anion Encapsulation and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cage 1P, which selectively encapsulates BPh4&#8722; over a wide range of temperatures, can be quantitatively oxidized to cage 1PO with more negative enthalpy (&#916;H&#176;) and entropy (&#916;S&#176;) that releases the captured BPh4&#8722; anions at high temperature but strongly encapsulates BPh4&#8722; at low temperature.







Abstract
New C3&#8208;symmetric imidazole ligands were designed with phosphine and phosphine oxide linkers (LP and LPO, respectively) to demonstrate a dual&#8208;triggered dynamic closed coordination cage. Both LP and LPO form discrete Zn4L4&#8208;closed cages (1P and 1PO, respectively) with excellent selectively for BPh4&#8722;, whereas 1P and 1PO encapsulate neither a slightly larger size anion [B(C6H4CH3)4&#8722;] nor smaller size anions (BF4&#8722;, PF6&#8722;, SbF6&#8722;, and OSO2CF3&#8722;). 1PO exhibits more negative enthalpy and entropy changes upon anion encapsulation, thus releasing almost all of the encapsulated anions at high temperature (343&#8197;K) (trigger 1: BPh4&#8722;&#8834;1PO
1PO+BPh4&#8722;). In contrast 1P has less negative enthalpy and entropy changes, thus preserving the captured anion over a wide range of temperatures (298&#8197;K to 343&#8197;K). The 1P cage can be quantitatively oxidized to the 1PO cage by a mild oxidant (Ox.=H2O2), and therefore the captured anion can be released by a redox triggering event (trigger 2: BPh4&#8722;&#8834;1P+Ox.&#8594;1PO+BPh4&#8722;).

         <title>Potent and Selective RIPK1 Inhibitors Targeting Dual&#8208;Pockets for the Treatment of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome and Sepsis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly potent dual&#8208;mode RIPK1 inhibitors occupying both the allosteric and the ATP binding pockets were developed, exemplified by compound 21 (ZB&#8208;R&#8208;55), which is about 10&#8208;fold more potent than GSK2982772, and exhibits excellent kinase selectivity, good oral pharmacokinetics and good therapeutic effects in the LPS&#8208;induced sepsis model.







Abstract
Sepsis, characterized with high risk of life&#8208;threatening organ dysfunction, represents a major cause of health loss and the World Health Organization (WHO) labelled sepsis as the most urgent unmet medical need in 2017. The emerging biological understanding of the role of RIPK1 in sepsis has opened up an exciting opportunity to explore potent and selective RIPK1 inhibitors as an effective therapeutic strategy for SIRS and sepsis therapy. Herein, we have synthesized a class of highly potent dual&#8208;mode RIPK1 inhibitors occupying both the allosteric and the ATP binding pockets, exemplified by compound 21 (ZB&#8208;R&#8208;55) which is about 10&#8208;fold more potent than GSK2982772, and exhibits excellent kinase selectivity, good oral pharmacokinetics and good therapeutic effects in the LPS&#8208;induced sepsis model, suggesting that compound ZB&#8208;R&#8208;55 is a highly promising preclinical candidate.

         <title>Cathespin&#8197;B&#8208;Initiated Cypate Nanoparticle Formation for Tumor Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared photoacoustic (PA) probe Cypate&#8208;CBT was designed for specific imaging and real&#8208;time tracking of cathespin&#8197;B (CTSB) activity in CTSB&#8208;overexpressing cells and tumors. After Cypate&#8208;CBT entered into CTSB&#8208;overexpressing cells, it underwent glutathione reduction and CTSB cleavage to generate cypate nanoparticles Cypate&#8208;CBT&#8208;NPs, which enhanced both the intensity and retention time of the PA signal in tumor sites.







Abstract
Cathepsin&#8197;B (CTSB) is a lysosomal protease that is overexpressed in the early stage of many cancer types. Precise evaluation of CTSB expression in vivo may provide a promising method for the early diagnosis of cancers. By virtue of the high&#8208;resolution PA imaging modality, a &#8220;smart&#8221; photoacoustic (PA) probe Cypate&#8208;CBT, which can self&#8208;assemble to cypate&#8208;containing nanoparticles in response to abundant GSH and CTSB inside tumor cells, was developed for the sensitive and specific detection of CTSB activity. Compared with unmodified Cypate, our probe Cypate&#8208;CBT exhibited a 4.9&#8208;fold or 4.7&#8208;fold PA signal enhancement in CTSB&#8208;overexpressing MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cancer cells or tumors, respectively, revealing intracellular accumulation of the probe after CTSB&#8208;initiated self&#8208;assembly. We expect Cypate&#8208;CBT to be employed as an effective PA imaging agent for clinical diagnosis of cancer at early stages.

         <title>Exploiting Cooperative Catalysis for the On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Linear Heteroaromatic Polymers via Selective C&#8211;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cooperative catalytic role of sodium and silver adatoms in steering the on&#8208;surface polymerization of hexaazatriphenylene molecules on Ag(111) is demonstrated. By combining high&#8208;resolution scanning probe microscopy with density functional calculations, we elucidate how complex surface processes can be enabled by addition of atomic species designed for catalyzing specific reaction steps.







Abstract
Regiospecific C&#8722;H activation is a promising approach to achieve extended polymers with tailored structures. While a recent on&#8208;surface synthetic approach has enabled regioselective homocoupling of heteroaromatic molecules, only small oligomers have been achieved. Herein, selective C&#8722;H activation for dehydrogenative C&#8722;C couplings of hexaazatriphenylene by Scholl reaction is reported for the first time. By combining low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), we revealed the formation of one&#8208;dimensional polymers with a double&#8208;chain structure. The details of the growth process are rationalized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, pointing out a cooperative catalytic action of Na and Ag adatoms in steering the C&#8722;H selectivity for the polymerization.

         <title>Sortase&#8208;Mediated Multi&#8208;Fragment Assemblies by Ligation Site Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) of multiple peptide fragments is enabled by ligation site switching. An active sorting motif installed by default into the ligation product is switched from an active to an inactive state while a latent nucleophile in the ligation product is activated for SML. Repetitive cycles of SML and ligation site switching allow the assembly of multiple fragments with wild type sortase.







Abstract
Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) is a powerful tool of protein chemistry allowing the ligation of peptides containing LPxTG sorting motifs and N&#8208;terminal glycine nucleophiles. The installation of a sorting motif into the product prohibits the assembly of multiple fragments by SML. Here we report multi&#8208;fragment SML based on switchable sortase substrates. Substitution of the Leu residue by disulfide&#8208;containing Cys(StBu) results in active sorting motifs, which are inactivatable by reduction. In combination with a photo&#8208;protected N&#8208;Gly nucleophile, multi&#8208;fragment SML is enabled by repetitive cycles of SML and ligation site switching. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept four&#8208;fragment ligation, the assembly of peptide probes for bivalent chromatin binding proteins and oligomerization of peptide antigens. Biochemical and immuno&#8208;assays demonstrated functionality of these probes rendering them promising tools for immunology and chromatin biochemistry.

         <title>Proton/Electron Donors Enhancing Electrocatalytic Activity of Supported Conjugated Microporous Polymers for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phthalocyanines are polymerized via a solid ionothermal Scholl reaction in the presence of carbon nanotubes, resulting in an ultrathin conjugated microporous polymer sheath containing single&#8208;atom CoN4 as catalytic sites and H2Pc units as proton/electron donors, both of which interplay to enhance the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Metal phthalocyanines (MePc) hold great promise in electrochemical reduction of CO2 to value&#8208;added chemicals, whereas the catalytic activity of MePc&#8208;containing polymers often suffers from a limited molecular modulation strategy. Herein, we synthesize an ultrathin conjugated microporous polymer sheath around carbon nanotubes by an ionothermal copolymerization of CoPc and H2Pc via the Scholl reaction. Given the H2Pc&#8208;mediated regulation in the synthesis, CoII metal is well preserved in the form of single atoms on the polymer sheath of the carbon nanotubes. With the synergistic effect of H2Pc moieties as proton/electron donors, the composites can selectively reduce CO2 to CO with a high Faradaic efficiency (max. 97&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V) in broad potential windows, exceptional turnover frequency (97&#8201;592&#8197;h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.65&#8197;V) and large current density (&gt;200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). It is thus desirable to develop a family of heterogeneous polymerized MePc with molecularly regulating electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Inspired Fragment Merging and Growing Affords Efficacious LasB Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 5, January 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient fragment merging and growing strategy with simple chemistry yielded a fragment&#8208;like inhibitor of the virulence factor LasB from Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a twelve&#8208;fold boost in activity. Our optimized structure shows an improved in vivo efficacy demonstrating the significance of exploiting alternative binding modes to succeed in simple fragment merging. The graphic was created with the software tool BioRender (biorender.com).







Abstract
Extracellular virulence factors have emerged as attractive targets in the current antimicrobial resistance crisis. The Gram&#8208;negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes the virulence factor elastase&#8197;B (LasB), which plays an important role in the infection process. Here, we report a sub&#8208;micromolar, non&#8208;peptidic, fragment&#8208;like inhibitor of LasB discovered by careful visual inspection of structural data. Inspired by the natural LasB substrate, the original fragment was successfully merged and grown. The optimized inhibitor is accessible via simple chemistry and retained selectivity with a substantial improvement in activity, which can be rationalized by the crystal structure of LasB in complex with the inhibitor. We also demonstrate an improved in vivo efficacy of the optimized hit in Galleria mellonella larvae, highlighting the significance of this class of compounds as promising drug candidates.

         <title>Engineering Olefin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photoenzymatic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is of profound significance concerning the global energy and environmental crisis to develop new techniques that can reduce and convert CO  2  . To address this challenge, we build a new type of artificial photoenzymatic system for CO  2  reduction, using a rationally designed mesoporous olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) as the porous solid carrier for co&#8208;immobilizing formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and Rh&#8208;based electron mediator. By adjusting the incorporating content of Rh electronic mediator, which facilitates the regeneration of nicotinamide cofactor (NADH) from NAD  +  , the apparent quantum yield can reach as high as 9.17&#177;0.44%, surpassing all reported NADH regenerated photocatalysts constructed by crystalline framework materials. Finally, the assembled photocatalyst&#8208;enzyme coupled system can selectively convert CO  2  to formic acid with high efficiency and good reusability. This work demonstrates the first example using COFs to immobilize enzymes for arti&#64257;cial photosynthesis systems that utilize solar energy to produce value&#8208;added chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures of Silver Fingers and a Pathway to Their Genotoxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, we demonstrated that Ag(I) can directly replace Zn(II) in zinc fingers (ZFs). The cooperative binding of Ag(I) to ZFs leads to a thermodynamically irreversible formation of silver clusters destroying the native ZF structure. Thus, a reported loss of biological function of ZF proteins is a likely consequence of such replacement. Here, we report the X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) study of Ag  n  S  n  clusters formed in ZFs to probe their structural features. Selective probing of local environment around Ag(I) by XAS showed the predominance of digonal Ag(I) coordination to two sulfur donors, coordinated with an average Ag&#8722;S distance at 2.41 &#197;. No Ag&#8722;N bonds were present. A mixed AgS  2  /AgS  3  geometry was found solely in the CCCH Ag(I)&#8208;ZF. We also show that cooperative replacement of Zn(II) ions with the studied Ag  2  S  2  clusters occurred in a three&#8208;ZF transcription factor protein 1MEY#, leading to a dissociation of 1MEY# from the complex with its cognate DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Dipole&#8208;Induced Photoredox Catalysis for Hydrogen Evolution over Self&#8208;assembled Naphthalimide Nanoribbons</title>

In aqueous solution, these two novel naphthalimides can self&#8208;assemble to nanoribbons (NRs) that present significantly different traces of exciton dissociation dynamics. Upon photoexcitation of NINI&#8208;NRs, no charge&#8208;separated excitons (CSEs) can be formed due to the large exciton binding energy, accordingly no hydrogen evolution. On the contrary, in the photoexcited CZNI&#8208;NRs, the initial bound Frenkel excitons are dissociated to long&#8208;lived CSEs after undergoing ultrafast charge transfer within  ca.  1.25  ps  and charge separation within less than 5.0  ps  . Finally, these free electrons were injected to Pt co&#8208;catalysts for reducing protons to H  2  at a rate of  ca.  417 mmol h  &#8208;1  g  &#8208;1  , correspondingly an apparent quantum efficiency of  ca.  1.3% can be achieved at 400 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Expanding Ion&#8208;Transport Channels on Anodes for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept of self&#8208;expanding lithium&#8208;ion transport channels to construct a fast&#8208;charging anode is proposed by Guoxing Li, Yuliang Li and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202113313). The self&#8208;expanded lithium&#8208;ion transport channels can be achieved by a self&#8208;reversible conversion of chemical bonds with different bond lengths in the anode driven by the interactions with lithium ions during cycling, and reduce the energy barrier of the lithium&#8208;ion transport, accelerate the lithium&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state diffusion, thus enable excellent fast&#8208;charging performance.

The self-expanded lithium-ion transport channels can be achieved by a self-reversible conversion of chemical bonds with different bond lengths in the anode driven by the interactions with lithium ions during cycling, and reduce the energy barrier of the lithium-ion transport, accelerate the lithium-ion solid-state diffusion, thus enable excellent fast-charging performance.

         <title>Taming the Lewis Superacidity of Non&#8208;Planar Boranes: C&#8722;H Bond Activation and Non&#8208;Classical Binding Modes at Boron</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taming the Lewis superacidity of a pyramidal borane by weakly coordinated anion dissociation enabled the activation of inert C&#8722;H bonds and resulted in an unusual coordination mode at boron.







Abstract
The rational design of a geometrically constrained boron Lewis superacid featuring exceptional structure and reactivity is disclosed. It enabled the formation of non&#8208;classical electron deficient B&#8722;H&#8722;B type of bonding, which was supported by spectroscopic and structural parameters as well as computational studies. Taming the pyramidal Lewis acid electrophilicity through weak coordinating anion dissociation enabled a series of highly challenging chemical transformations, such as Csp2&#8722;H and Csp3&#8722;H activation under a frustrated Lewis pair regime and the cleavage of Csp3&#8722;Si bonds. The demonstration of such rich chemical behaviour and flexibility on a single molecular compound makes it a unique mediator of chemical transformations generally restricted to transition metals.

         <title>A Reversible Chemogenetic Switch for Chimeric Antigen Receptor T&#8197;Cells**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Using asunaprevir to control the activity of HCV NS3 protease embedded in a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) on T cells, the CAR can be repeatedly turned on and off to target tumor cells for their elimination.







Abstract
As a revolutionary cancer treatment, the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy suffers from complications such as cytokine release syndromes and T cell exhaustion. Their mitigation desires controllable activation of CAR&#8208;T cells that is achievable through regulatory display of CARs. By embedding the hepatitis C virus NS3 protease (HCV&#8208;NS3) between the single&#8208;chain variable fragment (scFv) and the hinge domain, we showed that the display of anti&#8208;CD19 scFv on CAR&#8208;T cells was positively correlated to the presence of a clinical HCV&#8208;NS3 inhibitor asunaprevir (ASV). This novel CAR design that allows the display of anti&#8208;CD19 scFv in the presence of ASV and its removal in the absence of ASV creates a practically reversible chemical switch. We demonstrated that the intact CAR on T cells can be repeatedly turned on and off by controlling the presence of ASV in a dose dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo, which enables delicate modulation of CAR&#8208;T activation during cancer treatment.

         <dc:description>
Dianion and dication of a tetracyclopentatetraphenylene derivative were generated and characterized by spectroscopies and X&#8208;ray crystallography to reveal that the outer and inner conjugation circuits were significantly decoupled as theoretically predicted. The magnetically induced ring currents of the outer and inner circuits flow clockwise and counterclockwise, respectively, in the same direction as the trains run on the outer and inner loops of Osaka Loop Line, as reported by Ichiro Hisaki, Marina&#8197;A. Petrukhina, Tohru Nishinaga, Masayoshi Nakano, Yoshito Tobe, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202115316).

         <title>Gene Fusion and Directed Evolution to Break Structural Symmetry and Boost Catalysis by an Oligomeric C&#8722;C Bond&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gene fusion is an important natural process to create new enzymes from simpler ancestors. Gerrit&#8197;J. Poelarends and co&#8208;workers have adopted this strategy in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202113970) to evolve a promiscuous homohexameric 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) into an efficient enzyme for enantioselective Michael reactions. They designed a tandem fused 4&#8208;OT that has reduced structural symmetry, expanding its optimization potential by allowing independent sequence diversification of adjacent subunits, and thus enlarging the protein sequence space that can be travelled by directed evolution.

&lt;p&gt;Gene fusion is an important natural process to create new enzymes from simpler ancestors. Gerrit&#8197;J. Poelarends and co-workers have adopted this strategy in their Communication (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202113970"&gt;10.1002/anie.202113970&lt;/a&gt;) to evolve a promiscuous homohexameric 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) into an efficient enzyme for enantioselective Michael reactions. They designed a tandem fused 4-OT that has reduced structural symmetry, expanding its optimization potential by allowing independent sequence diversification of adjacent subunits, and thus enlarging the protein sequence space that can be travelled by directed evolution.

         <title>A Facile and Unprecedented Route to a Library of Thermostable Formaldehyde&#8208;derived Polyesters: Highly Active and Selective Copolymerization of Cyclic Acetals and Anhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new strategies for producing polyesters can expand the category of biodegradable materials. Here, we disclose the alternating copolymerization of cyclic acetals (made from formaldehyde and diols) and anhydrides for the first time, using 5 cyclic acetals and 9 anhydrides to afford 45 unprecedented polyesters. At a wide range of reaction temperatures (25 to 140&#176;C), diverse metal&#8208;free Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acids are highly active catalysts for these copolymerizations via the cationic mechanism. Of interest, kinetic studies indicate that the copolymerization of cyclic acetals and anhydrides shifts the chemical equilibrium of &#8220;cyclic acetals &#8652; polyacetals&#8221; to the left, thus yielding polyesters with up to &gt;99% alternating degree. The obtained polyesters possess high oxygen content ([O]:[C] up to 6:7), molecular weights of 2.0&#8208;33.3 kDa, narrow polydispersities of 1.2&#8208;1.5, low glass transition temperatures (&#8208;64 to &#8208;27&#176;C), as well as high decomposition temperatures (275 to 324&#176;C).</dc:description>

         <title>Amyloid&#8208;Templated Palladium Nanoparticles for Water Purification by Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalysis offers great promise for water purification but is limited by low active area and high uncontrollability of electrocatalysts.&#160;To overcome these constraints, we propose hybrid bulk electrodes by synthesizing and binding Pd&#160;nanocatalyst&#160;(nano&#8208;Pd) to the electrodes via amyloid fibrils (AFs). The AFs template is effective for controlling the nucleation, growth, and assembly of nano&#8208;Pd on the electrode. In addition, the three&#8208;dimensional hierarchically porous nanostructure of AFs is beneficial for loading high&#8208;density nano&#8208;Pd with a large active area. The novel hybrid cathodes exhibit superior electroreduction performance for detoxification of hexavalent chromium (Cr6+), 4&#8208;chlorophenol, and trichloroacetic acid in wastewater and drinking water. This study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept design of AFs&#8208;templated nano&#8208;Pd&#8208;based hybrid electrode, which constitutes a paradigm shift in electrocatalytic water purification, and broadens the horizon of its potential engineered applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Computational Studies on the Directing Ability of Chalcogenoethers in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective C&#8722;H Olefination and Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and computational studies on the directing ability of chalcogenoether motifs in Pd&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation are presented. The thioether motif was found to a superior directing group compared to the corresponding ether (&#8722;OR) and selenoether in terms of reactivity and enantiocontrol. The selenoether unit (&#8722;SeMe) was used for the first time as a suitable directing group in asymmetric C&#8722;H activation.







Abstract
We present herein our experimental and DFT computational studies on the directing ability of chalcogenoether motifs in Pd&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H functionalization. The thioether motif was found to be a superior directing group compared to the corresponding ether and selenoether in terms of reactivity and enantiocontrol. Remarkably, DFT calculation provided a predictive model for the optimization of reaction conditions and the interpretation of the origin of enantioselectivity. Both Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H olefination and allylation reactions were successfully developed using chiral phosphoric acids as efficient ligands, providing a broad range of axially chiral biaryls in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. The highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective construction of polyaryls bearing multiple stereogenic axes, gram&#8208;scale reaction and various chemical transformations make this protocol more attractive and significant.

         <title>Porous Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Networks with Hydrogel&#8208;Like Actuation and Reconfigurable Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous liquid&#8208;crystalline network can swell in water for actuation through both water absorption and order&#8211;disorder phase transition, and be loaded with functional fillers to display reconfigurable functions.







Abstract
A porous liquid&#8208;crystalline network (LCN), prepared by using a template method, was found to exhibit peculiar actuation functions. The creation of porosity makes the initially hydrophobic LCN behave like a hydrogel, capable of absorbing a large volume of water (up to ten times the sample size of LCN). When the amount of absorbed water is relatively small (about 100&#8201;% swelling ratio), the porous LCN displays anisotropic swelling in water and, in the same time, the retained uniaxial alignment of mesogens ensures a thermally induced shape change associated with a LC&#8208;isotropic phase transition. Combining the characteristic actuation mechanisms of LCN (order&#8211;disorder transition of mesogens) and hydrogel (water absorption), such porous LCNs can be explored for versatile stimuli&#8208;triggered shape transformations. Moreover, the porosity enables loading/removal/reloading of functional fillers such as ionic liquids, photothermal dyes and fluorophores, which imparts the porous LCN actuator with reconfigurable functions such as ionic conductivity, light&#8208;driven locomotion, and emissive color.

Herein, a dynamic boronic ester based non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly strategy has enabled the creation of programmable and transient supramolecular chiral G&#8208;quadruplex hydrogels with tunable lifetimes from minutes, to hours, to days, as well as high transparency and conductivity, excellent injectability, and self&#8208;healing properties.







Abstract
The temporal and spatial control of natural systems has aroused great interest for the creation of synthetic mimics. By using boronic ester based dynamic covalent chemistry and coupling it with an internal pH feedback system, we have developed a new chemically fueled reaction network for non&#8208;equilibrium supramolecular chiral G&#8208;quadruplex hydrogels with programmable lifetimes from minutes, to hours, to days, as well as high transparency and conductivity, excellent injectability, and rapid self&#8208;healing properties. The system can be controlled by the kinetically controlled in&#8197;situ formation and dissociation of dynamic boronic ester bonds between the cis&#8208;diol of guanosine (G) and 5&#8208;fluorobenzoxaborole (B) in the presence of chemical fuels (KOH and 1,3&#8208;propanesultone), thereby leading to a precipitate&#8208;solution&#8208;gel&#8208;precipitate cycle under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions. A combined experimental&#8208;computational approach showed the underlying mechanism of the non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly involves aggregation and disaggregation of right&#8208;handed helical G&#8208;quadruplex superstructures. The proposed dynamic boronic ester&#8208;based non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly strategy offers a new option to design next&#8208;generation adaptive and interactive smart materials.

&#8220;Dynamic&#8221; helical metal&#8208;based polymers can offer adaptability and functionality, but such systems remain unexplored. The titled polymers display mirror&#8208;image CD spectra for &#946;&#8208;(L and D)&#8208;arabinopyranosyl sidechains (signifying helical coiling with preferred, opposite screw sense); the responsiveness and dynamic nature of the folded conformations are evident, and developments toward helicity&#8208;governed activity are described.







Abstract
The study of metallopolymers with controllable helical sense remains in its infancy. We report arabinose&#8208;functionalized (Zn&#8208;salphen)&#8208;based conjugated polymers that display mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism spectra for L&#8208; and D&#8208;sugar sidechains respectively, signifying ordered (helical) coiling of the polymer backbone with opposite screw&#8208;sense preferences. The observation of different spectroscopic behavior and Cotton effects for a variety of solvents (in a reversible manner) and temperatures, ascribed to changes in the extent of intrachain (Zn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O(salphen) and &#960;&#8208;stacking) interactions between Zn&#8208;salphen moieties, thus indicate the flexible, responsive and dynamic nature of the folded helical conformation in these systems. An application study signifying that activity can be governed by the structure and helical sense of the polymer is described.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Driven Two&#8208;Step Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Switching in BiOIO3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pressure&#8208;driven two&#8208;step second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) switching has been achieved in polar BiOIO3, by using an in situ high&#8208;pressure polarization&#8208;dependent single&#8208;crystal SHG measurement system. The step&#8208;wise suppression of the lone&#8208;pair electrons on I5+ cations has been demonstrated to be responsible for the switching phenomenon in BiOIO3, and materials with multi&#8208;stabilities are crucial to next&#8208;generation switch and information storage devices.







Abstract
Materials with multi&#8208;stabilities controllable by external stimuli have potential for high&#8208;capacity information storage and switch devices. Herein, we report the observation of pressure&#8208;driven two&#8208;step second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) switching in polar BiOIO3 for the first time. Structure analyses reveal two pressure&#8208;induced phase transitions in BiOIO3 from the ambient noncentrosymmetric phase (SHG&#8208;high) to an intermediate noncentrosymmetric phase (SHG&#8208;intermediate) and then to a centrosymmetric phase (SHG&#8208;off). The three&#8208;state SHG switching was inspected by in&#8197;situ high&#8208;pressure powder SHG and polarization&#8208;dependent single&#8208;crystal SHG measurements. Local structure analyses based on the in&#8197;situ Raman spectra and X&#8208;ray absorption spectra reveal that the SHG switching is caused by the step&#8208;wise suppression of lone&#8208;pair electrons on the [IO3]&#8722; units. The dramatic evolution of the functional units under compression also leads to subtle changes of the optical absorption edge of BiOIO3. Materials with switchable multi&#8208;stabilities provide a state&#8208;of&#8208;art platform for next&#8208;generation switch and information storage devices.

         <title>The Underlying Molecular Mechanism of Fence Engineering to Break the Activity&#8211;Stability Trade&#8208;Off in Catalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distinct molecule&#8208;selective cobalt disulfide fence is proposed to be capable of solving the activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off of highly active cobalt&#8208;doped molybdenum disulfide catalysts. This fence completely encloses the catalyst and prevents species that would poison the catalyst from reaching it, but allows catalytic reaction&#8208;related species to diffuse freely. In&#8197;situ spectroscopy uncovers its underlying mechanism.







Abstract
Non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal (NPM) catalysts often face the formidable challenge of a trade&#8208;off between long&#8208;term stability and high activity, which has not yet been widely addressed. Herein we propose a distinct molecule&#8208;selective fence as a promising concept to solve this activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. The fence encloses the catalyst and prevents species poisonous to the catalyst from reaching it, but allows catalytic reaction&#8208;related species to diffuse freely. We constructed a CoS2 fence layer on the external surface of highly active cobalt&#8208;doped MoS2, achieving a remarkable catalytic stability towards the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction and improved activity. In&#8197;situ spectroscopy uncovered the underlying molecular mechanism of the CoS2 fence for breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off of the MoS2 catalyst. This work offers valuable guidance for rationally designing efficient and stable NPM catalysts.

         <title>Carbonylative Polymerization of Epoxides Mediated by Tri&#8208;metallic Complexes: A Dual Catalysis Strategy for Synthesis of Biodegradable Polyhydroxyalkanoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual catalysis strategy via carboxylate species featuring weak nucleophilicity and basicity is used for the direct carbonylative polymerization of various epoxides for the production of original advanced polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) with high molecular weight and tunable functionalization. This study represents a rare example of PHAs synthesis using epoxides and carbon monoxide as raw materials.







Abstract
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a unique class of commercially manufactured biodegradable polyesters with properties suitable for partially substituting petroleum&#8208;based plastics. However, high costs and low volumes of production have restricted their application as commodity materials. In this study, tri&#8208;metallic complexes were developed for carbonylative polymerization via a dual catalysis strategy, and 17 products of novel PHAs with up to 38.2&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1 Mn values were discovered. The polymerization proceeds in a sequential fashion, which entails the carbonylative ring expansion of epoxide to &#946;&#8208;lactone and its subsequent ring&#8208;opening polymerization that occurs selectively at the O&#8208;alkyl bond via carboxylate species. The wide availability and structural diversity of epoxide monomers provide PHAs with various structures, excellent functionalities, and tunable properties. This study represents a rare example of the preparation of PHAs using epoxides and carbon monoxide as raw materials.

         <title>Assembling Metal Organic Layer Composites for High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To avoid the poor conductivity of most pristine metal&#8211;organic frameworks, a free&#8208;standing metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) was exploited to construct diverse composites by a facile post&#8208;synthetic strategy. The structural superiority of the MOLs composites contributes to the excellent and durable performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction into formate.







Abstract
2D metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework (MOF) based composites have emerged as promising candidates for electrocatalysis due to their high structural flexibility and fully exposed active sites. Herein, a freestanding metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) with a 2D kgd (kagome dual) lattice was constructed with abundant surface oxygenate groups serving as anchoring sites to immobilize diverse guests. Taking Bi as an example, tetragonal Bi2O3 nanowires can be uniformly grown on MOLs after solvothermal treatment, the structural evolution of which was followed by ex&#8197;situ electron microscopy. The as&#8208;prepared Bi2O3/MOL exhibits excellent CO2 electroreduction activity towards formate reaching a specific current of 2.3&#8197;A&#8201;mgBi&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiencies of over 85&#8201;% with a wide potential range from &#8722;0.87 to &#8722;1.17&#8197;V, far surpassing Bi2O3/UiO (a 3D Zr6&#8208;oxo based MOF) and Bi2O3/AB (Acetylene Black). Such a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy can be flexibly extended to develop versatile MOL composites, highlighting the superiority of optimizing MOL&#8208;based composites for electrocatalysis.

         <title>Chirality Inversion in Self&#8208;Assembled Nanocomposites Directed by Curvature&#8208;Mediated Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active role of achiral nanoparticles in regulating supramolecular chirality of the nanocomposites is reported. Nanoparticle&#8208;curvature&#8208;dependent supramolecular chirality in nanotubular composites was discovered, where small&#8208;sized nanoparticles of high curvature and large&#8208;sized nanoparticles of low curvature lead to nanotubular composites with opposite chirality.







Abstract
Nanoscale curvature&#8208;dependent interactions are of paramount importance in biological systems. Here, we report that nanoscale curvature plays an important role in regulating the chirality of self&#8208;assembled nanocomposites from chiral organic molecules and achiral nanoparticles. Specifically, we show that the supramolecular chirality of the nanocomposites markedly depends on the nanoparticle curvature, where small&#8208;sized nanoparticles of high curvature and large&#8208;sized nanoparticles of low curvature lead to nanocomposites with opposite chirality. Quantitative kinetic experiments and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that nanoparticle curvature plays a key role in promoting the pre&#8208;nucleation oligomerization of chiral molecules, which consequently regulates the supramolecular chirality of the nanocomposites. We anticipate that this study will aid in rational design of an artificial cooperative system giving rise to emergent assembling phenomena that can be surprisingly rich and often cannot be understood by studying the conventional noncooperative systems.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Defluorinative Functionalizations of Polyfluorinated Aliphatic Amides and Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalytic approach to selective functionalization of the strong C&#8722;F bonds in polyfluorinated aliphatic esters and amides is reported, affording a diverse array of important partially fluorinated motifs through hydrodefluorination, defluoroalkylation, and defluoroalkenylation. Straightforward downstream chemistry towards fluorinated alcohols, amines and drug derivatives highlights the potential of the protocol.







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;F bond functionalization of perfluoalkyl units has huge potential towards accessing functionalized organofluorinated compounds, but remains challenging due to the high C&#8722;F bond strength and inherent selectivity challenges. We report a new catalytic approach to the selective functionalization of strong C&#8722;F bonds in polyfluorinated aliphatic esters and amides. This simple reaction proceeds in mild and operational fashion with divergent conversions, including hydrodefluorination, defluoroalkylation, and defluoroalkenylation, affording a diverse array of important partially fluorinated motifs. Straightforward downstream chemistry towards fluorinated alcohols, amines and drug derivatives highlights the potential of the protocol.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Band&#8208;Tunable White&#8208;Light Emission from Bi3+/Te4+ Emitters in Perovskite&#8208;Derivative Cs2SnCl6 Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy based on Bi3+/Te4+ co&#8208;doping was developed to achieve dual&#8208;band&#8208;tunable white&#8208;light emission in perovskite&#8208;derivative Cs2SnCl6 microcrystals with a quantum yield of up to 68.3&#8201;%. Solid evidence including the transition in photoluminescence lifetime from milliseconds at 10&#8197;K to microseconds at 300&#8197;K was provided to unravel the photoluminescence originating from the inter&#8208;configurational 3P0,1&#8594;1S0 transitions of Bi3+/Te4+.







Abstract
Luminescent metal halides have attracted considerable attention in next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lighting because of their superior optical properties and easy solution processibility. Herein, we report a new class of highly efficient and dual&#8208;band&#8208;tunable white&#8208;light emitters based on Bi3+/Te4+ co&#8208;doped perovskite derivative Cs2SnCl6 microcrystals. Owing to the strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling and efficient energy transfer from Bi3+ to Te4+, the microcrystals exhibited broad dual&#8208;band white&#8208;light emission originating from the inter&#8208;configurational 3P0,1&#8594;1S0 transitions of Bi3+ and Te4+, with good stability and a high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of up to 68.3&#8201;%. Specifically, a remarkable transition in Bi3+&#8208;PL lifetime from milliseconds at 10&#8197;K to microseconds at 300&#8197;K was observed, as solid evidence for the isolated Bi3+ emission. These findings provide not only new insights into the excited&#8208;state dynamics of Bi3+ and Te4+ in Cs2SnCl6, but also a general approach to achieve single&#8208;composition white&#8208;light emitters based on lead&#8208;free metal halides through ns2&#8208;metal ion co&#8208;doping.

         <title>Electropolymerization of Metal Clusters Establishing a Versatile Platform for Enhanced Catalysis Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8208;cluster hybrid materials was successfully fabricated by using the electropolymerization (EP) method. Poly&#8208;metal clusters in an extended conjugated network establish an electron transport highway to catalytic sites. The improvement in catalytic performance in poly&#8208;metal clusters was demonstrated by electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) and photocatalytic chemical warfare simulant degradation experiments.







Abstract
Atomically precise metal clusters are attractive as highly efficient catalysts, but suffer from continuous efficiency deactivation in the catalytic process. Here, we report the development of an efficient strategy that enhances catalytic performance by electropolymerization (EP) of metal clusters into hybrid materials. Based on carbazole ligand protection, three polymerized metal&#8208;cluster hybrid materials, namely Poly&#8208;Cu14cba, Poly&#8208;Cu6Au6cbz and Poly&#8208;Cu6Ag4cbz, were prepared. Compared with isolated metal clusters, metal clusters immobilizing on a biscarbazole network after EP significantly improved their electron&#8208;transfer ability and long&#8208;term recyclability, resulting in higher catalytic performance. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, Poly&#8208;Cu14cba was evaluated as an electrocatalyst for reducing nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3), which exhibited &#8776;4&#8208;fold NH3 yield rate and &#8776;2&#8208;fold Faraday efficiency enhancement compared to that of Cu14cba with good durability. Similarly, Poly&#8208;Cu6Au6cbz showed 10&#8197;times higher photocatalytic efficiency towards chemical warfare simulants degradation than the cluster counterpart.

&lt;p&gt;A series of metal-cluster hybrid materials was successfully fabricated by using the electropolymerization (EP) method. Poly-metal clusters in an extended conjugated network establish an electron transport highway to catalytic sites. The improvement in catalytic performance in poly-metal clusters was demonstrated by electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and photocatalytic chemical warfare simulant degradation experiments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically precise metal clusters are attractive as highly efficient catalysts, but suffer from continuous efficiency deactivation in the catalytic process. Here, we report the development of an efficient strategy that enhances catalytic performance by electropolymerization (EP) of metal clusters into hybrid materials. Based on carbazole ligand protection, three polymerized metal-cluster hybrid materials, namely &lt;b&gt;Poly-Cu&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;cba&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Poly-Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;cbz&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Poly-Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;cbz&lt;/b&gt;, were prepared. Compared with isolated metal clusters, metal clusters immobilizing on a biscarbazole network after EP significantly improved their electron-transfer ability and long-term recyclability, resulting in higher catalytic performance. As a proof-of-concept, &lt;b&gt;Poly-Cu&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;cba&lt;/b&gt; was evaluated as an electrocatalyst for reducing nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which exhibited &#8776;4-fold NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate and &#8776;2-fold Faraday efficiency enhancement compared to that of &lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;cba&lt;/b&gt; with good durability. Similarly, &lt;b&gt;Poly-Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;cbz&lt;/b&gt; showed 10&#8197;times higher photocatalytic efficiency towards chemical warfare simulants degradation than the cluster counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Long&#8208;Range Triplet Exciton Transport by Metal&#8211;Metal Interaction at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exciton transport plays a pivotal role in organic opto&#8208;electronics. Effective triplet energy transfer is difficult to achieve, due to the less efficient Dexter mechanism for triplet exciton transport than F&#246;rster resonant energy transfer for singlet exciton transport. Herein, we show that organic PtII and PdII nanowires exhibit long&#8208;range triplet exciton diffusion lengths with large diffusion coefficients by metal&#8211;metal interaction at room temperature.







Abstract
Efficient and long&#8208;range exciton transport is critical for photosynthesis and opto&#8208;electronic devices, and for triplet&#8208;harvesting materials, triplet exciton diffusion length (
) and coefficient (
) are key parameters in determining their performances. Herein, we observed that PtII and PdII organometallic nanowires exhibit long&#8208;range anisotropic triplet exciton LD of 5&#8211;7&#8197;&#956;m along the M&#8722;M direction using direct photoluminescence (PL) imaging technique by low&#8208;power continuous wave (CW) laser excitation. At room temperature, via a combined triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) analysis and spatial PL imaging, an efficient triplet exciton diffusion was observed for the PtII and PdII nanowires with extended close M&#8722;M contact, while is absent in nanowires without close M&#8722;M contact. Two&#8208;dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) and calculations revealed a significant contribution of the delocalized 1/3[d&#963;*(M&#8722;M)&#8594;&#960;*] excited state during the exciton diffusion modulated by the M&#8722;M distance.

         <title>A Proton&#8208;Activatable DNA&#8208;Based Nanosystem Enables Co&#8208;Delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 and DNAzyme for Combined Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By programming multi&#8208;functional sequences in one ultra&#8208;long ssDNA chain and using it as the scaffold, we developed a lysosomal proton&#8208;activatable DNA&#8208;based nanosystem, which overcomes the countervailing effect of Mn2+ on Cas9 and DNAzyme, and thus achieves efficient co&#8208;delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 and DNAzyme for combined gene therapy of breast cancer.







Abstract
CRISPR/Cas9 is emerging as a platform for gene therapeutics, and the treatment efficiency is expected to be enhanced by combination with other therapeutic agents. Herein, we report a proton&#8208;activatable DNA&#8208;based nanosystem that enables co&#8208;delivery of Cas9/sgRNA and DNAzyme for the combined gene therapy of cancer. Ultra&#8208;long ssDNA chains, which contained the recognition sequences of sgRNA in Cas9/sgRNA, DNAzyme sequence and HhaI enzyme cleavage site, were synthesized as the scaffold of the nanosystem. The DNAzyme cofactor Mn2+ was used to compress DNA chains to form nanoparticles and acid&#8208;degradable polymer&#8208;coated HhaI enzymes were assembled on the surface of nanoparticles. In response to protons in lysosome, the polymer coating was decomposed and HhaI enzyme was consequently exposed to recognize and cut off the cleavage sites, thus triggering the release of Cas9/sgRNA and DNAzyme to regulate gene expressions to achieve a high therapeutic efficacy of breast cancer.

         <title>A General Access Route to High&#8208;Nuclearity, Metal&#8208;Functionalized Molecular Vanadium Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled thermal treatment of the common decavanadate cluster in the solid state yields a universal precursor for the synthesis of large, metal&#8208;functionalized polyoxovanadates, as demonstrated for three examples.







Abstract
Molecular metal oxides are key materials in diverse fields like energy storage and conversion, molecular magnetism and as model systems for solid&#8208;state metal oxides. To improve their performance and increase the variety of accessible motifs, new synthetic approaches are necessary. Herein, we report a universal, new precursor to access different metal&#8208;functionalized polyoxovanadate (POV) clusters. The precursor is synthesized by a novel solid&#8208;state thermal treatment procedure. Solution&#8208;phase test reactions at room temperature and pressure show that reaction of the precursor with various metal nitrate salts gives access to a range of metal&#8208;functionalized POVs. The first nitrate&#8208;templated molecular calcium vanadate cluster is reported. We show that this precursor could open new access routes to POV components for molecular magnetism, energy technologies or catalysis.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Detection of Aqueous Uranyl Based on Uranyl&#8208;Triggered Protein Photocleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique uranyl&#8208;triggered photocleavage property is used for uranyl detection in diverse environments. This method is characterized by ultrasensitive detection, a wide detection range, as well as extensive environmental adaptability and is among the best&#8208;performing uranyl detection methods.







Abstract
The detection of environmental uranyl is attracting increasing attention. However, the available detection strategies mainly depend on the selective recognition of uranyl, which is subject to severe interference by coexisting metal ions. Herein, based on the unique uranyl&#8208;triggered photocleavage property, the protein BSA is labelled with fluorescent molecules that exhibit an aggregation&#8208;induced emission effect for uranyl detection. Uranyl&#8208;triggered photocleavage causes the separation of the fluorescent&#8208;molecule&#8208;labelled protein fragments, leading to attenuation of the emission fluorescence, which is used as a signal for uranyl detection. This detection strategy shows high selectivity for uranyl and an ultralow detection limit of 24&#8197;pM with a broad detection range covering five orders of magnitude. The detection method also shows high reliability and stability, making it a promising technique for practical applications in diverse environments.

         <title>Transforming Rhodamine Dyes for (d)STORM Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy via 1,3&#8208;Disubstituted Imidazolium Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing the benzene ring in the rhodamine core with a permanently charged 1,3&#8208;disubstituted imidazolium markedly improves the photoswitching behavior and overall performance of (direct) stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ((d)STORM). Excellent super&#8208;resolution microscopy images are thus obtained under green excitation.







Abstract
We introduce a strategy to optimize the photoswitching behavior of rhodamines for (d)STORM super&#8208;resolution microscopy. By replacing the benzene ring in the rhodamine core with a permanently charged 1,3&#8208;disubstituted imidazolium, the resultant dyes are markedly sensitized toward photoswitching, and exhibit outstanding (d)STORM performance with fast on&#8208;off switching, long&#8208;lasting blinking, and bright single&#8208;molecule emission. We thus attain excellent (d)STORM images under green excitation that are on par with the &#8220;ideal&#8221; red&#8208;excited dyes, including for difficult structures such as the mammalian actin cytoskeleton, and demonstrate high&#8208;quality two&#8208;color three&#8208;dimensional (d)STORM.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Polycyclic Photovoltaic Molecule with Low Trap Density for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to typical linear conjugated material (Y6), the two&#8208;dimensional polycyclic material TPP designed and synthesized here exhibits much lower trap density. The bulk heterojunction nanoparticles based on a blend of polymer donor and TPP, exhibited an enhanced average hydrogen evolution rate of 72.75&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 330 to 1100&#8197;nm illumination, which is 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than those values of inorganic/hybrid photocatalysts.







Abstract
Typical organic semiconductors show a high trap density of states (1016&#8211;1018&#8197;cm&#8722;3), providing a large number of centers for charge&#8208;carrier recombination, thus hindering the development of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Here, we design and synthesize a two&#8208;dimensional polycyclic photovoltaic material, named as TPP, to reduce the trap density to as low as 2.3&#215;1015&#8197;cm&#8722;3, which is 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude lower than those of typical organic semiconductors. Moreover, TPP exhibits a broad and strong absorption, ordered molecular packing with a large crystalline coherence length and enhanced electron mobility. Then, the bulk heterojunction nanoparticles (BHJ&#8208;NPs) based on a blend of polymer donor (PM6) and TPP exhibit an average hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 64.31&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under AM1.5G sunlight (100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and 72.75&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 330&#8211;1100&#8197;nm illumination (198&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) higher than that of the control NPs based on typical PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 (62.67&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1).

         <title>Iterative Synthesis of Stereo&#8208; and Sequence&#8208;Defined Polymers via Acid&#8208;Orthogonal Deprotection Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept of acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotection chemistry which proceed independently of one another by the selection of protecting groups that feature the respective acid&#8208;lability is reported. This chemistry increases the compatibility with otherwise sensitive groups and opens up pathways to facilely introduce structural and functional diversity into stereo&#8208; and sequence&#8208;defined polymers.







Abstract
Absolute control over polymer stereo&#8208; and sequence structure is highly challenging in polymer chemistry. Here, an acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotection strategy is proposed for the iterative synthesis of a family of unimolecular polymers starting with enantiopure serines, featuring precise sequence, stereoconfiguration and side&#8208;chain functionalities that cannot be achieved using traditional polymerization techniques. Acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotections proceed independently of one another by the selection of protecting groups that feature the respective acid&#8208;lability. Under p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid, acidolysis of tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl can proceed exclusively, while low&#8208;dosage trifluoroacetic acid and low temperature only trigger the selective and quantitative cleavage of trityl. The pioneering use of this acid&#8208;orthogonal deprotection chemistry increases the compatibility with otherwise sensitive groups and opens up pathways to facilely introduce structural and functional diversity into stereo&#8208; and sequence&#8208;defined polymers, thus imparting their unique properties beyond natural biopolymers.

         <title>Sn7Br10S2: The First Ternary Halogen&#8208;Rich Chalcohalide Exhibiting a Chiral Structure and Pronounced Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first ternary halogen&#8208;rich nonlinear optical chalcohalide Sn7Br10S2 exhibits a strong phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation response (1.5 &#215; AGS@2.1&#8197;&#956;m) and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (6.3 &#215; AGS). This work provides a competitive candidate with good performance, facile synthesis and simple chemical composition for infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) applications, and also introduces a facile strategy to obtain high&#8208;performance NLO materials via a symmetry break.







Abstract
Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) materials are significant in laser technology for civil and military uses. Here, we report the synthesis, structural chemistry and NLO properties of a halogen&#8208;rich chalcohalide Sn7Br10S2. Its noncentrosymmetric (NCS, P63) structure can be considered as partially aliovalent anion substitution of SnBr2 (P63/m) induced centrosymmetric (CS) to NCS structural transformation. The 3D &#8734;[Sn(1)6Sn(2)6Br6X6]6&#8722; (X=Br/S) channel framework consists of Sn(1)BrX2 and Sn(2)X3 trigonal pyramids. It exhibits excellent NLO performance, including a strong phase&#8208;matchable NLO response of 1.5 &#215; AgGaS2and high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 6.3 &#215; AgGaS2.Investigation of the structure&#8211;NLO performance relationship confirms that the effective arrangement of Sn(1)BrX2 and Sn(2)X3 units predominantly contributes to the large SHG response. These results indicate Sn7Br10S2 is a potential IR NLO candidate and provides a new feasible system for promising NLO materials.

         <title>Picking on Carbonate: Kinetic Selectivity in the Encapsulation of Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular hosts bind to inorganic anions at a fast rate&#160;and select them in proportion with thermodynamic stability of the&#160;corresponding [anion&#204;host] complexes, forming in a reversible&#160;manner. In this study, we describe the action of hexapodal capsule&#160;1&#160;and its remarkable ability to select anions based on a large span of&#160;rates by which they enter this host. The thermodynamic affinity of&#160;1

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular hosts bind to inorganic anions at a fast rate&#160;and select them in proportion with thermodynamic stability of the&#160;corresponding [anion&#204;host] complexes, forming in a reversible&#160;manner.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Crystalline Covalent Triazine Frameworks via a Polycondensation Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growth of crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) is still considered as a great challenge due to the less reversible covalent bonds of triazine linkages. The network of crystalline CTFs to date have been limited to two&#8208;dimentional (2D) structure, and the three&#8208;dimentional (3D) crystalline CTFs have never been reported before. Herein we report the design and synthesis of two 3D crystalline CTFs, termed 3D CTF&#8208;TPM and 3D CTF&#8208;TPA through reversible/irreversible polycondensation approach. The targeted 3D CTFs adopt  ctn  topology, they show moderate crystallinity, relatively large surface area (~2000 m  2  g  &#8208;1  ), high CO  2  uptake capacity (23.61%). Moreover, these 3D CTFs exhibit ultrastability in the presence of boiling water, strong acid (1 M HCl) and strong base (1 M NaOH). This contribution represents the first report of 3D crystalline CTFs, which not only extends their structural diversity but also offers synthetic strategy and structural basis for expanding practical applications of CTF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Precision Synthesis of AB, ABA and ABC Block Copolymers via Switchable Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The switchable catalysis using a commercial salenMn catalyst was firstly developed and applied in the one&#8208;pot selective copolymerization from anhydrides, epoxides, CO  2  and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL) mixtures for the precise synthesis of AB, ABA and novel ABC block copolymers. The observed unique double switch process comprising three different polymerization cycles was rationalized by theoretical calculations. Surprisingly, the first block turned out to be an efficient macromolecular initiator for the consecutive introduction of carbonate linkages into copolymers, albeit with dominant cyclization with the catalyst alone. Further, through the selective reaction on different epoxides, the switchable copolymerization of up to five monomers was achieved yielding well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;block copolymers with structural diversity and functionality.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular Energy Gap&#8208;Induced Formation of High&#8208;Valent Cobalt Species in CoOOH Surface Layer on Cobalt Sulfides for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts will undergo surface reconstruction to form active oxyhydroxide&#8208;based hybrids, which have been regarded as the &#8220;true&#8208;catalysts&#8221; for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Much effort has been devoted to understanding the surface reconstruction, but little on identifying the origin of enhanced performance derived from substrate effect. Herein, we report the electrochemical synthesis of amorphous CoOOH layers on the surface of various cobalt sulfides (CoS  &#945;  ), and identify that the reduced intermolecular energy gap (&#916;  inter  ) between valence band maximum (VBM) of CoOOH and conduction band minimum (CBM) of CoS  &#945;  can accelerate the formation of OER active high&#8208;valent Co  4+  species. The combination of electrochemical and  in situ  spectroscopic approaches, including cycle voltammetry (CV),  operando  electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Raman, reveals that Co species in the CoOOH/Co  9  S  8  is more readily oxidized to CoO  2  /Co  9  S  8  than in CoOOH and other CoOOH/CoS  &#945;  . This work provides a new design principle for transition metal&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented and Readily Tunable Photoluminescence from Aliphatic Quaternary Ammonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compounds bearing aliphatic amines can be emissive under appropriate conditions. However, their ionized counterparts, namely, quaternary ammonium salts (QASs), which are widely used as phase&#8208;transfer catalysts, ionic liquids, disinfectants, and surfactants, are known as luminescence quenchers and considered non&#8208;emissive. Herein, unprecedented intrinsic fluorescence/phosphorescence dual emissions from various QASs are reported, which can be finely regulated by changing the excitation wavelength, alkyl chain length, counterion, and mechanical stimuli. The bright photoluminescence along with distinct afterglow and tunable multicolor emissions enables the application of QAS solids in advanced multimode anticounterfeiting. This finding refreshes the understanding of QASs and may inspire emerging applications based on the utilization of the intrinsic luminescences of QASs. Furthermore, it opens opportunities for the investigation of QAS&#8208;related processes and functions  via  a photophysical approach and affords strong implications for the fabrication of novel nonconventional luminophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Confined Intervention of Cellular Senescence by a Lysosomal Metabolism Targeting Molecular Prodrug for Broad&#8208;Spectrum&#160;Senotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Specific intervention of senescent cells (SnCs) is emerging as a powerful means to counteract aging and age&#8208;related diseases. Canonical methods are generally designed to target SnC&#8208;associated signaling pathways, which are however dynamically changing and highly heterogeneous in SnCs, significantly limiting the effectiveness. Here, we present a tailor&#8208;made molecular prodrug targeting lysosome dysfunction, a unique feature shared by virtually all types of SnCs.The prodrug comprises three modules all targeting the altered lysosomal programs in SnCs, namely, a recognizing unit towards the elevated lysosome content, a linker cleavable by the activated lysosomal enzyme, and a lysosomotropic agent targeting the increased lysosomal membrane sensitivity. This spatially confined design enables killing broad&#8208;spectrum SnCs, with high specificity over non&#8208;SnCs. Along with in vivo benefits, this work offers a way to significantly expand the applicability of senotherapy in a wide range of diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemiluminescent 1,2&#8208;Dioxetane Iridium Complexes for Near&#8208;Infrared Oxygen Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemiluminescent iridium&#8208;based sensors which demonstrate oxygen&#8208;dependent responses have been developed. The molecular probes, named  IrCL&#8208;1  ,  IrCL&#8208;2  and  IrCL&#8208;3  consist of oxygen sensitive iridium complexes attached to a spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetane and operate via energy transfer from the chemiexcited benzoate to the corresponding iridium (III) complex. Complexing the iridium (III) center with &#960;&#8208;extended ligands results in emission in the biologically relevant, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. All probes demonstrate varying oxygen tolerance, with  IrCL&#8208;1  being the most oxygen sensitive. These probes have been further utilized for  in vitro  ratiometric imaging of oxygen, as well as for intraperitoneal, intramuscular and intratumoral imaging in live mice. To our knowledge, these are the first iridium&#8208;based chemiluminescent probes that have been employed for  in vitro  ratiometric oxygen sensing, and for  in vivo  tumor imaging.</dc:description>

To our knowledge, these are the first iridium-based chemiluminescent probes that have been employed for  in vitro  ratiometric oxygen sensing, and for  in vivo  tumor imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mapping the Morphological Landscape of Oligomeric Di&#8208;block Peptide&#8208;Polymer Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide&#8208;polymer amphiphiles (PPAs) are tunable hybrid materials that achieve complex assembly landscapes by combining the sequence&#8208;dependent properties of peptides with the structural diversity of polymers. Despite their promise as biomimetic materials, determining how polymer and peptide properties simultaneously affect PPA self&#8208;assembly remains challenging. We herein present a systematic study of PPA structure&#8208;assembly relationships. PPAs containing oligo(ethyl acrylate) and random&#8208;coil peptides were used to determine the role of oligomer molecular weight, dispersity, peptide length, and charge density on self&#8208;assembly. We observed that PPAs predominantly formed spheres rather than anisotropic particles. Oligomer molecular weight and peptide hydrophilicity dictated morphology, while dispersity and peptide charge affected particle size. These key benchmarks will facilitate the rational design of PPAs that expand the scope of biomimetic functionality within assembled soft materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular interactions rely on the noncovalent forces, such as hydrophobic effect, H&#8208;bonding, and electrostatic interaction, which govern many intracellular biological pathways. In cellulo supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, mainly includes host&#8208;guest interaction, pH, enzymes and polymerization induce self&#8208;assembly, which accurately introduce a variety of unnatural reactions without interfering with natural biological processes. This process can finely produce synthetic biocompatible macromolecules to control the cell attitudes and regulate biological functions, such as cell proliferation and differentiation. This review focuses on the latest update and anticipates the future advance of the in cellulo supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and its activation upon response to internal and external stimuli, such as intracellular overexpressed in acidity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enzymes, as well as the use of external light illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Zinc/Zeolite Catalyst: Selective Formation of p&#8208;Xylene from Methanol to Aromatics Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of p&#8208;xylene from methanol to aromatics reaction is challenging. By now, the catalytic stability, which is inversely proportional to the particle size of the zeolite, is always not compatible with p&#8208;xylene selectivity, which is inversely proportional to the external acid sites. In this study, based on a nano&#8208;sized zeolite, we designed hollow triple&#8208;shelled Zn/MFI single crystals using the ultra&#8208;dilute liquid&#8208;phase growth technique. The obtained composites possessed one ZSM&#8208;5 layer (~30 nm) in the middle and two silicalite&#8208;1 layers (~20 nm) epitaxially grown on two sides of ZSM&#8208;5, which exhibited a considerably long lifetime (100% methanol conversion &gt; 40 h) as well as an enhanced shape selectivity of p&#8208;xylene (&gt;35%) with a p&#8208;xylene/xylene ratio of ~90%. Importantly, using this sandwich&#8208;like zeolite structure, we directly imaged the Zn species in the micropores of only ZSM&#8208;5 layer and further determined the specific structure and anchor location of the Zn species.</dc:description>

         <title>Combining Genetically Engineered Oxidase with Hydrogen Bonded Organic Framework (HOF) for Highly Efficient Biocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes incorporated into hydrogen bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) via bottom&#8208;up synthesis are promising biocomposites for applications in catalysis and sensing. Here, we explored synthetic incorporation of&#160;d&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAAO) with the metal&#8208;free tetraamidine/tetracarboxylate&#8208;based BioHOF&#8208;1 in water. N&#8208;terminal enzyme fusion with the positively charged module Zbasic2&#160;strongly boosted the loading (2.5&#8208;fold; ~500 mg enzyme gmaterial&#8209;1) and the specific activity (6.5&#8208;fold; 23 U mg&#8208;1). The DAAO@BioHOF&#8208;1 composites showed superior activity with respect to every reported carrier for the same enzyme and excellent stability during catalyst recycling. Further, extension to other enzymes, including cytochrome P450 BM3 (used in the production high&#8208;value oxyfunctionalized compounds), points to the versatility of genetic engineering as a strategy for the preparation of biohybrid systems with unprecedented properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin Crossover in a Cobalt Complex on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Co&#8208;based complex [Co(H 2&#160; B(pz)(pypz)) 2&#160; ] (py = pyridine, pz = pyrazole) deposited on Ag(111) was investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy at&#160; &#8776;&#160; 5 K. Due to a bis(tridentate) coordination sphere the molecules aggregate mainly into tetramers. Individual complexes in these tetramers undergo reversible transitions between two states with characteristic image contrasts when current is passed through them or one of their neighbors. Two molecules exhibit this bistability while the other two molecules are stable. The transition rates vary linearly with the tunneling current and exhibit an intriguing dependence on the bias voltage and its polarity. We interpret the states as being due to&#160; S&#160; =&#160; 1 / 2&#160; and&#160; 3 / 2&#160; spin states of the Co 2+&#160; complex. The image contrast and the orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude variations of the switching yields can be tentatively understood from the calculated orbital structures of the two spin states, thus providing first insights into the mechanism of electron&#8208;induced excited spin&#8208;state trapping (ELIESST).</dc:description>

         <title>Towards a Systematic Understanding of the Influence of Temperature on Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycosidic bond formation is a continual challenge for practitioners. Aiming to enhance the reproducibility and efficiency of oligosaccharide synthesis, we studied the relationship between glycosyl donor activation and reaction temperature. A novel semi&#8208;automated assay revealed diverse responses of members of a panel of thioglycosides to activation at various temperatures. The patterns of protecting groups and the thiol aglycon combine to cause remarkable differences in temperature sensitivity among glycosylating agents. We introduce the concept of donor activation temperature to capture experimental insights, reasoning that glycosylations performed below this reference temperature evade deleterious side reactions. Activation temperatures enable a simplified temperature treatment and facilitate optimization of glycosylating agent (building block) usage. Isothermal glycosylation below the activation temperature halved the equivalents of building block required in comparison to the standard &#8216;ramp&#8217; regime used in solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide synthesis to&#8208;date.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Control of Mitosis with a Photoswitchable Eg5 Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical control of a mitotic kinesin, Eg5, was achieved through an azobenzene analog of EMD&#8208;534085. Under UV light conditions, HeLa cells undergo mitotic arrest, as evidenced by the formation of a monopolar spindle.







Abstract
Eg5 is a kinesin motor protein that is responsible for bipolar spindle formation and plays a crucial role during mitosis. Loss of Eg5 function leads to the formation of monopolar spindles, followed by mitotic arrest, and subsequent cell death. Several cell&#8208;permeable small molecules have been reported to inhibit Eg5 and some have been evaluated as anticancer agents. We now describe the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of photoswitchable variants with five different pharmacophores. Our lead compound Azo&#8208;EMD is a cell permeable azobenzene that inhibits Eg5 more potently in its light&#8208;induced cis form. This activity decreased the velocity of Eg5 in single&#8208;molecule assays, promoted formation of monopolar spindles, and led to mitotic arrest in a light dependent way.

         <title>Mechanochromic, Shape&#8208;Programmable and Self&#8208;Healable Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers Enabled by Dynamic Covalent Boronic Ester Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs) exhibiting mechanochromic, shape&#8208;programmable and self&#8208;healable properties were synthesized by introducing dynamic covalent boronic ester bonds into the main&#8208;chain CLCE polymer networks. This research shines new light onto the development of dynamic covalent polymers for emerging applications in areas of bioinspired camouflage, adaptive optics and smart soft robotics.







Abstract
Endowing a cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer (CLCE) exhibiting a helicoidal nanostructure with dynamically tailorable functionalities is of paramount significance for its emerging applications in diverse fields such as adaptive optics and soft robotics. Here, a mechanochromic, shape&#8208;programmable and self&#8208;healable CLCE is judiciously designed and synthesized through integrating dynamic covalent boronic ester bonds into the main&#8208;chain CLCE polymer network. The circularly polarized reflection of CLCEs can be reversibly and dynamically tuned across the entire visible spectrum by mechanical stretching. Thanks to the introduction of dynamic boronic ester bonds, the CLCEs were found to show robust reprogrammable and self&#8208;healing capabilities. The research disclosed herein can provide new insights into the development of 4D (color and 3D shape) programmable photonic actuators towards bioinspired camouflage, adaptive optical systems, and next&#8208;generation intelligent machines.

         <title>Substrate Profiling of Mitochondrial Caseinolytic Protease P via a Site&#8208;Specific Photocrosslinking Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined approach of genetic code expansion, photocrosslinking and proteomics allows identification of the substrate scope of mitochondrial human caseinolytic protease P (hClpP) in an unbiased manner in living mammalian cells. For this, the diazirine&#8208;bearing non&#8208;canonical amino acid DiazK is incorporated site&#8208;specifically at selected positions within the inner proteolytic chamber of hClpP and trapped hClpP&#8208;substrates are enriched and identified via mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Approaches for profiling protease substrates are critical for defining protease functions, but remain challenging tasks. We combine genetic code expansion, photocrosslinking and proteomics to identify substrates of the mitochondrial (mt) human caseinolytic protease P (hClpP). Site&#8208;specific incorporation of the diazirine&#8208;bearing amino acid DiazK into the inner proteolytic chamber of hClpP, followed by UV&#8208;irradiation of cells, allows to covalently trap substrate proteins of hClpP and to substantiate hClpP's major involvement in maintaining overall mt homeostasis. In addition to confirming many of the previously annotated hClpP substrates, our approach adds a diverse set of new proteins to the hClpP interactome. Importantly, our workflow allows identifying substrate dynamics upon application of external cues in an unbiased manner. Identification of unique hClpP&#8208;substrate proteins upon induction of mt oxidative stress, suggests that hClpP counteracts oxidative stress by processing of proteins that are involved in respiratory chain complex synthesis and maturation as well as in catabolic pathways.

         <title>Sustainable Superhydrophobic Surface with Tunable Nanoscale Hydrophilicity for Water Harvesting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel superhydrophobic surface with tunable nanoscale hydrophilicity for enhancing highly efficient water capture and transport performance is developed. The hydrophilic/superhydrophobic surface takes advantage of the surface&#8208;confined water of a cellulose nanocrystal under a humid environment and the hierarchical structure assembled by the wrinkled emulsion microparticles, to achieve an excellent water harvesting flux up to 3.402&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Superwettable surfaces show great potential in water harvesting applications, however, a scalable water harvesting surface remains elusive due to the trade&#8208;off between water deposition and transport. Herein, we report a unique superhydrophobic surface with tunable nanoscale hydrophilicity constructed by structured Pickering emulsions. Preferential exposure of the cellulose nanocrystal's outer surface and wax microspheres accelerates droplet deposition allowing for the manipulation of droplet mobility. Appropriate tuning of the wetting characteristics of the surfaces, optimizing the hydrophobicity and density of the water affinity nanodomains enhance the water deposition rate without the sacrifice of water transport rate, achieving an optimal water harvesting flux of 3.402&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 for a plate and 5.02&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 for a mesh. This hydrophilic/superhydrophobic surface allows the controllable manipulation of droplet nucleation and removal to enhance the water harvesting efficiency.

         <title>Tuning Exciton Coupling of Merocyanine Nucleoside Dimers by RNA, DNA and GNA Double Helix Conformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The barbituric acid merocyanine (BAM) is reported as a nucleobase surrogate that forms hydrogen&#8208;bonded base pairs, and antiparallel as well as rotationally stacked dimer aggregates, with orientation&#8208; and conformation&#8208;sensitive exciton coupling strength.







Abstract
Exciton coupling between two or more chromophores in a specific environment is a key mechanism associated with color tuning and modulation of absorption energies. This concept is well exemplified by natural photosynthetic proteins, and can also be achieved in synthetic nucleic acid nanostructures. Here we report the coupling of barbituric acid merocyanine (BAM) nucleoside analogues and show that exciton coupling can be tuned by the double helix conformation. BAM is a nucleobase mimic that was incorporated in the phosphodiester backbone of RNA, DNA and GNA oligonucleotides. Duplexes with different backbone constitutions and geometries afforded different mutual dye arrangements, leading to distinct optical signatures due to competing modes of chromophore organization via electrostatic, dipolar, &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The realized supramolecular motifs include hydrogen&#8208;bonded BAM&#8211;adenine base pairs and antiparallel as well as rotationally stacked BAM dimer aggregates with distinct absorption, CD and fluorescence properties.

         <title>Protonation&#8208;Induced Chirality Drives Separation by Differential Ion Mobility Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionization of N&#8208;protonated Verapamil by electrospray ionization (ESI) yields two peaks when measured by differential mobility spectrometry (DMS). This strange behaviour is caused by protonation&#8208;induced chirality, whereby protonation of Verapamil's tertiary amino moiety during ESI generates diastereomers that can be resolved in the gas phase.







Abstract
Upon development of a workflow to analyze (&#177;)&#8208;Verapamil and its metabolites using differential mobility spectrometry (DMS), we noticed that the ionogram of protonated Verapamil consisted of two peaks. This was inconsistent with its metabolites, as each exhibited only a single peak in the respective ionograms. The unique behaviour of Verapamil was attributed to protonation at its tertiary amino moiety, which generated a stereogenic quaternary amine. The introduction of additional chirality upon N&#8208;protonation of Verapamil renders four possible stereochemical configurations for the protonated ion: (R,R), (S,S), (R,S), or (S,R). The (R,R)/(S,S) and (R,S)/(S,R) enantiomeric pairs are diastereomeric and thus exhibit unique conformations that are resolvable by linear and differential ion mobility techniques. Protonation&#8208;induced chirality appears to be a general phenomenon, as N&#8208;protonation of 12 additional chiral amines generated diastereomers that were readily resolved by DMS.

&lt;p&gt;Ionization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-protonated Verapamil by electrospray ionization (ESI) yields two peaks when measured by differential mobility spectrometry (DMS). This strange behaviour is caused by protonation-induced chirality, whereby protonation of Verapamil's tertiary amino moiety during ESI generates diastereomers that can be resolved in the gas phase.

         <title>Selective Fluoromethyl Couplings of Alkynes via Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component carbo&#8208;fluoromethylation of alkynes with aliphatic halides and BrCF2H or ICH2F in the presence of zinc is described. This process is based on a nickel&#8208;mediated radical addition/fluoromethyl coupling domino strategy and provides selective access to a diverse range of biologically valuable CF2H&#8208; and CH2F&#8208;substituted alkenes with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity.







Abstract
We describe here a Ni&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular carbo&#8208;fluoromethylation of alkynes with aliphatic halides and fluoromethyl halides (BrCF2H and ICH2F) in the presence of zinc, enabling the facile and selective access to a diverse range of biologically valuable CF2H/CH2F&#8208;incorporated alkenes with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Notably, merging intramolecular radical cyclization with fluoromethyl coupling enables the expedient constructions of CF2H/CH2F&#8208;incorporated lactones and lactams with high efficiency and selectivity. Mechanistic studies disclose that this catalytic protocol proceeds via a radical addition to an alkyne followed by selective coupling with the fluoromethyl unit.

         <title>Discovery of an Ultra&#8208;rapid and Sensitive Lysosomal Fluorescence Lipophagy Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of brand&#8208;new large Stokes shift and highly stable fluorescent dyes were constructed. In particular, the Q&#8208;P&#8208;ARh fluorescent dye as a near&#8208;infrared emission lysosomal&#8208;specific probe with ultra&#8208;low concentration and ultra&#8208;fast staining characteristics for the complete lipophagy process imaging is presented.







Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive dynamic tracking of lysosomes and their interactions with other organelles is important for the study of lysosomal function and related diseases. However, many fluorescent dyes developed so far to target lysosomes cannot be used to monitor these processes due to the high concentrations required for imaging, long cell penetration times, and non&#8208;ideal photostability. In this regard, we synthesized three lysosomal targeting probes with large Stokes shifts, good stability, and high brightness. The Q&#8208;P&#8208;ARh dye, developed by us for the first time, can stain lysosomes at ultra&#8208;low concentrations (1.0&#8197;nM) without affecting the physiological functions of the lysosomes. More importantly, its excellent anti&#8208;interference ability and ultrafast lysosomal staining ability (within 1.0&#8197;min) clearly monitored the entire dynamic process of lipophagy. Ultimately, this method can greatly contribute to the study of autophagy pathways. This novel fluorescence platform shows great promise for the development of biological probes for application in pathological environments.

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for In&#8197;Vivo Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Hydrogen Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ratiometric fluorescent hydrogen probe was developed for the first time by a catalytic hydrogenation strategy, enabling efficient detection of hydrogen molecules in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro with high sensitivity, rapid responsivity, high selectivity and low detection limit, in favor of uncovering and understanding underlying biological behaviors and mechanisms of hydrogen molecules.







Abstract
To reveal the biomedical effects and mechanisms of hydrogen molecules urgently needs hydrogen molecular imaging probes as an imperative tool, but the development of these probes is extremely challenging. A catalytic hydrogenation strategy is proposed to design and synthesize a ratiometric fluorescent probe by encapsulating Pd nanoparticles and conjugating azido&#8208;/coumarin&#8208;modified fluorophore into mesoporous silica nanoparticles, realizing in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo fluorescence imaging of hydrogen molecules. The developed hydrogen probe exhibits high sensitivity, rapid responsivity, high selectivity and low detection limit, enabling rapid and real&#8208;time detection of hydrogen molecules both in cells and in the body of animal and plant. By application of the developed fluorescent probe, we have directly observed the super&#8208;high transmembrane and ultrafast transport abilities of hydrogen molecules in cells, animals and plants, and discovered in&#8197;vivo high diffusion of hydrogen molecules.

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted CO2 Hydrogenation over Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 Promoted by Active Sites in Close Proximity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd3Cu nanoparticles encapsulated into a MOF affording Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 exhibits excellent performance in CO2 hydrogenation enhanced by light irradiation. Photo&#8208;generated electrons migrate from the linkers to activate CO2 adsorbed on Zr&#8211;oxo clusters. Then activated CO2 accepts spillover H* from Pd3Cu to complete the conversion. Significantly, the Pd3Cu spatial position plays a critical role and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;confined Pd3Cu greatly promotes activity.







Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has attracted great interest while suffering from low conversion and high energy input. Herein, tiny Pd3Cu nanoparticles are confined into a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66, to afford Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 for CO2 hydrogenation. Remarkably, it achieves a methanol production rate of 340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 200&#8201;&#176;C and 1.25&#8197;MPa under light irradiation, far surpassing that in the dark. The photo&#8208;generated electron transfer from the MOF to antibonding orbitals of CO2* promotes CO2 activation and HCOO* formation. In addition, the Pd3Cu microenvironment plays a critical role in CO2 hydrogenation. In contrast to the MOF&#8208;supported Pd3Cu (Pd3Cu/UiO&#8208;66), the Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 exhibits a much higher methanol production rate due to the close proximity between CO2 and H2 activation sites, which greatly facilitates their interaction and conversion. This work provides a new avenue to the integration of solar and thermal energy for efficient CO2 hydrogenation under moderate conditions.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Zinc Electrodeposition Enabled by a Self&#8208;Healable and Desolvation Shield for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healable and desolvation shield is designed as an artificial coating for aqueous Zn electrodes. This interface regulates the solvation sheath of hydrated Zn2+, restrains the random Zn2+ diffusion, and in&#8208;situ repairs the plating/stripping&#8208;induced cracks. By means of the coating, a long&#8208;term cycling stability for &gt;3500&#8197;h is achieved.







Abstract
Artificial interfaces can alleviate the side reactions and the formation of the metallic (e.g., Li, Na, and Zn) dendrites. However, the traditional ones always breakdown during the repeated plating/stripping and fail to regulate the electrodeposition behaviors of the electrodes. Herein, a self&#8208;healable ion regulator (SIR) is designed as a desolvation shield to protect the Zn electrodes and guide the Zn electrodeposition. Benefiting from the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, SIR shows a superb capability to in situ repair the plating/stripping&#8208;induced cracks. Besides, the results of theoretical calculations and electrochemical characterizations show that the coating reduces water molecules in the solvated sheath of hydrated Zn2+ and restrains the random Zn2+ diffusion on the Zn surface. Even with a coating layer of only 360&#8197;nm, the SIR&#8208;modified Zn electrode exhibits excellent long&#8208;term stability for &gt;3500&#8197;h at 2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and &gt;950&#8197;h at an ultrahigh areal capacity of 20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Design of Near&#8208;Infrared Nonfullerene Acceptor with Ultralow Nonradiative Voltage Loss for High&#8208;Performance Semitransparent Ternary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;substituted asymmetric nonfullerene acceptor SN with an over 40&#8197;nm bathochromically shifted absorption compared to Y6 is designed and synthesized. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;SN&#8208;based binary cell exhibits the lowest nonradiative voltage loss of 0.15&#8197;eV ever achieved by organic solar cells (OSCs). Benefiting from extended NIR absorption and lowered voltage loss, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8201;:&#8201;SN&#8208;based semitransparent (ST)&#8208;OSCs, for the first time, achieve a power conversion efficiency of 14&#8201;% with an average visible transmittance over 20&#8201;%.







Abstract
Semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) are considered as one of the most valuable applications of OSCs and a strong contender in the market. However, the optical band gap of current high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OSCs is still not low enough to achieve the optimal balance between power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT). An N&#8208;substituted asymmetric nonfullerene acceptor SN with over 40&#8197;nm bathochromically shifted absorption compared to Y6 was designed and synthesized, based on which the device with PM6 as donor obtained a PCE of 14.3&#8201;%, accompanied with a nonradiative voltage loss as low as 0.15&#8197;eV. Meanwhile, ternary devices with the addition of SN into PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 can achieve a PCE of 17.5&#8201;% with an unchanged open&#8208;circuit voltage and improved short&#8208;circuit current. Benefiting from extended NIR absorption and lowered voltage loss, ST&#8208;OSCs based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;SN&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 were fabricated and the optimized device demonstrated a PCE of 14.0&#8201;% at an AVT of 20.2&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE at an AVT over 20&#8201;%.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Featured Supramolecular Tubisomes for Imaging&#8208;Guided Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission featured cylindrical polymeric nanoparticles (tubisomes) are obtained from the hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of an amphiphilic cyclic peptide polymer conjugate. Intriguingly, encapsulation of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) can inactivate the fluorescence of both tubisome and DOX due to the energy transfer relay (ETR). The release of DOX can interrupt the ETR effect and light up the silenced fluorescence, thereby permitting the in&#8208;situ visualization of drug release.







Abstract
Polymeric cylinders, a fascinating type of nanostructures with high surface area, internal volume and rigidity, have been exploited as novel drug delivery vehicles over the past decade. However, it's still an open challenge to afford cylindrical nanostructures using polymeric building blocks via traditional self&#8208;assembly processes. Herein, we report a hierarchical self&#8208;assembly strategy of preparing cylindrical aggregates (tubisomes) from an amphiphilic supramolecular bottlebrush polymer in which a cyclic peptide nanotube is employed as the noncovalent backbone. Additionally, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect was introduced into the tubisomes to endow them with excellent fluorescent properties. Intriguingly, by encapsulating with the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX), both the fluorescence of tubisome and DOX can be quenched due to the energy transfer relay (ETR) effect. The release of DOX can induce the interruption of the ETR effect and recover the silenced fluorescence, thereby permitting the in&#8208;situ imaging of drug release. The AIE&#8208;featured supramolecular tubisomes reported here provide an alternative approach for fabricating cylindrical polymeric nanostructures and holds great potential for imaging&#8208;guided drug delivery.

         <title>Symmetrically Tetra&#8208;functionalized Pillar[6]arenes Prepared by Fragment Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for synthesizing partially functionalized pillar[6]arenes is reported. It emphasizes the advantages of fragment coupling over one&#8208;pot synthesis in terms of preparing highly modifiable macrocycles for supramolecular chemistry. Moreover, one of the synthesized pillar[6]arenes, COOEtEtXP[6], exhibits cyan luminescence due to the through&#8208;space conjugation, which opens up new possibilities for designing luminescent macrocycles.







Abstract
Due to the highly symmetrical structures generated from one&#8208;pot syntheses, the partial functionalization of macrocycles is usually beset with low yields and onerous purifications of the target multifunctional macrocycles. To improve this situation, taking pillar[6]arenes as an example, a two&#8208;step fragment coupling method has been developed for synthesizing symmetrically tetra&#8208;functionalized pillar[6]arenes, namely X&#8208;pillar[6]arenes. This method is simple and versatile, which makes hetero&#8208;fragment coupling and pre&#8208;functionalization available. Nine new macrocycles and a pillar[6]arene&#8208;based cage have been prepared. In addition, one of the newly synthesized macrocycles, COOEtEtXP[6], exhibits a strong cyan luminescence in the solid state under irradiation by 365&#8197;nm UV light. This emission originates from intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation. Meanwhile, formation of a supramolecular polymer by multiple non&#8208;covalent intra/intermolecular interactions helps rigidify the structure and make COOEtEtXP[6] an efficient solid&#8208;state emitter. It is believed that this fragment coupling can also be used to realize the multi&#8208;functionalization of other macrocycles.

         <title>Nitrogen Atom Transfer Catalysis by Metallonitrene C&#8722;H Insertion: Photocatalytic Amidation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic nitrogen atom transfer into aldehyde C&#8722;H bonds is reported. A palladium(II) metallonitrene species with nitrogen&#8208;centered biradical character was identified as the key intermediate and was photocrystallographically, magnetically and computationally characterized. The nucleophilic metallonitrene C&#8722;H insertion step results in inverted selectivity for the net nitrene transfer catalysis.







Abstract
C&#8722;H amination and amidation by catalytic nitrene transfer are well&#8208;established and typically proceed via electrophilic attack of nitrenoid intermediates. In contrast, the insertion of (formal) terminal nitride ligands into C&#8722;H bonds is much less developed and catalytic nitrogen atom transfer remains unknown. We here report the synthesis of a formal terminal nitride complex of palladium.

     alt="Nitrogen Atom Transfer Catalysis by Metallonitrene C&#8722;H Insertion: Photocatalytic Amidation of Aldehydes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic nitrogen atom transfer into aldehyde C&#8722;H bonds is reported. A palladium(II) metallonitrene species with nitrogen-centered biradical character was identified as the key intermediate and was photocrystallographically, magnetically and computationally characterized. The nucleophilic metallonitrene C&#8722;H insertion step results in inverted selectivity for the net nitrene transfer catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&#8722;H amination and amidation by catalytic nitrene transfer are well-established and typically proceed via electrophilic attack of nitrenoid intermediates. In contrast, the insertion of (formal) terminal nitride ligands into C&#8722;H bonds is much less developed and catalytic nitrogen atom transfer remains unknown. We here report the synthesis of a formal terminal nitride complex of palladium. Photocrystallographic, magnetic, and computational characterization support the assignment as an authentic metallonitrene (Pd&#8722;N) with a diradical nitrogen ligand that is singly bonded to Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;. Despite the subvalent nitrene character, selective C&#8722;H insertion with aldehydes follows nucleophilic selectivity. Transamidation of the benzamide product is enabled by reaction with N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Based on these results, a photocatalytic protocol for aldehyde C&#8722;H trimethylsilylamidation was developed that exhibits inverted, nucleophilic selectivity as compared to typical nitrene transfer catalysis. This first example of catalytic C&#8722;H nitrogen atom transfer offers facile access to primary amides after deprotection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Charge&#8208;Switchable Zwitterionic Peptide for Rapid Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid colorimetric detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 protease using a zwitterionic peptide and gold colloids is reported. The sensor showed good performance in exhaled breath condensate with a limit of detection in the low nanomolar range. This technology can be integrated into regular face coverings for COVID&#8208;detection.







Abstract
The transmission of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 coronavirus has led to the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Nucleic acid testing while specific has limitations for mass surveillance. One alternative is the main protease (Mpro) due to its functional importance in mediating the viral life cycle. Here, we describe a combination of modular substrate and gold colloids to detect Mpro via visual readout. The strategy involves zwitterionic peptide that carries opposite charges at the C&#8208;/N&#8208;terminus to exploit the specific recognition by Mpro. Autolytic cleavage releases a positively charged moiety that assembles the nanoparticles with rapid color changes (t&lt;10&#8197;min). We determine a limit of detection for Mpro in breath condensate matrices &lt;10&#8197;nM. We further assayed ten COVID&#8208;negative subjects and found no false&#8208;positive result. In the light of simplicity, our test for viral protease is not limited to an equipped laboratory, but also is amenable to integrating as portable point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices including those on face&#8208;coverings.

         <title>Guest&#8208;Dependent Isomer Convergence of a Permanently Fluxional Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first metallo&#8208;supramolecular M2L4 cages bearing shape&#8208;shifting bullvalene ligands are prepared. The enormous potential complexity is limited by geometric constraints in solution, which converge to a single isomer in the solid state. Through detailed experimental and computational analysis, we map the fluxional nature of these systems.







Abstract
A fluxional bis&#8208;monodentate ligand, based on the archetypal shape&#8208;shifting molecule bullvalene, self&#8208;assembles with M2+ (M=Pd2+ or Pt2+) to produce a highly complex ensemble of permanently fluxional coordination cages. Metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly selects for an M2L4 architecture while maintaining shape&#8208;shifting ligand complexity. A second level of simplification is achieved with guest&#8208;exchange; the binding of halides within the M2L4 cage mixture results in a convergence to a cage species with all four ligands present as the &#8220;B isomer&#8221;. Within this confine, the reaction graph of the bullvalene is greatly restricted, but gives rise to a mixture of 38 possible diastereoisomers in rapid exchange. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals a preference for an achiral form consisting of both ligand enantiomers. Through a combination of NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we elucidate the restricted isomerisation pathway of the permanently fluxional M2L4 assembly.

A series of new dinuclear PtII blue emitters bridged by phenylalkoxy&#8208;tethered pyrazole are reported with emission quantum yields up to 95&#8201;%, emission lifetimes down to 1.3&#8197;&#956;s and radiative decay rate constants up to 7.3&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1. Efficient hyper&#8208;OLEDs fabricated exhibit a maximum EQE of 23.4&#8201;%, a FWHM of 18&#8197;nm and a device lifetime &gt;250&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of a new class of dinuclear PtII complexes with blue phosphorescence. Bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and tethered bridging ligands were employed to suppress photo&#8208;induced structural changes and to improve thermal stability of the complexes. These complexes show mixed 3IL/3MLCT blue emission (&#8776;460&#8197;nm) with emission quantum yields of up to 0.95, emission lifetimes of as low as 1.3&#8197;&#956;s and radiative decay rate constants of up to 7.3&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1 in 4&#8197;wt&#8201;% doped PMMA films; the latter is attributed to a 1MLCT excited state having high metal character (resulting in a large SOC) and a large transition dipole moment, based on DFT calculations. Phosphor&#8208;sensitized blue hyper&#8208;OLEDs with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.13, 0.12) showed a maximum EQE of 23.4&#8201;% with a full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 18&#8197;nm and a LT50 &gt;250&#8197;h at an L0 of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Suppressing Creep and Promoting Fast Reprocessing of Vitrimers with Reversibly Trapped Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viscous deformation in elastomeric vitrimers is suppressed by temporarily trapping a reactive side chain in the polymer backbone. Upon heating, the network defect is recovered allowing for fast exchange. This offers a versatile strategy to simultaneously achieve fast reprocessing, while maintaining the strong dimensional stability of vitrimers.







Abstract
We report a straightforward chemical strategy to tackle current challenges of irreversible deformation in low Tg vitrimers at operating temperature. In particular, vinylogous urethane (VU) vitrimers were prepared where reactive free amines, necessary for material flow, were temporarily shielded inside the network backbone, by adding a small amount of dibasic ester to the curing mixture. The amines could be released as reactive chain ends from the resulting dicarboxamide bonds via thermally reversible cyclisation to an imide moiety. Indeed, (re)generation of the required nucleophilic amines as network defects ensured reprocessing and rapid material flow at higher temperature, where exchange dynamics are (re)activated. As a result, VU vitrimers were obtained with limited creep at service temperature, yet with good reprocessability at elevated temperatures. Thus, by exerting strong control on the molecular level over the availability of exchangeable functional groups, a remarkable improvement of VU properties was obtained.

         <title>Isolation and Properties of the Long Elusive Deep Blue Soluble [K3{(NtBu)3S}2]. Cage Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deep blue radical [K3{(NtBu)3S}2]., containing S(NtBu)3&#8208;caps isosteric to SO32&#8722;, forms in the solid state an equilateral K3 triangle caped by two S(NtBu)3 anions. The EPR spectrum, recorded in solution at room temperature, shows 13 main lines (a=2.6&#8197;G), each split into seven lines (a&#8776;0.38&#8197;G), through the coupling of the unpaired electron with the six 14N nuclei (I=1) and the three central 39K/41K nuclei (I=3/2).







Abstract
The reaction of potassium metal with sulfurtriimide S(NtBu)3 (II) gives the long elusive deep blue cage radical [K3{(NtBu)3S}2]. (1_K) that crystallizes at &#8722;35&#8201;&#176;C from toluene solution. The subsequent physical characterization via X&#8208;ray structure analysis, UV/Vis&#8208;, and EPR spectroscopy from solution reveals the existence of one unpaired electron delocalized within the whole cage, i.e. coupling with the six nitrogen atoms, as well as the three potassium atoms caped by the two SN3 ligands. The present X&#8208;ray structure analysis further supports previous assumptions made on the parent compound 1_Li obtained from [Li4{(NtBu)3S}2] (I) and finally elucidates the structural arrangement of the SN3 caps and alkali metals in such radical cage species.

         <title>Formation and Reactivity of a Hexahydridosilicate [SiH6]2&#8722; Coordinated by a Macrocycle&#8208;Supported Strontium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear strontium hexahydridosilicate complex has been isolated. It can be regarded as the adduct of two cationic strontium hydride fragments [(Me4TACD)SrH(thf)x]+ with SiH4.







Abstract
The cationic benzyl complex [(Me4TACD)Sr(CH2Ph)][A] (Me4TACD=1,4,7,10&#8208;tetramethyltetraazacyclododecane; A=B(C6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;Me2)4) reacted with two equivalents of phenylsilane to give the bridging hexahydridosilicate complex [(Me4TACD)2Sr2(thf)4(&#956;&#8208;&#954;3&#8201;:&#8201;&#954;3&#8208;SiH6)][A]2 (3&#8201;a). Rapid phenyl exchange between phenylsilane molecules is assumed to generate monosilane SiH4 that is trapped by two strontium hydride cations [(Me4TACD)SrH(thf)x]+. Complex 3&#8201;a decomposed in THF at room temperature to give the terminal silanide complex [(Me4TACD)Sr(SiH3)(thf)2][A], with release of H2. Upon reaction with a weak Br&#248;nsted acid, CO2, and 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene SiH4 was released. The reaction of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 mixture of cationic benzyl and neutral dibenzyl complex with phenylsilane gave the trinuclear silanide complex [(Me4TACD)3Sr3(&#956;2&#8208;H)3(&#956;3&#8208;SiH3)2][A], while nOctSiH3 led to the trinuclear (n&#8208;octyl)pentahydridosilicate complex [(Me4TACD)3Sr3(&#956;2&#8208;H)3(&#956;3&#8208;SiH5nOct)][A].

         <title>Organic Supramolecular Zippers with Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence by a Dexter Energy Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic supramolecular zipper system showing fascinating ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) has been constructed. More importantly, detailed experimental and computational analysis suggest a new UOP mechanism involving Dexter energy transfer in single&#8208;component materials.







Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials glow persistently in the dark, which offers new exciting possibilities in the fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting, photoelectric devices and biological imaging. However, the development of single&#8208;component UOP materials remains a great challenge. Herein, we develop a single component organic supramolecular zipper system with a lifetime up to 0.77&#8197;s. Owing to the introduction of a pyrazole ring into the diphenylsulfone group, the &#8220;V&#8221; shaped molecules were artfully self&#8208;assembled into supramolecular zippers via &#960;&#8211;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, that is not only of significance in highly efficient generation of triplet excitons but also facilitates a Dexter energy transfer process within supramolecular zippers, that are responsible for alleviating radiative and non&#8208;radiative deactivation decay of triplet excitons, to finally boost the UOP. This finding not only gives a new set of guidelines for the design of single&#8208;component UOP molecules but also reveals the UOP mechanism from a new perspective.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework with Highly Accessible Carbonyls and &#960;&#8208;Cation Effect for Advanced Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COF) possess a robust and porous crystalline structure, making them an appealing candidate for energy storage. Herein, we report an exfoliated polyimide COF composite (P&#8208;COF@SWCNT) prepared by an  in&#8208;situ  condensation of anhydide and amine on the single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes as advanced anode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Numerous active sites exposed on the exfoliated frameworks and the various open pathways promote the highly efficient ion diffusion in the P&#8208;COF@SWCNT while preventing irreversible dissolution in the electrolyte. During the charging/discharging process, K  +  is engaged in the carbonyls of imide group and naphthalene rings through the enolization and &#960;&#8208;K  +  effect, which is demonstrated by the DFT calculation and XPS, ex&#8208;situ FTIR, Raman. As a result, the prepared P&#8208;COF@SWCNT anode enables incredibly high reversible specific capacity of 438 mA h g  &#8208;1  at 0.05 A g  &#8208;1  and extended stability. The structural advantage of P&#8208;COF@SWCNT enables more insights into the design and versatility of COF as an electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>Activatable Persistent Luminescence from Porphyrin Derivatives and Supramolecular Probes with Imaging&#8208;Modality Transformable Characteristics for Improved Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Persistent luminescence without excitation light and tissue autofluorescence interference holds great promise for biological applications, but is limited by available materials with long&#8208;wavelength emission and excellent clinical potential. Here, we report that porphyrin derivatives can emit near&#8208;infrared persistent luminescence over 60 min after cessation of excitation light or on interaction with peroxynitrite. A plausible mechanism of the successive oxidation of vinylene bonds was demonstrated. A supramolecular probe with a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure was constructed to enhance the tumor targeting ability and the photoacoustic and persistent luminescence signals. Such probes featuring light&#8208;triggered function transformation from photoacoustic imaging to persistent luminescence imaging permit advanced image&#8208;guided cancer surgery. Furthermore, peroxynitrite&#8208;activated persistent luminescence of the supramolecular probe also enables rapid and precise screening of immunogenic cell death drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Moderated Basicity of Endohedral Amine Groups in an Octa&#8208;cationic Self&#8208;assembled Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A self&#8208;assembled Fe  II  4  L  6  cage was synthesized with 12 internal amines in the cavity. The cage forms as the dodeca&#8208;ammonium salt, despite the cage carrying an overall 8+ charge at the metal centers, extracting protons from displaced water in the reaction. Despite this, the basicity of the internal amines is lower than their counterparts in free solution. The 12 amines have a sliding scale of basicity, with a ~6 pKa unit difference between the first and last protons to be removed. This moderation of side&#8208;chain basicity in an active site is a hallmark of enzymatic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical generation of vinyl carbocations from alkenyl boronic esters and boronates is reported. Using easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle nucleophilic fluoride reagents, these intermediates are trapped to form fully substituted vinyl fluorides. Mechanistic studies support the formation of dicoordinated carbocations through sequential single&#8208;electron oxidation events. Notably, this electrochemical fluorination features fast reaction times and Lewis acid&#8208;free conditions. This transformation provides a complementary method to access vinyl fluorides with simple fluoride salts such as TBAF.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Cyclopropanation and Epoxidation via a Catalytically Formed Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the enantioselective diversification of a single starting material, a different chiral catalyst is usually required for each transformation. Herein, we extend the concept of catalytically formed chiral auxiliary from hydrogenation to the asymmetric cyclopropanation and epoxidation of tetra&#8208;substituted olefins, alleviating the need for different chiral catalysts in the alkene functionalization step. The chiral auxiliary is catalytically constructed from propargylic amines in a Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective carboetherification step using a commercially available trifluoroacetaldehyde hemiacetal tether. The installed auxiliary is then controlling the stereochemistry of the cyclopropanation and the epoxidation using standard highly reactive reagents. This strategy allows for the synthesis of enantioenriched spirocyclic aminomethylcyclopropanols and &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;&#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioconvergent Allenylation of Aldehydes with Propargyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Allenol is a versatile synthon in organic synthesis. The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of &#945;&#8208;allenols from readily available starting materials remains a prominent challenge, especially when simultaneous control over axial and central chirality is required. Herein, we describe the Cr&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent allenylation of aldehydes with racemic propargyl halides to rapidly access a wide range of chiral &#945;&#8208;allenols with adjacent axial and central chiralities. This method features excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity control with broad substrate scope, and provides facile access to all four stereoisomers when allied with Mitsunobu reaction. Preliminary mechanistic studies support radical&#8208;based reaction pathways. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the application in late&#8208;stage functionalization and the formal total synthesis of (+)&#8208;varitriol.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence Colour on Demand: Control by Optical Force</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to modulate, tune, and control fluorescence colour has attracted much attention in photonics&#8208;related research fields. The most examined approach has been the design and synthesis of luminescent materials such as luminescent nanocrystals (i.e., quantum dots). However, thus far, it has been impossible to achieve fluorescence colour control (FCC) for material with a fixed structure, size, surrounding medium, and concentration. Here, we propose a novel approach to FCC using optical tweezers. We demonstrate an optical trapping technique using nanotextured Si (black&#8208;Si) that can efficiently trap polymer chains. By increasing the laser intensity, the local concentration of perylene&#8208;labelled water&#8208;soluble polymer chains increased inside the trapping potential of the laser tweezers. Accordingly, the excimer fluorescence of perylene increased while the monomer fluorescence decreased, evidenced by a fluorescence signal colour change from blue to orange. Using nanostructure assisted optical tweezing, we demonstrate control of the relative intensity ratio of fluorescence of the two fluorophores, thus showing remote and reversible FCC of the polymer assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissymmetric Chiral Poly(diphenylacetylene)s: Secondary Structure Elucidation and Dynamic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The secondary structure of a dissymmetric and chiral poly(diphenylacetylene) (PDPA) is elucidated by combining the data from NMR experiments &#8212;regioregular head to tail structure&#8212;, Raman and IR studies &#8212;E configuration of the polyene double bonds&#8212; and high&#8208;resolution AFM images &#8212;helical pitch, packing angle and orientation of the external helix&#8212;. As a result, an E&#8208;transoidal polyene backbone describing three coaxial helices is obtained. Theoretical ECD studies of the structure show a good correspondence between experimental and theoretical data and allow deciphering that the first Cotton band is generated by the poly(diphenylacetylene) core and not only by the polyene backbone. The dynamic behavior of poly&#8208;(S)&#8208;2 is also demonstrated by a helix inversion effect produced by conformational changes at the pendant groups when annealed in solvents with different donor abilities. This phenomenon is accompanied with an inversion of the circular polarized luminescence of the PDPA (CPL switch).</dc:description>

         <title>Main&#8208;Chain Fluoropolymers with Alternating Sequence Control via Light&#8208;Driven Reversible&#8208;Deactivation Copolymerization in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymers with regulated alternating structures are attractive in practical applications, particularly for main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers. We for the first time enabled controlled fluoropolymer synthesis with alternating sequence regulation using a novel fluorinated xanthate agent via a light&#8208;driven process, which achieved on&#8208;demand copolymerization of chlorotrifluoroethylene and vinyl esters/amides under both batch and flow conditions at ambient pressure. This method creates a facile access to fluoropolymers with a broad fraction range of alternating units, low dispersities and high chain&#8208;end fidelity. Moreover, a two&#8208;step photo&#8208;flow platform was established to streamline the in&#8208;situ chain&#8208;extension toward unprecedented block copolymers continuously from fluoroethylene. Influences of structural control were illustrated with thermal and surface properties. We anticipate that this work will promote advanced material engineering with customized fluoropolymers.</dc:description>

         <title>An Overlooked Pathway in 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions of Diazoalkanes with Enamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methyl diazoacetate reacts with 1&#8208;(  N  &#8208;pyrrolidino)&#173;cycloalkenes to give products of 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions and azo couplings. The kinetics and mechanism of these reactions were investigated by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Orthogonal &#960;&#8208;systems in the 1,3&#8208;dipoles of the propargyl&#8208;allenyl type allow for two separate reaction pathways for the (3+2)&#8208;cycloadditions. The commonly considered  concerted  pathway is rationalized by the interaction of the enamine HOMO with LUMO+1, the lowest unoccupied orbital of the heteropropargyl anion fragment of methyl diazoacetate. We show that HOMO/LUMO(&#960;*  N=N  ) interactions between enamines and methyl diazoacetate open a previously unrecognized reaction path for  stepwise  cycloadditions through zwitterionic intermediates with barriers approximately 40 kJ mol  &#8211;1  lower in energy in CHCl  3  (DFT calculations) than for the concerted path.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissipative Organization of DNA Oligomers for Transient Catalytic Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of synthetic non&#8208;equilibrium systems opens doors for man&#8208;made life&#8208;like materials. Yet, creating distinct transient functions from artificial fuel&#8208;driven structures remains a challenge. Building on our ATP&#8208;driven dynamic covalent DNA assembly in an enzymatic reaction network of concurrent ATP&#8208;powered ligation and restriction, we introduce ATP&#8208;fueled transient organization of functional subunits for various functions. The programmability of the ligation/restriction site allows to precisely organize multiple sticky&#8208;end&#8208;encoded oligo segments into double&#8208;stranded (ds) DNA complexes. We demonstrate principles of ATP&#8208;driven organization into sequence&#8208;defined oligomers by sensing barcode&#8208;embedded targets with different defects. Furthermore, ATP&#8208;fueled DNAzymes for substrate cleavage are achieved by transiently ligating two DNAzyme subunits into a dsDNA complex, rendering ATP&#8208;fueled transient catalytic function.</dc:description>

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Orthogonal Stiffening of Hydrogel Networks with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we introduce the wavelength&#8208;orthogonal crosslinking of hydrogel networks using two highly red&#8208;shifted chromophores, i.e. acrylpyerene (AP, &#955;  activation  = 410&#8208;490 nm) and styrylpyrido[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazine (SPP, &#955;  activation  = 400&#8208;550 nm), able to undergo [2+2] photocycloaddition in the visible light regime. The photoreactivity of the SPP moiety is pH&#8208;dependent, whereby an acidic environment inhibits the cycloaddition. By employing a spiropyran&#8208;based photoacid generator with suitable absorption wavelength, we are able to restrict the activation wavelength of the SPP moiety to the green light region (&#955;  activation  = 520&#8208;550 nm), enabling wavelength&#8208;orthogonal activation of the AP group. Our wavelength&#8208;orthogonal photochemical system was successfully applied in the design of hydrogels whose stiffness can be tuned independently by either green or blue light.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient Rechargeable Aluminium&#8208;Amine Battery Working Under Quaternization Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aluminium (Al) batteries (RABs) have long been pursued due to the high sustainability and three&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer properties of Al metal. However, limited redox&#8208;chemistry is available for rechargeable Al batteries, which restricts the exploration of cathode materials. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient Al&#8208;amine battery based on a quaternization reaction, in which nitrogen (radical) cations (R  3  N  &#8226;+  or R  4  N  +  ) are formed to store anionic Al complex. The reactive aromatic amine molecules further oligomerize during cycling, inhibiting amine dissolution into electrolyte. Consequently, the constructed Al&#8208;amine battery exhibits a high reversible capacity of 135 mAh g  &#8208;1  along with a superior cycling life (4000 cycles), fast charge capability and a high energy efficiency of 94.2%. Moreover, the Al&#8208;amine battery shows excellent stability against self discharge, far beyond conventional Al&#8208;graphite battery. Our findings pave an avenue to advance the chemistry of RABs and thus battery performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Quinolizine AIE System: Visualization of Molecular Motion and Elaborate Tailoring for Biological Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular motions are ubiquitous in nature and they immutably play intrinsic roles in all actions. However, exploring appropriate models to decipher molecular motions is an extremely important but very challenging task for researchers. Considering aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens possess their unique merits to visualize molecular motions, it is particularly fascinating to construct new AIE systems as model to study molecular motion. Herein, a novel quinolizine (QLZ) AIE system was constructed based on the restriction intramolecular vibration mechanism. It was demonstrated that QLZ could act as an ideal model to visualize single&#8208;molecule motion and macroscopic molecular motion  via  fluorescence change. Additionally, further elaborate tailoring of this impressive core achieved highly efficient reactive oxygen species production and realized fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy applications, which confirms the great application potential of this new AIE&#8208;active QLZ core. Therefore, this work not only provides an ideal model to visualize molecular motion but also opens a new way for the application of AIEgens.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape Permanence in Diarylethene&#8208;Functionalized Liquid Crystal Elastomers Facilitated by Thiol&#8208;Anhydride Dynamic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diarylethene&#8208;functionalized liquid crystalline elastomers (DAE&#8208;LCEs) containing thiol&#8208;anhydride bonds were prepared and shown to undergo reversible, reprogrammable photoinduced actuation. Upon exposure to UV light, a monodomain DAE&#8208;LCE generated 5.5% strain. This photogenerated strain was demonstrated to be optically reversible over five cycles of alternating UV/visible light exposure with minimal photochrome fatigue. The incorporation of thiol&#8208;anhydride dynamic bonds allowed for retention of actuated states. Further, re&#8208;programming of the nematic director was achieved by heating above the temperature for bond exchange to occur (70&#176;C) yet below the nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic transition temperature (100&#176;C) such that order was maintained between mesogens. The observed thermal stability of each of the diarylethene isomers of over 72 h allowed for decoupling of photo&#8208;induced processes and polymer network effects, showing that both polymer relaxation and back&#8208;isomerization of the diarylethene contributed to LCE relaxation over a period of 12 hours after actuation unless bond exchange occurred.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Adjusting Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient Capture of Trace Xenon and Krypton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The capture of the xenon and krypton from nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas is essential to the treatment of radioactive waste. Although various porous materials have been employed to capture Xe and Kr, the development of high&#8208;performance adsorbents capable of trapping Xe/Kr at very low partial pressure as in the in the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report a self&#8208;adjusting metal&#8208;organic framework based on multiple weak binding interactions to capture trace Xe and Kr from the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas. The self&#8208;adjusting behavior of ATC&#8208;Cu and its mechanism have been visualized by the in&#8208;situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies and theoretical calculations. The self&#8208;adjusting behavior endows ATC&#8208;Cu unprecedented uptake capacities of 2.65 and 0.52 cm  3  g  &#8208;1  for Xe and Kr respectively at 0.1 bar and 298 K, as well as the record Xe capture capability from the nuclear reprocessing off&#8208;gas. Our work not only provides a benchmark Xe adsorbent but proposes a new route to construct smart materials for efficient separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Halogenation, &#945;&#8208;Hydroxylation, and Acylation by a Remarkably Versatile Polyketide Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial multimodular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are large enzymatic assembly lines that synthesize many bioactive natural products of therapeutic relevance. While PKS catalysis is mostly based on fatty acid biosynthetic principles, polyketides can be further diversified by post&#8208;PKS enzymes. Here, we characterized a remarkably versatile trans&#8208;acyltransferase (trans&#8208;AT) PKS from Serratia that builds structurally complex macrolides via more than ten functionally distinct PKS modules. In the oocydin PKS, we identified a new oxygenation module that &#945;&#8208;hydroxylates polyketide intermediates, a halogenating module catalyzing backbone &#947;&#8208;chlorination, and modular O&#8208;acetylation by a thioesterase&#8208;like domain. These results from a single biosynthetic assembly line highlight the expansive biochemical repertoire of trans&#8208;AT PKSs and provide diverse modular tools for engineered biosynthesis from a close relative of E. coli.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional square planar platinum complexes typically form one&#8208;dimensional assemblies as a result of unidirectional metallophilic and/or &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; intermolecular interactions.

These 2D crystals show unique monocomponent  &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;  stacking from either the cyclometalating or noncyclometalating ligand and the bicomponent alternate &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking from both ligands along different facet directions. Anisotropic tri&#8208;directional waveguiding is further implemented on a single hexagonal microcrystal.

         <title>Superlattice in a Ru superstructure for enhancing hydrogen evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Superlattice has attracted extensive research attentions due to their unique physical and chemical properties. Nevertheless, the observations of superlattice are mainly limited to those layered structures with weak interlayered interactions, and the effect of superlattice on catalysis in metal&#8208;based nanostructures is largely unexplored yet. Herein, for the first time we report a facile wet&#8208;chemical method for synthesizing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ru multilayered nanosheets (Ru MNSs) with superlattice, and demonstrate the significant impact of superlattice on enhancing electrocatalysis. Detailed characterizations reveal that the superlattice is formed by stacking the adjacent Ru layers with twisted angles from 2  o  to 30  o  . Owing to the strong synergy between the adjacent layers, Ru MNSs with superlattice can serve as high&#8208;efficiency catalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), where the overpotential is 24 mV for reaching 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  , which is lower than those of Ru NSs (61 mV) and commercial Pt/C (70 mV). Theoretical calculations reveal that superlattice between the adjacent Ru layers can induce the strain effect, leading to the lattice contraction and the weakening *H adsorption ability, as a result of improved HER performance. This work not only fabricates the metal&#8208;based superlattice, but also sheds new light on the utilization of superlattice on enhancing catalysis in metal&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Polarizing Agents for MAS&#8208;DNP of Proton&#8208;dense Molecular Solids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficiently hyperpolarizing of proton&#8208;dense molecular solids through Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) solid&#8208;state NMR is still an unmet challenge. Polarizing agents (PAs) developed so far do not perform well on proton&#8208;rich systems, such as organic microcrystals and biomolecular assemblies. Herein we introduce a new PA, cAsymPolPOK, and report outstanding hyperpolarization efficiency on a 12.76 kDa U&#8208;  13  C,  15  N&#8208;labeled LecA protein and pharmaceutical drugs at high magnetic fields (up to 18.8 T) and fast MAS frequencies (up to 40 kHz). The performance of cAsymPolPOK is rationalized by MAS&#8208;DNP simulations combined with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR), Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) calculations. This work shows that this new biradical is compatible with challenging biomolecular applications and unlocks the rapid acquisition of  13  C&#8208;  13  C and  15  N&#8208;  13  C correlations of pharmaceutical drugs at natural isotopic abundance, which are key experiments for structure determination.</dc:description>

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Stannate(II): A Tetraamido Tin(II) Dianion and Strong Metal&#8208;Centered &#963;&#8208;Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anionic, metal&#8208;centered nucleophiles are emerging compounds with unique reactivities. Here, we describe the isolation and full characterization of the first tetraamido tin(II) dianion, its behavior as ligand towards transition metals, and its reactivity as a tin&#8208;centered nucleophile. Experimental values such as the Tolman electronic parameter and computations attest tin&#8208;located &#963;&#8208;donor ability exceeding that of carbenes or electron&#8208;rich phosphines. Against transition metals, the stannate(II) can act as  1  &#951;  &#8208; or  5  &#951;  &#8208;type ligand. With aldehydes, it reacts by hydride substitution to valuable acyl stannates. The reductive dehalogenation of iodobenzene indicates facile redox pathways mediated by halogen bond interaction. Calix[4]pyrrolato stannate(II) represents the first example of this macrocyclic ligand in low&#8208;valent  p  &#8208;block element chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Internal Electric Field and Interfacial Bonding Engineered Step&#8208;Scheme Junction for Visible Light&#8208;Involved Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;O2 batteries have aroused considerable interests in recent years, however they are hindered by high kinetic barriers and large overvoltages at cathodes. Herein, a step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) junction with hematite on carbon nitride (Fe2O3/C3N4) is designed as a bifunctional catalyst to facilitate oxygen redox for visible light&#8208;involved Li&#8208;O2 battery. The internal electric field and interfacial Fe&#8208;N bonding in the heterojunction boost the separation and directional migration of photo&#8208;carriers to establish spatially isolated redox centers, at which the photoelectrons on C3N4 and holes on Fe2O3 remarkably accelerate the discharge and charge kinetics. These enable the Li&#8208;O2 battery with Fe2O3/C3N4 to present an elevated discharge voltage of 3.13 V under illumination, higher than the equilibrium potential 2.96 V in dark, and a charge voltage of 3.19 V, as well as superior rate capability and cycling stability. This work will shed light on rational cathode design for metal&#8208;O2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Porphyrin&#8208;Based COF 2D Materials: Variable Modification of Sensing Performances by Post&#8208;Metallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2D nanomaterials with flexibly modifiable surface are extremely desired for various applications, especially in room temperature chemiresistive gas sensing. Here, we have prepared a series of COF 2D nanomaterials (porphyrin&#8208;based COF nanosheets (NS)) that enabled highly sensitive and specific&#8208;sensing of NO  2  at room temperature. Different from the traditional 2D sensing materials, H  2  &#8208;TPCOF was designed with largely reduced interlayer interaction and predesigned porphyrin rings as modifiable sites on its surfaces for post&#8208;metallization. After post&#8208;metallization, the metallized M&#8208;TPCOF (M = Co and Cu) showed remarkably improved sensing performances. Among them, Co&#8208;TPCOF exhibited highly specific sensing toward NO  2  with one of the highest sensitivity in all reported 2D materials and COF materials, ultra&#8208;low limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 6.8 ppb and fast response/recovery. This work might shed light on designing and preparing a new type of surface&#8208;highly&#8208;modifiable 2D material for various chemistry applications.</dc:description>
