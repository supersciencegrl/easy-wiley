         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Tunable Double Bond Migration and Geometrical Isomerization in Olefins via a Spin&#8208;Accelerated Alkyl Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A readily accessible, well&#8208;defined iron(II) catalyst that demonstrates high efficiency and versatility in positional and geometrical alkene isomerization is presented. A comprehensive mechanistic study suggests an alkyl mechanism via an isolable iron hydride species and indicates the stereo&#8208; and rate&#8208;determining &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination step exhibits a two&#8208;state reactivity resulting in spin acceleration and dictating the stereoselectivity outcome. 








Abstract
Despite the central relevance of metal&#8208;catalyzed alkene isomerization in academia and industry and the overarching role of iron in sustainable catalysis, highly efficient iron&#8208;catalyzed positional and geometrical isomerizations of alkenes remain long&#8208;sought&#8208;after goals. Herein, we disclose the development of an easily accessible, well&#8208;defined anilido&#8208;aldimine iron(II) alkyl catalyst that efficiently and selectively performs, for the first time, tunable olefin migration over one and multiple carbon&#8211;carbon bonds and configurational alkene isomerization. This singular catalyst behavior also unraveled the implementation of productive regiodivergent and regio&#8208; and stereoconvergent olefin isomerization processes. Notably, with only 1 equiv. of Cy2NH&#183;BH3 (relative to Fe) under mild conditions, these reactions exhibited a broad substrate scope, including (hetero)aryl&#8208;substituted and aliphatic alkenes of different substitution patterns and with diverse functionalities. They also displayed high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. Using experimental and computational approaches, a detailed mechanistic study of the positional isomerization regime suggested a redox&#8208;neutral alkyl&#8208;type mechanism via an isolable iron(II)&#8208;hydride species. This study indicated the stereo&#8208; and rate&#8208;determining &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination step occurs through a two&#8208;state reactivity resulting in spin acceleration and a stereoselectivity correlated to these spin state changes. This work also elucidated the peculiar and critical role of the anilido&#8208;aldimine skeleton on the reactivity.

         <title>Regulating Promiscuous Catalysis via Substrate&#8208;Induced Transient Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel substrate&#8208;induced transient co&#8208;assembly between a short Lys&#8208;rich peptide and Fmoc&#8208;Gly&#8208;OH. In the activated state, the assembly exhibits promiscuous catalytic activity through the rate enhancements of hydrolysis and C&#9552;N condensation reactions. Over time, the substrate Fmoc&#8208;Gly&#8208;OH is cleaved into smaller fragments, leading to the collapse of the hydrogel and a decrease in catalytic activity.








Abstract
In nature, substrate&#8208;induced assembly is a fundamental requirement for a wide range of enzyme&#8208;driven chemical transformations. Systems chemists have introduced synthetic substrate analogues that have proven effective in enhancing catalytic activities of assembling peptide folds, and mimic primitive enzymes. However, how catalytic promiscuity, the ability of one catalyst to catalyse multiple orthogonal reactions, might have shaped the diversification of prebiotic chemistry, remains largely unaddressed. Herein, we report a novel transient, substrate&#8208;induced co&#8208;assembly between a lysine&#8208;rich pre&#8208;assembling peptide and Fmoc&#8208;glycine. The nanostructure formed under nonequilibrium conditions provides the suitable microenvironment to promote the potential of catalytically active amino acids, performing orthogonal hydrolysis and C&#9552;N condensation reactions. Simultaneously, carbamate bond cleavage of the labile Fmoc group destabilises the co&#8208;assembly in the activated state, causing the structure to collapse gradually. By encoding catalytic promiscuity into assembling building blocks under kinetic control, we shed light on the emergence of primitive catalysis with broad substrate scope at the origin of life.

         <title>The Laccase&#8208;Like Mechanism in Peroxymonosulfate&#8208;Based Oxidation System for Water Decontamination: Dual&#8208;Substrate Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposed that direct electron transfer (DET)&#8208;dominated peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based advanced oxidation processes (PMS&#8208;AOPs) are a kind of laccase&#8208;like process, since they share similar oxidation mechanisms including dual&#8208;substrate activation, DET mechanism, pollutant polymerization, and relatively high redox potential. This new discovery means that laccase will be a good reference to develop high&#8208;performance catalysts for PMS&#8208;AOPs.








Abstract
This study demonstrates that direct electron transfer (DET)&#8208;dominated peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based advanced oxidation processes (PMS&#8208;AOPs) share a similar oxidation mechanism with laccase, including dual&#8208;substrate activation, DET mechanism, polymerization of organic pollutants, and relatively high redox potential at active site. To verify this point, a detachable catalyst (MnPc/CNT) was used. Neither manganese phthalocyanine (MnPc) nor carbon nanotubes (CNT) could efficiently catalyze PMS to remove phenol (PE), whereas MnPc/CNT achieved complete PE elimination primarily through a DET mechanism. In this process, PE was mainly removed via polymerization. Importantly, galvanic cell experiments and density functional theory calculations showed that MnPc/CNT can simultaneously activate both PE and PMS, whereas MnPc or CNT alone cannot. This dual&#8208;substrate activation phenomenon was seldom reported in PMS&#8208;AOPs. Comparative studies showed that MnPc/CNT, FePc/CNT, and CoPc/CNT exhibited significantly higher PE removal efficiency than NiPc/CNT, CuPc/CNT, and ZnPc/CNT, which correlated with their higher open circuit potentials. Since&#160;current catalyst design strategies for PMS&#8208;AOPs remain largely empirical and enzyme is highly efficient catalyst, this laccase&#8208;like mechanism means that the laccase&#8208;mimetic approach will be a promising direction for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts.

         <title>SiR&#8208;XActin: A Fluorescent Probe for Imaging Actin Dynamics in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SiR&#8208;XActin is a far&#8208;red fluorescent probe for live&#8208;cell imaging of actin that avoids genetic modification and minimizes disruption of actin dynamics, due to its lower binding affinity. Based on jasplakinolide&#8208;like natural product hybrids and Si&#8211;Rhodamine, it offers photostable live&#8208;cell no&#8208;wash staining across cell types and microscopy techniques. Fluorophore exchange allows multicolor labeling and combination with other probes or chemigenetic tools.








Abstract
Imaging actin&#8208;dependent processes in live cells is important for understanding numerous biological processes. However, currently used natural&#8208;product&#8208;based fluorescent probes for actin filaments affect the dynamics of actin polymerization and can induce undesired cellular phenotypes. Here, we introduce SiR&#8208;XActin, a simplified jasplakinolide&#8208;based, far&#8208;red fluorescent probe that enables bright and photostable staining in various cell types without requiring genetic modifications. Due to its relatively weak binding affinity, the probe exhibits minimal cytotoxicity and labels actin filaments without significantly altering actin dynamics. Furthermore, SiR&#8208;XActin is suitable for time&#8208;resolved, live&#8208;cell super&#8208;resolution STED microscopy. Exchanging the SiR fluorophore in SiR&#8208;XActin for other fluorophores yields probes in different colors. All these properties make SiR&#8208;XActin and its analogs powerful tools for studying actin dynamics using live&#8208;cell fluorescence microscopy.

         <title>Discovery of a Cryptic Pocket in EcDsbA Opens New Opportunities for Antibacterial Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamics&#8208;driven fragment&#8208;based approach reveals a cryptic pocket in EcDsbA, enabling the rational design of inhibitors beyond its canonical substrate&#8208;binding site.








Abstract
We have used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize dynamics in the bacterial oxidoreductase enzyme Escherichia coli disulfide bond protein A (EcDsbA). Through this process we identified a cryptic pocket in the structure. We demonstrate that we can identify small molecule &#8220;fragments&#8221; that bind entirely within this cryptic site. The fragments bind to the cryptic pocket with unusually slow kinetics and a preference for interacting with the oxidized state of EcDsbA where the two cysteine residues at the active site form a disulfide bond. We characterize the mechanism of binding, involving conformational changes in the active&#8208;site helix of EcDsbA, which are observed preferentially in the oxidized state. This dynamics&#8208;driven binding mechanism explains both the slow kinetics and the redox&#8208;dependent binding of the ligands. Furthermore, we demonstrate that compounds binding to the cryptic pocket inhibit EcDsbA activity.

&lt;p&gt;A dynamics-driven fragment-based approach reveals a cryptic pocket in &lt;i&gt;Ec&lt;/i&gt;DsbA, enabling the rational design of inhibitors beyond its canonical substrate-binding site.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize dynamics in the bacterial oxidoreductase enzyme &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; disulfide bond protein A (&lt;i&gt;Ec&lt;/i&gt;DsbA). Through this process we identified a cryptic pocket in the structure. We demonstrate that we can identify small molecule &#8220;fragments&#8221; that bind entirely within this cryptic site. The fragments bind to the cryptic pocket with unusually slow kinetics and a preference for interacting with the oxidized state of &lt;i&gt;Ec&lt;/i&gt;DsbA where the two cysteine residues at the active site form a disulfide bond. We characterize the mechanism of binding, involving conformational changes in the active-site helix of &lt;i&gt;Ec&lt;/i&gt;DsbA, which are observed preferentially in the oxidized state. This dynamics-driven binding mechanism explains both the slow kinetics and the redox-dependent binding of the ligands. Furthermore, we demonstrate that compounds binding to the cryptic pocket inhibit &lt;i&gt;Ec&lt;/i&gt;DsbA activity. These findings highlight the value of dynamics data in identification of the cryptic pocket and identify a new target site for developing more potent inhibitors of &lt;i&gt;Ec&lt;/i&gt;DsbA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Structural Transformations of Zinc(II) Knotted Cage Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic control over coordination environments and subcomponent sequences enabled the formation and stabilization of trefoil perplexanes and trefoil tetrahedral knotted cages. Peripheral crosslinkers diminished framework stability to tune host&#8211;guest behavior and dynamic exchange, while mechanical entanglement modulated self&#8208;sorting and guest binding, offering routes to future functional designs. 








Abstract
Interwoven architectures feature in biomolecules such as proteins, DNA, and RNA. However, the high&#8208;yielding syntheses and controlled structural transformations of artificial interwoven structures, particularly those exhibiting intricate topologies and bifurcated strands, remain a challenge. In this study, we present a rational design strategy that harnesses the rigidity of tailored ligands in combination with zinc coordination to direct the self&#8208;assembly process, thus enabling the controlled synthesis of covalently linked trefoil perplexane and trefoil tetrahedral knotted cage frameworks. We further elucidate the role of structural rigidity in governing framework transformations, demonstrating two&#8208;way interconversion between interwoven and non&#8208;interwoven architectures, accompanied by tunable guest encapsulation and release. Notably, the incorporation of peripheral crosslinkers was found to lock the cage conformation, thereby regulating its guest binding properties. In addition, the sequence of subcomponent addition was found to be critical to the product outcome: Initial construction of a covalently&#8208;linked knotted cage framework stabilizes kinetic intermediates during self&#8208;assembly, providing access to distinct products.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Sulfur&#8208;Dots Induced Spatiotemporal PhotoRDRP for Multi&#8208;Arm Star Functional Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free photoRDRP for functional polymers: Metal&#8208;free sulfur&#8208;dots (S&#8208;dots) mediated photoinduced reversible deactivation radical polymerization (photoRDRP) strategy is developed for the production of well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;arm star copolymers with dual stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. The resulting smart polymers exhibited precise architecture control and self&#8208;assembly behavior.








Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;dots (S&#8208;dots) serve as a cost&#8208;effective and non&#8208;toxic alternative to traditional photocatalysts or transition metals typically required in photoinduced reversible deactivation radical polymerization (photoRDRP). Herein, we report a facile and efficient method for synthesizing well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;arm star polymers through S&#8208;dots mediated photoRDRP under ambient conditions. This approach enables precise control over polymer growth with excellent spatiotemporal control over polymerization, as evidenced by the ability to pause and resume polymerization with UVA light (&#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switching). This methodology was successfully applied to produce a variety of polymer architectures, including multi&#8208;arm star homopolymers and dual&#8208;responsive diblock and triblock copolymers. Among these, the synthesized 4&#8208;arm star [poly(N,N&#8208;dimethyl acrylamide)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(butyl acrylate)]4&#8208;Br [4&#8208;arm star (PDMA&#8208;b&#8208;PDMAEMA&#8208;b&#8208;PBA)4&#8208;Br] triblock copolymer was used to assess pH and temperature responsiveness. This work introduces a sustainable, metal&#8208;free route for the development of next&#8208;generation smart polymers suitable for biomedical and environmental applications and highlights the versatility of S&#8208;dots as a catalyst.

         <title>Chiral Plasmonic Sensors: Fundamentals and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript illustrates various chiral plasmonic sensor modalities, including colorimetry, electrochemistry, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), photoluminescence (PL) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Leveraging chemical and physical chiral imprinting strategies, these platforms achieve nanoscale chirality, enabling highly enantioselective molecular recognition and signal amplification across all detection formats.








Abstract
Chiral plasmonic sensors have emerged as powerful tools for the enantioselective detection of biomolecules, addressing key limitations of conventional techniques such as circular dichroism (CD), chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In this review, we introduce a unifying framework based on physical and chemical chiral imprinting strategies to design nanostructures with tailored chiroptical activity. We explore the fabrication of both discrete and assembled plasmonic architectures through methods including top&#8208;down lithography, DNA&#8208;guided assembly, soft templates, and chiral molecule&#8208;directed growth. These platforms have enabled highly sensitive chiral sensing via localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)&#8208;based CD, colorimetry, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), photoluminescence (PL), and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). We describe the underlying sensing mechanisms, detection limits, and the influence of nanostructure geometry and composition on chiral signal generation. Recent applications in biosensing, disease diagnostics, and asymmetric catalysis monitoring are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss current challenges and future directions for integrating chiral plasmonic sensors into practical analytical systems, offering a comprehensive overview of their conceptual foundations, fabrication strategies (with emphasis on chiral imprinting), and application landscape.

         <title>Facile Access to Chelating CAArC&#8208;Phosphine (CAArCPhos) Palladium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protection group strategy using methoxyisoindolines as protected iminium equivalents was developed to allow late&#8208;stage functionalization of 4&#8208;bromo isoindoliumsalts, enabling the synthesis of 4&#8208;(diphenylphosphino) isoindolium salts. The phosphine functionality acts as a directing group for the palladation of the cyclic amino(aryl) carbene&#8208;phosphine (CAArCPhos) ligand by an acetate&#8208;assisted concerted&#8208;metalated deprotonation (CMD)&#8208;like process.








Abstract
In this article, we present a synthetic route to 4&#8208;(diphenyl&#8208;phosphino) isoindolium salts based on a new protecting group strategy. Key to success is the use of hemi&#8208;aminal methyl ether precursors, which serve as base&#8208;stable iminium salt equivalents that enable halogen&#8208;metal exchange and subsequent functionalization. After removal of the protecting group, the catalytically active palladium(II) complexes are formed of phosphine isoindolium salts by a CMD&#8208;like metalation process, producing the first examples of chelating cyclic amino(aryl) carbene complexes. Calculations on the mechanism support an acetate&#8208;assisted intramolecular palladation of the cyclic amino(aryl) carbene&#8208;phosphine (CAArCPhos) ligand enabled by the phosphine directing group through a six&#8208;membered transition state.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Assembly of &#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Substituted DOTAs as Superior and Universal Platforms for Multifunctional Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step multi&#8208;component synthetic approach is reported to construct &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted DOTAs, which required tedious multi&#8208;step synthesis in all previous works. The synthesized &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted DOTAs showed improved performance for developing multifunctional theranostics and represent a universal platform for bioconjugation. 








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Substituted DOTAs are promising chelators for MRI contrast agents owing to the improved coordination stability and relaxivity of the corresponding Gd(III) complexes. However, their broader application is limited by significant synthetic challenges arising from their multi&#8208;component nature. In this work, we report&#8212;for the first time&#8212;the use of multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs) to assemble all necessary building blocks of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted DOTAs in a single step. This strategy yields derivatives with faster coordination kinetics. Furthermore, we extend their application to luminescent lanthanide probes, achieving improved photophysical properties. This MCR approach offers a versatile solution for establishing a library of functionalized diagnostic and therapeutic agents.

     alt="One-Step Assembly of &#945;-Aryl-Substituted DOTAs as Superior and Universal Platforms for Multifunctional Theranostics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A one-step multi-component synthetic approach is reported to construct &#945;-aryl-substituted DOTAs, which required tedious multi-step synthesis in all previous works. The synthesized &#945;-aryl-substituted DOTAs showed improved performance for developing multifunctional theranostics and represent a universal platform for bioconjugation. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#945;-Substituted DOTAs are promising chelators for MRI contrast agents owing to the improved coordination stability and relaxivity of the corresponding Gd(III) complexes. However, their broader application is limited by significant synthetic challenges arising from their multi-component nature. In this work, we report&#8212;for the first time&#8212;the use of multi-component reactions (MCRs) to assemble all necessary building blocks of &#945;-aryl-substituted DOTAs in a single step. This strategy yields derivatives with faster coordination kinetics. Furthermore, we extend their application to luminescent lanthanide probes, achieving improved photophysical properties. This MCR approach offers a versatile solution for establishing a library of functionalized diagnostic and therapeutic agents. We are convinced that this work will reshape the field, inspiring broader exploration of &#945;-aryl-substituted DOTA derivatives and unlocking their full potential in next-generation biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of Cryogenic Electrolyte with Organic&#8208;Free Solvation Structure for Wide&#8208;Temperature Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming at broadening the temperature range of aqueous zinc metal batteries, a weak solvation shell electrolyte is proposed by introducing proline additive. By reconfiguring the hydrogen&#8208;bond network and facilitating rapid desolvation process, the designed electrolyte enables homogeneous zinc deposition and steady electrochemical performance without parasitic reaction across a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Albeit the promising performance at ambient temperatures, the development of zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) is still haunted by the freezing&#8208;prone characteristic of aqueous electrolytes and the deteriorative interface reaction in extreme scenarios. Especially at low&#8208;temperature conditions, the abundant hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) between H2O molecules inevitably drive the aqueous solution transform into an orderly frozen state, resulting in sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, a bio&#8208;inspired cryogenic electrolyte is proposed, and the strong interaction between proline additive and H2O solvent effectively disrupts the H&#8208;bond network, thereby depressing the freezing point while maintaining high ionic conductivity under extremely&#8208;low temperatures. Furthermore, the tailored weak and organic&#8208;free solvation structures facilitate rapid desolvation of Zn2+ ions, and the reduced H2O activity mitigates parasitic reactions on Zn anode surface, thus guaranteeing reversible zinc deposition and dendrite&#8208;free interface. Consequently, the anti&#8208;freezing electrolyte endows Zn||Zn cells with durable cyclic behavior over 2500&#160;h. The PANI||Zn cell&#160;demonstrates excellent temperature adaptability from &#8722;30 to 60 &#176;C, achieving a reversible capacity of 173.6&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 60 &#176;C and maintaining 93.6% capacity retention after 1300 cycles at &#8722;30 &#176;C. This work reports a practical electrolyte design strategy for ZMBs in harsh environments, promoting the future application of low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant aqueous batteries.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Arabinogalactans from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Cell Wall up to the 92&#8208;mer and Structure&#8211;Conformation&#8211;Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An arabinogalactan 92&#8208;mer from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall has been synthesized through an orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl&#160;ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, precluding such issues as aglycone transfer. Structure&#8211;conformation&#8211;activity studies revealed the surface&#8208;exposed 30&#8208;mer epitope to be the most bioactive molecule capable of activating NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling pathways while still preserving cell viability.








Abstract
Arabinogalactans (AG) from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cell wall represent potential therapeutic agents against the notorious disease tuberculosis (TB). However, the synthetic access to these long, highly branched, and complex arabinogalactans remains a challenging task, hindering structure&#8211;activity relationship studies. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of arabinogalactan 92&#8208;mer 1 and shorter sequences 14&#8208;mer 2, 30&#8208;mer 3, and 50&#8208;mer 4 from M. tuberculosis cell envelope via an orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which avoids such issues as aglycone transfer inherent to one&#8208;pot assemblies based on thioglycosides. The synthetic route also features the following characteristics: 1) highly stereoselective construction of eight 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;Araf&#8208;(1&#8594;2) linkages via hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery strategy; 2) effective one&#8208;pot assembly of several linear and branched glycans by strategic utilizations of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates, ortho&#8208;alkynylbenzoates, and ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates; 3) a one&#8208;pot and convergent [(7&#160;&#215;&#160;2&#160;+&#160;7)&#160;&#215;&#160;2&#160;+&#160;50] assembly of arabinogalactan 92&#8208;mer with the simultaneous formations of six furanosidic bonds. Conformational analysis using molecular dynamics simulations and NMR spectroscopy, as well as immunological studies of synthetic arabinogalactans 1&#8211;4 in human cell models, revealed that the surface&#8208;exposed 30&#8208;mer 3 epitope induced only a modest NF&#8208;&#954;B activation while preserving cell viability.

         <title>Fully Aromatic Fluorinated Polyamide Nanofilms with Molecular Gating for Ultrafast Crude Oil Fractionation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully aromatic fluorinated polyamide (FAFPA) nanofilms feature a switchable molecular gating&#8208;on/gating&#8208;off state to activate and reconstruct sub&#8208;nanochannels for the permselectivity of hydrocarbon liquids, enabling ultrafast and stable crude oil fractionation. The gating&#8208;on FAFPA nanofilms show an unprecedented separation factor for 1,3,5&#8208;triisopropylbenzene of about 33 and toluene permeance of over 2&#160;L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1, which surpasses the permselectivity of most reported membranes.








Abstract
Crude oil is the &#8220;black gold&#8221; of the world and its fractionation by thermal distillation is a highly energy&#8208;consuming process. Polymer membranes are manifesting the potential in revolutionizing crude oil fractionation for developing energy&#8208;efficient, low&#8208;footprint petrochemical engineering. Nevertheless, conventional polymer membranes suffer from inferior fractionation performance with unsatisfied permeance and selectivity owing to their polar channel chemistry as well as low&#8208;connective and vulnerable channel architecture. We report a kind of robust, fully aromatic fluorinated polyamide (FAFPA) nanofilm that features a switchable molecular gating&#8208;on/gating&#8208;off state to activate and reconstruct sub&#8208;nanochannels for the permselectivity of hydrocarbon liquids, enabling ultrafast and stable crude oil fractionation. We demonstrate the gating&#8208;on state is launched by the interplay of FAFPA networks and polar&#8208;matched trigger molecules bearing &#945;&#8208;H such as alcohols and ketones, redefining the sub&#8208;nanochannel chemistry and improving the spatial connectivity of sub&#8208;nanochannels to accelerate the selective transport of hydrocarbons. The gating&#8208;on FAFPA nanofilms show a record&#8208;high separation factor of 33 for 1,3,5&#8208;triisopropylbenzene with a molecular weight of 204&#160;Da as well as a profound n&#8208;hexane permeance, 24&#8208;fold higher than that of the gating&#8208;off state. Moreover, these gating&#8208;on FAFPA nanofilms can stably handle typical black crude oil at an elevated temperature of 80 &#176;C for garnering a 32&#8208;fold increased permeance while sustaining nearly constant selectivity toward hydrocarbons.

         <title>Unveiling the Stereochemical Uncertainty of Polyol Scaffolds: Total Synthesis of Mycapolyol E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a combination of total synthesis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, Aggarwal and coworkers have unveiled the stereochemical uncertainties of the complex metabolite mycapolyol E. An elegant stereoselective iterative diboration&#8208;homologation sequence has been used to build one of the longest 1,3&#8208;polyols ever constructed.








Abstract
Mycapolyol E is a cytotoxic metabolite, isolated from the marine sponge Mycale izuensis. After isolation, the stereochemistry of the 1,3&#8208;polyol fragment remained uncertain. Aggarwal and coworkers have solved this puzzle in their recent publication in Angewandte Chemie Novit through a combination of total synthesis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The total synthesis of mycapolyol E was completed in 20 steps, the longest linear sequence, using iterative diboration/homologation reactions as key transformations to assemble the complete carbon backbone with exquisite regio&#8208; and stereocontrol (https://doi.org/10.1002/anov.70003).

&lt;p&gt;Through a combination of total synthesis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, Aggarwal and coworkers have unveiled the stereochemical uncertainties of the complex metabolite mycapolyol E. An elegant stereoselective iterative diboration-homologation sequence has been used to build one of the longest 1,3-polyols ever constructed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mycapolyol E is a cytotoxic metabolite, isolated from the marine sponge &lt;i&gt;Mycale izuensis&lt;/i&gt;. After isolation, the stereochemistry of the 1,3-polyol fragment remained uncertain. Aggarwal and coworkers have solved this puzzle in their recent publication in &lt;i&gt;Angewandte Chemie Novit&lt;/i&gt; through a combination of total synthesis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The total synthesis of mycapolyol E was completed in 20 steps, the longest linear sequence, using iterative diboration/homologation reactions as key transformations to assemble the complete carbon backbone with exquisite regio- and stereocontrol (&lt;a target="_blank"

         <title>Electrocatalytic Alcohol Oxidation to Aldehyde Through Direct Dehydrogenation Mechanism Using a High&#8208;Performance Pt/Co3O4 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalytic direct dehydrogenation mechanism (DDM) has been proposed for the efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols to aldehyde compounds. Such a mechanism has been demonstrated and validated on Pt/Co3O4/CC catalyst developed for efficient glycolaldehyde dimer synthesis, which features a FE of as high as &#8764;100.0%, a selectivity of 99.0% and a productivity of 204.9&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, ranking among the highest of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts in neutral electrolyte.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic upgrading of low&#8208;value carbon sources has been widely regarded as a green approach for synthesizing diverse chemicals and promising route to attain carbon neutrality goals. However, according to the prevailing reactive oxygen species&#8208;mediated mechanism (ROSMM), these reactions suffer from harsh reaction conditions (strong basic electrolyte) and high energy costs (high reaction potential, especially under neutral conditions). Here, a novel electrochemical direct dehydrogenation mechanism (DDM) has been proposed. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept, Pt/Co3O4/CC catalyst has been developed to accelerate the dehydrogenation reaction for efficient upgrading of ethylene glycol to glycolaldehyde dimer. Impressively, an ultralow potential of 0.4&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at a current density of 3.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;100.0%, a selectivity of 99.0% and an extra&#8208;high productivity of 204.9&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in neutral electrolyte have been obtained, which are among the highest of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts ever reported. Various value&#8208;added aldehydes can be obtained by similar approach. The proposed direct dehydrogenation mechanism offers novel perspectives for electrocatalyst design, reaction pathway modulation, and energy consumption reduction in the syntheses of high&#8208;value chemicals by electrocatalytic upgrading reactions.

         <title>Modular Design of Polymer Donors Regulates Solution Aggregation and Stretchability of Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Modular design of PTzBI&#8208;dF&#8208;Si balances solubility and aggregation in o&#8208;xylene, enabling fibrillar morphologies and mechanically robust stretchable organic solar cells.








Abstract
The use of nonhalogenated solvents in organic solar cell (OSC) manufacturing is crucial for environmental sustainability but remains hindered by difficulties in achieving optimal thin&#8208;film morphologies. In particular, controlling solution&#8208;state aggregation to form well&#8208;defined fibrillar networks that enable high device performance is a central challenge. Here, we present a modular molecular design strategy based on the PTzBI polymer platform, enabling simultaneous tuning of energy levels, crystalline packing, and chain flexibility to address this limitation. The resulting polymer, PTzBI&#8208;dF&#8208;Si, integrates a fluorinated backbone and siloxane&#8208;terminated side chains, showing balanced solubility and controlled solution&#8208;state aggregation in o&#8208;xylene. These network&#8208;like solution aggregates translate into enhanced molecular crystallinity and a well&#8208;organized fibrillar morphology in the solid film. The corresponding PTzBI&#8208;dF&#8208;Si:L8&#8208;BO blends achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.9% in rigid OSCs. Moreover, PTzBI&#8208;dF&#8208;Si exhibits ductile deformation with a fracture strain of &#8764;20%, leading to intrinsically stretchable OSCs with a PCE over 16%, retaining&#160;&gt;80% of the initial PCE under 40% strain. These results highlight the promise of rational, modular polymer design in advancing nonhalogenated&#8208;solvent processed, high&#8208;efficiency, and mechanically robust OSCs for scalable and wearable electronic applications.

         <title>Counteranion&#8208;Controlled Chemodivergent Transfer&#8208;Hydrothiolation/Carbothiolation Using Thioethers as Bifunctional Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a counteranion&#8208;controlled Rh&#8208;catalytic system for the chemodivergent functionalization of alkenes via C(sp3)&#9472;S bond cleavage. The use of Rh(COD)2OTf promotes Markovnikov transfer&#8208;hydrothiolation. Alternatively, Rh(COD)2BF4 enables unprecedented intermolecular carbothiolation, where thioethers act as dual carbon and sulfur donors, forming both C(sp3)&#9472;S and C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bonds.








Abstract
The pursuit of catalysis capable of forging C(sp3)&#9472;S bonds is extremely desired because these bonds have substantial importance in pharmaceuticals, functional materials, and organic synthesis. Hydrothiolation and carbothiolation of feedstock alkenes are among the most straightforward and prominent approaches to C(sp3)&#9472;S bond formations. However, hydrothiolation of alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes typically proceeds in an anti&#8208;Markovnikov fashion, and carbothiolation predominantly relies on three&#8208;component coupling strategies using highly reactive pre&#8208;functionalized electrophilic sulfur sources and nucleophilic carbon sources. Herein, by strategically using heterolytic cleavage of C(sp3)&#9472;S bond, we report a chemodivergent transfer&#8208;hydrothiolation and carbothiolation of alkenes with thioethers serving as bifunctional reagents. The chemo&#8208;control is achieved through careful selection of the counteranion associated with the Rh&#8208;center. Counteranions with relatively strong coordinating ability, such as TfO&#8722;, promote an unusual Markovnikov transfer&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene reaction. Conversely, noncoordinating counteranions, such as BF4&#8722;, enable an unprecedented intermolecular thioether&#8208;ene reaction that adds thioethers directly across alkenes. Mechanistic and computational studies elucidated that the coordination or noncoordination of counteranions on Rh can alter the basicity of the thiolate, resulting in chemodivergence.

&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of catalysis capable of forging C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;S bonds is extremely desired because these bonds have substantial importance in pharmaceuticals, functional materials, and organic synthesis. Hydrothiolation and carbothiolation of feedstock alkenes are among the most straightforward and prominent approaches to C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;S bond formations. However, hydrothiolation of alkyl-substituted alkenes typically proceeds in an &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-Markovnikov fashion, and carbothiolation predominantly relies on three-component coupling strategies using highly reactive pre-functionalized electrophilic sulfur sources and nucleophilic carbon sources. Herein, by strategically using heterolytic cleavage of C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;S bond, we report a chemodivergent transfer-hydrothiolation and carbothiolation of alkenes with thioethers serving as bifunctional reagents. The chemo-control is achieved through careful selection of the counteranion associated with the Rh-center. Counteranions with relatively strong coordinating ability, such as TfO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, promote an unusual Markovnikov transfer-thiol-ene reaction. Conversely, noncoordinating counteranions, such as BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, enable an unprecedented intermolecular thioether-ene reaction that adds thioethers directly across alkenes. Mechanistic and computational studies elucidated that the coordination or noncoordination of counteranions on Rh can alter the basicity of the thiolate, resulting in chemodivergence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbonyl&#8208;Anchoring Stabilized Copper Single Sites with Cavity&#8208;Enhanced Mass Transport for Acetylene&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Electrosynthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
Cucurbit[6]uril&#8208;anchored copper (CB[6]&#8208;Cu) is reported as a stable single&#8208;site catalyst, achieving a 95.39% Faradaic efficiency for C2H4 at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in electrocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation (EAH). The single&#8208;Cu&#8208;site and adjacent cavity structure facilitates optimal reactant coverage and disrupted hydrogen bonding, suppressing side reactions. The general applicability of this strategy is shown with CB[6]&#8208;Co for hydroxylamine synthesis.








Abstract
Controlling mass transfer and adsorption in single&#8208;site catalysts is critical for the activity and selectivity of heterogeneous electrocatalytic hydrogenation, but structural fragility at large current densities (&#8805;200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) makes their practical application challenging. Here, taking acetylene (C2H2) hydrogenation to ethylene (C2H4) as an example, cucurbit[6]uril&#8208;coordinated copper (CB[6]&#8208;Cu) is theoretically predicted and experimentally proven to be the desired carbonyl&#8208;anchoring isolated Cu site with engineered mass transport. CB[6]&#8208;Cu demonstrates an outstanding Faradaic efficiency of 95.4% for C2H4, which significantly suppresses the competitive coupling and hydrogen evolution reactions at 300&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a turnover frequency of 2.91 s&#8722;1 and 65&#160;h of continuous stable operation. The distinctive C2H2 adsorption configuration and broken hydrogen bond network are revealed to result in optimal coverage and a sufficient supply of C2H2 feedstocks, accounting for the remarkable C2H4 performance. The extended CB[6]&#8208;Co also exhibits enhanced NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH electrosynthesis performance, highlighting its potential.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Matched Nonpolar Pore Surfaces Enhance Alkane Recognition Toward Natural Gas Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) featuring zigzag aromatic pore channels can achieve specific capture of V&#8208;shaped C3H8 and linear C2H6 molecules from ternary gas mixtures, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of shape&#8208;matched pore architectures and nonpolar pore surfaces.








Abstract
Efficiently removing C3H8 and C2H6 from natural gas remains a formidable challenge in meeting industrial purification demands. Traditional strategies have primarily focused on subtle polarizability differences among alkane molecules, there have been no reported efforts that exploit their substantial shape disparities for separation purposes. Hence, we customized a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), Zn&#8208;BPDP, featuring zigzag aromatic pore channels. Zn&#8208;BPDP achieves specific capture of V&#8208;shaped C3H8 and linear C2H6 through the synergistic effect of shape&#8208;matched and nonpolar pore surfaces. Ultimately, Zn&#8208;BPDP exhibits considerable C3/C2 adsorption capacities, along with outstanding C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivities. Under harsh simulated industrial conditions, including high flow rate (4&#160;mL&#160;min&#8722;1), elevated temperature (318&#160;K), and saturated humidity (RH&#160;=&#160;100%), Zn&#8208;BPDP demonstrates superior separation performance for C3H8/C2H6/CH4 mixtures. Theoretical calculations further indicate that shape&#8208;matched aromatic surfaces provide enlarged contact interfaces with both C3H8 and C2H6 through multiple C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions, thereby presenting an innovative approach for natural gas upgrading.

         <title>In Situ Chemical Construction of Ultrathin Zn2+&#8208;Conductive Interphase for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;thin zinc&#8208;polyphosphate/g&#8208;C3N4 (PPAG) artificial interphase was constructed on Zn foil. This hybrid architecture integrates chain&#8208;structured polyphosphates with g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;induced negative microelectric fields, creating Zn2+&#8208;selective ion pathways, which ensures desolvation effect and uniform Zn2+ deposition. Consequently, the engineered Zn@PPAG electrode exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance, surpassing that of most reported artificial interfacial layers.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc (Zn) interfacial chemistry is inherently safe but encounters significant challenges with irreversibility, as exemplified by low Coulombic efficiency (CE) and uncontrollable deposition. Here, an ultra&#8208;thin electrode skin, merely &#8764;100&#160;nm thick and composed of zinc&#8208;polyphosphate and graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) (denoted as PPAG) has been in situ constructed on the Zn anode surface through an ultrafast chemical synthesis. The PPAG layer integrates chain&#8208;like polyphosphate architectures with a ring&#8208;shaped negative microelectric field generated by g&#8208;C3N4, synergistically enabling Zn2+&#8208;dominated charge transport. This unique configuration facilitates long&#8208;range and rapid movement of cations, thereby increasing the Zn2+ transference number from 0.34 (bare Zn) to 0.70, ensuring high&#8208;current operation of the Zn anode. Moreover, the homogeneous dispersion of g&#8208;C3N4 within PPAG provides abundant nucleation sites, simultaneously enabling smooth Zn2+ deposition and suppressing parasitic reactions. Consequently, the Zn@PPAG||Cu half&#8208;cell achieves exceptional cyclability with a CE of 99.67% over 2900 cycles. Furthermore, symmetric cells demonstrate a superior cycling lifespan exceeding 3800 and 1500&#160;h at current densities of 5.0 and 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. This work establishes a universal ultrafast strategy for Zn anode engineering, accelerating practical applications of Zn&#8208;based energy storage systems.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Reconfigurable Optical Structures Using Photomechanical Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial patterning via photodimerization generates localized photomechanical height changes on a single crystal surface. The dimer dissociation rate can be controlled by temperature or light exposure, creating a reconfigurable surface for optical applications.








Abstract
In crystal form, 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;9&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid (4F&#8208;9AC) undergoes a room temperature reversible intermolecular [4&#160;+&#160;4] photodimerization that can be harnessed for photomechanical actuation. This negative photochromic reaction enables high conversion throughout the crystal. Patterned 405&#160;nm excitation of single 4F&#8208;9AC crystals creates localized photo&#8208;dimer regions with an expansion of up to 3% of the total crystal thickness. These photoconverted regions cause reversible surface deformations and changes in birefringence that follow the reaction progress. Temperature dependent rate measurements of the photo&#8208;dimer dissociation yield an activation energy of 97&#160;kJ/mol, making the reversibility rate highly sensitive to temperature. By varying the crystal temperature and the light exposure level, the lifetime of the photomechanical features can be tuned from 40 milliseconds to minutes. This enables rapid updating of images and features using a commercial spatial light modulator. We use this capability to create dynamic surface relief gratings that can steer a diffracted 633&#160;nm probe beam in arbitrary directions. The rapid mechanical response of the crystalline systems permits write&#8211;erase cycles with a duration of&#160;1&#160;s, which compares favorably to polymer systems.

&lt;p&gt;In crystal form, 4-fluoro-9-anthracenecarboxylic acid (&lt;b&gt;4F-9AC&lt;/b&gt;) undergoes a room temperature reversible intermolecular [4&#160;+&#160;4] photodimerization that can be harnessed for photomechanical actuation. This negative photochromic reaction enables high conversion throughout the crystal. Patterned 405&#160;nm excitation of single &lt;b&gt;4F-9AC&lt;/b&gt; crystals creates localized photo-dimer regions with an expansion of up to 3% of the total crystal thickness. These photoconverted regions cause reversible surface deformations and changes in birefringence that follow the reaction progress. Temperature dependent rate measurements of the photo-dimer dissociation yield an activation energy of 97&#160;kJ/mol, making the reversibility rate highly sensitive to temperature. By varying the crystal temperature and the light exposure level, the lifetime of the photomechanical features can be tuned from 40 milliseconds to minutes. This enables rapid updating of images and features using a commercial spatial light modulator. We use this capability to create dynamic surface relief gratings that can steer a diffracted 633&#160;nm probe beam in arbitrary directions. The rapid mechanical response of the crystalline systems permits write&#8211;erase cycles with a duration of&#160;1&#160;s, which compares favorably to polymer systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Stabilized Heterometallic Pair Sites for Selective Ethanol Dehydrogenation on Pt&#8211;Cr&#8211;Ag Alloy Catalysts</title>

Trimetallic PtxCrxAg1&#8208;x (x &lt; 0.1) alloys feature active Pt&#8211;Cr pairs for non&#8208;oxidative ethanol dehydrogenation. Operando X&#8208;ray spectroscopy confirms the preferential formation of Pt&#8211;Cr pairs dispersed throughout an Ag matrix and demonstrates that the Pt&#8211;Cr sites have high activity and selectivity for catalytic ethanol dehydrogenation, while suppressing reactions that deactivate binary Pt&#8211;Ag and Cr&#8211;Ag alloys.








Abstract
Self&#8208;stabilized, heterometallic pair&#8208;sites can enable fine&#8208;tuning of catalytic functionality while also mitigating dynamic structural changes that degrade catalytic performance. This study demonstrates the development and characterization of trimetallic PtxCrxAg1&#8208;2x (x &#8804; 0.1) alloys with active Pt&#8211;Cr pair&#8208;ensembles for non&#8208;oxidative ethanol dehydrogenation, leveraging predictions that favorable bonding stabilizes Pt&#8211;Cr pairs diluted in Ag. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy confirms the preferential formation and stability of Pt&#8211;Cr pairings dispersed throughout the Ag matrix, and ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that Pt&#8211;Cr sites have significant activity for ethanol dehydrogenation, while suppressing reaction processes that deactivate binary Pt&#8211;Ag and Cr&#8211;Ag alloys. This work demonstrates that stabilizing heterometallic pair sites within trimetallic alloys provides a new avenue for designing catalysts with discrete active sites that are durable and highly selective.

         <title>Breaking Interference&#8208;Driven Reversal Currents to Boost Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In cross&#8208;conjugated single&#8208;molecule systems, the presence of destructive quantum interference leads to low conductivity, which is accompanied by the presence of reversal currents. This study demonstrates a novel strategy to dramatically enhance conductance in cross&#8208;conjugated systems by preventing reversal current formation, achieving two orders of magnitude increase in conductance. 








Abstract
Controlling charge transport in single&#8208;molecule junctions is essential for advancing molecular electronics. This study demonstrates a novel strategy to dramatically enhance conductance in cross&#8208;conjugated systems by preventing reversal current formation in destructive quantum interference (DQI) regimes. We design four molecules with meta&#8208;substituted phenyl rings replaced by hydrogen&#8208;bonded diketone (OHO) or boron&#8208;coordinated rings (NBN, NBO, OBO), all maintaining hexagonal cross&#8208;conjugated topology. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal a counterintuitive conductance enhancement arising from suppressed reversal currents. Replacing the prototype m&#8208;phenyl ring (mPh) with diketone (OHO) elevates conductance by one order of magnitude. Further boron coordination synergistically modulates quantum interference and energy levels, achieving an unprecedented two orders of magnitude increase in conductance in OBO (from 10&#8722;5.39 G0 to 10&#8722;3.41 G0). This work establishes a paradigm for efficient conductance modulation via targeted reversal current suppression, enabling rationally designed quantum&#8208;interference molecular devices.

         <title>Studies of &#945;&#8242;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;Epoxyketone Synthesis by Small&#8208;Molecule Flavins and Flavoenzymes</title>

         <dc:description>
A combined synthetic and biochemical approach links the flavoenzyme EpxF to three key steps in epoxomicin biosynthesis. Crystallography, mutagenesis, and 13C&#8208;labeling complete the mechanistic picture of &#945;&#8242;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;epoxyketone formation and illustrate the potential of flavin&#8208;mediated transformations.








Abstract
Epoxomicin is a highly potent natural proteasome inhibitor and the structural scaffold for the anticancer drug carfilzomib. The biosynthesis of its &#945;&#8242;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;epoxyketone warhead involves the flavoenzyme EpxF, but a molecular understanding of the key catalytic reaction cascade remained elusive. Here, we disclose detailed mechanistic insights by characterizing all intermediates in the sequential steps of decarboxylation, desaturation, and epoxidation with synthetic flavins and the flavin&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase EpxF. A high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of EpxF revealed the architecture of the active site and enabled the identification of key catalytic residues. Exploratory docking based on this structure served as a qualitative tool to guide mutagenesis and rationalize substrate recognition. NMR studies with a 13C&#8208;labeled epoxomicin precursor and structure&#8208;based EpxF variants further supported the proposed mechanism. Our integrated approach revealed similarities between synthetic and natural flavin catalysts and offers avenues for developing sustainable biomimetic reactions.

         <title>Repurposing Waste Chemicals to Engineer Redox Mediators for Selective Active Species Modulation in Photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;Like Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a strategy for extracting an efficient catalyst from discarded chemical reagents to construct a photo&#8208;assisted oxidant activation system with customizable activation pathways. While enabling green and sustainable remediation of organic wastewater, this approach also holds promise for applications in selective CO2 reduction, selective H2O2 regeneration, and other high&#8208;value chemical transformations, fostering prosperity across multiple fields.








Abstract
Resource recovery from chemical wastes offers significant economic and environmental opportunities. In particular, repurposing recycled materials to construct light&#8208;driven oxidant activation systems presents a promising strategy for organic wastewater remediation. However, in such a photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like system, precise regulation of active species remains a major challenge, limiting performance optimization. Here, we propose a sustainable approach using catalysts derived from deteriorated potassium iodide (KI) reagents. Theoretical analyses reveal that I&#8722; and I3&#8722; species from degraded KI function as effective redox mediators, generating internal electric fields that substantially lower energy barriers for carrier separation. The resulting catalytic system exhibits outstanding decontamination performance, achieving complete removal of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole with a pseudo&#8208;first&#8208;order rate constant of 0.79&#160;min&#8722;1, representing 3.76&#8208; and 79.00&#8208;fold enhancements over systems using standard KI and single&#8208;based catalysts, respectively. Mechanistic studies confirm the efficient utilization of photogenerated carriers and the selective generation of singlet oxygen through non&#8208;radical pathways. Notably, this novel mechanism shows broad applicability across various oxidant activation systems, with the I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox mediator effectively modifying substrate electronic structures to enhance reactive oxidant interactions. This work introduces an innovative strategy for converting chemical wastes into high&#8208;value materials, advancing sustainable wastewater treatment, and opening new avenues for resource&#8208;efficient chemical applications.

A novel heterometallic T2&#8208;supertetrahedron constructs LiPb3GeS4Cl3, which achieves record high optical performance in its class via lithium activated surface states. 








Abstract
The anisotropic structure building unit involving diverse chemical bond (ABUCB) has been proven effective in exploring high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, through simultaneously enhancing second harmonic generation (SHG) and birefringence (&#8710;n). Building on this concept, we propose a strategy that employs different types of primary tetrahedra to construct anisotropic supertetrahedron (T2). As a demonstration, we report a novel compound assembled by a quasi&#8208;T2&#8208;supertetrahedron, LiPb3GeS4Cl3 (LPGSC), exhibiting the superior optical properties among known thiogermanate halides and supertetrahedron&#8208;chalcogenides. In the structure, there are two crystallographically independent Pb sites: Pb(1) forms the heterometallic T2&#8208;supertetrahedron [GePb(1)3S8], while Pb(2) occupies an interstitial site with a labile coordination environment. As demonstrated by a series of samples LixPb3.5&#8208;x/2GeS4Cl3 (LxPGSC, x&#160;=&#160;1&#8210;0), the Pb(2) site can be substituted by lithium. Together with theoretical studies, we demonstrate that lithium incorporation effectively activates non&#8208;bonding states (Pb&#8208;6s2, S&#8208;3p, Cl&#8208;3p) near the Fermi level. This activation significantly enhances the second&#8208;order NLO susceptibility (LPGSC: d33&#160;=&#160;36.01&#160;vs. AGS: d36&#160;=&#160;18.67 pm V&#8722;1) and polarity anisotropy (LPGSC: &#8710;ncal. = 0.09&#160;vs. AGS: 0.03 at 546&#160;nm).

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Singlet Oxygen Generation via Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Driven Intersystem Crossing in 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two ESIPT&#8208;capable molecules with distinct dimensionalities were designed, exhibiting opposing ESIPT behaviors upon excitation. The 2D THTA undergoes complete ESIPT, enabling efficient intersystem crossing and robust 1O2 generation. This study highlights the pivotal role of ESIPT in triplet&#8208;state formation and pioneers its application for sustainable ESIPT&#8208;based catalysis. 








Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is a key reactive species in photodynamic therapy and organic synthesis. Conventional generation of 1O2 relies on metal&#8208;containing sensitizers to promote intersystem crossing (ISC) and thereby activate molecular oxygen (3O2), which limits biocompatibility and scalability. Here, we report a metal&#8208;free strategy leveraging excited&#8208;state intramolecular&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) to enhance 1O2 production. Two classes of ESIPT&#8208;active materials, 1D polymers and 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs), were systematically compared. Interestingly, while the ESIPT transition in the 1D polymer is incomplete and unstable, 2D COF enables a highly stabilized tautomeric transition, resulting in a persistent metastable state that acts as a gateway to enhanced ISC. This difference is due to a reversed ESIPT pathway dictated by ground&#8208;state geometry. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic studies reveal that the ESIPT transition process in the 2D COF triggers ISC, facilitating 1O2 generation. Thermodynamic analysis reduces the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap and increases dipole moment changes, while spin&#8211;orbit coupling and frontier molecular orbital reorganization indicate kinetic facilitation of ISC. This work highlights the unique advantages of 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;based ESIPT transformations, offering a groundbreaking approach to boosting ISC efficiency and 1O2 generation, expanding the scope of ESIPT in photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Acceleration of [2]Catenane Formation by One of its Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This highlight underscores the most straightforward synthesis of [2]catenanes from readily available molecular precursors: The one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step catenane formation from a crown ether, a linear diamine, and a diester is accelerated by the preformed macrocycle, which stabilizes the two zwitterionic transition states involved in the course of consecutive amide bond formation, the first being a transient pseudorotaxane, the second trapping the crown ether by ring closing of the newly created macrocycle into a [2]catenane.








Abstract
[2]Catenanes were prepared from a crown ether, a diamine, and a diester in moderate to good yields in mild conditions by single&#8208;step, metal&#8208;free active template synthesis. The macrocycle first catalyzes the linear condensation of the diamine and the diester, then it accelerates the cyclization of the bifunctional thread and is incorporated in the catenane, as reported by Zhong et&#160;al. (https://doi.org/10.1002/anov.70004).

         <title>Endogenous Template&#8208;Directed Topological Engineering of Lignite&#8208;Derived Hard Carbons for Kinetically Accelerated Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional group assisted self&#8208;templating strategy is proposed for coal&#8208;based hard carbon. &#8208;OH group chelates with metal ions to form carbonates as templates, promoting closed&#8208;pore structures. C&#9552;O restricts carbon atom movement, preventing graphitization, and inducing a stable F&#8208;rich SEI. The resulting hard carbon for SIBs shows high capacity and superior rate capability.








Abstract
Coal is a promising precursor for the preparation of hard carbon, which shows great commercial potential as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between planar aromatic molecules and the trend toward graphitization lead to a highly ordered carbon structure with narrow interlayer spacing. In this study, a self&#8208;templating strategy is proposed to regulate the closed&#8208;pore structures of coal&#8208;based hard carbon at the molecular level, and finally improve the plateau capacity. The &#8208;OH is beneficial for the formation of closed&#8208;pore structure during carbonization by chelation with metal ions, and C&#9552;O can help to prevent graphitization, increase the interlayer spacing and form hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic SEI through surface functional remodeling with salt in ether&#8208;based electrolytes. The coal&#8208;based hard carbon displays good cycling stability, exhibiting a high reversible capacity (350 mAh g&#8722;1) at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and capacity retention of up to 88% after 8000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. Moreover, the full battery assembled with NVP demonstrates a stable cycling performance. This work provides new insights into the construction of closed pores and the role of carbonyl groups in hard carbons for enhancing sodium storage performance.

A 3D hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (ZNU&#8208;30) is assembled from 1D coordination polymers and demonstrates efficient separation of trace water vapor from C1&#8208;C3 alkene/alkanes and CO2. The cover image symbolizes the capability of ZNU&#8208;30 to capture trace H2O molecules (the orange&#8208;red fish) from CH4 (the larger yellow fish) by a combination of hydrogen bonding and molecular sieving effect. Further details are reported by Banglin Chen, Yuanbin Zhang et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202515257).

The pentagonal&#8208;heptagonal rings act like &#8220;water droplets&#8221; falling into the carbon layers, inducing a water&#8208;like ripple effect in the carbon atomic layers. Consequently, it renders electrons to exhibit a water&#8208;ripple&#8208;like enrichment phenomenon, greatly enhancing sodium storage capability, as demonstrated by Wei Zhang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202512725).

Two flexible framework conformers (FJI&#8208;H29 and FJI&#8208;H41) are prepared, they not only exhibit different responses to the same stimuli, but their responsive behaviors can also be regulated precisely. FJI&#8208;H29 is thermosensitive, it can undergo thermal&#8208;driven deformations and reconstructions. While FJI&#8208;H41 is sensitive to the kinetic energy, it can undergo desolvent&#8208;driven controllable deformations, from in situ shrinkage to stepwise shrinkage. Details of the study are reported by Hong, Yuan, and Chen et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202512049).

A woven polyester fabric conformally coated with microcrystals of bismuth&#8208;based conductive coordination polymer absorbs H2S plume. As reported by Katherine A. Mirica et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202509883), the resulting smart membrane acts as a variable resistor within an electronic circuit, giving a concentration&#8208;dependent signal as the fabric captures the gas. A molecular visualization shows polysulfide chains wrapping Bi nodes that promote multifunctional performance of detection, capture, and detoxification in one electronic textile.

A series of multicomponent covalent organic cages (MCOCs) was synthesized through multicomponent reactions (MCRs), with the largest architecture consisting of up to 54 components. Imitating the coronavirus spike protein, the MCOCs can be easily functionalized with various alcohols to achieve desired properties. Details of this study are reported by Kongzhao Su, Daqiang Yuan et al. in their Research Article (e202514219).

The image illustrates a strategy to lower the desolvation energy of Mg2+ by introducing 7&#8208;aminoindole (7AID) as a non&#8208;direct coordinating additive, as reported by Liuyue Cao et al. in their Communication (e202513213). Rather than directly coordinating with Mg2+, 7AID &#8220;pulls&#8221; solvent molecules away from the cation in a &#8220;tug&#8208;of&#8208;war&#8221; manner. In the bulk electrolyte, 7AID also forms hydrogen bonds and CH&#9472;&#960; interactions with solvent molecules, limiting their mobility and availability for Mg2+ coordination, thereby further facilitating desolvation.

         <title>Catalytic Strategies for Stereoselective Carbohydrate Synthesis: Emerging Concepts for Accessing Challenging Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent developments in catalytic stereoselective carbohydrate synthesis are presented. The converging synthetic trajectories of the catalytic and carbohydrate communities are discussed, including impactful case studies exemplifying noncovalent catalysis, radical catalysis, asymmetric catalysis and new catalytic modalities.








Abstract
The development of innovative catalytic strategies for stereoselective carbohydrate synthesis is rapidly emerging as a theme of general synthetic interest. This research frontier is fuelled by current realization that anomeric and site&#8208;selectivity challenges encountered in carbohydrate chemistry are indeed fascinating fundamental synthetic questions, still yet to be satisfactorily addressed. Although specialist carbohydrate chemistry and catalysis developed largely independently over the past three decades, growing recognition of carbohydrates as an excellent platform for catalytic method development is now generating fresh opportunities to advance our understanding of chemical phenomena. Unexpected catalytic mechanisms are often unearthed in such cross&#8208;disciplinary endeavours. Moreover, new bond&#8208;forming catalytic solutions are in great demand as the definition of biologically relevant glycosidic chemical space has broadened substantially beyond native oligosaccharides to include glycomimetics, rare and non&#8208;classical sugars. Distinctly, the last 5 years is marked by an unprecedented flurry of activity in the development of ground&#8208;breaking catalytic carbohydrate transformations, leading to robust methods that diverge from classical glycosylation approaches. In this minireview, lately emerging concepts such as noncovalent catalyzed glycosylations, radical catalyzed glycosylations, asymmetric catalytic carbohydrate functionalizations and new glycosylation modalities will be examined.

         <title>Catalytic Stereoselective Silyl&#8208; and Boraformylations: Charting a Challenging Road Ahead</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview highlights advances in silyl&#8208; and boraformylation&#8212;CHO and silyl/boryl additions to unsaturated C&#9472;C bonds. While silylformylation has matured, boraformylation remains early&#8208;stage. Enantioselective variants are still elusive, offering key opportunities to develop catalysts for accessing stereochemically complex molecules. 








Abstract
This minireview highlights key milestone discoveries in (stereoselective) silylformylation and boraformylation reactions&#8212;formal additions of a formyl group (CHO) and a silyl or boryl group across unsaturated C&#9472;C bonds, such as those in alkenes, dienes, alkynes, or allene derivatives. Although these transformations have not yet reached the level of maturity of the parent hydroformylation reaction (the addition of CHO and H across an unsaturated C&#9472;C bond), significant progress has nonetheless been achieved. This minireview presents the current state of the art in silylformylation catalysis, emphasizing the chemo&#8208; and diastereoselectivities achieved by leading catalytic systems. In contrast, boraformylation remains in its infancy, with only a handful of examples reported in the literature to date. Notably, catalytic enantioselective variants of both silyl&#8208; and boraformylation reactions have yet to be realized. This limited progress is primarily attributed to the scarcity of catalysts that effectively combine a metal center with a suitable ligand framework. This minireview article underscores the significant opportunities for advancing catalytic enantioselective methodologies in these areas and the potential for accessing structurally diverse, stereochemically complex molecules through these underdeveloped yet promising transformations.

         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous photoelectrodes are widespread for activations of H2O and CO2, while homogeneous photoelectrochemistry with molecular catalysts dominates complex molecule activations in synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great potential for synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability, and stability. This review comprehensively presents the field in a manner accessible to synthetic chemists, including surface techniques for photoelectrode fabrication.








Abstract
Photoelectrodes have traditionally enjoyed widespread attention as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of water and CO2 in energy research, while photoelectrochemistry with homogeneous molecular catalysts dominates the activations of more complex molecules in organic synthesis. Nonetheless, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) offers great benefits to organic synthesis, including catalyst cost&#8208;efficiency, reusability, and stability. This review aims i) for a comprehensive collection of historical and recent examples of iPEC and ii) to present the field in manner and language accessible to synthetic chemists. Conceptual comparisons from photoelectrodes to homogeneous (electro&#8208;activated) photocatalysts to dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrodes will be drawn, with advantages and limitations of each catalyst archetype discussed. Surface techniques for fabrication of photoelectrodes will be introduced. Future semiconductor photoelectrode materials, substrate targets, and conceptual challenges in the field will be highlighted.

         <title>Pyrrole&#8208;Linked Benzimidazolyl Hydrazone Self&#8208;Assembly Forms HCl Channels and Induces Apoptosis in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rare HCl&#8208;selective nanochannel formed by a pyrrole&#8208;linked benzimidazolyl&#8208;hydrazone that self&#8208;assembles across lipid bilayers, showing remarkable transport activity with an EC50 of 0.016 mol%. Uniquely, it effectively kills cancer cells while sparing healthy ones and significantly outperforms doxorubicin (DOX) against MCF&#8208;7&#8208;derived 3D spheroids, presenting a promising strategy for targeted cancer therapy.








Abstract
Modulation of intracellular chloride ion concentration by artificially developed ion transporters has been known to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. However, most of these transporters cause harm to healthy cells as well, limiting their applicability in real biological systems. Here, we report a pyrrole&#8208;linked benzimidazolyl&#8208;hydrazone that self&#8208;assembles to form a nanochannel assembly across the lipid bilayer, enabling the selective translocation of HCl, a system rarely reported in the literature. The channel shows an extraordinarily high HCl transport activity with an EC50 value as low as 0.016 mol%, relative to lipid. We demonstrate solid&#8208;state evidence that compound 1 self&#8208;assembles in the presence of HCl to produce organized arrays that include chloride&#8208;filled and water&#8208;filled channels. The formation of a stable HCl channel across the lipid bilayer membrane was verified through electrophysiological experiments, detailed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and quantum mechanical calculations. When tested in cellular systems, the compound showed pronounced toxicity toward cancerous cell lines while remaining relatively nontoxic to cell lines of non&#8208;cancerous origin. Interestingly, compound 1 was also found to inhibit the growth and proliferation of MCF&#8208;7&#8208;derived 3D spheroids with higher efficiency when compared to the commercially available anticancer drug&#9472;doxorubicin (DOX).

&lt;p&gt;Modulation of intracellular chloride ion concentration by artificially developed ion transporters has been known to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. However, most of these transporters cause harm to healthy cells as well, limiting their applicability in real biological systems. Here, we report a pyrrole-linked benzimidazolyl-hydrazone that self-assembles to form a nanochannel assembly across the lipid bilayer, enabling the selective translocation of HCl, a system rarely reported in the literature. The channel shows an extraordinarily high HCl transport activity with an EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value as low as 0.016 mol%, relative to lipid. We demonstrate solid-state evidence that compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; self-assembles in the presence of HCl to produce organized arrays that include chloride-filled and water-filled channels. The formation of a stable HCl channel across the lipid bilayer membrane was verified through electrophysiological experiments, detailed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and quantum mechanical calculations. When tested in cellular systems, the compound showed pronounced toxicity toward cancerous cell lines while remaining relatively nontoxic to cell lines of non-cancerous origin. Interestingly, compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was also found to inhibit the growth and proliferation of MCF-7-derived 3D spheroids with higher efficiency when compared to the commercially available anticancer drug&#9472;doxorubicin (DOX).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Switching Controlled Luminescence in Hybrid Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, controllable coupling of ferroelectric polarization and luminescence behavior has been achieved in a hybrid halide luminescent ferroelectric with multi&#8208;state emission under electric field.








Abstract
Luminescent ferroelectrics have sparked significant attention in integrated photoelectronic devices, optical sensing and storage. Their potential cross&#8208;coupling effect of polarization&#8208;light modulation would offer enormous possibilities for novel functionalities and multi&#8208;level information processing. However, achieving controllable coupling modulation between photoluminescence (PL) and ferroelectric polarization has always been a long&#8208;standing challenge since the first discovery of ferroelectricity in 1921. Moreover, the ferroelectrics equipped with tenably multi&#8208;state emission in a single material has been a blank to date. Herein, we reported the first successful integration and coupling of ferroelectricity and luminescent behavior in a single&#8208;component hybrid material, (Quinuclidinium&#8208;3&#8208;one)2ZrCl5. Remarkably, based on the controllable orientation of dipole ions, its PL intensity can be deliberately modulated by polarization switching under the action of external electric field, achieving a coupling&#8208;induced PL intensity variation ratio as high as 50%, which is unprecedented among reported hybrid ferroelectrics. More interestingly, (Quinuclidinium&#8208;3&#8208;one)2ZrCl5 also exhibits multi&#8208;state emission with PL colors from apricot red to emerald green through varied light&#8208;excitation. This work represents a major breakthrough in luminescent ferroelectrics and would herald the emergence of novel application potential toward smart photoelectronics.

         <title>Regulation of Relay Catalytic Mechanism for Efficient Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NiOOH&#8208;Mo2C@C heterojunction interface is engineered to utilize differential adsorption properties of its phases for methanol and OH&#8722;, thereby regulating the interfacial distribution of reactive species. The spatial regulation facilitates migration kinetics of *CHO intermediates from OH&#8722;&#8208;deficient NiOOH to OH&#8722;&#8208;rich Mo2C surface, enabling relay catalysis to overcome kinetic barriers and enhance methanol oxidation efficiency.








Abstract
The methanol oxidation reaction serves as a representative model for multistep catalytic processes involving diverse intermediates. Catalyst design strategies that spatially arrange discrete active sites, analogous to relay runners, facilitate the sequential activation of reaction steps, thereby enhancing overall catalytic efficiency compared to single&#8208;site catalysts. This approach effectively decouples complex reaction networks into a sequence of coordinated elementary steps, thereby enhancing the production efficiency of the target products. Here, we propose a relay catalysis paradigm through electrochemical in situ construction of NiOOH&#8208;Mo2C@C heterojunction featuring with dual Lewis acid sites. By precisely controlling interfacial methanol/OH&#8722; concentration gradients, nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for formate production is achieved during methanol electrooxidation. Multiscale characterizations combined with density functional theory computations reveal that the engineered interface regulates *CHO intermediate migration from NiOOH to Mo2C domains, thereby effectively shifting the rate&#8208;determining step from *CHO&#8208;OH&#8722; coupling to O&#9472;H bond cleavage. This spatial decoupling strategy reduces the thermodynamic barrier by 1.18&#160;eV. This study elucidates a design strategy that tailors the spatial distribution of electrochemical interface species to guide catalytic pathway optimization. Furthermore, it highlights the essential role of heterojunction&#8208;mediated relay catalysis in enhancing electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of organic small molecules.

         <title>Transsulfurase&#8208;Catalyzed Reversible Modification of C&#8208;Terminal Cysteine and Application for Orthogonal Dual Labeling of Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here the identification of a reversible addition and elimination of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;carboxypropyl (acp) group on the C&#8208;terminal cysteine residues of a broad range of proteins and peptides, specifically mediated by the cystathionine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;synthase (CGS) and cystathionine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lyase (CGL). This study also demonstrates an application of dual&#8208;enzyme mediation for orthogonal dual labeling of proteins.








Abstract
Protein thiol bioconjugation in combination with reversible modification of cysteine is a powerful strategy for orthogonal dual labeling of protein cysteine residues. Here, we utilize recombinant Escherichia coli (E. coli) cultivated in high&#8208;phosphate minimal medium for the expression of ubiquitin G76C, and discovered that cystathionine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;synthase (CGS), an enzyme in bacterial methionine biosynthesis, catalyzes both in cells and in vitro a site&#8208;specific and high&#8208;efficient &#947;&#8208;replacement reaction of the flexible C&#8208;terminal cysteine with O&#8208;succinyl&#8208;homoserine, leading to the addition of a 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;carboxypropyl (acp) group. Mechanistic studies using high&#8208;resolution NMR reveal a very weak ternary association among cystathionine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;synthase, O&#8208;succinyl&#8208;homoserine, and ubiquitin G76C. Cystathionine&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lyase (CGL), involved in cysteine biosynthesis, specifically catalyzes the &#945;,&#947;&#8208;elimination reaction of the modified unit, thereby effectively removing the acp unit in vitro. Their catalytic efficiency and selectivity of both enzymes were evaluated, and each one shows unidirectional catalytic activity for proteins. Reversible modification of C&#8208;terminal cysteines across a broad range of proteins can be achieved by CGS and CGL. Finally, we demonstrated the feasibility of using this two&#8208;enzyme system for orthogonal dual labeling of proteins in combination with thiol bioconjugation techniques. This discovery significantly broadens the toolkit for protein thiol modifications and holds substantial application for the dual site&#8208;specific functionalization of proteins.

         <title>Regulating the Nanosheets Structures in Pitch&#8208;Derived Amorphous Carbons for Efficient Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing a molecular engineering strategy, the nanosheets structure of the pitch&#8208;derived amorphous carbon (PDAC) anode material has been precisely regulated. The results demonstrate that extending the disordered amorphous carbon nanosheets and preventing intersheet spacing contraction not only increases sodium ion storage capacity but also enhances diffusion kinetics, significantly improving the rate capability of the amorphous carbon anode material.








Abstract
Amorphous carbon (AC), prized for their cost&#8208;effectiveness and excellent performance, are promising as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, its amorphous structure challenges balancing high rate capability with high capacity. This study regulates the nanosheets structure of pitch&#8208;derived&#8208;AC (PDAC) through pre&#8208;polymerization&#8208;induced polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons growth, enabling simultaneous enhancement of rate capability and maintenance of high capacity. The regulation of the nanosheets length to 12.27&#160;nm can increase the closed pore volume to 0.062&#160;cm3 g&#8722;1, thereby facilitating the formation of quasi&#8208;metallic sodium clusters, which elevates the specific capacity of PDAC to 377.4&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 in an ester&#8208;based&#8208;electrolyte, with the plateau region contributing up to 68.0%. Furthermore, the extended nanosheets maintain a spacing of 0.396&#160;nm, overcoming the kinetics limitations inherent in accessing plateau capacity at high current. Consequently, a specific capacity of 357.8&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 (incl. 248.1&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 plateau capacity) is achieved at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1, with retention of 253.6&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Additionally, the PDAC demonstrates exceptional cycling stability, retaining 90.4% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles. The critical roles of extending nanosheets, maintaining interlayer spacing, and increasing closed pore volume in enabling efficient Na&#8314; storage and advancing fast&#8208;charging SIBs are systematically elucidated.

Furthermore, the extended nanosheets maintain a spacing of 0.396&#160;nm, overcoming the kinetics limitations inherent in accessing plateau capacity at high current. Consequently, a specific capacity of 357.8&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (incl. 248.1&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; plateau capacity) is achieved at 200&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with retention of 253.6&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 500&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, the PDAC demonstrates exceptional cycling stability, retaining 90.4% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles. The critical roles of extending nanosheets, maintaining interlayer spacing, and increasing closed pore volume in enabling efficient Na&#8314; storage and advancing fast-charging SIBs are systematically elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Chemical Manipulation of Mannosyl&#8208; and Galactosyl&#8208;Queuosine in tRNAs of Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Q&#8208;base in the anticodon loop of certain eukaryotic tRNA is further mannosylated and galactosylated. Using feeding of chemically manipulated queuine derivatives, we show that the sugar&#8208;modifying enzymes perform the modification chemistry with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.








Abstract
Queuosine is a hypermodified nucleoside found in the anticodon loop of tRNAs decoding the amino acids His, Asn, Tyr, and Asp. In tRNATyr, the homoallylic 2&#8208;hydroxyl group of the cyclopentene ring carries an additional &#946;&#8208;galactose, while in tRNAAsp, an &#945;&#8208;mannose is connected to the allylic 3&#8208;hydroxyl group. Although these additional sugar modifications were found in the tRNAs of many animals, including humans, their purpose remains unknown. Recently, the Q&#8208;tRNA galatosyl&#8208; and mannosyltransferase (QTGAL and QTMAN) that attach the galactose and mannose moieties to the different OH groups of the Q&#8208;base have been identified, but the function of this transfer reaction remains unclear. Here, we performed feeding experiments with synthetic deoxyqueuine derivatives that lack either the allylic, the homoallylic, or both hydroxyl groups. Analysis of the queuosine derivatives that are found in the corresponding tRNAs shows that the glycosylases attach the sugar with precise specificity, suggesting decisive functions of the galactose and mannose sugar moieties in the decoding process.

         <title>Monomer&#8208;Dependent Selectivity in Sulfur&#8208;Containing Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerisation: Bimetallic Catalysis for Predictive Design of Degradable Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unified Cr(III)/Rb(I) catalyst was developed for sulfur&#8208;based ring&#8208;opening copolymerisation (ROCOP), enabling high selectivity. Perfectly alternating copolymers were obtained from COS with minimal byproducts. PhNCS was identified as a practical alternative. Lower selectivity and O/S scrambling were observed for CS2 and thioanhydride

Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;containing polymers offer unique opportunities for advanced materials due to their inherent degradability, high refractive indices, and potential for chemical recyclability. Yet, synthetic strategies for their precise construction remain underdeveloped and monomer selection rules to achieve this are elusive. Herein, we achieve the first comprehensive evaluation of sulfurated ring&#8208;opening copolymerisations (ROCOP) performed under unified conditions using a single heterobimetallic Cr(III)/Rb(I) catalyst platform. Although such catalysts are largely unexplored in sulfur&#8208;based ROCOP, our study demonstrates their remarkable synergistic performance in controlling both activity and selectivity across diverse heteroallene/epoxide systems. We identify carbonyl sulfide (COS) as the most promising monomer, enabling perfectly alternating copolymers under mild conditions on kinetic grounds. As a close second,&#160;PhNCS emerges as a viable, easier to handle, alternative that offers selective access to sulfur&#8208;containing copolymers. In contrast, thioanhydrides and CS2 show progressively lower selectivity, with increasing O/S scrambling and small molecule byproduct formation. This study provides the first predictive framework linking sulfur monomer identity to selectivity and reactivity under unified conditions, enabling rational design of degradable sulfur&#8208;rich polymers.

Abstract
Despite extensive studies of electrophilic copper&#8208;nitrenoid species in nitrene transfer chemistry, the formation and application of Cu&#8208;nitrene radicals remain elusive and underdeveloped. Nitrene radicals, being highly reactive, actively participate in radical&#8208;type amination reactions under mild conditions. Using a well&#8208;defined Cu(II)&#8208;catalyst [CuII(L1)Cl2] (1) bearing 2,6&#8208;bis(phenyldiazenyl)pyridine (L1) as a ligand, the otherwise copper&#8208;stabilized electrophilic nitrenoid species has been transformed to a nitrene radical species via selective catalyst to nitrene single electron transfer. The copper&#8208;stabilized nitrene radical species facilitates the selective formation of N&#9472;N bonds, resulting in N&#8208;acyl hydrazides. Catalyst 1 exhibits a broad substrate scope, smoothly functionalizing dioxazolone derivatives derived from long&#8208;chain fatty acids, including palmitic, stearic, oleic, and erucic acids, as well as biologically relevant acids such as 1&#8208;adamantane acetic acid, &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid, and glutamic acid. Important N&#8208;heterocyclic amines, such as quinolines, carbazoles, and azepines, were also successfully functionalized. Catalyst 1 is also compatible with intramolecular N&#9472;N coupling, enabling the direct synthesis of pyrazoles in a single step, thereby emphasizing the method's synthetic versatility. The reaction is scalable, affording excellent yields in gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Detailed mechanistic investigations, control experiments, and EPR analysis, including DFT calculations, confirm the existence of a radical&#8208;mediated pathway.

         <title>Hydrogen Bridge&#8208;Mediated Efficient Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural on Ni(OH)2&#9472;PO43&#8722;/Ni3(PO4)2 Heterojunctions</title>

This work presents a concept to facilitate proton deintercalation of lattice&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;groups to form Ni3+&#9472;O catalytic sites, and further enhance proton transfer efficiency by PO43&#8722;&#8208;induced hydrogen bridges (PO43&#8722;&#8943;H&#9472;O&#9472;Ni2+ &#8594; HPO42&#8722; + Ni3+&#9472;O). Moreover, the rate&#8208;controlling step for OH adsorption happens via hydrogen bridges connecting the PO43&#8722; group with the &#945;&#8208;C in *HMF&#8208;H intermediate, notably decreasing the energy barrier for HMF oxidation.








Abstract
Accelerating proton deintercalation and transfer on the catalyst surface is crucial for the electrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into the high&#8208;value 2,5&#8208;furanodicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Herein, we have constructed a Ni(OH)2&#9472;PO43&#8722;/Ni3(PO4)2 heterojunction catalyst that demonstrates exceptional selectivity (97.16%), yield (94.16%), and Faraday efficiency (94.31%) in the selective oxidation of HMF toward FDCA. The incorporation of PO43&#8722; groups triggers the formation of hydrogen bridges and reconfigures the interfacial charge distribution, facilitating the activation and subsequent proton deintercalation of lattice&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;groups to generate active Ni3+&#9472;O catalytic sites (PO43&#8722;&#8943;H&#9472;O&#9472;Ni2+ &#8594; HPO42&#8722; + Ni3+&#9472;O). Both density functional theory calculations and pH&#8208;dependent experiments emphasize the crucial function of these hydrogen bridges as proton ferries, effectively boosting the proton transfer efficiency during HMF oxidation. Theoretical studies unveil that the rate&#8208;controlling step for OH adsorption on Ni(OH)2&#9472;PO43&#8722; occurs via the hydrogen bridge connecting the PO43&#8722; group with the &#945;&#8208;C atom in *HMF&#8208;H intermediate (PO43&#8722;&#8943;H&#9472;O&#8943;COR &#8594; PO42&#8722;&#9472;H&#8943;O&#9472;COR), significantly reducing the energy barrier for HMF oxidation.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents a concept to facilitate proton deintercalation of lattice-hydroxyl-groups to form Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#9472;O catalytic sites, and further enhance proton transfer efficiency by PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accelerating proton deintercalation and transfer on the catalyst surface is crucial for the electrochemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into the high-value 2,5-furanodicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Herein, we have constructed a Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction catalyst that demonstrates exceptional selectivity (97.16%), yield (94.16%), and Faraday efficiency (94.31%) in the selective oxidation of HMF toward FDCA. The incorporation of PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups triggers the formation of hydrogen bridges and reconfigures the interfacial charge distribution, facilitating the activation and subsequent proton deintercalation of lattice-hydroxyl-groups to generate active Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#9472;O catalytic sites (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8943;H&#9472;O&#9472;Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; &#8594; HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; + Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#9472;O). Both density functional theory calculations and pH-dependent experiments emphasize the crucial function of these hydrogen bridges as proton ferries, effectively boosting the proton transfer efficiency during HMF oxidation. Theoretical studies unveil that the rate-controlling step for OH adsorption on Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; occurs via the hydrogen bridge connecting the PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; group with the &#945;-C atom in *HMF-H intermediate (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8943;H&#9472;O&#8943;COR &#8594; PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#9472;H&#8943;O&#9472;COR), significantly reducing the energy barrier for HMF oxidation.

         <title>Peptidic Tryptophan Halogenation by a Promiscuous Flavin&#8208;Dependent Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ChlH, a flavin&#8208;dependent tryptophan halogenase, was reconstituted in vitro and capable of modifying a wide array of diverse peptidic substrates. This suggests a potential use in the biocatalytic production of chlorinated peptides.








Abstract
Amino acids undergo numerous enzymatic modifications. However, the broad applicability of amino acid&#8208;modifying enzymes for synthetic purposes is limited by narrow substrate scope and often unknown regulatory or accessory factor requirements. Here, we characterize ChlH, a flavin&#8208;dependent halogenase (FDH) from the chlorolassin biosynthetic gene cluster. Unlike characterized peptide&#8208;modifying FDHs, which are limited to either specifically modified peptides or the termini of linear peptides, ChlH halogenates internal Trp residues of linear peptides, as well as N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal Trp. Scanning mutagenesis of the substrate peptide ChlA revealed Trp was tolerated by ChlH at nearly every position. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborated the importance of a C&#8208;terminal motif in ChlA and provided insight into the lack of Trp14 chlorination in native chlorolassin. Furthermore, halogenation of disparate ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide (RiPP) precursor peptides, pharmacologically relevant peptides, and special examples of internal Trp within proteins was achieved using wild&#8208;type ChlH. A rapid cell&#8208;free biosynthetic assay provided insight into ChlH's preferences. In contrast to characterized FDHs, ChlH halogenates diverse peptide sequences, and we predict this promiscuity may find utility in the modification of additional peptide and protein substrates of biotechnological value.

         <title>Multifunctional Electronic Textiles for the Simultaneous Detection and Uptake of Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrothermal synthesis of a Bi&#8208;containing coordination polymer on polyester enables fabrication of electronic textiles (e&#8208;textiles) capable of simultaneous detection and uptake of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Resulting smart membranes exhibit a concentration&#8208;dependent sensor response to H2S down to 5&#160;ppm and micro&#8208;breakthrough capacities of up to 16.8&#160;mmol g&#8722;1. Spectroscopic analysis suggests that the H2S forms polysulfide species about the bismuth nodes of the coordination polymer.








Abstract
This paper describes the fabrication of multifunctional electronic textiles (e&#8208;textiles) capable of simultaneous detection and uptake of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Hydrothermal templation of the bismuth&#8208;based framework (Bi(HHTP)) onto the textile installs a conductive coating from the molecular building blocks of 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) and bismuth acetate. Electronic textile (e&#8208;textile) surfaces achieve average Bi(HHTP) loadings of 8&#160;&#177;&#160;2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, corresponding to 20%&#160;&#177;&#160;4% of the e&#8208;textile being Bi(HHTP) by mass, and demonstrate average resistivities of 1.26&#160;k&#937; cm&#8722;1 with good stability to withstand mechanical stressors. The resulting e&#8208;textiles exhibit an analyte&#8208;selective, concentration&#8208;dependent chemiresistive response to H2S from 80 to 5&#160;ppm, with good selectivity toward H2S over SO2, NO, NO2, NH3, and CO. The materials reach micro&#8208;breakthrough capacities of up to 16.8 and 14.8&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 under exposure to 4.6% H2S, for e&#8208;textile and bulk powder, respectively. Spectroscopic analysis suggests that material&#8211;analyte interactions are characterized by the formation of polysulfide species. The resulting electronic textile represents a novel approach toward the development of smart membranes capable of simultaneous sensing and filtration of H2S.

         <title>High&#8208;Fidelity Profiling of Multiple Nearby Mutations via Cooperative Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperative recognition that integrates both hybridization and ligation&#8208;based recognition mechanisms is introduced to enable AND&#8208;gate&#8208;based detection of multiple nearby mutations with high specificity and robustness. This strategy allows accurate discrimination of microRNA from its family members and isoforms, as well as the high&#8208;fidelity identification of drug&#8208;resistant single nucleotide variants in lung cancer patients.








Abstract
Detection methods with single&#8208;nucleotide specificity are essential tools for nucleic acid analysis in diverse clinical and biological settings. However, both hybridization&#8208;based and enzyme&#8208;based methods are only effective for discriminating single&#8208;nucleotide mutations at certain positions, making it difficult to detect nucleic acid targets having multiple nearby mutations. Herein, we describe the design of cooperative recognition probes (CRPs) that integrate both hybridization and ligation&#8208;based recognition mechanisms and thus are highly effective for discriminating mutations throughout all positions. The cooperative nature of CRPs further enables AND&#8208;gate&#8208;based detection of multiple nearby mutations with high fidelity and specificity. Moreover, CRPs generate circular or linear ligation products that can be readily amplified by rolling circle amplification or polymerase chain reaction, making our strategy readily adaptable to diverse biological and clinical settings. Leveraging CRPs, we demonstrate the detection of nucleic acid targets that are difficult to be discriminated using conventional strategies, such as the highly specific discrimination of microRNA from its family members and isoforms, and the high&#8208;fidelity identification of drug&#8208;resistant single&#8208;nucleotide variants in the presence of nearby synchronous mutations in lung cancer samples.

         <title>Intramolecular Phosphinyl&#8208;Zincation of Alkynes: A Powerful Entry to Benzophosphole Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ortho&#8208;alkynylated secondary arylphosphine oxides undergo phosphinyl&#8208;zincation upon reaction with Et2Zn under gentle heating. The ensuing C3&#8208;zincated benzophosphole oxides have been characterized by multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy. They are readily derivatized via Cu or Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;C cross&#8208;couplings. This one&#8208;pot&#8208;two&#8208;step process gives straightforward and efficient access to a wide range of benzophosphole oxides with diverse substitution patterns.








Abstract
Upon reacting ortho&#8208;alkynylated secondary arylphosphine oxides with Et2Zn, we discovered that P(O)&#9472;H activation is followed upon gentle heating by phosphinyl&#8208;zincation. This unprecedented transformation stands as a phosphorus version of the silyl and germyl&#8208;zincation of alkynes recently shown to give modular access to elaborated tri and tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes. The cyclic vinyl&#8208;zinc derivative resulting from intramolecular phosphinyl&#8208;zincation was characterized by multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy. It subsequently undergoes Cu or Pd&#8208;catalyzed derivatizations with a broad range of electrophiles. The synthetic utility of this one&#8208;pot&#8208;two&#8208;step process has been leveraged to prepare a wide range of benzophosphole oxides (BPO) with diverse substitution patterns. Furthermore, &#960;&#8208;extended BPOs have been synthesized by C&#9472;C coupling or cyclization of C3&#8208;alkynyl / alkenyl substituted compounds and their optical properties have been analyzed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ortho&lt;/i&gt;-alkynylated secondary arylphosphine oxides undergo phosphinyl-zincation upon reaction with Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Zn under gentle heating. The ensuing C3-zincated benzophosphole oxides have been characterized by multi-nuclear NMR spectroscopy. They are readily derivatized via Cu or Pd-catalyzed C&#9472;C cross-couplings. This one-pot-two-step process gives straightforward and efficient access to a wide range of benzophosphole oxides with diverse substitution patterns.

         <title>Stopping the Chain: Isolated Molecular Intermediates of Anionic Styrene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the organometallic first&#8208;step carbolithiation products of anionic styrene polymerization with diethyl ether and thf, that have not been isolated so far due to the high reactivity of anionic polymerization. X&#8208;ray solid&#8208;state and NMR solution&#8208;state experiments show different intermediates in the different solvents. In situ FT&#8208;IR and DFT&#8208;calculations present mechanistic proposals for the initiation reaction.








Abstract
Anionic polymerization developed to one of the most used polymerization techniques both in industry and academia in the last 70 years. Due to the required high reactivity of the polymerization, the isolation of the organometallic intermediate in between initiation and propagation step has not been possible so far and its mechanism is still not fully understood. Additionally, deprotonations in benzylic positions remain challenging, which is a prerequisite for a successful living carbanionic polymerization, but also complicating the synthetic access to the intermediates. Herein, we present the synthesis and isolation of the first&#8208;step carbolithiation product of anionic styrene polymerization in diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. Characterizations in solid&#8208;state by X&#8208;ray diffraction and in solution state by extended nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were carried out. Differing initiation reactivity was observed by in situ fourier transform&#8208;infrared (FT&#8208;IR) spectroscopy, revealing the intermediates to be responsible for polymerization reactivity. A possible mechanistic explanation for the initiation state was presented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By our approach of isolating the chain&#8208;relevant intermediates on a molecular level, we gained new insights on the existing mechanism.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Engineered Membranes Break the Conductivity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;Off in Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorine&#8208;based design strategy is proposed to address the dilemma of ion exchange membranes concerning the combination of ion conductivity and selectivity towards redox actives, as exemplified by the fluorinated poly(arylene alkylene) anion exchange membrane. It strikes a good balance between ion conductivity and selectivity toward actives, thus enabling a stable&#8208;cycling pH&#8208;neutral aqueous organic redox flow battery.








Abstract
Ion exchange membranes constitute critical components in aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs), yet face a fundamental trade&#8208;off. High&#8208;ion&#8208;affinity membranes achieve high conductivity but endure swelling&#8208;induced low selectivity due to co&#8208;uptake of water and organic active species. To address it, we develop a fluorine&#8208;engineered polymer architecture strategy, demonstrated via fluorinated poly(arylene alkylene) anion exchange membranes. Fluorine incorporation 1) establishes interconnected ion channels with suppressed swelling, enabling competitive conductivity at low hydration (&#955;&#160;&lt;&#160;4.5), and 2) simultaneously reduces redox&#8208;active material affinity, yielding low permeabilities of, for example, 4.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;12 cm2 s&#8722;1 for methyl viologen, representing 50&#8208;fold and 425&#8208;fold lower permeability than those of fluorine&#8208;free counterpart and commercial DSV membranes, respectively. The optimized membrane enables a pH&#8208;neutral AORFB exhibiting a low&#8208;capacity decay rate (0.00077% per cycle)&#8211;outperforming existing systems by 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude. Our observations provide fundamental guidance for developing advanced membranes in electrochemical energy technologies.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Glycomimetics by Photocatalytic One&#8208;Pot C(sp3)&#9472;H Acylation and Ring Contraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile method for the stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;acyl glycosides and carbasugars from readily accessible and bench&#8208;stable 1&#8208;deoxyglycosides was developed by photo&#8208;HAT/nickel dual catalysis. This one&#8208;pot reaction proceeds under mild conditions and exhibits high stereoselectivity across diverse glycosyl units. The approach was further applied to the synthesis of a challenging cyclopentanepentol, an analogue of calditol.








Abstract
Glycomimetics, structural mimics of natural carbohydrates such as C&#8208;glycosides and carbasugars, are important therapeutic leads for treating a variety of diseases. However, the structural and stereochemical complexity of glycomimetics poses daunting challenges to synthetic chemists and is incompatible with diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic approaches. Herein, we develop a facile and general method for the stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;acyl glycosides and carbasugars from readily accessible and stable 1&#8208;deoxyglycosides via photo&#8208;HAT/nickel dual catalysis. The reaction proceeds in one&#8208;pot under mild conditions and exhibits high stereoselectivity across a wide range of glycosyl units, illustrating the potential of this method in the preparation of structurally diverse and densely functionalized carbasugars. The synthetic utility of this strategy is further demonstrated in the synthesis of challenging cyclopentanepentol, an analogue of calditol.

         <title>Encapsulation Enhances the Quantum Coherence of a Solid&#8208;State Molecular Spin Qubit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A purely synthetic supramolecular chemistry approach enables the protection of the spin&#8208;based qubit [Cr(ox)3]3&#8722; from external sources of decoherence in the solid state, leading to the enhancement of the phase memory and the spin lattice relaxation time, thus validating this chemical engineering strategy for qubit implementation.








Abstract
Spins within molecules benefit from the atomistic control of synthetic chemistry for the realization of qubits. One advantage is that the quantum superpositions of the spin states encoding the qubit can be coherently manipulated using electromagnetic radiation. The main challenge is the fragility of these superpositions when qubits are to partake of solid&#8208;state devices. We address this issue with a supramolecular approach for protecting molecular spin qubits against decoherence. The molecular qubit [Cr(ox)3]3&#8722; has been encapsulated inside the diamagnetic triple&#8208;stranded helicate [Zn2L3]4+ (L is a bis&#8208;pyrazolylpyridine ligand). The quantum coherence of the protected qubit is then analyzed with pulsed EPR spectroscopy and compared with the unprotected qubit, both in solution and in the solid state. Crucially, the spin&#8211;spin relaxation in the solid state has been examined within diamagnetic crystal lattices of the isostructural ([Al(ox)3]@[Zn2L3])+ or [Al(ox)3]3&#8208; assemblies, respectively, doped with the Cr3+ qubit in two different (&lt;10%) concentrations. The study unveils a surprising increase of the phase memory time of the qubit upon encapsulation only in the solid. Spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times also exhibit a significant enhancement, as established from inversion recovery pulse sequences and from slow relaxation of the magnetization of the protected qubit, not featured by the free qubit.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Solvent&#8208;Assisted Cation Exchange Approach to Hollow Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Nanoreactors with Orderly Distributed Active Sites for Tandem Catalysis</title>

Multifunctional hollow MOF nanoreactor, Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, which contains precisely encapsulated Pd nanoparticles inside cavities, was controllably synthesized through one&#8208;step solvent&#8208;assisted cation exchange method. Micro&#8208;mesoporous shell thicknesses in the range of 22&#8211;73&#160;nm are controlled by easily tuning Pd2+ loading. The resulting Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 has the ability of size&#8208;selective molecular recognition and tandem catalysis.








Abstract
Biological membrane&#8208;enclosed organelles, in which cascade reactions promoted by multiple enzymes occur, have inspired widespread interest in the design of spatially confined nanoreactors for tandem catalytic transformations. Because of their accessible compartmentalized environments and large framework diversity, hollow metal&#8211;organic frameworks (H&#8208;MOFs) are ideal platforms for the development of new multi&#8208;functionalized nanoreactors. However, simple methodologies for fabrication of hollow MOFs, which possess functionalities that are precisely localized and encapsulated of active sites like those found in biological membrane&#8208;enclosed organelles, is a considerable challenge. Herein, a facile, one&#8208;step solvent&#8208;assisted cation exchange method was firstly developed for controlled synthesis of multifunctional H&#8208;MOF, Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, which contains precisely encapsulated Pd nanoparticles (NPs) inside cavities. Micro&#8208;mesoporous shell thicknesses in the range of 22&#8211;73&#160;nm are effectively controlled by easily tuning Pd2+ loading. Impressively, the delicate nanoarchitecture and precise encapsulation of Pd NPs give Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 a propensity for size&#8208;selective molecular recognition in catalytic hydrogenation reactions and ability to catalyze tandem processes. Observations made in this effort suggest that one&#8208;step solvent&#8208;assisted cation exchange protocol might serve as general avenue for the design and construction of multi&#8208;functionalized H&#8208;MOFs, which can be employed in diverse applications in the fields of material chemistry.

         <title>Generalizing Vinyl Halide Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions with Photoredox and Photoredox/Nickel Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy has been developed for predictable and robust vinyl halide cross&#8208;coupling reactions. This approach demonstrates broad applicability across seven distinct bond&#8208;forming transformations, featuring wide electrophile and nucleophile scope, high tolerance for functional groups, and suitability for late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex biomolecules. It also enables efficient one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step bifunctional transformations.








Abstract
Reliable, broadly applicable cross&#8208;coupling conditions that deliver the desired products with minimal optimization are essential in pharmaceutical research, where efficient synthesis accelerates lead discovery and late&#8208;stage diversification. Although advances like high&#8208;throughput additive screening and commercial catalyst/ligand libraries improve prediction in specific systems, a general strategy for vinyl halide cross&#8208;coupling across diverse bond&#8208;forming reactions remains elusive. Herein, we report a general and highly predictable method for vinyl halide cross&#8208;coupling under photoredox conditions, employing two complementary catalytic systems. In the first, the organic photocatalyst 4CzIPN enables efficient coupling with nucleophiles such as thiols, selenols, sulfinate salts, activated alkenes, phosphorus (III), and boron compounds, affording C(sp2)&#9472;S, &#9472;Se, &#9472;C, &#9472;P, and &#9472;B bonds in high yields. In the second, a dual nickelphotoredox catalytic system facilitates coupling with less reactive nucleophiles, including phosphorus (V), nitrogen, and oxygen. This approach enables seven distinct bond&#8208;forming reactions, offering broad electrophile and nucleophile scope, high functional group tolerance, and applicability to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex biomolecules. The simple and consistent conditions enable one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step bifunctional transformations by sequentially activating distinct chemical bonds involving nucleophiles and electrophiles.

         <title>Intramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Catalyst/Initiator for Precise Synthesis of Polycarbonates and Copolymers with Unprecedented Activity and Molecular Weights</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate highly efficient synthesis of polycarbonates via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic carbonates, and their gradient or block copolymers with lactide in one&#8208;pot reactions, using the single&#8208;component catalyst/initiator comprising a thiourea moiety and alkoxide.








Abstract
The development of efficient and selective catalytic methods for synthesizing well&#8208;defined polycarbonates and their copolymers represents a significant advancement toward sustainable polymer production. In this study, we report a series of innovative single&#8208;molecule hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysts/initiators for the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic carbonates, enabling rapid and precise synthesis of polycarbonates and their copolymers with polylactide. These catalysts uniquely facilitate simultaneous activation of both monomer and chain&#8208;end within a single molecular architecture, demonstrating superior activity compared to conventional multicomponent hydrogen&#8208;bonding initiating systems. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that alkyl substitution plays a critical role in enhancing catalytic activity for ROP by reducing the energy barrier relative to aryl&#8208;substituted analogues. The modular design of these catalysts allows for facile structural optimization and performance tuning. Notably, Cat. 1 exhibits high catalytic efficiency at 25&#160;&#176;C, producing polycarbonates with well&#8208;defined structures and high molecular weights (Mn up to 164.8&#160;kDa, &#208; of 1.37). We further demonstrate versatile copolymerization strategies: one&#8208;step copolymerization yields gradient polycarbonate&#8208;g&#8208;polylactide copolymers, whereas sequential monomer addition in one&#8208;pot reactions produces well&#8208;defined block polycarbonate&#8208;b&#8208;polylactide copolymers within minutes. These block copolymers exhibit high molecular weights (Mn up to 189.4&#160;kDa, &#208; of 1.37), precisely tunable thermal properties, and exceptional mechanical performance, highlighting their potential for advanced material applications.

Abstract
All inorganic lead halide perovskite (CsPbX3) has become a hot topic in chiral optics for its high quantum yield and tunable luminescence. The environmental degradation tendency and lack of magneto&#8208;optical coupling mechanism of lead&#8208;based perovskite severely restrict its chirality integrated application. Rare&#8208;earth ions (such as Gd3+, Eu3+), with their unique 4f electronic configuration, not only passivate the lattice defects to improve stability but also expand the spectral response range through electronic localization effects. In this study, we proposed a strategy to introduce magneto&#8208;optical active rare&#8208;earth ions (Gd3+, Eu3+) into the CsPbX3 lattice to form nanosheets (NSs), and oriented assembled into large scale chiral films with tailorable chiroptical activity ranging from 300 to 700&#160;nm and achieved tailoring a multicolor circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) system with angle dependent polarization switching characteristics. Chiral Gd3+:CsPbBr3 NSs films and chiral Eu3+:CsPb(Br/Cl)3 NSs films exhibited significantly increased luminescence asymmetry factor of |glum| up to 10&#8722;2 and also displayed enhanced magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) responses. We further developed an optical encryption system based on multidimensional regulation of components/polarization/wavelength, enabling dynamic programmable information storage and providing a new material platform for spin photon devices, quantum communication, and high&#8208;end anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology.

Chiral Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;:CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NSs films and chiral Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;:CsPb(Br/Cl)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NSs films exhibited significantly increased luminescence asymmetry factor of |g&lt;i&gt;lum&lt;/i&gt;| up to 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and also displayed enhanced magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) responses. We further developed an optical encryption system based on multidimensional regulation of components/polarization/wavelength, enabling dynamic programmable information storage and providing a new material platform for spin photon devices, quantum communication, and high-end anti-counterfeiting technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Poly(benzoxazine)&#8208;Based Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries With Ultralong Lifespans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel poly(benzoxazine&#8208;propylene&#8208;oxide)&#8208;based gel electrolyte was developed. After ring&#8208;opening curing, the benzoxazine polymer demonstrates a dual crosslinking system comprising both chemical and physical cross&#8208;links, showing exceptional electrolyte adsorption capacity and retention stability. The synergistic interaction between the extended propylene&#8208;oxide chain segments and the electrolyte solution contributes to its high ionic conductivity. The cross&#8208;linked structure significantly enhances electrochemical stability, rendering the electrolyte highly suitable for application in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with ultralong lifespans.








Abstract
Gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is a desirable candidate for high&#8208;safety lithium batteries but is still plagued by the dynamic fluctuations of liquid electrolyte components, which induce localized fluid aggregation or leakage, ultimately leading to performance instability or even degradation. Here, we develop a novel poly(benzoxazine&#8208;propylene&#8208;oxide)&#8208;based GPE, achieving superior electrochemical performance and high safety simultaneously. Through molecular architecture design, the strategic incorporation of long&#8208;chain propylene&#8208;oxide segments and amide functionalities into the benzoxazine backbone endows the polymer matrix with enhanced lithium&#8208;ion transport capability. Catalyst&#8208;free thermal curing triggers oxazine ring&#8208;opening polymerization, constructing three&#8208;dimensional chemically cross&#8208;linked network architecture, generating abundant hydrogen bonds. The synergistic interaction between chemical crosslinking and dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding enabled exceptional electrolyte uptake (600%&#160;w/w within 5&#160;min) coupled with effective solvent immobilization. The incorporated long&#8208;chain propylene&#8208;oxide segments exhibited synergistic solvation effects with carbonate solvents, enabling superior ionic conductivity (9.62 mS cm&#8722;1 at 20&#160;&#176;C). The Li||Li symmetric cells based on PBz&#8208;PO&#8208;GPE 2000 operated for 3000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and LiFePO4||Li full cells delivered 140.7&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 initial discharge capacity at 2&#160;C rate, near&#8208;unity coulombic efficiency, and 70.5% capacity retention after 1800 cycles. This multiscale design of GPE provides an effective strategy for electrolyte exploration in high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Synergistic Chalcogenate and Fluorine Engineering on Metal Oxyhydroxides Breaks the OER Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorine bridge on NiFeOOH breaks the OER scaling relationship. It creates a distorted atomic interface that shortens hydrogen bonds and promotes proton transfer kinetics, lowering the theoretical overpotential from 0.37 to 0.27&#160;eV. Guided by theory, the synthesized catalyst achieves a breakthrough performance, delivering an industrial&#8208;level current density of 1.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at a remarkably low overpotential of 304&#160;mV with exceptional stability.









Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a bottleneck in electrochemical water splitting, is fundamentally limited by a scaling relationship between the binding energies of key intermediates (OH* and OOH*), imposing a minimum theoretical overpotential of 0.37&#160;eV. Breaking this scaling relationship is crucial for enhancing OER activity, yet effective strategies remain scarce. We demonstrate that the introduction of high&#8208;electronegativity fluorion on chalcogenate&#8208;adsorbed nickel&#8208;iron oxyhydroxide (NiFeOOH) significantly shortens hydrogen bonds between the chalcogenate and OER intermediates (*OH and *OOH). This shortening promotes proton transfer kinetics and lowers the theoretical overpotential to 0.27&#160;eV. Guided by these calculations, the co&#8208;adsorption of chalcogenate and fluorion on metal oxyhydroxide (NiFeSF&#8208;R) catalyst is synthesized, and it achieves 1.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at an ultralow overpotential of 304&#160;mV in 1.0&#160;M KOH, a substantial improvement of 106 and 182&#160;mV compared to NiFeS&#8208;R and NiFe, respectively. Notably, NiFeSF&#8208;R exhibits exceptional stability, sustaining 1.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2 for over 500&#160;h with negligible degradation. In an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the NiFeSF&#8208;R anode stably achieves 1.0&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at 1.73&#160;V for 700&#160;h at 50&#160;&#176;C. This work highlights the potential of local coordination environment tuning to break scaling relationships for high&#8208;performance OER catalysts.

         <title>Exciton Regulation and Fluorescence Switching via Redox&#8208;Responsive Heterojunction Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by traditional Chinese lanterns, this work constructs a covalent triazine framework (CTF) that spatially organizes CdSe quantum dots (QDs) into spherical structures. The CTF serves as a nanoscale &#8220;lantern shell&#8221; enabling interfacial charge transfer and excitonic regulation. The resulting CdSe@CTF material achieves selective and visual detection of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) via dual&#8208;mode fluorescence&#8211;colorimetric response.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;responsive fluorescence regulation at heterointerfaces remains a critically underdeveloped yet strategically significant domain in advanced chemical sensing. Herein, we present an exciton modulation strategy enabled by heterojunction engineering between electron&#8208;rich CdSe quantum dots and an electron&#8208;deficient covalent triazine framework (CTF). This type&#8208;I CdSe@CTF heterostructure achieves nanoscale electronic decoupling and directional charge redistribution, unveiling a previously unreported fluorescence&#8208;switching mechanism governed by redox&#8208;triggered interfacial reconfiguration. Beyond excitonic regulation, the heterostructure intrinsically mimics oxidase&#8208;like catalysis, enabling dual fluorescence&#8211;colorimetric readouts within a unified excitonic framework. When embedded into flexible electrospun membranes and combined with artificial neural network (ANN)&#8208;based image recognition, the system offers adaptive and intelligent detection under bio&#8208;relevant conditions. This study establishes a molecularly encoded design paradigm that bridges exciton dynamics, redox chemistry, and wearable photonic sensing, offering a blueprint for the development of multifunctional bioelectronic platforms.

         <title>Unexpected Spontaneous Generation of Superoxide Radicals: Water&#8208;Solid Collision as an Atypical Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that superoxide radicals (O2&#8226;&#8722;) can be generated at the water&#8208;solid collision interface even in the dark, which come from the reduction of dissolved oxygen in water by electrons transferred by the water&#8208;solid contact. Simulations of rain colliding with mineral interface further confirm this phenomenon. Quantitative studies show that the production of O2&#8226;&#8722; in this process is equivalent to that in photochemical reactions. 








Abstract
Spontaneous generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) driven by water&#8208;solid contact electrification was a new source of redox chemistry. However, superoxide radicals (O2&#8226;&#8722;), a kind of ROS that was of great significance in both natural and engineering environments, remain overlooked and poorly understood at the water&#8208;solid interface. Here, we found O2&#8226;&#8722; could be generated spontaneously when water collided with the solid interface even under dark conditions, and its production was quantified by CL. 18O isotope labelling experiments and solid&#8211;liquid contact electrification detection confirmed that the generation of O2&#8226;&#8722; was from the reduction of dissolved oxygen by electrons at the water&#8208;solid interface and that the kinetic energy of the water energized the reaction. Given the ubiquitous nature of solid&#8211;liquid collisions, such as rain colliding with mineral surfaces during rainfall, we further systematically investigated the O2&#8226;&#8722; generation and their decay kinetics at three distinct rain&#8208;mineral interfaces. Results showed that O2&#8226;&#8722; generation ranged from 0.015 to 1.1&#160;nM, comparable to the O2&#8226;&#8722; production by photochemical pathways. Our findings established the water&#8208;solid collision interface as a previously unrecognized global source of O2&#8226;&#8722; and highlight a universal yet overlooked physicochemical mechanism underpinning multiphase redox chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) driven by water-solid contact electrification was a new source of redox chemistry. However, superoxide radicals (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), a kind of ROS that was of great significance in both natural and engineering environments, remain overlooked and poorly understood at the water-solid interface. Here, we found O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; could be generated spontaneously when water collided with the solid interface even under dark conditions, and its production was quantified by CL. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O isotope labelling experiments and solid&#8211;liquid contact electrification detection confirmed that the generation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; was from the reduction of dissolved oxygen by electrons at the water-solid interface and that the kinetic energy of the water energized the reaction. Given the ubiquitous nature of solid&#8211;liquid collisions, such as rain colliding with mineral surfaces during rainfall, we further systematically investigated the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; generation and their decay kinetics at three distinct rain-mineral interfaces. Results showed that O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; generation ranged from 0.015 to 1.1&#160;nM, comparable to the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; production by photochemical pathways. Our findings established the water-solid collision interface as a previously unrecognized global source of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and highlight a universal yet overlooked physicochemical mechanism underpinning multiphase redox chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acetylene&#8208;Linked Octupolar Conjugated Microporous Polymers for CO2 Photoreduction to Methanol: Effect of Acceptor and &#960;&#8208;Bridge Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of acetylene&#8208;linked specialized donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) were synthesized by varying the acceptor strength and &#960;&#8208;conjugated units. These structural modifications were found to influence key factors such as exciton binding energy and charge dynamics, thereby influencing the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol.








Abstract
The development of efficient, metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to methanol is promising for alleviating energy and environmental issues, but achieving high selectivity and conversion efficiency without sacrificial agents or co&#8208;catalysts remains a challenge. In this work, we report a series of acetylene&#8208;linked specialized donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) designed with tailored electronic structures to investigate their efficacy in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol in an aqueous NaOH solution under visible light irradiation. Significantly, the optimized porous polymer TTT&#8208;DEBP, featuring a strong electron&#8208;accepting triazine ring and an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated diethynyl biphenyl (DEBP) system, achieved a higher CH3OH production rate of 30.8&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 with 90.3% selectivity and excellent recyclability. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the synergistic effect of triazine, biphenyl, and acetylene moieties of the porous network reduces exciton binding energy, enhancing charge separation and transfer, and reduces charge recombination for improved photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Voltage&#8208;Programmed Sequential Fluorescence Encoding (VPSFE) Enables Multiplexed In Situ Proteo&#8208;Imaging with Electric&#8208;Field Turing Patterns</title>

Voltage&#8208;Programmed Sequential Fluorescence Encoding (VPSFE) pioneers electric&#8208;field Turing pattern for multiplexed in situ proteo&#8208;imaging, enabling 27&#8208;plex detection via single hybridization and voltage&#8208;controlled probe activation and removal (&#8764;4 minute per round) &#8212; eliminating iterative washing and achieving &#181;M&#8208;level probe tolerance.








Abstract
DNA barcode&#8208;based immunolabeling has revolutionized single&#8208;cell protein profiling. However, conventional multiplexed imaging methods are hindered by laborious probe exchange procedures involving buffer washing&#8208;based probe removal and prolonged hybridization cycles (requiring tens of minutes to 1.5&#160;h per cycle), which limit throughput, specificity, and universality. Here, we introduce an electrophoresis&#8208;based in situ probe removal method that achieves high&#8208;specificity iterative probe imaging without washing steps, utilizing 2&#8208;min low&#8208;voltage electrophoresis for excess probes removal and 3&#8208;min high&#8208;voltage electrophoresis for hybridized probes dissociation. The robustness was validated through 19 rounds of cyclic electrophoresis, 10 rounds of repetitive imaging, and simultaneous processing of 14 probes (&#181;M&#8208;level) across five rounds of multiprobe exchange, demonstrating exceptional specificity and efficiency. Applied to sequential color coding&#8208;based multiplexed imaging, this approach establishes voltage&#8208;programmed sequential fluorescence encoding (VPSFE), enabling multiplexed imaging of epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT)&#8208;related proteins. Furthermore, we developed a VPSFE&#8208;based Turing pattern coding strategy for multiplexed detection that requires only a single multicolor probe hybridization step. Using three voltage conditions and three fluorescence channels, this system generates 27 unique fluorescence Turing patterns to encode 27 distinct targets. This electric&#8208;field Turing pattern coding strategy represents a novel probe exchange&#8208;free approach for rapid, universal, and highly specific multiplexed in situ imaging.

         <title>Rational Design of an Organotellurium Chalcogen Bonding Catalyst for Azetidine Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of bidentate organotellurium dication catalysts are rationally designed to strengthen the weak chalcogen bonding interactions. The enhanced reactivity enables the first catalytic application of chalcogen bonding in the activation of azetidines via a bidentate activation mode, thereby initiating [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions with non&#8208;activated alkenes and alkynes to access various piperidine and tetrahydropyridine architectures.








Abstract
The application of chalcogen bonding catalysis has been largely confined to benchmark reactions due to the limited structural diversity and activating ability of the catalysts, especially those derived from tellurium. Herein, we present a group of rationally designed bis&#8208;telluronium catalysts and realize the first application of chalcogen bonding donor in catalyzing the [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction between azetidines and non&#8208;activated alkenes or alkynes. This chemistry demonstrates excellent functional group tolerance and offers an efficient avenue to access the piperidine and tetrahydropyridine architectures in generally moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good efficiency. A wide array of mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations have been performed to verify the high activity of the organotellurium catalysts with strong electron&#8208;deficient aromatic substituents and to suggest a novel bidentate activation mode between catalyst and azetidine via Te&#8943;O interaction.

         <title>Engineering Gradient D&#8208;d Orbital Occupancy to Boost Substrate Adsorption for Efficient Electrocatalytic Biomass Valorization</title>

The construction of Mn&#8208;O&#8208;Ni channels enables precise regulation of orbital occupancy at Ni active sites, optimizing their electronic states and achieving highly efficient HMF electrooxidation to FDCA.








Abstract
Electrocatalysis provides a green and sustainable approach for the upgrading of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to the polymer monomer 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Precisely tuning the electronic structure, specifically the electron gradient orbitals and spin state of key active sites, is crucial for achieving high catalytic performance, as it directly influences the adsorption strength of the reactive substrate. Herein, by introducing Mn4+/3+ with low 3d filling, the e&#8722;&#8211;e&#8722; repulsion between bridging O2&#8722; and Ni2+ is weakened due to &#960;&#8208;donation function. Corresponding energy level splitting and partial occupancy of the spin&#8208;up state orbital determine the location and state density of the Fermi level. Based on this, an ultra&#8208;high current density of 1.2&#160;A cm&#8722;2 at the potential of only 1.42&#160;V versus RHE can be achieved with a well&#8208;designed Mn&#8208;modified porous metallic skeleton Ni for HMF electrooxidation. Furthermore, continuous flow electrolysis experiments confirmed the stable FDCA production capacity, yielding 88.3% FDCA after approximately 300&#160;h of operation. This insight into the electron gradient orbitals&#8211;activity relationship can provide valuable guidance for developing electrocatalysts for biomass upgrading.

         <title>Optimizing Electronic Structure to Achieve High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Layered Oxide Cathode for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel P3&#8208;K0.7Fe0.3Ni0.15Mg0.03Ti0.02Mn0.5O2 (KFNMTMO) cathode is crafted for high&#8208;performance potassium&#8208;ion batteries. By doping with low&#8208;valent ions, the oxidation state of Mn is elevated to avoid charge compensation, thereby suppressing the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect. Concurrently, the low electronegativity of Mg2&#8314; enhances the bonding interactions between transition metals and oxygen, improving the stability of lattice structure. Consequently, the KFNMTMO cathode exhibits high reversible capacity and excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
Layered Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes demonstrate great potential for application in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. However, issues such as Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of Mn and significant volume changes during K+ intercalation/removal severely limit their practical use. To address these challenges, we successfully synthesize the cathode material K0.7Fe0.3Ni0.15Mg0.03Ti0.02Mn0.5O2 (KFNMTMO) by introducing low&#8208;valence ions and incorporating active metal elements. The results show that the introduction of low&#8208;valence ions raises the average oxidation state of Mn to approximately +4, causing the projected density of states of Mn to shift above the Fermi level. This effectively suppresses the redox activity of Mn, making it primarily responsible for stabilizing layered structure. Meanwhile, electronic structure optimization considerably activates the redox couples of other active elements such as Ni2+/Ni3+ and Fe3+/Fe4+. This synergistic effect not only alleviates Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion but also, through the addition of the less electronegative Mg2+ ions, markedly enhances the orbital hybridization between transition metals and oxygen atoms, further improving the stability of crystal lattice. Consequently, the KFNMTMO cathode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, achieving a reversible capacity of 114.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1, an energy density of 328&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, and remarkable cycling stability with a capacity retention of 81.5% after 800 cycles.

         <title>A Broadly Applicable Strategy to Aminate Azines Enabled by Electronically Tuned Phosphine Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a pyridine C4&#8208;amination reaction via phosphonium salt intermediates, where an electronically tuned phosphine is key to successful C&#9472;N bond formation. The process accommodates aliphatic amines, (heteroaryl)anilines, hydrazines, and nitrogen heteroaromatics, as well as a variety of pyridine building blocks and late&#8208;stage C&#9472;N couplings.








Abstract
We describe a strategy for aminating pyridines and other azines via phosphonium salt intermediates. Precisely tuning the electronic properties of the phosphonium ion was key for C&#9472;N bond formation via an SNAr&#8208;halogenation, SNAr&#8208;amination sequence. The process couples a wide range of amine classes with pyridines and is viable for applications such as late&#8208;stage amination of complex pharmaceuticals and fragment&#8211;fragment coupling reactions. The capacity to rapidly modify the structure of the phosphine reagent was decisive and is a valuable feature in pseudohalide design.

In&#9472;SnS2&#8722;x@NG with synergistic effects owns deeply reversible conversion&#8208;alloying reaction and yields additional surface capacitive behavior, further realizing ultrahigh reversible capacity, and prominent rate performance.








Abstract
Developing distinctive composite anodes with multiple active components is critical for enhancing the charge storage capability of sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs). Herein, In single atom&#8208;substituted SnS2 with moderate sulfur vacancies in situ bonded on N&#8208;doped graphene nanotubes (In&#9472;SnS2&#8722;x@NG) is ingeniously engineered as a superior anode. Theoretical calculations and in situ/ex situ characterizations illustrate that the introduced Sn(In)&#9472;N interfacial bonds immensely strengthen composites integration and boost charge transfer, then In single atom substitution effectively elevates d band center and enhances Na+ adsorption. Moreover, the sulfur vacancies reveal the bifunctional roles in accelerating Na+ diffusion and reinforcing structural thermodynamics. These merits guarantee deeply reversible conversion&#8208;alloying reaction and yield additional surface capacitive behavior of the In&#9472;SnS2&#8722;x@NG anode, further realizing &#8220;1+1+1&gt;3&#8221; synergistic enhanced sodium storage with ultrahigh reversible capacity (&#8764;1211.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and prominent rate performance of 417&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Additionally, a SIHC device with the In&#9472;SnS2&#8722;x@NG anode and the activated carbon cathode exhibits the high energy/power density of 278&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1/10.0&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1 and long cycle lifespan, showing promising practical application. This work not only offers in&#8208;depth insights for designing SIHCs anodes, but also paves the way on practical applications for Na+ storage systems.

         <title>Conformation&#8208;Adaptive Transformations of Flexible Frameworks: From Controlled Stimuli&#8208;Responsiveness to Regulated Responsive Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two flexible framework conformers (FJI&#8208;H29 and FJI&#8208;H41) were prepared. They not only exhibit different responses to the same stimuli, but their responsive behaviors can also be regulated precisely. FJI&#8208;H29 is thermosensitive, it can undergo thermal&#8208;driven deformations and reconstructions. While FJI&#8208;H41 is sensitive to the kinetic energy, it can undergo desolvent&#8208;driven controllable deformations, from in situ shrinkage to stepwise shrinkage.








Abstract
Synthesizing enzyme&#8208;like porous materials that can regulate responsiveness through conformations remains a challenge. Here, two flexible framework conformers (FJI&#8208;H29 and FJI&#8208;H41) were prepared from a semirigid ligand. They not only exhibit different responses to the same stimuli, but their responsive behaviors can also be regulated precisely. FJI&#8208;H29 is thermosensitive, it can undergo continuous thermal&#8208;driven transformations, from reversible deformations to irreversible reconstruction, and the reconstruction barrier can be further tuned. While FJI&#8208;H41 is sensitive to the kinetic energy generated by solvent removal; when the solvents escape vigorously, it in situ shrinks to a more stable conformer (FJI&#8208;H43); when the solvents escape slowly, it first forms a shape maintaining metastable state (FJI&#8208;H41'), then spontaneously transforms into FJI&#8208;H43. Structural analysis shows the FJI&#8208;H29 is mechanically stable, while its ligands undergo more severe distortion with increasing temperature, enabling it to undergo thermal&#8208;driven reconstruction. Whereas FJI&#8208;H41 is mechanically unstable, so it is prone to undergo desolvent&#8208;driven deformations. FJI&#8208;H43 not only exhibits a temperature&#8208;dependent gate&#8208;open effect for the adsorption of C2H2 and CO2 but can also be used for one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from C2H2/C2H4/CO2 mixture; but FJI&#8208;H29 does not work. This provides a new strategy for preparing enzyme&#8208;like porous materials.

While &lt;b&gt;FJI-H41&lt;/b&gt; is sensitive to the kinetic energy generated by solvent removal; when the solvents escape vigorously, it in situ shrinks to a more stable conformer (&lt;b&gt;FJI-H43&lt;/b&gt;); when the solvents escape slowly, it first forms a shape maintaining metastable state (&lt;b&gt;FJI-H41'&lt;/b&gt;), then spontaneously transforms into &lt;b&gt;FJI-H43&lt;/b&gt;. Structural analysis shows the &lt;b&gt;FJI-H29&lt;/b&gt; is mechanically stable, while its ligands undergo more severe distortion with increasing temperature, enabling it to undergo thermal-driven reconstruction. Whereas &lt;b&gt;FJI-H41&lt;/b&gt; is mechanically unstable, so it is prone to undergo desolvent-driven deformations. &lt;b&gt;FJI-H43&lt;/b&gt; not only exhibits a temperature-dependent gate-open effect for the adsorption of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but can also be used for one-step C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; purification from C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture; but &lt;b&gt;FJI-H29&lt;/b&gt; does not work. This provides a new strategy for preparing enzyme-like porous materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ion&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Healing Strategy Enabling Efficient and Stable ETL&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

By introducing an indium sulfate functional layer at the buried interface, In3+ forms a gradient doping, eliminating harmful defects through dynamic redox cycles (Pb0&#8594;Pb2+, I0&#8594;I&#8722;) to achieve synergistic bulk and interfacial healing, and leading to a high efficiency of 22.97% and excellent device stability for the ETL&#8208;free perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells without electron transport layers (ETL&#8208;free PSCs) have garnered increasing attention in recent years due to their simplified fabrication process and low production costs. However, non&#8208;radiative recombination of charge carriers and band energy mismatch at the interface significantly limit device performance. Here, we propose an ion&#8208;mediated self&#8208;healing strategy introducing an indium sulfate (ln2(SO4)3) functional layer at the buried interface of the perovskite. The ln3+ exhibits gradient doping at the buried interface, acting as a redox buffer to oxidize Pb0 to Pb2+, while the generated ln+ reduces I0 to I&#8722;, forming a self&#8208;healing redox dynamic cycle. The incorporation of indium sulfate effectively improves the contact properties and band energy alignment at the ITO/perovskite interface, ultimately achieving a high&#8208;power conversion efficiency of 22.97%. The device retains 91.6% of its initial efficiency after 1200&#160;h of continuous illumination, providing new insights for the development and application of perovskite solar cells without electron transport layers.

         <title>Thermodynamic Miscibility&#8208;Guided Engineering of Bismuth&#8211;Tin Janus Catalysts for Durable Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>

Based on the superior thermodynamic miscibility between Bi and Sn, a nano&#8208;sized Janus Bi&#8211;Sn catalyst with rich interfaces was constructed via a novel in situ electroreduction strategy. The unique atomic patterns achieve the maximum exposure of active sites with optimized electronic structure and significantly boost the electrocatalytic performance for formate production.








Abstract
Interfaces in heterogeneous bimetallic catalysts play a pivotal role in providing rich active sites and accelerating charge transfer during reaction process. However, designing an interface&#8208;rich catalyst with sufficient exposed active sites is crucial yet challenging. Janus catalysts containing bifunctional surfaces segregated by interfaces can boost the performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction by optimizing electronic structure and reaction pathway. Herein, we construct a nano&#8208;sized Janus Bi&#8211;Sn catalyst by in situ electroreduction method, and the optimized structure and composition endow Bi&#8211;Sn catalyst with high FEHCOO&#8208; of 95.5% (&#8722;0.9&#160;V) and remarkable structural stability (310&#160;h) in H&#8208;type cell. The ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation validates that the good thermodynamic miscibility between Bi and Sn favors the decrease of atomic segregation rate during ambient electroreduction process facilitating the formation of interfaces. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that Bi&#8211;Sn interface pattern demonstrates moderate electronic interaction facilitating the decrease of adsorption free energy of HCOO* by optimizing the p&#8208;orbital energy level of Sn. Moreover, Janus Cu&#8211;Sn and Cu&#8211;Co catalysts were fabricated via in situ electroreduction strategy verifying the universality of the proposed method. This work provides new sights into engineering nonprecious Janus structured catalysts based on in situ electroreduction strategy.

         <title>The Origin of the Feedstock Molecules for Life on the Hadean Earth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of life in the Hadean eon required the formation of amino acids and nucleosides among the key molecules of life. In an often postulated strongly reducing atmosphere, HCN and its derivatives are robustly formed as plausible starting molecules. But HCN does not form in a Hadean, weakly reducing atmosphere. Instead, aldehydes and NO are produced, which react to produce oxime, amidoxime, and nitrile&#8208;based feedstock molecules as precursors.








Abstract
The origin of life in the Hadean eon required the formation of amino acids and nucleosides among the key molecules of life. It is assumed that highly unsaturated carbon and nitrogen containing feedstock molecules, which form in a strongly reducing H2&#8208;atmosphere were the reactive starting materials. The Hadean Earth was, however, surrounded by a CO2&#8208;dominated atmosphere and the question of how under such inert conditions the biomolecules could have formed is unsolved. Here, we report that HNO and formaldehyde, which form robustly in a weakly reducing atmosphere by lightning and UV&#8208;irradiation, react with SO2 to produce oxime, amidoxime, and nitrile&#8208;containing molecules, which react to give precursors to amino acids and all four canonical nucleosides. The small number of feedstock molecules required suggests that the molecules of life can robustly form on all types of rock planets with volcanic activity and a CO2&#8208;dominated atmosphere.

         <title>Multivariate Sulfate&#8208;Pillared Metal Azolate Frameworks with Tunable Flexibility for CO2 Capture from C2 Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>

Suppressing flexibility for CO2 capture: The multivariate functionality approach precisely modulates the structural flexibility of sulfate&#8208;pillared metal azolate frameworks, enhancing their selective CO2 capture and separation from C2 hydrocarbons for sustainable carbon cycling.








Abstract
A series of sulfate&#8208;pillared metal azolate frameworks (MAFs) were synthesized via a multivariate (MTV) strategy to systematically tune framework flexibility and gas separation performance. The monotonic sulfate&#8208;pillared MAF, Zn2(daTz)2SO4 (where daTz = 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolate), exhibits pronounced structural dynamics upon adaptive guest inclusions, driven by triazolate linker rotation and reversible Zn&#9472;O bonds rearrangement, enabling dynamic pore modulation for efficient CO2, C2H4, and C2H6 uptakes. Incorporation of an asymmetric, non&#8208;amino linker effectively suppresses framework flexibility by reducing intraframework hydrogen bonding, resulting in a locked structure with enhanced selectivity for CO2 over light hydrocarbons. Gas adsorption and breakthrough experiments demonstrate that the MTV approach enabled structural control, leading to exceptional CO2/C2H6 and CO2/C2H4 separation performance. Notably, Zn2(mTz)0.74(daTz)1.26SO4 (where mTz = 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazolate) achieves 17&#8208;fold enhancement in ethylene purification. Comprehensive structural analyses and interaction energy calculations reveal the molecular basis of flexibility regulation, offering valuable insights for designing next&#8208;generation porous materials for selective gas separation.

         <title>Distinct Hole and Electron Transport Anisotropy in Ambipolar Nickel Dithiolene&#8208;Based Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous yet distinct anisotropic transport of holes and electrons is demonstrated within a single&#8208;component ambipolar semiconductor. Utilizing an air&#8208;stable ambipolar semiconductor, we elucidated frontier orbital&#8208;specific intermolecular interactions governing the factor for this transport anisotropy, guiding the development of next&#8208;generation anisotropic electronic devices.








Abstract
Understanding anisotropic charge transport in molecular semiconductors is crucial for device optimization, yet its intricate dependence on orbital&#8208;specific intermolecular interactions and molecular packing remains a challenge, especially in ambipolar systems. In ambipolar semiconductors, where both holes and electrons participate in conduction, distinct molecular orbitals prompt a critical inquiry: can orbital variations result in coexisting yet distinct anisotropic transport properties within a single component? We confirm this possibility by demonstrating that the air&#8208;stable nickel dithiolene, Ni(4OPr), exhibits such behavior. Despite its herringbone stacking implying a two&#8208;dimensional electronic structure, Ni(4OPr) uniquely exhibits distinct intermolecular interactions for hole (HOMO&#8208;to&#8208;HOMO; HOMO = highest occupied molecular orbital) and electron (LUMO&#8208;to&#8208;LUMO; LUMO = lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) transport. Crucially, this leads to highly anisotropic hole transport pathways, while electron pathways are remarkably isotropic, demonstrating a stark contrast in their transport anisotropies. Leveraging the high crystallinity, grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) determined in&#8208;plane molecular orientation. This enabled experimental verification of distinct anisotropic hole and electron transport, directly governed by orbital&#8208;specific intermolecular interactions, in an ambipolar molecular semiconductor. Our findings, demonstrating coexisting yet distinct anisotropic transport properties for both carriers within a single component, significantly advance the understanding of ambipolar molecular semiconductors and broaden their scope for future device applications.

         <title>Orbital Rehybridization Enabling Abundant Pentagonal&#8211;Heptagonal Rings in Hard Carbon for Optimal Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The constructed pentagonal&#8211;heptagonal rings induces ripple&#8208;like distortions in the carbon layers of hard carbon. The resulting curvature structures deviate from the sp2 hybridization state, denoting electron abundance at the curvature sites. Such electronic reconfiguration confers hard carbon materials with exceptional sodium storage activity.








Abstract
Curvature structure modulation through the introduction of abundant non&#8208;hexagonal (pentagonal and/or heptagonal) rings results in structural mutation and tuning of the electronic structure of hard carbon. This functional utilization of hard carbon is promising yet very challenging. For instance, in an electrochemical storage system, the curvature effect leads to the formation of structurally defective carbon materials with higher reactivity than pure graphite. Here, we reveal that the introduction of pentagonal&#8211;heptagonal rings results in partial structural distortion by distorting C&#9552;C bonds in pyrolyzed topologically defective hard carbon (TDC). Theoretical and experimental evidence indicates that hard carbon with abundant pentagonal&#8211;heptagonal rings forms localized curvature structures. The corresponding changes in electronic properties from the sp2 hybridization state are mainly due to the rehybridization of &#963; and &#960; orbitals. The resulting charge&#8208;rich structure has high reactivity for sodium ion adsorption. Samples with abundant pentagonal&#8211;heptagonal rings exhibited excellent rate performance and high cycling stability, as indicated by a capacity of 411&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (TDC&#8208;2) after 400 cycles at a current density of 2&#160;A g&#8722;1, in contrast to 212&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 for TDC&#8208;1.

         <title>Electrochemical Conversion of Methane to C2+ Hydrocarbons and Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and stable CH4 conversion in a solid oxide steam electrolyzer is proposed to produce C2+ hydrocarbons and hydrogen synchronously, and the electro&#8208;spillover oxygen modulated surface C&#9472;H cleavage followed by the gaseous &#183;CH3 radical coupling mechanism is elucidated. 








Abstract
Catalytic methane (CH4) upgrading to C2+ products has attracted widespread interest. However, non&#8208;oxidative coupling and oxidative coupling of CH4 are limited by coking and over&#8208;oxidation, respectively. In this work, we propose an efficient and stable CH4 conversion system in a solid oxide steam electrolyzer, enabling the simultaneous production of C2+ hydrocarbons and H2. Furthermore, through various in situ characterizations, we reveal a gaseous &#183;CH3 radical coupling mechanism underlying the electrochemical CH4 conversion. These findings pave the way for the efficient design of the electrode for anodic CH4 coupling reactions in a solid oxide electrolyzer and establish a new framework for atom&#8208;efficient strategies for CH4 upgrading.

         <title>Synergistic t2g&#8208;to&#8208;&#960;* Electron Transfer and Nanotube Engineering in Spinal Catalysts for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Chloride Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The t2g&#8208;to&#8208;&#960;* &#960;&#8208;backbonding and the unique open nanotube architecture are successfully constructed in the carbon quantum dot&#8208;functionalized trimetallic spinel nanotubes (FCNO@CQDs) for the chlorine evolution reaction (CER). The optimized FCNO@CQDs requires only 174&#160;mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, maintaining for 240&#160;h without obvious degradation, and displays selectivity up to 99.0%.








Abstract
Facing the massive energy consumption of over 200 TWh y&#8722;1 of chlor&#8208;alkali industry, developing high&#8208;activity and durable non&#8208;precious CER (chlorine evolution reaction) catalysts is urgently needed to address the high overpotentials and suppress the dissolution high&#8208;valance metal species. Herein, a carbon quantum dots functionalized trimetallic Fe/Co/Ni spinel oxide nanotube architecture (FCNO@CQDs) is constructed, featuring t2g&#8208;to&#8208;&#960;* &#960;&#8208;backbonding for dramatically enhanced CER activity and stability. The reverse electron flow from Co d&#8208;obritals to the vacant CQDs&#8217; &#960;* orbitals can upshift the d&#8208;band center for enhanced intermediate adsorption, while stabilizing high&#8208;valent Co centers via increased bond order. Meanwhile, the open nanotube architecture facilitates rapid mass transfer and efficient Cl2 desorption, validated by fluid dynamics simulations and in situ microscopic analysis. Electrochemically, FCNO@CQDs achieves an ultralow overpotential of 174&#160;mV at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and exceptional selectivity of 98.8%&#8211;99.7% across a broad potential range, outperforming commercial Ru/Ir&#8208;based dimensionally stable anodes (DSA). Mechanistic studies reveal a dynamic transition from the Volmer&#8211;Heyrovsk&#253; pathway to a hybrid Volmer&#8211;Heyrovsk&#253; and Tafel mechanism under high Cl* coverage (&#952;Cl &#8764;72%), enabling rapid kinetics. By bridging molecular orbital theory with nanoscale architecture design, FCNO@CQDs provides a valuable strategy for optimizing cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;performance CER catalysts.

The high dispersion of inorganic nanoparticles in organic polymers was achieved by B&#9472;O&#9472;W coordination bond locking, which effectively reduced the band gap width of phosphotungstic acid, and the optimal conjugated organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid photochromic material (PDAB0.3&#8208;W) exhibited high transparency (96.4%), excellent dimming capability (&#9651;T550&#160;nm&#160;=&#160;87.1%), and excellent adhesion strength (13&#160;MPa). Adaptive solar thermal and light conditioning performance in different seasons, significantly reducing building energy consumption.








Abstract
Photochromic smart windows with efficient solar heat and sunlight modulation are highly sought after for energy efficiency in buildings. However, the preparation of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid photochromic coating with high transparency and excellent dimming ability remains a challenge. Here, we achieve a high dispersion of inorganic nanoparticles in the polymer network based on the B&#9472;O&#9472;W coordination bond locking strategy, and effectively reduce the energy band gap of Phosphotungstic acid (PTA) by adjusting the local coordination and electronic environment of the metal centre (W) to design a novel conjugated organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid photochromic material with high transparency (96.4%), rapid photoresponse (colouring in10&#160;s), and excellent dimming ability (reaching saturation state in 20&#160;min, Visible light modulation range &#9651;T550&#160;nm&#160;=&#160;87.1%, &#9651;T749&#160;nm&#160;=&#160;94.0%). Selective heating and cooling of interiors in winter and summer shows excellent potential for improving indoor sunlight comfort and increasing energy efficiency in buildings.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Modulation of Mg2+ Desolvation Beyond the Primary Solvation Shell in Magnesium Battery Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the outer solvation sheath, the CH&#8208;&#960; interactions between 7&#8208;aminoindole (7AID) and solvent molecules counteract the coordination bonds between Mg2+ and solvent molecules. Meanwhile, in the bulk phase, 7AID reduces the availability of solvent molecules for Mg2+ coordination via hydrogen bonds and CH&#8208;&#960; interactions. The interactions in dual sites reduce the Mg2+&#8208;desolvation energy barrier, thereby reducing the overpotential.








Abstract
High overpotential and instability of Mg anode reactions limit the development of halide&#8208;free Mg battery electrolytes. Here, we report 7&#8208;aminoindole (7AID), a predominantly noncoordinating additive that modulates solvation via CH&#8211;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions with both Mg2+&#8208;bound and free ether solvents. These outer&#8208;shell and bulk&#8208;phase interactions weaken Mg2+&#183;&#183;&#183;solvent binding, enhance solvent mobility, and lower the desolvation barrier. As a result, Mg plating/stripping overpotentials are significantly reduced and interfacial stability is improved. Compared to strongly coordinating additives, this approach suppresses parasitic reactions and enables more stable cycling. This work presents a solvation&#8208;targeted additive design paradigm beyond the primary coordination shell for advancing multivalent battery electrolytes.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclobutane&#8208;fused Heterocycles via Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative [2+2] Photocycloaddition of Indoles, Benzofurans, and Benzothiophenes with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular approach for the enantioselective [2+2] photocycloaddition dearomatization of indoles, benzothiophenes, and benzofurans with alkenes was developed. This method is characterized by the use of readily available Lewis acid catalysts and the broad diversity of substrates. A wide range of cyclobutane&#8208;fused indolines, dihydrobenzothiophenes, and dihydrobenzofurans were obtained with excellent yields and selectivities. 








Abstract
Cyclobutane&#8208;fused heterocycles are important motifs in biologically active molecules, yet their enantioselective synthesis remains a significant challenge. We report a broadly applicable and modular strategy for constructing these strained architectures through a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated, Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed dearomative [2+2] photocycloaddition of indoles, benzofurans, and benzothiophenes with alkenes. The method employs a simple catalytic system based on commercially available rare&#8208;earth Lewis acids and chiral pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(oxazoline) (PyBox) ligands. A wide array of heteroarenes and styrenes bearing diverse functional groups participate efficiently, delivering cyclobutane&#8208;fused products in up to 96% yield, &gt;20:1 dr, and &gt;99% ee. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated by gram&#8208;scale synthesis and facile removal of the directing group to access functionalized amino acid derivatives. Mechanistic investigations, including ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8211;vis) spectroscopy, nonlinear effect studies, kinetic isotope effects, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveal that a triplet&#8208;state heteroarene engages in regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective C&#9472;C bond formation under mild photochemical conditions. This study highlights the potential of excited&#8208;state Lewis acid catalysis in unlocking enantioselective dearomatization pathways for complex molecular architectures.

         <title>The Crucial Role of Solvent and Bound Oxygen on the Interplay of Cerium (III) and Cerium (IV) Chloride in a Photocatalytic Cycle for Organic Transformations</title>

Ultrafast Photooxidation of Ce (III) by nearby O2 molecules at a distance of 2.3&#160;&#197;, forming the Ce (IV) evident by a peak maximized at 375&#160;nm.








Abstract
Here, we investigate the fundamental interactions between Ce (III) chloride, molecular oxygen, and various solvent environments to elucidate their collective impact on photocatalytic efficiency. Through comprehensive spectroscopic analyses and computational modeling, we discovered that in acetonitrile (MeCN), O2 molecules directly bind to the metal complex using the sphere of action model with a separation distance of 2.35 &#197;. This binding leads to significant emission quenching of the 4f &#8592; 5d transition, driven by an ultrafast electron transfer from Ce (III) to bound molecular oxygen, leading to Ce (IV) and O2&#8226;&#9472; (superoxide radical anion) in approximately 1.0&#160;ps, as confirmed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. However, this distinctive O2 interaction is disrupted by the presence of strong oxidizing substrates, such as 4&#8208;fluoroiodobenzene, or when the complex is dissolved in protic solvents like methanol (MeOH) or water (H2O). In these protic media, MeOH or H2O solvent molecules displace the Cl&#8722; ligands, and the extended hydrogen bonding network formed by MeOH or H2O ligand acts as an effective shield around the Ce (III) center. Our findings reveal how solvent selection can strategically modulate Ce (III) photochemistry, shifting the balance between emission&#8208;dominated and redox&#8208;active pathways, and providing a mechanistic foundation for optimizing cerium&#8208;based photocatalytic systems.

This work demonstrated lattice oxygen activity, represented by the amounts of O 2p ligand holes and O 2p band center relative to the Fermi level, as the electronic descriptor for the performance of spinel oxides MCo2O4 (M&#9552;Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, and Ni) in the ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR).








Abstract
Electrocatalytic upcycling of waste polyester plastics into valuable organic acids offers a dual solution for mitigating plastic pollution and promoting sustainable carbon cycling. However, practical implementation remains limited by the scarcity of cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. In this work, we investigate MCo2O4 (where M&#9552;Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, and Ni) as model catalysts and identify lattice oxygen activity as a critical factor governing the electrochemical upgrading of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET). NiCo2O4 demonstrates the highest oxygen activity, characterized by the greatest density of O 2p ligand holes and the closest proximity of the O 2p band center to the Fermi level. Such unique character facilitates lattice oxygen participation in surface electro&#8208;oxidation reactions, leading to exceptional performance of up to 98.3% formate selectivity and 98.9% Faraday efficiency, among the highest values reported for transition metal catalysts in alcohol electro&#8208;oxidation. We further demonstrate the direct electrocatalytic upcycling of real waste PET plastics, estimating a $739 profit per ton of recycled PET and confirming its economic viability. These results provide critical insights for refining the design principles of electrocatalytic systems aimed at recycling diverse waste materials and pollutants.

         <title>Strong Dipole Moments and Increased Charge Transfer in Polymer&#8208;Based Solid Electrolyte Enable Wide&#8208;Temperature Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composite polymer electrolytes (CSEs) were prepared by adding POP&#8208;SO3H@Zn(NO3)2 fillers to PEO&#8208;based polymer electrolytes. The strong dipole moment and accelerated charge transfer properties in POP&#8208;SO3H catalyzed the decomposition of NO3&#8722; and TFSI&#8722; and accelerated the migration of Li+. At the same time, LiF/Li3N/LiZn&#8208;rich SEI are formed to comprehensively improve the battery performance.








Abstract
The development of solid electrolyte interfaces (SEI) using lithium and nitrate salts represents a promising approach to enhancing the performance of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the inherent stability of lithium and nitrate salts often results in incomplete decomposition, leading to the formation of inhomogeneous SEI that degrade battery performance. In this study, a strong dipole moment and increased charge transfer strategy are used, which can effectively catalyze the decomposition of NO3&#8722; and TFSI&#8722; and accelerate the migration of Li+, as well as the formation of Li3N&#8208;LiF&#8208;rich SEI. Li/CSEs/LFP batteries demonstrated excellent cycling stability over a wide temperature range (30&#8211;100 &#176;C) and across various charge/discharge rates (1C&#8208;5C). Notably, pouch cells with high loading of Ni90Co5Mn5 and LFP exhibited remarkable electrochemical performance and safety. This work presents a strong dipole moment and increased charge transfer strategy for optimizing polymer electrolytes, providing new insights into optimizing the performance of LMBs.

         <title>Engineering Energy Dissipation Pathway via Topological Design: Toward Tunable Macroscopic Mechanical Performances of Dynamic Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We leverage orthogonal host&#8211;guest recognition and metal&#8208;ligand coordination to construct SPNs and MINs with distinct topological cross&#8208;linked architectures, which perform&#160;divergent energy dissipation pathways. In SPNs, after host&#8211;guest recognition dissociates, the macrocycle slides along the axle and slips off, with the coordination bond remaining intact. In contrast, in MINs, force transmission from the host to the axial stoppers following host&#8211;guest dissociation, results in rupture of metal&#8208;coordination bonds and contributes to additional energy dissipation. This fundamental difference in energy dissipation pathways results in significantly enhanced mechanical performance of MIN&#8208;2. 








Abstract
The incorporation of multiple supramolecular interactions as sacrificial bonds for energy dissipation has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the mechanical properties of elastomeric materials. However, precise control over energy dissipation pathways remains challenging, primarily due to the difficulty in selectively activating specific interactions on demand. Herein, we present an orthogonal self&#8208;assembly strategy that integrates host&#8211;guest recognition and metal&#8208;coordination to tailor energy dissipation mechanisms. We demonstrate that subtle modifications at the axial terminals of host&#8211;guest motifs dictate the formation of supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) or mechanically interlocked networks (MINs), respectively. Upon external force, SPNs dissipate energy primarily through host&#8210;guest dissociation, while coordination bonds remain intact. In contrast, in MINs, force transmission from the host to the axial stoppers following host&#8210;guest dissociation leads to the rupture of metal&#8208;coordination bonds, enabling additional dissipate energy. This fundamental divergence in energy dissipation pathways results in superior mechanical performance in MIN&#8208;2, with higher strength (19.1&#160;versus 14.5&#160;MPa), toughness (57.7&#160;versus 45.9&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), and puncture resistance compared to SPN&#8208;2. These findings highlight the potential of topological structure design in precisely tuning energy dissipation pathways, offering a robust and versatile strategy for developing high&#8208;performance supramolecular elastomers.

         <title>Conjugated Base Assists Proton Stripping off Pt for Alkaline H2 Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present that, when proton acid is immobilized on carbon support, in alkaline solution, it will be deprotonated, forming numerous conjugated base surrounding Pt. Such surface anchored conjugated base will assist the stripping and interfacial transfer of H+ off Pt, thereby significantly enhancing alkaline HOR.








Abstract
Recent studies have revealed that slow transfer of the continuously formed H+ away from Pt surface can be a potential cause responsible for the extremely sluggish alkaline hydrogen oxidation (HOR). Herein, we show that anchoring mild oxyacid on carbon support is a generally effective approach to boost interfacial transfer of proton away from Pt. In alkaline solution, the surface anchored oxyacid is deprotonated generating affluent conjugated base surrounding Pt; taking C&#8208;PO42&#8208; as a typical example, the conjugated base can readily seize&#160;the as&#8208;formed H+ around Pt (Pt&#8208;H+ + C&#9472;PO42&#8208; &#8594; Pt&#160;+&#160;C&#9472;H2PO4) from HOR, which then are neutralized immediately by OH&#8722; in the bulk solution (C&#9472;H2PO4&#160;+&#160;OH&#8722; &#8594; C&#9472;PO42&#8722; + H2O). Via such repetitive protonation and deprotonation, the as&#8208;formed H+ from HOR is efficiently transported away from Pt surface, thereby significantly improving the HOR rates. This strategy is found both effective for developing home&#8208;made Pt electrocatalysts as well as for modification of those commercial Pt/C. This study emphasizes the importance of enhancing interfacial proton transfer along the pursuit of efficient Pt electrocatalysts for alkaline HOR and provides a straightforward and generally effective strategy to address the issue.

         <title>Are Grignard Reactions in Deep Eutectic Solvents Interface&#8208;Driven?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and molecular dynamics studies of acetophenone, alongside a computational analysis of i&#8208;PrMgCl in a biphasic ChCl:2Gly DES/THF solution, offer valuable insights into the remarkable efficiency of the Grignard reaction under these conditions. The poorly soluble acetophenone interacts with the Grignard reagent at the interface of the two solvents, enhancing the probability of effective contact between the reagents.








Abstract
Due to their high reactivity, organolithium and organomagnesium addition to ketones is usually performed under inert atmosphere at low temperature.

&lt;p&gt;Experimental and molecular dynamics studies of acetophenone, alongside a computational analysis of &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-PrMgCl in a biphasic ChCl:2Gly DES/THF solution, offer valuable insights into the remarkable efficiency of the Grignard reaction under these conditions. The poorly soluble acetophenone interacts with the Grignard reagent at the interface of the two solvents, enhancing the probability of effective contact between the reagents.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to their high reactivity, organolithium and organomagnesium addition to ketones is usually performed under inert atmosphere at low temperature. Recent work has shown that, by dissolving the substrate in deep eutectic solvents (DES), these processes can be carried out on the benchtop, in air at room temperature. Surprisingly, the organometallic reagent, added to the DES from an organic solution, works in these conditions and gives better yields than in the standard setup. Here, we investigated acetophenone in a (1:2) choline chloride:glycerol (ChCl:Gly) DES solution by experimental liquid diffraction, neutron reflectometry, NMR, interfacial tension measurements, and by computational modelling. Our data show that this DES is a poor solvent for the ketone and promotes its accumulation at the surface of the liquid or its escape into the organic solvent.

         <title>Operando XAFS Reveals Dynamic Structural Evolution of Pt Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Chlorine Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando XAFS elucidated structure&#8211;activity relationships in single&#8208;atom catalysts for chlorine evolution reaction (CER). Divergent catalyst&#8208;Cl intermediate interactions under CER conditions were observed on the PtN4 site and the low&#8208;coordinated Pt site. The latter exhibited higher *Cl coverage than that of PtN4 site, shifting the traditional rate&#8208;determining step from that on PtN4 site to the Heyrovsk&#253; step and improving CER activity.








Abstract
Metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with near&#8208;100% metal utilization and flexible coordination environments are promising candidates for electrochemical chlorine evolution reaction (CER) to produce valuable Cl2&#8212;a key raw material for plastics manufacturing, water treatment, and pharmaceuticals. However, it remains challenging to assess specific coordination environments for structure&#8211;activity relationships and monitor their dynamic structural evolution under catalytic reaction conditions. Herein, operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) revealed distinct dynamic structural evolution on the low&#8208;coordinated Pt site, compared to the conventional PtN4 site. Specifically, the low&#8208;coordinated Pt site transformed into an asymmetry PtN2Cl2 structure upon exposure to a Cl&#8722;&#8208;containing solution, transiently evolved to PtN2Cl4 intermediate at low overpotentials, and reverted to PtN2Cl2 after CER. By overcoming the limitation of *Cl intermediate coverage on PtN4 SAC, the low&#8208;coordinated Pt SAC displayed superior CER performance to commercial RuO2 and PtN4 benchmarks. This work provides new insights into the rational design of coordination geometry in SACs for electrocatalysis.

         <title>Pt Atomic Site&#8208;Engineered Redox Mediator Boosts Electrosynthesis of Formic Acid from Glycerol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic Pt site&#8208;engineered Ni2+&#948;&#8211;(OH)ads redox mediator is reported for greatly boosting glycerol conversion, which circumvents the involvement of Ni3+&#8211;O. This regulatory strategy can effectively break the high potential limitation of the dual&#8208;mediator mechanism, thus enabling high&#8208;performance electrosynthesis of formic acid from glycerol at remarkably low potential.








Abstract
Electrophilic oxygen&#8208;mediated non&#8208;electrocatalytic processes on Ni&#8208;based catalysts enable highly selective electrosynthesis of formic acid from glycerol. However, this process, usually mediated by dual mediators of Ni3+&#8211;O and Ni2+&#948;&#8211;(OH)ads, is significantly plagued by the high potential of Ni3+&#8211;O. Herein, we report a class of Pt atomic site&#8208;engineered Ni2+&#948;&#8211;(OH)ads redox mediators without Ni3+&#8211;O involvement for breaking the dual&#8208;mediator mechanism limitation, achieving efficient formic acid electrosynthesis from glycerol at remarkably low potential. We demonstrate that Pt atomic sites on Ni aerogels can promote Ni2+&#948;&#8211;(OH)ads generation, thereby circumventing the Ni3+&#8211;O pathway and favoring initial C&#9472;C bond cleavage and sequential hydrogen atom transfer of C1 intermediates. The resultant Ni93Pt7 exhibits a remarkably low onset potential of only 1.25&#160;V and a high efficiency of 250 C for &#8764;100% glycerol conversion, outperforming Ni aerogels (1.36&#160;V, 300 C) and catalysts reported previously, along with excellent stability over 180&#160;h. We further demonstrate the broad applicability of this atomic site&#8208;promoted redox mediator engineering for low&#8208;potential electrosynthesis of low&#8208;carbon compounds from other vicinal polyols.

         <title>In Situ Cation&#8208;Switched Organometallic Cage Reconfiguration Enables Highly Selective Li+ Recognition and Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces the alkali ion&#8208;induced reconstitution of a [Ag3L2]3+ metallocage into three highly ordered [MAg12L8]3+ (M&#160;=&#160;Li+, Na+, K+) architectures. The reconstituted metallocages exhibit unparalleled binding selectivity for alkali ions (Li+ &gt; Na+ &gt; K+). Leveraging this specificity, a supramolecular extractant was demonstrated that was capable of selective Li+ recovery from Mg2+/Li+ brine (2000:1), with CO32&#8722;&#8208;driven reassembly enabling repeated extraction cycles.








Abstract
Biomacromolecular selectivity paradigms, epitomized by the &#8220;induced&#8208;fit&#8221; concept, motivate adaptive supramolecular designs; however, cationic guest&#8208;directed morphological responses in metal&#8208;coordinated hosts remain inadequately developed. We reveal a dynamic AgI&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cage that experiences alkali ion&#8208;induced structural metamorphosis triggered by Lewis acid&#8210;base interactions. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and independent gradient model (IGM) evidence confirm that these interaction templates have highly ordered architectures exceeding 340 non&#8208;H atoms. Competitive affinity assessments exhibit unprecedented Li+ discrimination against Na+/K+ (Li+ &gt; Na+ &gt; K+), outperforming commercial benchmark chelators (e.g., crown ethers and cryptands). Capitalizing on this trait, we fabricated a supramolecular extractant for targeted Li+ isolation from both an equimolar Li+/Na+/K+ brine and a high&#8208;Mg2+ brine (c(Mg2+)/c(Li+)&#160;&#8776;&#160;2000/1). Subsequent carbonate&#8208;induced reconfiguration reverts the initial metallocage, permitting cyclic utilization. This study deciphers cation&#8208;modulated plasticity in coordination architectures and offers a recyclable bioinspired platform for precision ion recognition and extraction.

Effects of inert cation on regulating the interfacial electrolyte configuration dynamic evolution were revealed by advanced spectroscopy methods. By tuning the interfacial electrolyte configuration, inert cation promotes anion decomposition and suppresses parasitic reaction.








Abstract
Interfacial stability in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) hinges on precise regulation of dynamic interfacial electrolyte configuration. Although inert cations are frequently employed to stabilize Li&#8208;metal anode, their interfacial adsorption behavior and the resultant evolution of the electrolyte/electrode interface remain elusive. Herein, using in&#8208;situ spectroscopy, we visualized the adsorption of inert cations, exemplified by tetrabutylammonium (TBA+). Furthermore, the inherent anion&#8208;lean, solvent&#8208;rich interface formed during desolvation was mitigated by the electrostatic interaction between TBA+ and anions. This anion&#8208;anchoring effect promotes preferential anion decomposition, thereby suppressing parasitic reactions associated with solvent decomposition. Consequently, the cycling stability and reversibility of Li stripping/plating are significantly enhanced. This work not only refreshes the understanding of inert cations on regulating the interfacial electrolyte configuration, but also highlights the close relationship between the interfacial solvation configuration and the SEI architecture, offering fundamental insights for potential electrolyte design.

&lt;p&gt;Interfacial stability in high-energy-density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) hinges on precise regulation of dynamic interfacial electrolyte configuration. Although inert cations are frequently employed to stabilize Li-metal anode, their interfacial adsorption behavior and the resultant evolution of the electrolyte/electrode interface remain elusive. Herein, using in-situ spectroscopy, we visualized the adsorption of inert cations, exemplified by tetrabutylammonium (TBA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, the inherent anion-lean, solvent-rich interface formed during desolvation was mitigated by the electrostatic interaction between TBA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and anions. This anion-anchoring effect promotes preferential anion decomposition, thereby suppressing parasitic reactions associated with solvent decomposition.

         <title>Conductive Knitting of Covalent Organic Framework Manipulates Spin Density, Orbital Reorganization, and Charge Mobility for Outstanding Photoreactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent integration of polythiophene chains into COFs enables the transformation of 2D structure into a well&#8208;defined, highly conductive 3D framework. This molecular weaving strategy not only significantly enhances electrical conductivity but also induces pronounced HOMO&#8208;LUMO spatial separation, increases active site density, and ultimately leads to superior photocatalytic performance in quinazolinone photosynthesis.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts but are hindered by inherent limitations such as low interlayer charge mobility, restricted active site accessibility, and inefficient charge separation. Herein, we constructed a thiophene&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based COF photocatalytic system, comprising a COF with thiophene&#8208;modified pore walls and a quasi&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COF formed via in situ oxidative polymerization&#8212;generated polythiophene chains covalently linked to the COF skeleton. The knitting of 2D COF layers with conjugated polythiophene units endows the 3D COF with enhanced light absorption capability and improved conductivity by four orders of magnitude. The synergistic structural and functional merits of this 3D COF achieve exceptional performance in quinazolinone photosynthesis (99% conversion, &gt; 96% selectivity), doubling the selectivity of its 2D COF. Spectroscopic and computational studies reveal that thiophene polymerization induces pronounced HOMO&#8208;LUMO spatial separation and a substantial increase in spin density. These results demonstrate that interlayer covalent linkages of thiophene can manipulate active site density and charge mobility to improve photocatalytic efficiency. The polythiophene chains serve as conjugated bridges, narrowing the bandgap, and creating additional electron transport pathways. This discovery pioneers a paradigm for enhancing photocatalytic activity via interlayer conductive weaving strategy in COF architectures.

         <title>Potent Fluorescent Probe for Target&#8208;Engagement Studies of Allosteric Pyruvate Kinase Modulators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
LumiPK, a novel environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent tracer, enables direct monitoring of allosteric ligand engagement with pyruvate kinase fused with nanoluciferase (Nluc), focusing on the liver isoform (PKL). In NanoBRET, and fluorescence indicator displacement assays, LumiPK shows high affinity and validates known allosteric modulators of PKL. This tool compound advances target engagement technologies and supports broader PK&#8208;related therapeutic research.








Abstract
Pyruvate kinases (PKs) are highly allosterically regulated enzymes that play a central role in cellular metabolism and are increasingly recognized as valuable therapeutic targets in cancer, metabolic diseases, and diabetes. Despite their biological and clinical significance, methods to directly assess allosteric ligand engagement of PK isoforms remain limited. Here, we report the development of LumiPK, a novel, environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescent tracer designed to monitor allosteric binding to the liver isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKL). LumiPK integrates an environment&#8208;sensitive 4&#8208;sulfamonyl&#8208;7&#8208;aminobenzoxadiazole fluorophore into a potent allosteric modulator scaffold. It emerged as the lead compound from a small ligand series, showing high affinity for PKL (KD&#160; = &#160;37&#160;&#177;&#160;5&#160;nM) in recombinant assays; the most potent fluorescent PK reporter reported to date. A NanoBRET assay using a PKL&#8208;Nluc fusion (PKLNluc) enabled intracellular monitoring of unlabeled ligand engagement. LumiPK maintained high potency (EC50&#160; = &#160;18.4&#160;nM) in cellular experiments. Competitive NanoBRET and fluorescence titration assays confirmed binding of known PKL activators (mitapivat, TEPP&#8208;46, DASA&#8208;58) in both cellular and recombinant settings, with KD values remaining consistent across these methods. LumiPK thus provides a robust tool for probing PKL allosteric modulation and fills a key gap in target engagement technologies for PKL.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Alkaline Double Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double electrolyte strategy combining an acidic catholyte (7&#160;M H3PO4) and an alkaline anolyte (6&#160;M KOH), separated by a proton exchange membrane (PEM), enables a 1.83&#160;V aqueous proton battery. Using CoCuHCF and benzo[c]cinnoline (BCC) as electrodes, the system achieves high energy&#8212;power output and excellent cycling stability, offering a new path for high&#8208;voltage aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous proton batteries offer a promising energy storage solution due to their inherent safety, rapid ion mobility, and low cost. However, their performance is largely constrained by water's limited electrochemical stability, restricting operating voltage and energy density. This study addresses this challenge by introducing an innovative acid&#8208;alkaline double electrolyte configuration to achieve high&#8208;voltage aqueous proton batteries. Employing a high&#8208;anodic&#8208;limit acidic catholyte (7&#160;M H3PO4) and a low&#8208;cathodic&#8208;limit alkaline anolyte (6&#160;M KOH), separated by a proton exchange membrane (PEM), significantly expands the full battery's electrochemical stability window (ESW) to 2.91&#160;V. Cobalt&#8208;doped Prussian blue (CoCuHCF) was selected as the cathode due to its superior proton kinetics and cycling durability, while benzo[c]cinnoline (BCC) was identified as an optimal anode via combined theoretical analysis and experimental validation. Consequently, the battery delivered exceptional electrochemical performance, achieving a high energy density of 329.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, a remarkable power density of 14788.3&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1, and excellent cycling stability with 98.3% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. The proposed acid&#8208;alkaline double electrolyte strategy provides efficient and valuable guidance for advancing aqueous energy storage technologies.

         <title>Cationic&#8211;Zwitterionic Polymer Electrolytes with Enhanced Ionic Conductivity and Lithium&#8208;Ion Selectivity for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic&#8211;zwitterionic polymers are developed to address the low ionic conductivity and lithium&#8208;ion selectivity of polymer electrolytes. Sulfonate moieties facilitate cation dissociation and transport, while cationic groups confine anions electrostatically, yielding a conductivity of 1.6&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a lithium transference number of 0.76.

Polymer electrolytes are attractive for solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;metal batteries owing to their favorable interfacial compatibility and scalable processability. However, the concurrent realization of high ionic conductivity and a high lithium&#8208;ion transference number remains a significant key challenge. Herein, we report a class of cationic&#8211;zwitterionic polymer electrolytes that simultaneously exhibit high ionic conductivity and enhanced lithium&#8208;ion selectivity. The cationic segments within the polymer networks immobilize anions to promote selective lithium&#8208;ion transport, while sulfonate groups facilitate effective lithium salt dissociation and ion mobility. Structural and electrochemical analyses verify the stability and performance of these electrolytes in lithium symmetric cells and Li||LiFePO4 batteries. Notably, a 1.2&#160;Ah pouch cell incorporating the optimized electrolyte validates the practical scalability and safety, highlighting its promise for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Cationic&#8211;zwitterionic polymers are developed to address the low ionic conductivity and lithium-ion selectivity of polymer electrolytes. Sulfonate moieties facilitate cation dissociation and transport, while cationic groups confine anions electrostatically, yielding a conductivity of 1.6&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a lithium transference number of 0.76. These electrolytes demonstrate high safety and enable Ah-level lithium&#8211;metal batteries.

         <title>Multicomponent Assembly of High&#8208;Component Covalent Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The employment of multicomponent reactions enables the synthesis of the highest component [6+24+24] covalent organic cages featuring coronavirus&#8208;shaped structures. These cages are assembled through C&#9552;N, B&#8592;N, and B&#9472;O linkages. Moreover, they can be readily functionalized by merely choosing spike alcohol synthons with specific functionalization and desired properties.








Abstract
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs), a powerful strategy for generating desired products by employing more than two starting materials in one&#8208;pot reactions, have been determined to be a superior synthetic strategy to achieve structural complexity and functional diversity. However, the use of MCRs in fabricating the multicomponent covalent organic cages (MCOCs) is still in its infancy. Here we report coronavirus&#8208;shaped MCOCs, formed by MCR involving a Schiff&#8208;base reaction (C&#9552;N bonds), coupled with the formation of dative B&#8592;N and B&#9472;O bonds. Specifically, reaction of bowl&#8208;shaped tetraformylcalix[4]resorcinarene, linear heteroditopic amino&#8208;substituted phenylboronic acid, and spike alcohol synthons can afford [6+24+24] MCOCs with a large octahedral cavity, 8 triangle windows, 12 rhombic windows, and 24 functional alcohols, as determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Notably, the number of components for the MCOCs reaches up to 54, making them the highest in covalent organic cages. Such MCR self&#8208;assembly can also afford MCOCs other sizes and topologies just using amino&#8208;substituted phenylboronic acid synthons with different lengths and angles. Interestingly, the MCOCs can be functionalized by alcohols with different substituent groups via both one&#8208;pot reaction and post&#8208;synthetic modification methods for desired properties. This work emphasizes the utilization of MCRs in constructing functional high&#8208;component organic cages with desired properties.

         <title>Synthesis of an Sp&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Rich Carbonaceous Material Exhibiting Distinctive Anode Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot strategy to cleave two bonds, producing TMS&#8208;capped sp&#8208;carbon hybridized carbonaceous material (TMS&#8208;C) via coupling of trimethylsilylacetylene&#8208;protected acetylene. Ultra&#8208;long acetylene chains offer abundant Li storage sites, and the highly ordered crystalline structure enables near&#8208;theoretical capacity, delivering 3219&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. This work presents a promising route for carbyne synthesis and high&#8208;performance Li storage.








Abstract
Among carbon allotropes, carbyne, composed solely of sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms, has garnered significant interest due to its potential unique physical and chemical properties. Nevertheless, the synthesis of carbyne or its analogs remains a persistent challenge, hindering further exploration in this area. Herein, a straightforward synthesis method is proposed to prepare TMS&#8208;capped sp&#8208;carbon hybridized carbonaceous material (TMS&#8208;C). Trimethylsilylacetylene (TMSA) with two types of bond&#8208;cleaving spots was used as the precursor to obtain TMS&#8208;C via a one&#8208;pot coupling reaction. TMS not only inhibits side reactions but can also be cleaved to generate reaction intermediates participating in subsequent coupling reactions via a copper catalyst. The as&#8208;synthesized TMS&#8208;C contains conjugated linear acetylene bonds composed of over 92 continuous sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. Due to the large amount of sp&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms, the lithium (Li)&#8208;ion half&#8208;cell prepared based on TMS&#8208;C delivered an impressive reversible capacity of approximately 3219&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, and at a high current density of 5000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, it can be stably cycled 8865 times. Our results reveal immense promise for developing methodologies capable of cutting multiple types of bonds within a single reaction system for the synthesis of carbyne&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Construction of Fused&#8211;Bridged Tricycles by Molecular Reorganization Involving Prins Cyclization/Dicycloexpansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade Prins cyclization/dicycloexpansion of cycloalkylidene&#8208;tethered cycloketones (or their dimethoxy ketal form) was developed to synthesize fused&#8208;bridged tricyclic ring systems with consecutive quaternary centers through a molecular reorganization strategy. A diverse library of fused&#8208;bridged tricyclo[M.L.N] scaffolds (M/L/N&#160;=&#160;5&#8211;7) was accessible through systematic variation of substituents, ring sizes, tether lengths, and connectivity patterns.








Abstract
The development of efficient methods for constructing structurally complex and diverse polycyclic carbon frameworks remains in high demand for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and bioactive natural products. One such method lies in engineered one&#8208;step molecular reorganization through the cascade cyclization/cycloexpansion of rationally designed precursors with interconnected small&#8208;ring systems. Here, we have strategically designed and developed a synthetically valuable method to construct fused&#8208;bridged tricyclic systems through cascade Prins cyclization/dicycloexpansion of substrates with a cycloalkylidene (CAD) tethered to a cycloketones. This methodology features high step economy, reaction efficiency, and selectivity, as well as a broad substrate tolerance. Diversification through variation of the size of the small ring, the linker length, and the linking site has enabled the efficient synthesis of six types of fused&#8208;bridged tricyclic scaffolds, which are found frequently in bioactive natural products. Based on supporting experiments and DFT calculations, a plausible reaction mechanism is also proposed.

         <title>N,O&#8208;Alternant Belt[3]arene Utilized for Construction of Multi&#8208;Color Supramolecular TADF Materials and Highly Selective Detection of 2&#8208;Cyanopyrazine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from a new macrocyclic arene, 3,6&#8208;dimethoxycalix[3]acridine (3,6&#8208;DMO&#8208;C[3]A), N,O&#8208;alternant belt[3]arene (NOAB[3]A) was conveniently synthesized and successfully utilized to construct multi&#8208;color supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Notably, the belt[3]arene was also employed for rapid visual and highly selective detection of 2&#8208;cyanopyrazine (2CP) with the detection limit of 1.7&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1. 








Abstract
In this work, 3,6&#8208;dimethoxycalix[3]acridine (3,6&#8208;DMO&#8208;C[3]A), as a new macrocyclic arene, was synthesized and then applied to the construction of a new kind of N,O&#8208;alternant belt[3]arene (NOAB[3]A) by the conversion approach from macrocycle to belt. NOAB[3]A has a regularly hexagonal structure and electron&#8208;rich cavity, and it can be successfully utilized as an electron donor to construct supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence (STADF) materials with multi&#8208;color emissions by its complexation with electron acceptors with different electron&#8208;deficient abilities. Notably, due to the formation of STADF accompanied by fluorescence enhancement and redshift when NOAB[3]A combines with the cyanide&#8208;containing aromatic compounds, the belt[3]arene can also be directly used for highly selective, sensitive, and visual detection of 2&#8208;cyanopyrazine (2&#8208;CP) vapor at trace level. The limit of detection (LOD) concentration for 2&#8208;CP reached 1.7&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1, indicating that NOAB[3]A can serve as an excellent sensing platform for detecting 2&#8208;CP.

     alt="N,O-Alternant Belt[3]arene Utilized for Construction of Multi-Color Supramolecular TADF Materials and Highly Selective Detection of 2-Cyanopyrazine"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from a new macrocyclic arene, 3,6-dimethoxycalix[3]acridine (3,6-DMO-C[3]A), &lt;i&gt;N,O&lt;/i&gt;-alternant belt[3]arene (NOAB[3]A) was conveniently synthesized and successfully utilized to construct multi-color supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Notably, the belt[3]arene was also employed for rapid visual and highly selective detection of 2-cyanopyrazine (2CP) with the detection limit of 1.7&#160;mg&#160;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. 

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, 3,6-dimethoxycalix[3]acridine (3,6-DMO-C[3]A), as a new macrocyclic arene, was synthesized and then applied to the construction of a new kind of &lt;i&gt;N,O&lt;/i&gt;-alternant belt[3]arene (NOAB[3]A) by the conversion approach from macrocycle to belt. NOAB[3]A has a regularly hexagonal structure and electron-rich cavity, and it can be successfully utilized as an electron donor to construct supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence (STADF) materials with multi-color emissions by its complexation with electron acceptors with different electron-deficient abilities. Notably, due to the formation of STADF accompanied by fluorescence enhancement and redshift when NOAB[3]A combines with the cyanide-containing aromatic compounds, the belt[3]arene can also be directly used for highly selective, sensitive, and visual detection of 2-cyanopyrazine (2-CP) vapor at trace level. The limit of detection (LOD) concentration for 2-CP reached 1.7&#160;mg&#160;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, indicating that NOAB[3]A can serve as an excellent sensing platform for detecting 2-CP. This work not only expands the applications of functionalized belt[n]arenes but also provides an innovative insight into the detection application of the STADF strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Electrolyte Additives in a Dual&#8208;Salt System for High&#8208;Performance Four Electron Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries Across a Wide Temperature Range</title>

A multi&#8208;component electrolyte composed of Zn(ClO4)2, ZnCl2, glycerol (Gly), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) enables highly reversible four&#8208;electron aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine batteries over a wide temperature range. Gly and PVA synergistically disrupt the intrinsic H&#8208;bond network and reduce the active water content. The PVA&#8208;containing dual&#8208;salt system effectively activates and stabilizes the I0/I+ redox reaction even under low chloride concentrations.








Abstract
Four&#8208;electron aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (4eAZIBs) with the successful I&#8722;/I0/I+ redox couples have emerged as a promising alternative for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high energy density. However, the practical application of these batteries, particularly in harsh environments, is hindered by the poor reversibility of Zn plating/stripping processes and the instability of I+ species in conventional aqueous electrolytes. Here, we design a multi&#8208;component hybrid electrolyte composed of Zn(ClO4)2, ZnCl2, glycerol (Gly), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to enable highly reversible operation of 4eAZIBs across a wide temperature range. Theoretical calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and spectral analyses reveal that Gly and PVA synergistically modify the intrinsic hydrogen bond network and effectively reduce the content of active water molecules, thereby enhancing the plating/stripping behavior of Zn2+, suppressing the hydrolysis of I+, and lowering the freezing point of the electrolyte. Moreover, the PVA&#8208;containing dual&#8208;salt system reduces the Gibbs free energy of the I&#8722;/I0/I+ reaction, facilitating enhanced stability of the 4eAZIBs even under low chloride concentrations. Consequently, the Zn||I2 full cells using this system exhibit a remarkable lifespan of 15&#160;000 cycles with a capacity attenuation of 0.15% per hundred cycles, and along with excellent performance over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 40&#160;&#176;C.

ON/OFF switching of PCET. Light and redox&#8208;induced PCET ON&#8211;OFF switching was investigated in a series of ruthenium complexes. Photosubstitution triggers the conformational from a nonaqua to a PCET&#8208;active aqua complex, while oxidation induces a reverse conformational change.








Abstract
We report a reversible ON&#8211;OFF proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) switch based on ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes, triggered by both light and redox stimuli. Upon photoirradiation, a carboxylate&#8208;ligated Ru(II) complex undergoes photosubstitution to generate a metastable, PCET&#8208;active aqua complex. This metastable complex exhibits redox&#8208;induced conformational change, regenerating the original carboxylate complex. The switching behavior enables external control of PCET activity, directly modulating electrocatalytic water oxidation. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses reveal that the mechanism is governed by a pH&#8208;dependent interplay between intramolecular conformational change and bimolecular electron exchange. Importantly, the rate&#8208;determining step shifts from unimolecular conformational change near neutral pH to bimolecular electron exchange under acidic conditions. These findings establish a strategy for designing tunable molecular switches and redox&#8208;responsive functional materials.

A pseudo&#8208;rotaxane system featuring an naphthalenediimide (NDI)&#8208;based guest encapsulated in a nanosized metallorectangle shows redox&#8208;modulated stability and reversible chloride&#8208;triggered guest release. Combined NMR and computational studies reveal distinct shuttling and rocking motions, highlighting dynamic behavior essential for designing responsive supramolecular devices. 








Abstract
Gaining insight into the dynamic behavior of supramolecular systems is essential for understanding selective guest encapsulation and for the rational design of nanodevices capable of precise, controllable motion at the molecular scale. In this work, we report the construction of a pseudo&#8208;rotaxane system through the encapsulation of a naphthalenediimide (NDI) derivative bearing long aliphatic chains within the cavity of a nanosized metallorectangle. Electrochemical studies reveal that encapsulation significantly alters the redox properties of the guest. In addition, upon reduction, the NDI&#8208;based radical is stably confined within the host cavity, forming a persistent host&#8211;guest complex. This encapsulated radical species can be released upon the addition of chloride ions, demonstrating a clear example of reversible, stimuli&#8208;responsive guest uptake and release. To elucidate the internal dynamics of the system, we employed variable&#8208;temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with computational modeling. These studies revealed two distinct modes of motion: a) a shuttling motion, in which the guest slides along the axis of the host cavity between central and peripheral positions; and b) a rocking motion, involving partial rotation of the guest enabled by the flexible movement of its aliphatic chains within the host interior.

         <title>Olefin Ligand Metathesis for Colloidal Emissive Nanocrystals with Enhanced Stability and Photosensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Olefin metathesis transforms original ligands on colloidal perovskite nanocrystals into metathesized ligands featuring dual anchoring groups, shortened chains, and exposed alkenes at the outermost ligand shell. The stronger binding and reduced conformational entropy enhance colloidal stability, while the exposed alkenes improve photosensitivity, enabling high&#8208;resolution pattern formation under reduced UV exposure.








Abstract
High&#8208;resolution patterning of colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) is essential for next&#8208;generation display technologies, yet conventional approaches relying on exogenous photosensitive ligands or additives often compromise optical properties and colloidal stability. Here, we present a nondestructive ligand modification strategy based on olefin metathesis, in which original oleic acid and oleylamine ligands are converted into metathesized ligands featuring dual anchoring groups and shortened chains. This structural transformation enhances colloidal stability through stronger chelation and reduced conformational entropy of possible ligand configurations. The removal of sterically hindering hydrocarbon chains exposes reactive alkene moieties, enhancing the photosensitivity of PNCs. The resulting metathesized PNCs (PNC&#8208;M) exhibit excellent photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) retention (&gt;93% after 3 weeks) and strong resistance to structural degradation under ambient conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the strengthened surface&#8211;ligand interactions in PNC&#8208;M, consistent with the experimentally observed structural robustness. Furthermore, PNC&#8208;M enables efficient direct optical lithography at substantially reduced UV doses via alkene polymerization and hydrothiolation, clearly outperforming pristine PNCs (PNC&#8208;P). This strategy offers a general, nondestructive ligand engineering method for various emissive nanocrystals, including II&#8211;VI and III&#8211;V quantum dots, and facilitates high&#8208;resolution lithography under reduced UV exposure by leveraging the enhanced photosensitivity imparted by olefin ligand metathesis.

         <title>Electron Delocalization&#8208;Driven Dual&#8208;Electron Redox Chemistry in NiCo&#8208;LDH for High&#8208;Capacity Aqueous Ni&#8211;Zn Batteries</title>

The introduction of cobalt into the Ni(OH)2 lattice facilitates the generation of charge&#8208;transfer orbitals through delocalized electrons near the Fermi level. In addition, the ultrathin structure reduces the second&#8208;step dehydrogenation energy barriers through weakened interlayer hydrogen bonding, thereby enabling efficient dual&#8208;electron transfer. This work contributes new insights into metal&#8208;doping optimized electron storage mechanism.








Abstract
As a cathode material for alkaline Zn batteries, Ni(OH)2 shows limited capacity and efficiency due to its single&#8208;electron transfer per redox site and the side reaction of oxygen evolution during charge&#8211;discharge processes. Here, we report an electrode material featuring an ultrathin NiCo&#8208;LDH layer coated on hollow carbon shell (NC@HCS). Incorporating Co into the lattice affects the conformation and band structure of adjacent Ni sites via CoO6 octahedral distortion, leading to the formation of charge&#8208;transfer orbitals through electron delocalization near the Fermi level, which significantly reduces the oxidation potential of Ni(OH)2. The ultrathin NC@HCS architecture weakens interlayer hydrogen bonding during the dehydrogenation process (charging), lowering the dehydrogenation energy barrier. This structural feature facilitates the formation of high&#8208;valence states and enables efficient two&#8208;electron transfer. As an efficient cathode material for Zn batteries, the ultrathin NC@HCS cathode exhibits a remarkable capacity of 528&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 (0.63&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2). This strategy provides a pathway for developing high&#8208;performance and durable cathode materials for Ni&#8211;Zn batteries.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Azepines: A Cascade Strategy Featuring 1&#8208;Aza&#8208;Cope Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A breakthrough methodology has been developed for constructing chiral azepines through a relay catalysis system combining tetrapeptide bis&#8208;quaternary phosphonium salts (PBPSs) with a gold(I) catalyst. This strategy enables the first enantioselective, chiral intermediate&#8208;participated 1&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement. The key to this success lies in the rational design of a novel class of tetrapeptide&#8208;based bis&#8208;quaternary phosphonium salt (PBPS) catalysts, which exhibit significantly improved enantioselectivity and reaction efficiency compared to previous dipeptide&#8208;based phosphonium salt (PPS) systems.








Abstract
The 1&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement serves as a valuable method for constructing nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds; however, its asymmetric variants remain largely underexplored due to unfavorable thermodynamics and reaction reversibility. To overcome these challenges, we developed a relay catalysis system comprising tetrapeptide bis&#8208;quaternary phosphonium salts (PBPSs) in combination with a gold(I) catalyst. This strategy incorporates a ring&#8208;opening process during the rearrangement to preserve stereocenters and facilitate product formation. Using this approach, we synthesized a variety of chiral azepines in excellent yields (up to 96%) and with high stereoselectivities (up to 98%&#160;ee and&gt;20:1&#160;dr). Mechanistic investigations clarified the origin of chirality and offered insights into the reaction pathway. This work presents a new strategy for constructing medium&#8208;sized chiral nitrogen heterocycles and highlights the broader potential of relay catalysis integrating transition metals with bioinspired peptide&#8211;phosphonium salts (PPSs).

         <title>Maxwell Protocol for Non&#8208;Destructive Health Diagnosis of All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diagnostic protocol&#8212;based on the Maxwell relations&#8212;that combines entropymetry and volumetry is proposed for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Entropymetry mirrors the delithiation heterogeneity in cathode materials, whereas volumetry reflects the internal porosity in the electrode. This quantitative diagnostic approach allows used cells to be classified as reusable, or requiring reconditioning or recycling for a sustainable battery ecosystem.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) exhibit distinct degradation dynamics characterized by intricate interfacial cascade reactions that differ markedly from those of conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Despite being technologically promising, these systems currently lack robust health diagnostic frameworks to capture their critical failure mechanisms. Various physicochemical analyses based on cell disassembly are available and provide useful health&#8208;related information; but, because of their destructive nature, they render cells unusable for continuous health monitoring over long&#8208;term cycling. Herein, we present a nondestructive diagnostic methodology founded on the Maxwell relations. This approach enables the precise detection of the delithiation heterogeneity in cathode active materials and quantifies internal void formation by measuring changes in the open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) in response to temperature and pressure variations, respectively, without perturbing the cell operation. Our comprehensive thermodynamics analysis protocol establishes systematic criteria for classifying cells into one of three categories: reuse, recondition, or recycle. This nondestructive diagnostic methodology enables the sustainable utilization of ASSB technology based on efficient resource management.

         <title>Full P4 to P3&#8722; Reduction with a Redox&#8208;Active Metal Crown Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking the crown: Reduction of P4 generally results in larger polyphosphide Zintl anions: Pmn&#713;. However, using a hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble Mg0 complex, P4 can be fully reduced to mononuclear P3&#713;. The metal crown opens to a two&#8208;armed pincer&#8208;like ligand that efficiently stabilizes the phosphido anion. Latter P3&#713; anion reacts as a base, a three&#8208;fold nucleophile or a reducing agent. 








Abstract
Traditional bulk syntheses of phosphorus compounds start with P4 to PCl3 oxidation but more sustainable methods cleave P&#9472;P bonds reductively. This generally results in larger polyphosphide Zintl anions: Pmn&#713;. We report a relatively selective full reduction of P4 at room temperature to give a unique hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble s&#8208;block metal complex of the P3&#713; anion. Key to this chemistry is a recently reported redox&#8208;active metal crown complex: (BDI*)MgNa3N&#8243;2 (VI); N&#8243;&#160;=&#160;N(SiMe3)2 and BDI*&#160;=&#160;HC[(tBu)C&#9552;N&#8208;DIPeP]2, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;CHEt2&#8208;phenyl. The reduction of P4 according to 2 VI&#160;+&#160;0.25 P4&#160;&#8594;&#160;(BDI*)MgNa5N&#8243;3P (1)&#160;+&#160;0.5 [(BDI*)Mg]2&#160;+&#160;0.33 (NaN&#8243;)3 is calculated to be exothermic (&#916;H&#160;=&#160;&#8722;40.5&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1). The crystal structure of 1 shows a strongly bound (BDI*)MgP2&#713; anion with two chelating [Na&#8208;N&#8243;&#8208;Na+] and [Na&#8208;N&#8243;&#8208;Na&#8208;N&#8243;&#8208;Na+] arms of unequal length. Although these arms are highly fluxional and rapidly exchange ions, they effectively stabilize the P3&#713; anion. DFT calculations confirm the highly ionic nature of the complex and describe P3&#713; as full valence&#8208;shell anion with four lone&#8208;pairs of electrons. Reactivity studies show that the P3&#713; anion can react as a triple Br&#248;nsted base, a three&#8208;fold nucleophile or as a reducing agent.

The reduction of P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; according to 2 &lt;b&gt;VI&lt;/b&gt;&#160;+&#160;0.25 P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&#8594;&#160;(BDI*)MgNa&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8243;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;)&#160;+&#160;0.5 [(BDI*)Mg]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;+&#160;0.33 (NaN&#8243;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is calculated to be exothermic (&#916;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;&#8722;40.5&#160;kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The crystal structure of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; shows a strongly bound (BDI*)MgP&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#713; anion with two chelating [Na-N&#8243;-Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and [Na-N&#8243;-Na-N&#8243;-Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] arms of unequal length. Although these arms are highly fluxional and rapidly exchange ions, they effectively stabilize the P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#713; anion. DFT calculations confirm the highly ionic nature of the complex and describe P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#713; as full valence-shell anion with four lone-pairs of electrons. Reactivity studies show that the P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#713; anion can react as a triple Br&#248;nsted base, a three-fold nucleophile or as a reducing agent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Assembled from 1D Coordination Polymers for Efficient Gas Dehydration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable HOF termed as ZNU&#8208;30 is constructed from a linear CP via hydrogen bonds, C&#9472;H&#8943;&#960; and &#960;&#8943;&#960; interactions for efficient gas dehydration with considerable water uptake at low humidity, rapid water sorption kinetics, mild regeneration conditions, and outstanding cycling performance.








Abstract
Two &#8208;(2D) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous coordination polymers have been extensively explored for their porous nature and thus gas separation, but one&#8208;dimensional (1D) materials remain much less explored due to their reliance on weaker, non&#8208;covalent interactions to sustain the permanent porosity. Recent significant advances on the construction of porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) through synergistic weak interactions have provided us with the promise and motivated us to explore porous HOFs using 1D coordination polymers (CPs), and their multifunctional properties. In this work, we present such a HOF, [Cu(bpy)(H2PO4)&#8729;H2O]n (ZNU&#8208;30), constructed from a linear CP via hydrogen bonds, C&#9472;H&#8943;&#960;, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Upon thermal activation at 373&#160;K under vacuum, ZNU&#8208;30 undergoes a reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation, yielding ZNU&#8208;30a with 1D channels. Notably, ZNU&#8208;30a exhibits exceptional hydrophilicity, featuring considerable water uptake at low humidity, rapid adsorption&#8211;desorption kinetics, mild regeneration conditions, and outstanding cycling stability over 100 adsorption&#8211;desorption cycles. Single&#8208;component gas adsorption isotherms reveal unique molecular sieving behavior, with preferential adsorption of water (100&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1) over CO2 and C1&#9472;C3 alkene/alkanes (CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8) at 298&#160;K. Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis and DFT calculations indicate that the selective adsorption of H2O is facilitated by multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the framework. Breakthrough experiments further confirm the material's ability to efficiently separate trace water vapor from CH4 and other gases.

         <title>Stabilizing Highly Active Metastable Bi (101) Facet via Covalent Organic Frameworks to Break Activity&#8211;Stability Trade&#8208;off in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH Electrocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
This work breaks the activity&#8211;stability trade&#8208;off of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion by stabilizing the highly active metastable Bi (101) facet for the first time by tuning the electrochemical and thermodynamic steady states leveraging a covalent organic framework, delivering 98.7% selectivity, &gt;230&#160;h stability, and 350&#160;mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 partial current density at &#8722;1.0&#160;V in a flow cell. 








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) offers a sustainable route to convert greenhouse gases into value&#8208;added chemicals. Bismuth (Bi) has emerged as a promising electrocatalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion due to its low cost, nontoxicity, and favorable adsorption properties for the key *OCHO intermediate. However, its relatively contracted 5d and expanded 6p orbitals lead to inevitable thermodynamically driven structural reconstruction during eCO2RR, resulting in a persistent trade&#8208;off between activity and stability. Here, by tuning the balance between the electrochemical and thermodynamic steady states of layered Bi species leveraging interlayer interactions and spatial confinement provided by a two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF), we achieve the selective exposure and stable maintenance of the highly active, metastable Bi (101) facet during eCO2RR for the first time. The resulting catalyst achieves top&#8208;tier performance with 98.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.1% HCOOH selectivity, exceptional stability over 230&#160;h, and a flow cell HCOOH partial current density exceeding 350&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#160;V versus RHE, ranking it among the most efficient and stable electrocatalysts reported to date.

         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;metal alloy nanotubes with sub&#8208;1&#8208;nm wall thickness are synthesized via a simple one&#8208;pot method, which exhibits efficient mass transfer and nearly 100% surface exposure. Benefiting from high intrinsic activity enabled by the multi&#8208;metal alloying effects, the CuNiCoFeRu alloy nanotube shows excellent performance in nitrate reduction and nitrobenzene reduction.








Abstract
The multi&#8208;metal alloy (MMA) catalysts display exceptional multifunctional catalytic capabilities. However, it is still a great challenge to improve the catalytic performance by accurately synthesizing the morphology. Herein, we present a simple one&#8208;pot method for designing and synthesizing the ultrathin MMA nanotube&#8208;structured CuNiCoFeRu catalysts (CuNiCoFeRu UNT), which achieve unprecedented comprehensive performance in nitrate and nitrobenzene reduction. The MMA nanotube with sub&#8208;1&#160;nm wall thickness showed efficient mass transfer and nearly 100% surface exposure. Benefiting from high intrinsic activity enabled by the multi&#8208;metal alloying effects, the CuNiCoFeRu UNT achieved as high as 98% NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) and 6.8&#160;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1cat. yield in the nitrate reduction, and as high as 99% selectivity with a yield of 16.4&#160;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1cat. from nitrobenzene to aniline. High electron density and the synergistic effect among elements endow CuNiCoFeRu UNT with considerably enhanced nitrate and nitrobenzene reduction activity. This finding provides a highly efficient electrocatalyst for inorganic and organic nitrogen reduction. Furthermore, this synthetic strategy can be applied to other multi&#8208;metal alloy nanotubes with ultrathin walls, including binary, ternary, quaternary, quinary and senary alloy structures, demonstrating that the synthetic route is a general and universal method for multi&#8208;metal alloy nanotubes.

         <title>Mn3O4/Pt Oxide&#8208;on&#8208;Metal Inverse Catalyst Facilitates Hydrogen Spillover for CO2 Hydrogenation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional Pt/Mn3O4 catalyst suffers from sluggish hydrogen spillover due to strong Pt&#9472;H binding at interfacial Pt&#948;+&#9472;O&#9472;Mn sites. In contrast, the Mn3O4/Pt inverse catalyst enables more efficient hydrogen spillover and enhanced CO2 hydrogenation, owing to weaker H adsorption and a more favorable transition&#8208;state geometry along interfacial Pt&#9472;Mn&#9472;O pathway.








Abstract
Hydrogen spillover, the migration of metal&#8208;activated hydrogen species across support surfaces, is key for many H&#8208;related reactions. However, questions remain about how the metal/oxide interfaces affect hydrogen spillover and hydrogenation reaction. Here, we construct Mn3O4&#8208;on&#8208;Pt(111) (Mn3O4/Pt(111)) inverse catalyst and Pt clusters&#8208;on&#8208;Mn3O4 (Pt/Mn3O4) catalyst, and image hydrogen spillover behavior using high&#8208;pressure scanning tunneling microscopy. We find that the onset H2 partial pressure for hydrogen spillover is two orders of magnitude lower at Mn3O4/Pt(111) than at Pt/Mn3O4. This structural promotion effect was leveraged to synthesize MnOx/Pt/C inverse catalyst by depositing MnOx on Pt nanoparticles, which exhibits a 1.8&#8208;fold higher CO2 conversion compared to conventional Pt/MnOx/C catalyst during CO2 hydrogenation. Theoretical calculations reveal that the inverse catalysts promote hydrogen spillover via weaker H adsorption and a more favorable transition&#8208;state geometry at interfacial Pt sites, particularly along the Pt&#9472;Mn&#9472;O pathway. The Pt/Mn3O4 interfaces feature strong H binding on Pt&#948;&#8314; and high H diffusion barriers, which can be partially mitigated by CO co&#8208;adsorption. These findings demonstrate that inverse structure offers both electronic and geometric advantages at the interfaces, enabling efficient hydrogen spillover for hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Unveiling an Innovative Pathway for Enhancing Lithium&#8208;ion Conductivity of Li3PW12O40 Electrolyte via Pressure Modulation Strategy</title>

The high&#8208;pressure strategy achieves the significant enhancement of lithium&#8208;ion conductivity by 2 orders of magnitude and the disappearance of grain boundary resistance in polyoxometalate Li3PW12O40 electrolyte via an irreversible phase transition from Keggin to bronze structure.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries have raised considerable attention due to their great potential for the development of new energy storage devices with high energy density and safety. However, enhancing ion conductivity in solid&#8208;state electrolytes stands as a pivotal challenge for the large&#8208;scale commercialization of next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a high&#8208;pressure strategy is reported to achieve the significant enhancement of lithium&#8208;ion conductivity by 2 orders of magnitude and the disappearance of grain boundary resistance in polyoxometalate Li3PW12O40 electrolyte via an irreversible phase transition from Keggin to bronze structure. High&#8208;pressure in situ structure analyses revealed that the Keggin structure started to transform into the bronze structure at 18.0&#160;GPa, and completed the transition around 34.0&#160;GPa. Detailed density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the bronze structure captured under pressure had a lower migration barrier (0.051&#160;eV) and activation energy (0.091&#160;eV) than the Keggin structure, which was mainly attributed to the corner&#8208;sharing WO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra forming tunnels that can accommodate Li+ ions and provide transport channels. These results not only offer novel insights into optimizing the ion conductivity of solid&#8208;state electrolytes but also hold promise for developing new electrolyte materials under pressure.

         <title>Molecular Junction Polyoxotungstate&#8208;based Copper&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molecular junction polyoxotungstate&#8208;based copper&#8208;organic frameworks (i.e., Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;1, Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;2, and Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;3) have been successfully prepared and characterized that can be utilized in efficient photocatalytic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions of tertiary amines and terminal alkynes. The achieved reaction system enables gram&#8208;scale synthesis and operation under natural sunlight and air conditions. 








Abstract
The cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) of tertiary amines and terminal alkynes is a vital catalysis step in the manufacture of C&#9472;C bonds. The traditional thermal catalysis, utilizing noble metal salts or toxic solvents, generally results in relatively low atom economy or unmet sustainable development prospect. The challenge of the CDC reactions lies in the simultaneous activation of C&#9472;H bonds in terminal alkynes and formation of free radical activation of tertiary amines to achieve the C&#9472;C coupling, which calls for novel catalytic techniques and powerful catalysts. For the first time, in exclusively green solvent (i.e., dimethyl carbonate), full light, and air, we have developed a series of molecular junction polyoxotungstate&#8208;based copper&#8208;organic frameworks (i.e., Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;1, Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;2, and Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;3), each with unique topological dimension and well&#8208;regulated charge transfer ability that can be utilized in efficient photocatalytic CDC reactions. Notably, the optimal Cu&#8208;POMOF&#8208;3 with the combination of polyoxotungstate and Cu sites within the 3D POMOF topological structure enables the simultaneous activation and C&#9472;C coupling of tertiary amines and terminal alkynes with 98% yield. In addition, the reaction system enables scale&#8208;up production (2.06&#160;g in a batch experiment) and operation under natural sunlight and air.

A nested three&#8208;shell cluster Gd52Ni36 featuring a carbonate&#8208;templated dodecahedral Gd20 core was synthesized via a urea&#8208;mediated slow&#8208;release strategy. The mechanism of cluster formation was studied and the synthesis was optimized through a machine learning&#8211;guided high&#8208;throughput screening of 780 reaction conditions.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based polyhedral clusters are of great interest due to their unique geometries and functional properties, but their controlled synthesis remains a major challenge. Here, we report a nested three&#8208;shell cluster, [Gd52Ni36(MeIDA)36(OH)114(CO3)12 (H2O)48]&#183;(ClO4)18&#183;(H2O)21 (Gd52Ni36, H2MeIDA = N&#8208;Methyliminodiacetic acid), achieved by using urea as a slow&#8208;release carbonate source to direct the formation of a dodecahedral inner shell. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals a unique Gd20@Gd32@Ni36 arrangement, with the innermost Gd20 forming a Platonic dodecahedron templated by carbonate. A machine learning&#8211;guided, high&#8208;throughput synthesis platform enabled the exploration of 780 reaction conditions, uncovering key parameters and phase boundaries governing cluster formation. This work demonstrates data&#8208;driven strategies can accelerate the discovery of complex lanthanide architectures.

         <title>Regioisomerization&#8208;Directed MR&#8208;TADF Emitters: Enhanced RISC and Suppressed Aggregation Toward High&#8208;Performance Narrowband Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An isomerization&#8208;directed twisted conformation boosts reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), enabling a fast RISC rate of 7.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8309;&#160;s&#8722;1, narrowband blue emission, and strong resistance to aggregation. The resulting devices deliver an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 32.7% with suppressed roll&#8208;off at high luminance. 








Abstract
The organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) performance of multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters is fundamentally constrained by their slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and pronounced aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ). Herein, through regioselective borylation, we design and synthesize a series of blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters. The regioisomerization&#8208;directed twist configuration synergistically enhances RISC while suppressing ACQ, without compromising spectral purity. The emitter with twist configuration exhibits a remarkably fast RISC rate constant (kRISC) of 7.1&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1, narrowband blue emission with a small full&#8208;width at half maxima (FWHM) of 23&#160;nm, and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 94%. The corresponding OLEDs deliver high&#8208;performance narrowband blue emission, with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 32.4%, and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off at high luminance (EQE1000&#160;=&#160;22.2%). Notably, excellent performance is retained even at elevated doping levels (EQEmax&#160;=&#160;29.4% at 20&#160;wt%). This work provides a design paradigm for advancing blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters toward practical display technologies.

         <title>Heteroporous Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Framework Cathode for High&#8208;Rate&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 42, October 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on heteroporous D&#8208;A engineering was proposed towards a COF (HDA&#8208;COF) with optimized &#963;e and &#963;ions through Schiff&#8208;base reaction. This heteroporous D&#8208;A engineering endows HDA&#8208;COF with mass transport enhancement and D&#8208;A electron transport promotion to obtain higher active sites availability. Thereby, it can be regarded as advanced COF&#8208;based cathodes with high &#963;ions and &#963;e to achieve high&#8208;rate performance.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a conspicuous porous material, harvest great promise for rechargeable batteries, owing to well&#8208;defined pore structure and structural precision. However, designing high&#8208;rate&#8208;capacity COF cathode by balancing ions diffusion kinetics and electron transport kinetics based on the framework and pore chemistry remains a challenge. Here, a heteroporous donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) engineering is proposed to design one novel kind of COF (HDA&#8208;COF) with optimized electronic conductivity (&#963;e) and ionic conductivity (&#963;ions). The heteroporous D&#8208;A framework featuring with triangle&#8208;like micropores for promoted electron transport and enlarged hexagonal&#8208;like mesopores for facilitated ions diffusion rate. HDA&#8208;COF demonstrates high compatibility with high &#963;e and &#963;ions verified by the combination of experimental results and theoretical calculations. Notably, HDA&#8208;COF displays favorable fast&#8208;charging performance with 104 mAh g&#8722;1 (277&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, 5 A g&#8722;1) and shorter charge time (75&#160;s), maintaining steadily cycling for 1000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Also, it delivers high discharge capacity of 259&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (627&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, 0.05&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1). This work offers in&#8208;depth insights in constructing high&#8208;rate&#8208;capacity COF cathode by synchronously optimizing &#963;e and &#963;ions within a heteroporous D&#8208;A engineering.

         <title>Strong and Tough Poly(2&#8208;Isopropenyl&#8208;2&#8208;Oxazoline) Hydrogels with Terpyridine as Dual Orthogonal Covalent and Non&#8208;Covalent Crosslinker</title>

Strong and tough single network hydrogels are reported using a dual orthogonal 2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8217;&#8208;terpyridine crosslinker, which both acts as a covalent crosslinker and as a dynamic crosslinker upon metal complexation with zinc(II) ions.








Abstract
Developing simple and efficient methods to mechanically reinforce single&#8208;network hydrogels for practical applications remains an important challenge. This study presents a strategy for preparing poly(2&#8208;isopropenyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PiPOx) hydrogels using a dicarboxylic acid functionalized terpyridine (TPy) dual orthogonal crosslinker that acts as both a permanent covalent crosslinker and a dynamic non&#8208;covalent crosslinker upon metal complexation. In this dual orthogonal crosslinking approach, PiPOx is first crosslinked with the dicarboxylic acid functionalized TPy in DMSO to form a stable covalent network, followed by solvent exchange to water, drying and&#160;the introduction of reversible coordination bonds through swelling in an aqueous zinc(II) ion solution. This orthogonal dual crosslinking strategy results in high compressive strength (26.6&#160;MPa) and tough (5.28&#160;MJ&#183;m&#8722;3) single&#8208;network hydrogels. This is attributed to the fact that the hydrogel combines thermodynamically stable primary permanent crosslinks and dynamic secondary reversible crosslinks in the same dual crosslinker, leading to polymer network contraction, thereby providing a novel and simple approach for the preparation of strong and tough dual orthogonal crosslinked single network hydrogels.

         <dc:description>
Isolable arylphosphinidene chalcogenides (Ar&#9472;P&#9552;E; E = S, Se, Te) were synthesized and fully characterized, which exhibit P&#9552;E double bonds and rich reactivity at the P&#9552;E units, including [4+2] cycloaddition, oxidation, and X&#9472;H (X = O, N) bond activation. Their one&#8208;electron reduction furnishes persistent radical anions, representing unprecedented isolable pnictinidene chalcogenide&#8208;based radicals.








Abstract
We report the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of isolable arylphosphinidene chalcogenides (Ar&#9472;P&#9552;E; 2 (E = S), 3 (E = Se), 4 (E = Te)), prepared via chalcogen atom transfer from tris(dimethylamino)phosphine chalcogenides (Me2N)3P&#9552;E (E = S, Se, Te) to a phosphanorcaradiene. The compounds crystallize at ambient temperature and feature P&#9552;E double bonds, as confirmed by structural and computational studies. Compounds 2&#8211;4 undergo [4+2] cycloaddition with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene to furnish six&#8208;membered heterocyclic products, demonstrating their &#960;&#8208;bond reactivity. Compound 3 reacts with mesityl azide to afford a P(V) compound. Additionally, 2 and 3 are capable of oxidative cleavage of O&#9472;H and N&#9472;H bonds in H2O and NH3, respectively. Furthermore, 2&#8211;4 can be one&#8208;electron reduced to their corresponding radical anion salts, which are unprecedented radical anions of pnictinidene chalcogenides isolable in the condensed phase.

Compounds &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; undergo [4+2] cycloaddition with 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene to furnish six-membered heterocyclic products, demonstrating their &#960;-bond reactivity.

Furthermore, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; can be one-electron reduced to their corresponding radical anion salts, which are unprecedented radical anions of pnictinidene chalcogenides isolable in the condensed phase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Electron Transfer in Inorganic&#8211;Organic Interfacial Electric Field Enabling Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noncovalent interface is established between a negatively charged CdS light&#8208;harvesting center and a Co(II)&#8208;bpy catalyst through surface functional groups. This interface promotes strong electronic interactions and efficient electron transfer, directing electrons towards the Co(II)&#8208;bpy high&#8208;energy orbitals. As a result, there is a significant improvement in CO2 reduction activity, achieved by effectively suppressing the H2 evolution reaction.








Abstract
The efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction has long been limited by the competing H2 evolution reaction. In this study, we present an innovative strategy for boosting high&#8208;throughput electron transfer to suppress H2 evolution, thereby enhancing CO2 reduction. By employing CdS and cobalt bipyridine as a model, we engineered the surface of CdS to create an electric field at the inorganic&#8211;organic interface. Through in situ and transient spectroscopy techniques, we discovered that CdS functionalized with &#9472;COOH groups demonstrates remarkable noncovalent interactions and improved charge transfer capabilities compared to those functionalized with &#9472;NH2 groups. The fast delivery of electrons on cobalt bipyridine facilitates the adsorbed CO2 to participate in the proton&#8208;electron coupling reaction, rather than allowing adsorbed protons to accept electrons directly. Consequently, the established CdS&#8208;COOH/Co(II)&#8208;bpy system achieved a CO production rate of 2.523&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 96.3%. This research presents an approach for creating efficient charge transport interfaces and provides a comprehensive strategy for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalytic CO2 reduction systems that effectively counteract the challenges posed by competing H2 evolution reactions.

         <title>Contemporary Strategies in SmI2 Catalysis: A Reagent Reborn</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rich chemistry of the single electron transfer reagent SmI2 has been widely exploited in synthesis. Recent years have seen significant progress in SmI2&#8208;catalysis, with provision of a suite of systems that may evolve to provide the efficiency, practicality, and generality needed for widespread adoption. This minireview provides a critical evaluation of strategies for SmII&#8208;catalysis and maps out a course that will complete the reinvention of SmI2 as a tool for sustainable catalysis.








Abstract
The strategies adopted in the development of SmII&#8208;catalyzed processes are critically evaluated. In particular, we examine promising approaches using stoichiometric sacrificial reductants, electrochemical methods, photochemical processes, and electron recycling through back electron transfer to Sm. While each strategy has considerable potential for facilitating catalytic SmII transformations, they also face specific challenges relating to efficiency, selectivity, scalability, and generality. We highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach, discuss recent advances, and identify challenges that remain. By offering an in&#8208;depth analysis of the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in SmII catalysis, we aim to guide future research to complete the reinvention of SmI2 as a tool for sustainable catalysis.

         <title>Elucidating the Critical Role of Water in Selective Hydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles on a Cobalt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model catalyst consisting of carbon&#8208;coated cobalt nanoparticles with rich functional groups exhibits universal and efficient water&#8208;promoted N&#8208;heterocycle hydrogenation performance at 100 &#176;C and 0.5&#160;MPa H2. Mechanistic studies have shown that water is crucial in providing protons directly and enhancing H2 diffusion, thereby facilitating a favorable water&#8208;mediated hydrogenation pathway on the Co catalyst.








Abstract
The ambiguous role of water as a solvent in regulating liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation activity and selectivity is of great significance to modern organic synthesis, yet remains challenging to identify. Here, we present a carbon&#8208;coated cobalt nanoparticle catalyst with a high number of functional groups, synthesized using a simple approach. This catalyst exhibits exceptional water&#8208;promoted N&#8208;heterocycle hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Remarkably, 100% quinoline conversion and &gt;99% 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline selectivity can be achieved at 100 &#176;C and 0.5&#160;MPa H2, surpassing the performance of most reported heterogeneous catalysts. Using a combination of advanced mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and theoretical analysis, we elucidate the water&#8208;promoted hydrogenation mechanism. Water is a crucial solvent because it provides protons directly and enhances H2 diffusion, thereby facilitating a favorable water&#8208;mediated 1&#8211;4&#8211;2&#8211;3 hydrogenation pathway on the surface of this catalyst. Based on this finding, the catalyst exhibits universal water&#8208;promoted hydrogenation performance for a wide range of N&#8208;heterocycles (14 examples with yields of over 96%). This work highlights the crucial role of water in liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation reactions and provides a new research paradigm for the future development of such reactions.

         <title>Achiral Catalyst&#8208;Induced Stereoselectivity Switch at Quaternary Stereocenter: Diastereodivergent Ring&#8208;Opening Alkylation and Enantiodivergent Arylation of Oxindoles</title>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;one stone, a butterfly's wings, two birds&#8221; for the stereodivergence strategy. By simply changing the achiral Lewis acid from d&#8208;block metal salt ZnCl2 to lanthanide f&#8208;block metal salt DyCl3 without changing the chiral catalyst, an achiral metal cation&#8208;arene noncovalent interaction directed stereodivergence synthesis in both diastereodivergent asymmetric ring&#8208;opening alkylation and enantiodivergent arylation of oxindoles was developed in this study.








Abstract
The development of a unified strategy to achieve both diastereodivergence and enantiodivergence is a prominent yet challenging objective. In this study, a new strategy involving achiral Lewis acid &#8208;directed stereodivergence has been developed. An achiral metal salt is used as a control element to achieve a diastereoselectivity switch, which is unusual. By simply changing the achiral Lewis acids from a non&#8208;lanthanide d&#8208;block metal salt (ZnCl2) to a lanthanide f&#8208;block metal salt (DyCl3), a diastereodivergent asymmetric ring&#8208;opening alkylation of racemic oxindoles with oxabicyclic alkenes has been achieved, leading to a new series of chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles with three contiguous stereocenters bearing a dihydronaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;ol motif with excellent enantioselectivities (up to&#160;&gt;&#160;99% ee) and diastereoselectivities (up to&#160;&gt;&#160;95:5 dr). Next, by simply switching the achiral metal Lewis acid cocatalysts while maintaining the same chiral catalyst, an enantiodivergent formal arylation has been achieved, providing chiral 3,3&#8208;diaryl oxindoles featuring a triaryl&#8208;substituted quaternary stereocenter. Diverse transformations of the chiral 3,3&#8208;oxindoles delivered synthetically useful compounds. Those chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles have shown significant antiproliferative activity against HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. The relative and absolute configurations of these compounds exert prominent effects on the bioactivities, further highlighting the remarkable importance of catalytic asymmetric stereodivergent synthesis.

Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) are a promising frontier for sustainable long&#8208;duration energy storage. This review highlights&#160;recent advances in redox&#8208;active molecule design, structure&#8208;property relationships, and degradation mechanisms, alongside pairing strategies and full&#8208;cell engineering. We outline rational design principles, which may contribute to advancing high&#8208;performance, stable AORFBs.








Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs), utilizing redox&#8208;active organic materials as energy storage materials, represent a promising frontier for sustainable long&#8208;duration energy storage. This review highlights&#160;recent advances in redox&#8208;active molecule design, analyzing how molecular structures govern electrochemical behavior and degradation pathways critical to stability. We categorize systems by positive and negative electrolyte pairings, examining performance and lifetime challenges across configurations. We explore molecular engineering approaches and full&#8208;cell assembly principles to extend battery lifetime. By introducing representative studies within each category of redox couples, we outline state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments and establish rational design and pairing principles. This framework proposes guidelines for selecting compatible electrolyte pairs based on molecular properties of organic redox&#8208;active species, which may contribute to advancing stable materials and higher&#8208;performance AORFBs.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Responsive Biomimetic Nanoplatelets for Thrombus&#8208;Mediated Photothermal Immunotherapy of Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Marginal tumor resistance in photothermal therapy is often overlooked due to unclear tumor boundaries, which can be fatal in aggressive tumor therapy. Here, we report reactive oxygen species&#8208;responsive, self&#8208;recruiting nanoplatelets that effectively ablate internal tumors and starve marginal tumors via vascular occlusion under photoirradiation. This approach could assist in the treatment of postoperative recurrence, achieving an 80% inhibition rate in a patient&#8208;derived xenograft tumor model.








Abstract
One of the biggest advantages of photothermal therapy (PTT) as a compelling cancer treatment is its spatiotemporal nature. However, there are still significant challenges in completely eradicating tumors through PTT due to the unclear boundary between tumor and normal tissues. Here, we present a tumor vascular disruption strategy that leverages photothermally induced hemorrhage to enhance therapeutic efficacy through thrombosis&#8208;driven intensive PTT and peripheral tumor vascular embolization. A biomimetic nanoplatelet (PPIE@P), reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanogel scaffold loading with indocyanine green (ICG) and the coagulant etamsylate with platelet membrane camouflage, is developed. Upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, ICG&#8208;generated ROS trigger precise disintegration of PPIE@P, releasing the coagulant while producing hyperthermia that induces vascular injury and hemorrhage. This process activates the coagulation cascade and recruits additional nanoplatelets to the hemorrhagic tumor site. Subsequently, the penetrating ICG and coagulant&#8208;accelerated blood clots enable intense hyperthermia during a second photoirradiation, whereas embolization of peripheral tumor&#8208;associated vessels contributes to complete tumor eradication. Notably, this antiangiogenic PTT strategy also elicits a potent systematic immune response by promoting dendritic cell maturation and effector T&#8208;cell infiltration. Overall, this work introduces a thrombus&#8208;augmented PTT paradigm with strong potential for future clinical translation.

         <title>Donor&#8722;&#960;&#8722;Acceptor Conjugated Polymeric Photocatalyst for Efficient Deep Oxidation of NO Facilitated by Strong Asymmetric Local Electric Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymeric catalyst by covalently incorporating ultrathin carbon nitride nanosheets with &#960;&#8211;pyrene&#8211;&#960; molecules displayed strong asymmetric local electric field, which enables facilitated exciton dissociation, accelerated charge transfer kinetics, and offers dual adsorption sites for capture O2 and NO for highly selective and deep photocatalytic oxidization of NO at ppb levels to NO3&#8722;.








Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of low&#8208;concentration NOx into NO3&#8722; is limited by strong exciton effects, rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, and lack of localized bonding sites of oxygen species in catalysts. Directed enrichment of charge carriers and reactants (O2 and NO) at active sites is essential for achieving high&#8208;performance photocatalytic NO removal. Herein, a donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) conjugated polymeric catalyst was engineered by covalently incorporating ultrathin carbon nitride nanosheets with electron&#8208;donating &#960;&#8211;pyrene&#8211;&#960; molecules, which achieves an exceptional 82.2% NO elimination and 94.9% selectivity toward ionic products (NO3&#8722; sel. of 75.9%) with stable operation over 1000 mins, outperforming the previously reported carbon nitride photocatalysts. Rapidly reduces NO levels below safe concentration in a simulated environment chamber was also achieved. The generated asymmetric local electric field in D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A conjugated polymeric catalyst through intramolecular charge transfer between electron&#8208;accepting heptazine rings and electron&#8208;donating pyrene units facilitates exciton dissociation, accelerating charge transfer kinetics, and offer dual adsorption sites for capture O2 and NO, thus favoring the O2 activation for highly selective oxidization of NO to NO3&#8722;. This work highlights the pivotal role of asymmetric local electric fields in D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A architectures for advancing efficient photocatalytic NO oxidation.

         <dc:description>
A series of deep&#8208;ultraviolet transparent mixed&#8208;d0&#8208;metal oxyfluorides were designed and synthesized for high&#8208;performing optical nonlinearilities, as reported by Chao Wu, Chi Zhang et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202513438). By empolying a synergistic dual&#8208;site strategy, key three&#8208;parameters including second&#8208;harmonic generation, bandgap, and birefringence were synchronously optimized in the oxyfluorides. The work discloses the key role of distinct d0&#8208;metal polyhedra in optical activities.

The cover image depicts a sacrificial unit embedded in molecular junctions, demonstrating enhanced mechanoresistive behavior. In their Research Article (e202514424), Hongliang Chen, Feihe Huang et&#160;al. employ a pillar[6]arene&#8208;like cyclophane as an energy&#8208;dissipative motif to create programmable multistate mechanoswitches. Conformational transitions are regulated via intramolecular dispersion forces, enabling stable multi&#8208;level electrical signals during junction compression/stretching, thereby enabling multistate molecular&#8208;scale mechanical switching.

Lanmodulin&#8208;inspired Lanthanide&#8208;binding peptides synthesised in reversed order have a higher affinity to lanthanides than the natural sequence, as reported by Lena Daumann et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202510453). As highlighted in this cover art the band of the cassette which gets rewound by the pencil symbolises the reversed peptides binding a trivalent europium. The original protein is shown as sketch in the back. That the higher affinity was a serendipitous finding is accentuated with the song title printed on the cassette.

         <title>Enantioselective Miyaura Reaction by Desymmetrizing C(sp2)&#8211;B Cross&#8208;Coupling of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;Biaryl&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl Bis(nonaflates)</title>

         <dc:description>
A desymmetrization strategy for an enantioselective Miyaura&#8208;type C(sp2)&#8211;B cross&#8208;coupling to access highly enantioenriched, axially chiral biaryl boronic esters is disclosed. The enantiomeric excess of the chiral monoborylated product after reductive elimination is further improved by a downstream kinetic resolution, thereby converting the minor enantiomer into the corresponding achiral bisborylated biaryl byproduct.








Abstract
An efficient protocol for a desymmetrizing C(sp2)&#8211;B cross&#8208;coupling of achiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryl&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl bis(nonaflates) and B&#8211;B reagents is disclosed. An in situ&#8208;formed palladium(0)&#8211;(S,S)&#8208;f&#8208;Binaphane complex discriminates between the enantiotopic nonaflate groups, and the subsequent transmetalation of the B&#8211;B reagent is enhanced by a copper co&#8208;catalyst. The enantiomeric excess of the chiral monoborylated product after reductive elimination is further improved by a downstream kinetic resolution, thereby converting the minor enantiomer into the corresponding achiral bisborylated biaryl byproduct. This enantioselective Miyaura reaction enables the synthesis of highly valuable, axially chiral boron compounds with superb enantiomeric ratios (up to e.r.&#160;= 99:1) and exhibits broad substrate scope and good functional&#8208;group tolerance.

         <dc:description>
In their Research Article (e202515805), Ye Wang et&#160;al. reporte the controllable synthesis of ultrafine palladium phosphides (PdxPy, &lt; 2 nm) via a defect&#8208;assisted anchoring strategy, using defective TiO2&#8208;supported Pd as the phosphidation precursor. This strategy enhances the atom utilization of Pd and modulates its geometric structure. The sub&#8208;2 nm PdxPy exhibits an exceptional selectivity of 97.5% and a TOF of 833.8 h&#8722;1 for selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.

         <title>C&#9472;H Amination of Polypropylene with Sodium N&#8208;Chloro&#8208;Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy to introduce diverse N&#8208;containing groups onto polypropylene materials under mild conditions via C&#9472;H functionalization has been developed. A series of aminated polypropylenes retaining crystallinity and molecular weight could be obtained while exhibiting new properties not present in virgin PP, such as improved compatibility in mixed plastic blends, enhanced adhesion to metals, and fluorescence properties.








Abstract
Polypropylene (PP) is one of the most produced polymers. To meet the requirements of many modern technologies, it is very urgent to introduce diverse functional groups onto PP. Selective C&#9472;N bonds forming via C&#9472;H functionalization have been considered as a universal platform; however, it remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a mild, catalyst&#8208;free, and light&#8208;free C&#9472;H amination of both commodity and postconsumer PP using sodium N&#8208;chloro&#8208;amides as nitrogen sources. This method allows the efficient preparation of a variety of aminated PP materials (up to 2.4 mol% LOF) via direct functionalizations and subsequent functional group transformations. These aminated materials retain crystallinity and molecular weight while exhibiting new properties not present in virgin PP, such as improved compatibility in mixed plastic blends, enhanced adhesion to metals, and fluorescence properties. This work also provides a sustainable strategy to expand the use of PP waste.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview explores the potential of micro&#8208;/nanorobots in treating neurological diseases, focusing on blood&#8208;brain barrier penetration, stem cell regulation, and energy metabolism modulation. These advancements shift treatment toward more precise, targeted therapies, with intelligent technologies offering promising prospects for revolutionizing care.








Abstract
Neurological diseases (NDs) are associated with barrier transport dysfunction, abnormal protein aggregation, and impaired cellular energy metabolism, with bioenergetic deficits increasingly recognized as a central factor in disease progression. Micro&#8208;/nanorobots offer a promising strategy to address these challenges by enabling active and targeted regulation of neuronal metabolism. Unlike passive nanocarriers, micro&#8208;/nanorobots can cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) under external guidance and deliver therapeutic agents with subcellular precision. By integrating mitochondrial&#8208;targeting components, ATP&#8208;generating modules, and redox&#8208; or ion&#8208;responsive release systems, they can restore cellular energy supply and attenuate oxidative stress, thereby improving metabolic function, synaptic activity, and neural repair. This minireview summarizes recent advances in micro&#8208;/nanorobot applications for drug delivery, barrier penetration, stem&#8208;cell differentiation, and metabolic regulation. It explores their potential roles in improving neuronal function, limiting pathological protein aggregation, and facilitating neural network reconstruction. Also, clinical translation faces significant challenges, including safety evaluation, large&#8208;scale manufacturing, and regulatory compliance. A therapeutic framework centered on micro&#8208;/nanorobot&#8208;mediated metabolic regulation may provide a novel and effective approach for treating NDs.

         <title>Breaking of the Up&#8208;Down Symmetry of DNA Origami on a Solid Substrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the surface orientation of chiral double&#8208;L (CDL) DNA origami on mica was controlled by tuning magnesium ion (Mg2&#8314;) concentration. This simple yet powerful method, exploiting global shape distortions, achieved 100% S orientation enabling precise nanostructure deposition.








Abstract
Controlling the surface orientation of DNA origami nanostructures (DON) is crucial for applications in nanotechnology and materials science. While previous work utilized various DON modifications, simple methods for controlling their landing orientation remain scarce. Here, we demonstrate a straightforward approach to control the adsorption orientation of chiral double&#8208;L (CDL) DON on mica by tuning magnesium ion (Mg2&#8314;) concentration and exploiting global shape distortions. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we analyzed the resulting distribution of the mirror&#8208;image orientations, referred to as S and Z orientations, at both buffer/mica and air/mica interfaces and identified conditions resulting in homogenous CDL orientation of 100% S. These results demonstrate how DON conformation and ionic environments influence DON orientation, offering insights for precise nanostructure deposition.

         <title>High&#8208;Selectivity Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Glycerol to C3&#8208;Glyceraldehyde Coupled to H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a PtSb single&#8208;atom alloy loaded on oxygen&#8208;deficient TiO2 catalyst, which achieved 87% selectivity for C3&#8208;glyceraldehyde, offering a novel strategy for the glycerol oxidation to produce a single high&#8208;value chemical product.








Abstract
Achieving high selectivity of glyceraldehyde (GLD) products remained challenging due to competing C&#9472;C bond cleavage and multiple reaction pathways during glycerol electrooxidation. Herein, we designed a PtSb single&#8208;atom alloy supported on non&#8208;stoichiometric TiO2 (PtSb1/TiOx), which enabled highly efficient and stable GLD production under neutral conditions. The catalyst achieved 87% GLD selectivity with exceptional stability exceeding 120&#160;h. TiOx support suppressed C&#9472;C bond cleavage, preserving C3 intermediates, while atomic Sb dispersed in the Pt matrix enhanced GLD selectivity. This further stabilized active sites through Pt&#9472;Sb bond formation, which mitigated oxidative deactivation. We integrated PtSb1/TiOx with a Pt&#8208;loaded ZnFeWMn medium&#8208;entropy oxide for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction, enabling simultaneous production of C3 and H2O2 products. In a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly system under neutral conditions, this achieved yields of 0.332&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 for GLD and 0.50&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 for H2O2. In alkaline media, by controlling H2O2 transport, the system attained 72.9% glycerate selectivity without external bias, representing one of the most efficient bias&#8208;free glycerol valorization systems reported. This work pioneered a dual&#8208;strategy approach for catalyst engineering to control reaction pathways and system integration for simultaneous high&#8208;value chemical production.

         <title>Hypercrosslinked Polymers for Volatile and Very Volatile Organic Compound Capture Beyond Commercial Benchmarks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adsorption of volatile and very volatile organic compounds ((V)VOCs) is investigated using hypercrosslinked polymers with varied chemical functionalities. Mixed&#8208;analyte breakthrough experiments reveal how polymer chemistry governs sorption under dry and humid conditions. Amine&#8208;functionalised networks outperform commercial benchmarks, offering broad analyte retention, regenerability, and lower cost, establishing hypercrosslinked polymers as tuneable sorbents for (V)VOC capture.








Abstract
The effective capture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and very volatile organic compounds (VVOCs) is crucial for controlling indoor air quality, environmental monitoring, and emission regulation. However, effective VVOC adsorption remains challenging due to their low boiling points, high vapour pressures, and the susceptibility of many adsorbents to competitive water sorption. Here, we report a systematic study on the role of chemical functionality in hypercrosslinked polymers for (V)VOC capture under realistic operational conditions. A series of fluorene&#8208;based hypercrosslinked polymers bearing heteroatom substituents (C, N, O, S, and SO2) was synthesised and characterised, exhibiting high thermal stability, surface areas up to 1600&#160;m2&#183;g&#8722;1, and micro&#8208;/mesoporous architectures. The adsorption performance of these networks is evaluated using thermodesorption&#8208; and headspace&#8208;gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry. Under both dry and humid atmospheres, the hypercrosslinked polymers outperform a commercial benchmark sorbent in the uptake of a ten&#8208;component (V)VOC mixture, with the amine&#8208;functionalised network achieving the broadest analyte retention range even in the presence of water vapour. Our findings elucidate how polymer chemistry governs sorption behaviour and establish hypercrosslinked polymers as high&#8208;performance, tuneable alternatives to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial sorbents for capturing volatile analytes.

         <dc:description>
Azobenzene&#8208;appended semiaza&#8208;bambusuril macrocycles act as light&#8208;gated anion channels. UVA and visible light toggle E/Z isomers, enabling reversible ON/OFF chloride transport in liposomes and cells. This photo&#8208;switchable system offers a new design strategy for stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular therapeutics.








Abstract
The ability to control ion transport across membranes in living systems by stimulus&#8208;responsive natural channels, such as channelrhodopsins and their mimics, is a revolutionary tool for understanding biological processes. Herein, we demonstrate a new class of azo&#8208;functionalized bambusurils (azo&#8208;BUs) that act as efficient, photo&#8208;switchable anion channels capable of modulating chloride flux across lipid membranes and within cellular environments. The (E)&#8208;isomer exhibits pronounced chloride transport activity, which can be reversibly toggled via light&#8208;induced isomerization, enabling precise spatiotemporal control. Mechanistic studies reveal that the (E)&#8208;form induces apoptosis through mitochondrial membrane depolarization, reactive oxygen spieces (ROS) generation, and cytochrome c release, while also disrupting lysosomal acidification via H&#8314;/Cl&#8722; cotransport. This dual perturbation of cytosolic and lysosomal ion homeostasis underscores the compound's multifaceted cytotoxic mechanism. In contrast, the (Z)&#8208;isomer displayed minimal transport activity and negligible cytotoxicity, reinforcing its role as the inactive, photo&#8208;switchable OFF state in this system. The ability to control transport activity with light positions azo&#8208;BUs as promising candidates for the development of next&#8208;generation, stimuli&#8208;responsive anticancer agents. This work introduces a reversible photo&#8208;gated anion channel with therapeutic potential, offering a powerful platform for studying membrane transport and designing light&#8208;responsive biomedical tools.

         <title>The Effect of Cap Structure and Poly(A) Positioning on mRNA Translation Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We examined how protein synthesis is affected when the positions of two major structural elements of eukaryotic mRNA&#8212;the 5&#8242; cap and the 3&#8242; poly(A) tail&#8212;are reversed. Reversing their orientation resulted in a marked reduction in protein production. This decrease is likely due to the essential role of cap positioning at the 5&#8242; end for efficient translation initiation, coupled with an inhibitory influence of the poly(A) positioned at the 5&#8242; end.








Abstract
We investigated the relationship between mRNA structure and translation activity using our recently developed chemical method to add a cap structure to an oligonucleotide and a technique for purifying capped mRNAs via reversed&#8208;phase high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) employing a photoreactive tag. Specifically, we designed and synthesized mRNA constructs in which the typical eukaryotic elements&#8212;the 5&#8242; cap and the 3&#8242; poly(A) tail&#8212;were interchanged in position. We examined how this inversion affected translation efficiency. The results revealed that this reversed configuration abolished the synergistic enhancement of translation typically observed with correctly positioned cap and poly(A) tail, resulting in a substantial decrease in activity compared to the native orientation. Interestingly, focusing solely on the cap structure, capping at the 3&#8242; end&#8212;though less effective than at the 5&#8242; end&#8212;still promoted a measurable increase in translation. Moreover, the poly(A) sequence placed at the 5&#8242; end was found to suppress translation. We also prepared mRNAs containing a poly(A) tail with reversed 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; orientation and demonstrated that this inverted poly(A) could still enhance protein synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;We investigated the relationship between mRNA structure and translation activity using our recently developed chemical method to add a cap structure to an oligonucleotide and a technique for purifying capped mRNAs via reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) employing a photoreactive tag. Specifically, we designed and synthesized mRNA constructs in which the typical eukaryotic elements&#8212;the 5&#8242; cap and the 3&#8242; poly(A) tail&#8212;were interchanged in position. We examined how this inversion affected translation efficiency. The results revealed that this reversed configuration abolished the synergistic enhancement of translation typically observed with correctly positioned cap and poly(A) tail, resulting in a substantial decrease in activity compared to the native orientation. Interestingly, focusing solely on the cap structure, capping at the 3&#8242; end&#8212;though less effective than at the 5&#8242; end&#8212;still promoted a measurable increase in translation. Moreover, the poly(A) sequence placed at the 5&#8242; end was found to suppress translation. We also prepared mRNAs containing a poly(A) tail with reversed 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; orientation and demonstrated that this inverted poly(A) could still enhance protein synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Directional Electron Transfer in Porphyrin&#8208;Based Heteroleptic Metallacages for Enhanced Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the design of porphyrin&#8208;based heteroleptic metallacages that mediate directional photoinduced electron transfer for efficient confined photocatalysis. One of the metallacages, constructed via multicomponent self&#8208;assembly, incorporate electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine ligands that enhance charge separation and superoxide generation, leading to improved photocatalytic activity in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven oxidative coupling of tetraorganoborates.








Abstract
The rational design of supramolecular architectures capable of mediating directional photoinduced electron transfer (PET) remains a central challenge in confined photocatalysis. Herein, we report two porphyrin&#8208;based heteroleptic metallacages, constructed via multicomponent coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, for the visible light&#8208;driven oxidative coupling of tetraorganoborates. Both metallacages feature well&#8208;defined, positively charged cavities that enable selective substrate encapsulation and efficient catalytic turnover. In particular, one metallacage incorporates electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine units that engage in directional interligand PET with the porphyrin moieties, as supported by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This intramolecular PET promotes long&#8208;lived charge separation and enhances superoxide anion generation, resulting in markedly improved photocatalytic activity compared to control systems lacking donor&#8211;acceptor motifs. This study demonstrates a modular strategy for integrating electron donor and acceptor functionalities within a single supramolecular scaffold and highlights the potential of PET&#8208;enhanced cage&#8208;based photocatalysis, providing a versatile platform for sustainable light&#8208;driven chemical transformations.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Twisted Intramolecular Charge Transfer (TICT) Dyes into Bright Fluorophores with Large Stokes Shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile supramolecular strategy to transform environment&#8208;sensitive twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) dyes into bright fluorophores with retained large Stokes shifts in aqueous media is reported. By embedding TICT dyes within a rigid microdomain provided by a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, nonradiative decay pathways, particularly the TICT process, are effectively suppressed, leading to enhanced radiative emission.








Abstract
Twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) dyes are promising candidates for bioimaging and sensing due to their environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescence and large Stokes shifts. However, their inherently low fluorescence quantum yields in aqueous media have limited their practical applications. Here, we present a general supramolecular strategy to transform a broad range of TICT dyes into bright fluorophores with large Stokes shifts. By noncovalently dispersing the dyes into the rigid microdomain of a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold in water, the formation of the non&#8208;radiative TICT state is effectively suppressed. The resulting supramolecular TICT dyes exhibit dramatically enhanced fluorescence quantum yields (up to 42.3%), while preserving large Stokes shifts of up to 107&#160;nm. Particularly, supramolecular TICT dyes emitting in the NIR region display excellent photostability, enabling applications in long&#8208;term bioimaging and single&#8208;excitation multi&#8208;color imaging in live cells. This work offers a versatile and modular supramolecular approach to generate high&#8208;performance fluorophores from otherwise low&#8208; or non&#8208;emissive TICT dyes, greatly broadening their potential in biological and optical applications.

         <title>A Crystalline Bismuth(II) Radical Anion: Synthesis, Characterization, and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A T&#8208;shaped Bi(III) trisamide featuring a sterically demanding NNN pincer ligand was prepared. The planarization of the Bi center furnishes a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital with distinct Bi(6p) orbital character which unlocks clean one&#8208;electron reduction to afford a crystalline Bi(II) radical anion. Comprehensive spectroscopic analysis reveals the localization of the unpaired electron at the bismuth center further confirmed by reactivity studies.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of a planarized tris&#8208;amidobismuthane supported by a rigid, bulky NNN pincer ligand, which enforces a T&#8208;shaped geometry at the bismuth center. The Bi(NNN) complex features a low&#8208;lying LUMO with distinct Bi(6p) orbital character as shown by DFT calculations. Cyclic voltammetry reveals a fully reversible one&#8208;electron reduction at E1/2&#160;=&#160;&#8211;1.85&#160;V versus Fc0/+ in THF. Chemical reduction with KC8 in the presence of 4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane (222&#8208;crypt) enables the isolation of an unprecedented Bi(II) radical anion in high isolated yields. Multi&#8208;frequency EPR, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry complemented by theoretical calculations confirm localization of the unpaired electron on the bismuth center. Preliminary reactivity studies display radical reactivity as shown by single&#8208;electron transfer chemistry and radical coupling reactions.

         <title>Rational Crystal Contact Engineering for Programmable Self&#8208;Assembled Protein Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Winning by losing: With rational elimination of crystal lattice contacts, the remaining interaction sites drive the formation of predetermined assemblies. Thus, rational lattice redesign can produce multiple structured frameworks from essentially the same building blocks, without resource&#8208;costly calculations required for new designs.








Abstract
Ordered protein&#8208;based assemblies are increasingly desirable for materials science, but the design of new materials remains challenging and requires considerable effort. Crystal lattice contact modulation enables rapid rational design of an assortment of structurally diverse constructs with crystalline order. Targeted disruption of crystal contacts and directional growth pre&#8208;biasing allows for restricting crystal lattice growth in selected directions, resulting in lower&#8208;dimension assemblies with parent crystal structural features. Two&#8208;dimensional crystals, one&#8208;dimensional fibres, flexible ribbons, and single&#8208;walled nanotubes based on tetratricopeptide repeat proteins were constructed from reengineered 3D crystal lattices. The large library of available crystal structures provides an abundance of engineering targets, promising to make crystal contact engineering a rapid and attractive approach for the design of ordered supramolecular protein assemblies.

         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed, enantioselective three&#8208;component dearomative coupling of bromoarenes, silyldiazomethane, and malonates has been developed. This method employs a newly designed chiral ligand to efficiently construct 1,4&#8208;disubstituted hydrogenated naphthalenes, providing a concise and versatile strategy for the synthesis of terpenoid natural products. 








Abstract
We report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric three&#8208;component coupling of bromoarenes, diazoalkanes, and malonates. It represents a significant advancement in catalytic enantioselective dearomative 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated arenes. A palladium catalyst of a novel phosphoramidite enables a domino reaction consisting of enantiofacial aryl insertion of a bound diazoalkane and regioselective and stereospecific allylic substitution. The new reaction was readily applied in short total syntheses of three terpenoids, including (+)&#8208;erogorgiaene, (&#8722;)&#8208;7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydrocadalin, and (&#8722;)&#8208;odongrossin C. Mechanistic studies establish that stereocontrol arises from a concerted aryl migration/N2 extrusion, which forms the key cyclic &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium intermediate. The C4&#8208;regioselectivity of the malonate attack is governed by a combination of ligand effects, silyl group sterics, and stabilizing noncovalent interactions between the naphthyl ring and sodium malonate.

A palladium catalyst of a novel phosphoramidite enables a domino reaction consisting of enantiofacial aryl insertion of a bound diazoalkane and regioselective and stereospecific allylic substitution. The new reaction was readily applied in short total syntheses of three terpenoids, including (+)-erogorgiaene, (&#8722;)-7-hydroxy-3,4-dihydrocadalin, and (&#8722;)-odongrossin C. Mechanistic studies establish that stereocontrol arises from a concerted aryl migration/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extrusion, which forms the key cyclic &#960;-allyl palladium intermediate.

         <title>Valence&#8208;Modulated Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) Cathode Tuned by Orbital&#8208;Delocalization for Extreme&#8208;Temperature Sodium Storage</title>

         <dc:description>
Conventional NFPP cathodes suffer from slow Na&#8314; diffusion, low capacity, and structural degradation. We propose an orbital&#8208;delocalization assisted valence modulation strategy, optimizing Na&#8314; pathways for ultralow&#8208;temperature (&#8722;40&#8239;&#176;C) operation and creating multiple redox centers to boost capacity and conductivity. NFPP&#8208;2Mo exhibits enhanced structural stability, resisting electrolyte attack even at 60&#8239;&#176;C, ensuring long&#8208;term integrity. This approach enables wide&#8208;temperature (&#8722;40&#8211;60&#8239;&#176;C) functionality, fast charging/discharging, and extended lifespan, addressing key Na&#8208;ion cathode challenges.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based polyanionic Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) is recognized as a promising cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with its cost&#8208;effectiveness and stable framework. However, its commercialization is seriously hindered by sluggish Na+ kinetics, and insufficient capacity utilization. Herein, an orbital&#8208;delocalization assisted valence modulated strategy is proposed to address these challenges. The lattice is stabilized by high&#8208;valence Mo6+ through robust Mo&#9472;O bonds, simultaneously reducing Na+ diffusion barriers and activating the inert Na2 sites, while electron delocalization is effectively promoted by its partially filled 3d orbitals to enhance electronic conductivity. Concurrently, additional charge compensation is also provided by Mo4+ via a reversible Mo4+/Mo6+ redox couple, enabling complete Na+ extraction/insertion and suppression of structure distortion. A record&#8208;high discharge capacity of 130.74&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;C is delivered by the optimized Na4Fe2.91Mo0.09(PO4)2(P2O7) cathode, with 87.23% capacity retained after 10&#160;000 cycles at 50&#160;C, along with stable operation from&#160;&#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C. A universal paradigm for high&#8208;performance polyanionic cathodes is established by this synergistic reinforcement approach, advancing durable and high&#8208;power SIBs.

         <title>A Reversible Chemoenzymatic Labeling Strategy for Profiling of Protein O&#8208;Glucosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible chemoenzymatic labeling strategy for the efficient analysis of protein O&#8208;Glc was developed, and numerous canonical and noncanonical O&#8208;Glc modifications were identified across human cell lines with mass spectrometry (MS) technology, suggesting protein O&#8208;Glc is a widespread post&#8208;translational protein modification.








Abstract
O&#8208;linked glucose (O&#8208;Glc), the &#946;&#8208;linked modification of serine residues, is a rare form of protein glycosylation first identified on proteins containing epidermal growth factor (EGF)&#8208;like domains (canonical O&#8208;Glc). Several recent studies revealed that proteins lacking EGF&#8208;like domains could also undergo O&#8208;Glc modification (noncanonical O&#8208;Glc). However, the biosynthetic origin and biological function of protein O&#8208;glucosylation remain poorly understood and debated, owing to the lack of effective analytical tools. Here, a reversible chemoenzymatic labeling strategy for O&#8208;Glc analysis is described. By the strategy described, a large number of canonical and noncanonical O&#8208;Glc sites were identified in human cell lines, indicating that protein O&#8208;Glc is a widespread post&#8208;translational protein modification.

         <title>Spatial Decoupling of Adsorption and Transformation Sites on Ag&#8208;Cu Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Highly Selective Photocatalytic Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically paired neighboring Ag and Cu sites on g&#8208;C3N4 with their synergistic functions enable photocatalytic tandem nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion under visible light irradiation via the creation of an unique microenvironment: Cu sites adsorb and activate NO3&#8211;, whereas adjacent Ag sites stabilize *NO intermediates and modulate the proton supply suppressing the hydrogen reaction evolution for achieving fast spatially decoupling adsorption&#8208;transformation pathways with 98% NH3 selectivity.








Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8211;) reduction to ammonia (NH3) presents a sustainable solution for simultaneous NH3 synthesis and wastewater remediation. However, achieving high selectivity is challenging, plagued by sluggish kinetics and parasitic side reactions. In this study, we rationally design a synergistic Ag&#8208;Cu dual&#8208;atom catalyst on g&#8208;C3N4 (AgCu&#8208;CN) that embodies a spatially decoupled tandem scheme. We demonstrate that the oxophilic Cu1 site serve as Lewis acid centers to efficiently capture and activate NO3&#8211;, before the crucial *NO intermediate is shuttled to adjacent Ag1 site, which is intrinsically inert toward the hydrogen evolution reaction, act as dedicated hydrogenation center for rapid and deep *NO reduction. This atomic&#8208;level synergy manifests in a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance, with AgCu&#8208;CN delivering an impressive 98% NH3 selectivity and a production rate of 630.5&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 under visible light. In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations corroborate the tandem mechanism and the critical role of the Ag&#8208;Cu dual sites in steering reaction selectivity. This study establishes a powerful tandem catalytic design principle to manage the selectivity challenges in complex multi&#8208;proton/electron reactions.
