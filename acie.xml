         <title>Mechanophotocatalysis: A Generalizable Approach to Solvent&#8208;minimized Photocatalytic Reactions for Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study cements the viability and generality of mechanophotocatalysis, merging mechanochemistry and photocatalysis to enable solvent&#8208;minimized photocatalytic reactions. We demonstrate the transmutation of four archetypal solution&#8208;state photocatalysis reactions to a solvent&#8208;minimized environment driven by the combined actions of milling, light, and photocatalysts. The chlorosulfonylation of alkenes and the pinacol coupling of aldehydes and ketones were conducted under solvent&#8208;free conditions with competitive or superior efficiencies to their solution&#8208;state analogues. Furthermore, decarboxylative alkylations are shown to function efficiently under solvent&#8208;minimized conditions, while the photoinduced energy transfer promoted [2+2] cycloaddition of chalcone experiences a significant initial rate enhancement over its solution&#8208;state variant. This work serves as a platform for future discoveries in an underexplored field: validating that solvent&#8208;minimized photocatalysis is not only generalizable and competitive with solution&#8208;state photocatalysis, but can also offer valuable advantages.</dc:description>

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Continuous and In Situ Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide by Sulfur&#8208;Functionalized Polymer Catalyst for Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic H2O2 generation system based on polymer catalyst receives increasing attention in recent years; however, the insufficient charge separation efficiency and low oxygen adsorption/activation capacity severely limit their potential application. In this study, a sulfur (C=S) functionalized polymer catalyst is reported through a green water&#8208;mediated and catalyst&#8208;free multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs) route. The sulfur functional group endows the polymer with a suitable energy band and facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pair. The reported polymer achieves a high H2O2 production efficiency (3132 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1) in pure water without oxygen aeration. To demonstrate their potential in in&#8208;situ wastewater treatment, a panel reactor system (20&#215;20 cm) is constructed for large&#8208;scale production of H2O2, which realizes continuous degradation of emerging pollutants including antibiotics and bisphenol A under natural sunlight irradiation condition. The H2O2 utilization efficiency of the photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton system using in&#8208;situ generated H2O2 is found 7.9 times higher than that of the traditional photo&#8208;Fenton system. This study offers new insights in green synthesis and design of functional polymer photocatalyst, and demonstrates the feasibility of panel reactor system for large&#8208;scale continuous H2O2 photocatalytic production and water treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzo&#8208;fused Nitrogen Heterocycles by Asymmetric Ring Expansion and Stereochemically Retentive Re&#8208;contraction of Cyclic Ureas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzo&#8208;fused nitrogen heterocycles are common features of bioactive molecules, and the enantioselective synthesis of their substituted analogues is an important goal. In this paper we demonstrate a practical and mechanistically intriguing approach to the enantioselective synthesis of 1&#8208;arylbenzazepines and their analogues. The reaction sequence starts with an asymmetric migratory ring expansion of indoline, tetrahydroquinoline, or tetrahydrobenzazepine ureas on treatment with a chiral lithium amide base. Treatment of the ring&#8208;expanded ureas with acid triggers a two&#8208;atom ring contraction &#8211; an &#8216;azatropic shift&#8217; in which one urea nitrogen displaces the other &#8211; with almost complete retention of stereochemistry. Aminolysis of the urea products provides enantioenriched 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydrobenzazepine derivatives and their congeners, including an analogue of an intermediate in the synthesis of the drug solifenacin. Deuteration, in situ IR, and DFT studies provide evidence for the mechanisms of the reaction steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of a Hydrophobic Protrusion on Nanoparticles to Improve the Membrane&#8208;Anchoring Ability and Cellular Internalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable hydrophobic protrusion was created on Janus particles to regulate the nanoparticle&#8208;cell membrane interactions. When the Janus particle contacts cell membrane, the protrusion will induce membrane wrapping, lead the particle to dock to the membrane, and then draw the whole particle into the cell, improving the efficiencies of both membrane&#8208;anchoring and cellular internalization.







Abstract
Controlling the nanoparticle&#8208;cell membrane interaction to achieve easy and fast membrane anchoring and cellular internalization is of great importance in a variety of biomedical applications. Here we report a simple and versatile strategy to maneuver the nanoparticle&#8208;cell membrane interaction by creating a tunable hydrophobic protrusion on Janus particles through swelling&#8208;induced symmetry breaking. When the Janus particle contacts cell membrane, the protrusion will induce membrane wrapping, leading the particles to docking to the membrane, followed by drawing the whole particles into the cell. The efficiencies of both membrane anchoring and cellular internalization can be promoted by optimizing the size of the protrusion. In vitro, the Janus particles can quickly anchor to the cell membrane in 1&#8197;h and be internalized within 24&#8197;h, regardless of the types of cells involved. In vivo, the Janus particles can effectively anchor to the brain and skin tissues to provide a high retention in these tissues after intracerebroventricular, intrahippocampal, or subcutaneous injection. This strategy involving the creation of a hydrophobic protrusion on Janus particles to tune the cell&#8208;membrane interaction holds great potential in nanoparticle&#8208;based biomedical applications.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;A Mitochondrion&#8208;Localized Two&#8208;Photon Photosensitizer Generating Carbon Radicals Against Hypoxic Tumors&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ESR spectra reported in a Research Article by Chao and co&#8208;workers are not in agreement with reactive &#8220;carbon radicals&#8221; claimed to be produced by 730&#8197;nm irradiation of the iridium(III) complex Ir4&#8208;red. The observed tumor&#8208;damaging effects must be induced by other, unidentified reactive intermediates.







Abstract
It is shown that data presented in a paper by Chao and co&#8208;workers do not support the formation of active &#8220;Carbon Radicals&#8221; as claimed according to the title. The assignments of observed ESR spectra and the mechanistic interpretation are severely flawed. Hence, other reactive intermediates must be responsible for the observed tumor&#8208;damaging effects.

         <title>P450&#8208;Modified Multicyclic Cyclophane&#8208;Containing Ribosomally Synthesized and Post&#8208;Translationally Modified Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive bioinformatic analysis identified 1,057 putative P450&#8208;modified RiPP gene clusters classified into 11 different clades. Gene clusters from Class&#8197;3 and 9, which encode multiple aromatic amino acids, were selected for heterologous expreesion. A total of 11 P450&#8208;modified multicyclic peptides were successfully characterized, with some containing unusual cyclophane linkers, demonstrating the powerful catalytic capabilities of P450 enzymes.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides with cyclophane linkers are an attractive compound type owing to the fine&#8208;tuned rigid three&#8208;dimensional structures and unusual biophysical features. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are capable of catalyzing not only the C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O oxidative coupling reactions found in vancomycin and other nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), but they also exhibit novel catalytic activities to generate cyclic ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) through cyclophane linkage. To discover more P450&#8208;modified multicyclic RiPPs, we set out to find cryptic and unknown P450&#8208;modified RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) through genome mining. Synergized bioinformatic analysis reveals that P450&#8208;modified RiPP BGCs are broadly distributed in bacteria and can be classified into 11&#8197;classes. Focusing on two classes of P450&#8208;modified RiPP BGCs where precursor peptides contain multiple conserved aromatic amino acid residues, we characterized 11 novel P450&#8208;modified multicyclic RiPPs with different cyclophane linkers through heterologous expression. Further mutation of the key ring&#8208;forming residues and combinatorial biosynthesis study revealed the order of bond formation and the specificity of P450s. This study reveals the functional diversity of P450 enzymes involved in the cyclophane&#8208;containing RiPPs and indicates that P450 enzymes are promising tools for rapidly obtaining structurally diverse cyclic peptide derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive bioinformatic analysis identified 1,057 putative P450-modified RiPP gene clusters classified into 11 different clades. Gene clusters from Class&#8197;3 and 9, which encode multiple aromatic amino acids, were selected for heterologous expreesion. A total of 11 P450-modified multicyclic peptides were successfully characterized, with some containing unusual cyclophane linkers, demonstrating the powerful catalytic capabilities of P450 enzymes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclic peptides with cyclophane linkers are an attractive compound type owing to the fine-tuned rigid three-dimensional structures and unusual biophysical features. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are capable of catalyzing not only the C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O oxidative coupling reactions found in vancomycin and other nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), but they also exhibit novel catalytic activities to generate cyclic ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) through cyclophane linkage. To discover more P450-modified multicyclic RiPPs, we set out to find cryptic and unknown P450-modified RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) through genome mining. Synergized bioinformatic analysis reveals that P450-modified RiPP BGCs are broadly distributed in bacteria and can be classified into 11&#8197;classes. Focusing on two classes of P450-modified RiPP BGCs where precursor peptides contain multiple conserved aromatic amino acid residues, we characterized 11 novel P450-modified multicyclic RiPPs with different cyclophane linkers through heterologous expression. Further mutation of the key ring-forming residues and combinatorial biosynthesis study revealed the order of bond formation and the specificity of P450s. This study reveals the functional diversity of P450 enzymes involved in the cyclophane-containing RiPPs and indicates that P450 enzymes are promising tools for rapidly obtaining structurally diverse cyclic peptide derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase Control and Singlet Energy Transfer Enabled by Trimethylamine Modified Boron Dipyrromethene for Stable CsPbBr3 Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trimethylamine modified boron dipyrromethene (BDP&#8208;TMA) driven can precisely control phase distribution and enhance the stability of CsPbBr3 quantum wells. Notably, BDP&#8208;TMA, acting as a co&#8208;spacer organic entity, facilitates efficient singlet energy transfer (ET) and tailors the luminescent characteristics to produce a distinctive bluish&#8208;white emission. BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3 exhibits the thermally&#8208;induced dynamic fluorescence control.







Abstract
The phase distribution and organic spacer cations play pivotal roles in determining the emission performance and stability of perovskite quantum wells (QWs). Here, we propose a universal molecular regulation strategy to tailor phase distribution and enhance the stability of CsPbBr3 QWs. The capability of sterically hindered ligands with formidable surface binding groups is underscored in directing CsPbBr3 growth and refining phase distribution. With trimethylamine modified boron dipyrromethene (BDP&#8208;TMA) ligand as a representative, the BDP&#8208;TMA driven can precisely control phase distribution and passivate defects of CsPbBr3. Notably, BDP&#8208;TMA acts as a co&#8208;spacer organic entity in obtained BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3, facilitating efficient singlet energy transfer and tailoring the luminescence to produce a distinctive bluish&#8208;white emission. The BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3 demonstrates significant phase stability under water exposure, light irradiation, and moderate temperature. Interestingly, BDP&#8208;TMA&#8208;CsPbBr3 exhibits the thermally&#8208;induced dynamic fluorescence control at elevated temperatures, which can be achieved feasible for advanced information encryption. This discovery paves the way for the exploration of perovskite QWs in applications like temperature sensing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and other advanced optical smart technologies.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Initiated Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Polythiophene&#8208;Based Conjugated Block Copolymer into Erect Micellar Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) of polythiophene&#8208;base block copolymer and further decoration of Pt nanoparticles lead to facile construction of highly erect conjugated micellar brushes on various substrates. Moreover, successive patterned immobilization of two types of seed micelles followed by independently surface&#8208;initiated CDSA allows the growth of patterned dual&#8208;micellar brushes on the same substrate.







Abstract
Nanostructured conjugated polymers are of widespread interest due to their broad applications in organic optoelectronic devices, biomedical sensors and other fields. However, the alignment of conjugated nanostructures perpendicular to a surface remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report a facile method to directly self&#8208;assemble a poly(3&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thiophene), P3EHT&#8208;based block copolymer into densely aligned micellar brushes through surface&#8208;initiated living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. The presence of an ethyl pendant on the side group intrinsically moderates the crystallization rate of the polythiophene main chains, and hence favors the controlled living growth of long conjugated fibers and the subsequent fabrication of conjugated micellar brushes. The corona of the micellar brush can be further decorated with platinum nanoparticles, which enables the formation of erect nanoarrays with heights up to 2700&#8197;nm in the dried state. This also renders the micellar brush catalytically active toward hydrogen evolution reaction, which shows a low overpotential of 27&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Notably, the P3EHT&#8208;based micellar brush can simultaneously grow with polyferrocenyldimethylsilane, PFS&#8208;based micellar brush on the same surface without any significant interference between the two systems. Thus, these two micellar brushes can be patterned through site&#8208;selective immobilization of two types of seeds followed by independent living self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>L&#8208;Glycosidase&#8208;Cleavable Natural Glycans Facilitate the Chemical Synthesis of Correctly Folded Disulfide&#8208;Bonded D&#8208;Proteins</title>

Temporary installation of natural O&#8208;linked&#8208;&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) groups onto D&#8208;serine (DS) or D&#8208;threonine (DT) residues of synthetic disulfide&#8208;bonded D&#8208;proteins can facilitate their folding in vitro, and the natural glycosyl groups can be completely removed from the folded D&#8208;proteins using naturally occurring O&#8208;GlcNAcase (L&#8208;OGA) to afford the desired D&#8208;protein targets.







Abstract
D&#8208;peptide ligands can be screened for therapeutic potency and enzymatic stability using synthetic mirror&#8208;image proteins (D&#8208;proteins), but efficient acquisition of these D&#8208;proteins can be hampered by the need to accomplish their in vitro folding, which often requires the formation of correctly linked disulfide bonds. Here, we report the finding that temporary installation of natural O&#8208;linked&#8208;&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) groups onto selected D&#8208;serine or D&#8208;threonine residues of the synthetic disulfide&#8208;bonded D&#8208;proteins can facilitate their folding in vitro, and that the natural glycosyl groups can be completely removed from the folded D&#8208;proteins to afford the desired chirally inverted D&#8208;protein targets using naturally occurring O&#8208;GlcNAcase. This approach enabled the efficient chemical syntheses of several important but difficult&#8208;to&#8208;fold D&#8208;proteins incorporating disulfide bonds including the mirror&#8208;image tumor necrosis factor alpha (D&#8208;TNF&#945;) homotrimer and the mirror&#8208;image receptor&#8208;binding domain of the Omicron spike protein (D&#8208;RBD). Our work establishes the use of O&#8208;GlcNAc to facilitate D&#8208;protein synthesis and folding and proves that D&#8208;proteins bearing O&#8208;GlcNAc can be good substrates for naturally occurring O&#8208;GlcNAcase.

         <title>Sonogenetics for Monitoring and Modulating Biomolecular Function by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sonogenetics is an evolving field in which ultrasound is used for the molecular control of cellular functions at different levels, thereby opening new avenues in biological and medical research. Here we discuss sonogenetic mediators and review state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sonogenetic methods utilizing thermal and mechanical ultrasonic effects as well as mechanochemically reactive macromolecular systems and ultrasound biomolecular imaging.







Abstract
Ultrasound technology, synergistically harnessed with genetic engineering and chemistry concepts, has started to open the gateway to the remarkable realm of sonogenetics&#8212;a pioneering paradigm for remotely orchestrating cellular functions at the molecular level. This fusion not only enables precisely targeted imaging and therapeutic interventions, but also advances our comprehension of mechanobiology to unparalleled depths. Sonogenetic tools harness mechanical force within small tissue volumes while preserving the integrity of the surrounding physiological environment, reaching depths of up to tens of centimeters with high spatiotemporal precision. These capabilities circumvent the inherent physical limitations of alternative in vivo control methods such as optogenetics and magnetogenetics. In this review, we first discuss mechanosensitive ion channels, the most commonly utilized sonogenetic mediators, in both mammalian and non&#8208;mammalian systems. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sonogenetic approaches that leverage thermal or mechanical features of ultrasonic waves. Additionally, we explore strategies centered around the design of mechanochemically reactive macromolecular systems. Furthermore, we delve into the realm of ultrasound imaging of biomolecular function, encompassing the utilization of gas vesicles and acoustic reporter genes. Finally, we shed light on limitations and challenges of sonogenetics and present a perspective on the future of this promising technology.

         <title>Facilitating the Electrochemical Oxidation of ZnS through Iodide Catalysis for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible conversion of sulfur cathodes in aqueous Zn&#8208;S batteries is realized by applying the highly water&#8208;soluble ZnI2 catalyst. Experimental and computational results indicate that abundant iodide ions adsorbed on ZnS nanoparticles surface regulate the d&#8208;band center of Zn, leading to atomic rearrangements, and therefore promoting the electro&#8208;oxidation of ZnS to S.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;sulfur (Zn&#8208;S) batteries show great potential for unlocking high energy and safety aqueous batteries. Yet, the sluggish kinetic and poor redox reversibility of the sulfur conversion reaction in aqueous solution challenge the development of Zn&#8208;S batteries. Here, we fabricate a high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;S battery using highly water&#8208;soluble ZnI2 as an effective catalyst. In situ experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the strong interaction between I&#8722; and the ZnS nanoparticles (discharge product) leads to the atomic rearrangement of ZnS, weakening the Zn&#8208;S bonding, and thus facilitating the electrochemical oxidation reaction of ZnS to S. The aqueous Zn&#8208;S battery exhibited a high energy density of 742&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg(sulfur)&#8722;1 at the power density of 210.8&#8197;W&#8201;kg(sulfur)&#8722;1 and good cycling stability over 550 cycles. Our findings provide new insights about the iodide catalytic effect for cathode conversion reaction in Zn&#8208;S batteries, which is conducive to promoting the future development of high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.

         <title>Accelerating the Reaction Kinetics of CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products by Synergistic Effect between Cation and Aprotic Solvent on Copper Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of cation and aprotic solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) in a neutral electrolyte can improve the selectivity of C2+ products for CO2 reduction reaction. Among them, the synergistic effect not only enhances C&#8722;C coupling, but also decreases the water network connectivity &#8208; which suppresses C1 product formation and hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Improving the selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction to multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) is an important and highly challenging topic. In this work, we propose and validate an effective strategy to improve C2+ selectivity on Cu electrodes, by introducing a synergistic effect between cation (Na+) and aprotic solvent (DMSO) to the electrolyte. Based on constant potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we first revealed that Na+ facilitates C&#8722;C coupling while inhibits CH3OH/CH4 products via reducing the water network connectivity near the electrode. Furthermore, the water network connectivity was further decreased by introducing an aprotic solvent DMSO, leading to suppression of both C1 production and hydrogen evolution reaction with minimal effect on *OCCO* hydrogenation. The synergistic effect enhancing C2 selectivity was also experimentally verified through electrochemical measurements. The results showed that the Faradaic efficiency of C2 increases from 9.3&#8201;% to 57&#8201;% at 50&#8197;mA/cm2 under a mixed electrolyte of NaHCO3 and DMSO compared to a pure NaHCO3, which can significantly enhance the selectivity of the C2 product. Therefore, our discovery provides an effective electrolyte&#8208;based strategy for tuning CO2RR selectivity through modulating the microenvironment at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Assisted Li&#8208;N2 Batteries with Enhanced Nitrogen Fixation and Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery system is established by employing a plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;modified defective carbon nitride (Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) photocathode. Benefiting from the strong light&#8208;harvesting, N2 adsorption, and N2 activation abilities of the Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 cathode, the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery displays the highest round&#8208;trip efficiency (56.2&#8201;%) to date, superior rate capability, and stable cycle life of over 500&#8197;h.







Abstract
Li&#8208;N2 batteries have received widespread attention for their potential to integrate N2 fixation, energy storage, and conversion. However, because of the low activity and poor stability of cathode catalysts, the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;N2 batteries is suboptimal, and their electrochemical reversibility has rarely been proven. In this study, a novel bifunctional photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery system was established by employing a plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;modified defective carbon nitride (Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4) photocathode. The Au&#8208;Nv&#8208;C3N4 exhibits strong light&#8208;harvesting, N2 adsorption, and N2 activation abilities, and the photogenerated electrons and hot electrons are remarkably beneficial for accelerating the discharge and charge reaction kinetics. These advantages enable the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery to achieve a low overpotential of 1.32&#8197;V, which is the lowest overpotential reported to date, as well as superior rate capability and prolonged cycle stability (&#8776;500&#8197;h). Remarkably, a combination of theoretical and experimental results demonstrates the high reversibility of the photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;N2 battery. The proposed novel strategy for developing efficient cathode catalysts and fabricating photo&#8208;assisted battery systems breaks through the overpotential bottleneck of Li&#8208;N2 batteries, providing important insights into the mechanism underlying N2 fixation and storage.

         <title>Disclosing Support&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Effect on Ambient Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation over Nickel/Titanium Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size of support significantly affects the reaction orientation of the light&#8208;driven CO2 hydrogenation. Small&#8208;size TiO2 supporting nickel exhibits enhanced metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI) and enables more light&#8208;induced electrons on TiO2 to transfer to Ni, thereby accelerating the H2 decomposition and CO2 methanation process.







Abstract
The size of support in heterogeneous catalysts can strongly affect the catalytic property but is rarely explored in light&#8208;driven catalysis. Herein, we demonstrate the size of TiO2 support governs the selectivity in photothermal CO2 hydrogenation by tuning the metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI). Small&#8208;size TiO2 loading nickel (Ni/TiO2&#8208;25) with enhanced MSI promotes photo&#8208;induced electrons of TiO2 migrating to Ni nanoparticles, thus favoring the H2 cleavage and accelerating the CH4 formation (227.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under xenon light&#8208;induced temperature of 360&#8201;&#176;C. Conversely, Ni/TiO2&#8208;100 with large TiO2 prefers yielding CO (94.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) due to weak MSI, inefficient charge separation, and inadequate supply of activated hydrogen. Under ambient solar irradiation, Ni/TiO2&#8208;25 achieves the optimized CH4 rate (63.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) with selectivity of 99.8&#8201;%, while Ni/TiO2&#8208;100 exhibits the CO selectivity of 90.0&#8201;% with rate of 30.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This work offers a novel approach to tailoring light&#8208;driven catalytic properties by support size effect.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Liquid Interfacial Engineered Large&#8208;Area Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of large&#8208;area continuous COF films with controllable thickness and the patterned growth of films are achieved by solid&#8208;liquid interface engineering. The COF films have high crystalline quality and photoelectrochemical performance. When used as an active material for synaptic devices, they show excellent light&#8208;stimulated synaptic plasticity properties and successfully simulate biological synaptic functions.







Abstract
Constructing uniform covalent organic framework (COF) film on substrates for electronic devices is highly desirable. Here, a simple and mild strategy is developed to prepare them by polymerization on a solid&#8208;liquid interface. The universality of the method is confirmed by the successful preparation of five COF films with different microstructures. These films have large lateral size, controllable thickness, and high crystalline quality. And COF patterns can also be directly achieved on substrates via hydrophilic and hydrophobic interface engineering, which is in favor of preparing device array. For application studies, the PyTTA&#8208;TPA (PyTTA: 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1,3,6,8&#8208;Tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene and TPA: terephthalaldehyde) COF film has a high photoresponsivity of 59.79&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 at 420&#8197;nm for photoelectrochemical (PEC) detection. When employed as an active material for optoelectronic synaptic devices for the first attempt, it shows excellent light&#8208;stimulated synaptic plasticity properties such as short&#8208;term plasticity (STP), long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP), and the conversion of STP to LTP, which can be used to simulate biological synaptic functions.

         <title>In situ Light&#8208;Writable Orientation Control in Liquid Crystal Elastomer Film Enabled by Chalcones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable liquid crystal elastomer (LCE), where anisotropy can be written by linearly polarized light based on the photoinduced cycloaddition reaction of chalcone mesogens, is accomplished. Importantly, the sophisticated topography changes are realized by implanting regionally distributed anisotropy into LCE sheets.







Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with intrinsic anisotropy. However, it is still challenging to in situ program the mesogen alignment to realize three&#8208;dimensional (3D) deformations with high&#8208;resolution patterned structures. This work presents a feasible strategy to program the anisotropy of LCEs by using chalcone mesogens that can undergo a photoinduced cycloaddition reaction under linear polarized light. It is shown that by controlling the polarization director and the irradiation region, patterned alignment distribution in a freestanding LCE film can be created, which leads to complex and reversible 3D shape&#8208;morphing behaviors. The work demonstrates an in situ light&#8208;writing method to achieve sophisticated topography changes in LCEs, which has potential applications in encryption, sensors, and beyond.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled Calcium Overload from Endogenous Sources for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, the Ca2+ nanomodulator can generate ROS to stimulate the TRPA1 channel and realize Ca2+ influx from extracellular environments. At the same time, photothermo&#8208;controlled NO generation could open the RyR channel in the ER and allow stored Ca2+ to leak. Through the combination of dual channels, Ca2+ overload would occur in the cytoplasm and efficiently inhibit tumor growth.







Abstract
Designing reactive calcium&#8208;based nanogenerators to produce excess calcium ions (Ca2+) in tumor cells is an attractive tumor treatment method. However, nanogenerators that introduce exogenous Ca2+ are either overactive incapable of on&#8208;demand release, or excessively inert incapable of an overload of calcium rapidly. Herein, inspired by inherently diverse Ca2+&#8208;regulating channels, a photo&#8208;controlled Ca2+ nanomodulator that fully utilizes endogenous Ca2+ from dual sources was designed to achieve Ca2+ overload in tumor cells. Specifically, mesoporous silica nanoparticles were used to co&#8208;load bifunctional indocyanine green as a photodynamic/photothermal agent and a thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide (NO) donor (BNN&#8208;6). Thereafter, they were coated with hyaluronic acid, which served as a tumor cell&#8208;targeting unit and a gatekeeper. Under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, the Ca2+ nanomodulator can generate reactive oxygen species that stimulate the transient receptor potential ankyrin subtype 1 channel to realize Ca2+ influx from extracellular environments. Simultaneously, the converted heat can induce BNN&#8208;6 decomposition to generate NO, which would open the ryanodine receptor channel in the endoplasmic reticulum and allow stored Ca2+ to leak. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the combination of photo&#8208;controlled Ca2+ influx and release could enable Ca2+ overload in the cytoplasm and efficiently inhibit tumor growth.

         <title>Towards a Light&#8208;mediated Gene Therapy for the Eye using Caged Ethinylestradiol and the Inducible Cre/lox System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue light sensitive caged ethinylestradiol (EE2) was used in combination with the inducible Cre/lox system for photoactivated transgene expression in the living eye. Following intravitreal injection of caged EE2 and irradiation with light at 450&#8197;nm, tdTomato reporter gene expression was robustly induced in retinal tissue.







Abstract
Increasingly, retinal pathologies are being treated with virus&#8208;mediated gene therapies. To be able to target viral transgene expression specifically to the pathological regions of the retina with light, we established an in vivo photoactivated gene expression paradigm for retinal tissue. Based on the inducible Cre/lox system, we discovered that ethinylestradiol is a suitable alternative to Tamoxifen as ethinylestradiol is more amenable to modification with photosensitive protecting compounds, i.e., &#8220;caging.&#8221; Identification of ethinylestradiol as a ligand for the mutated human estradiol receptor was supported by in silico binding studies showing the reduced binding of caged ethinylestradiol. Caged ethinylestradiol was injected into the eyes of double transgenic GFAP&#8208;CreERT2 mice with a Cre&#8208;dependent tdTomato reporter transgene followed by irradiation with light of 450&#8197;nm. Photoactivation significantly increased retinal tdTomato expression compared to controls. We thus demonstrated a first step towards the development of a targeted, light&#8208;mediated gene therapy for the eyes.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydrophobic Tri&#8208;layer Interface Rendered Mechanically Graded Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical hydrophobic tri&#8208;layer interface is developed through the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte design to create stable electrode/electrolyte interface. The OTF&#8208; rich interface facilitates the formation of mechanically graded solid electrolyte interface. As a result, the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte enabled zinc metal battery stably operation at practical condition and under wide temperature operation.







Abstract
The aqueous zinc&#8208;ion battery is promising as grid scale energy storage device, but hindered by the instable electrode/electrolyte interface. Herein, we report the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte for aqueous zinc metal batteries. The lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte creates the hydrophobic tri&#8208;layer interface assembled by first two layers of hydrophobic OTF&#8722; and EMIM+ and third layer of loosely attached water, beyond the classical Gouy&#8211;Chapman&#8211;Stern theory based electrochemical double layer. By taking advantage of the hydrophobic tri&#8208;layer interface, the lean&#8208;water ionic liquid electrolyte enables a wide electrochemical working window (2.93&#8197;V) with relatively high zinc ion conductivity (17.3&#8197;mS/cm). Furthermore, the anion crowding interface facilitates the OTF&#8722; decomposition chemistry to create the mechanically graded solid electrolyte interface layer to simultaneously suppress the dendrite formation and maintain the mechanical stability. In this way, the lean&#8208;water based ionic liquid electrolyte realizes the ultralong cyclability of over 10000 cycles at 20&#8197;A/g and at practical condition of N/P ratio of 1.5, the cumulated areal capacity reach 1.8&#8197;Ah/cm2, which outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art zinc metal battery performance. Our work highlights the importance of the stable electrode/electrolyte interface stability, which would be practical for building high energy grid scale zinc&#8208;ion battery.

         <title>Iodinated Electron Acceptor with Significantly Extended Exciton Diffusion Length for Efficient Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodination in organic solar cell molecule yields a breakthrough with the non&#8208;fullerene acceptor BO&#8208;4I, delivering expanded exciton diffusion, improved intra&#8208;moiety excitation, and unprecedentedly low non&#8208;radiative losses, propelling photovoltaic efficiency forward.







Abstract
Iodination has unlocked new potentials in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). A newly designed and synthesized iodinated non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, BO&#8208;4I, showcases exceptional excitation delocalization property with the exciton diffusion length increased to 80&#8197;nm. The enhanced electron delocalization property is attributed to the larger atomic radius and electron orbit of the iodine atom, which facilitates the formation of intra&#8208;moiety excitations in the acceptor phase. This effectively circumvents the charge transfer state&#8208;related recombination mechanisms, leading to a substantial reduction in non&#8208;radiative energy loss (&#916;Enr). As a result, OPV cell based on PBDB&#8208;TF&#8201;:&#8201;BO&#8208;4I achieves an impressive efficiency of 18.9&#8201;% with a notable &#916;Enr of 0.189&#8197;eV, markedly surpassing their fluorinated counterparts. This contribution highlights the pivotal role of iodination in reducing energy loss, thereby affirming its potential as a key strategy in the development of advanced next&#8208;generation OPV cells.

         <title>Photoluminescence Quenching of Hydrophobic Ag29 Nanoclusters Caused by Molecular Decoupling during Aqueous Phase Transfer and EmissionRecovery through Supramolecular Recoupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the phase transfer of hydrophobic clusters into the aqueous phase with maintained emission intensities via the supramolecular recoupling of emissive Ag29 nanoclusters with atomic precision.







Abstract
Exploiting emissive hydrophobic nanoclusters for hydrophilic applications remains a challenge because of photoluminescence (PL) quenching during phase transfer. In addition, the mechanism underlying PL quenching remains unclear. In this study, the PL&#8208;quenching mechanism was examined by analyzing the atomically precise structures and optical properties of a surface&#8208;engineered Ag29 nanocluster with an all&#8208;around&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;functionalized surface. Specifically, phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;triggered PL quenching was justified as molecular decoupling, which directed an unfixed cluster surface and weakened the radiative transition. Furthermore, emission recovery of the quenched nanoclusters was accomplished by using a supramolecular recoupling approach through the glutathione&#8208;addition&#8208;induced aggregation of cluster molecules, wherein the restriction of intracluster motion and intercluster rotation strengthened the radiative transition of the clusters. The results of this work offer a new perspective on structure&#8208;emission correlations for atomically precise nanoclusters and hopefully provide insight into the fabrication of highly emissive cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials for downstream hydrophilic applications.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Fully&#8208;Substituted and Configuration&#8208;Defined Alkyl Vinyl Ethers Enabled by Dual&#8208;Functional Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of highly&#8208;substituted alkyl vinyl ethers in a well&#8208;defined configuration is challenging. Now, a modular, chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective synthesis of fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined alkyl vinyl ethers (AVEs) enabled by dual&#8208;functional Cu catalysis is reported. It also represents a novel ring&#8208;opening pattern involving the cleavage of the C1&#8722;C3 bond in gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes.







Abstract
Here we present a modular, chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective synthesis of fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined alkyl vinyl ethers (AVEs) using simple chemical feedstocks. The distinctive approach involves the chemo&#8208; and regioselective functionalization of the CF2 unit in gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes with O&#8722;H and C&#8722;H nucleophiles in a specific order. The resulting highly functionalized cyclopropanyl ethers then undergo a stereoselective ring&#8208;opening process to produce fully&#8208;substituted and configuration&#8208;defined AVEs. These AVEs are rarely accessible through conventional methods and are easily transformable. Mechanistic experiments indicate that the success of this method relies on the use of dual&#8208;functional copper catalysis, which is involved in both the functionalization of the CF2 unit and the subsequent ring&#8208;opening process.

         <title>Designing Multifunctional Biomaterials via Protein Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview sums up cutting&#8208;edge concepts regarding the formation of protein&#8208;based supramolecular structures, compartmentalization, and self&#8208;assembly monitoring; it compares the routes of their modifications and applications in multifunctional biomaterial design. We summarize the current knowledge about machine learning/artificial intelligence applications for protein structure prediction/obtainment and link it to biomaterial performance.







Abstract
Protein self&#8208;assembly is a fundamental biological process where proteins spontaneously organize into complex and functional structures without external direction. This process is crucial for the formation of various biological functionalities. However, when protein self&#8208;assembly fails, it can trigger the development of multiple disorders, thus making understanding this phenomenon extremely important. Up until recently, protein self&#8208;assembly has been solely linked either to biological function or malfunction; however, in the past decade or two it has also been found to hold promising potential as an alternative route for fabricating materials for biomedical applications. It is therefore necessary and timely to summarize the key aspects of protein self&#8208;assembly: how the protein structure and self&#8208;assembly conditions (chemical environments, kinetics, and the physicochemical characteristics of protein complexes) can be utilized to design biomaterials. This minireview focuses on the basic concepts of forming supramolecular structures, and the existing routes for modifications. We then compare the applicability of different approaches, including compartmentalization and self&#8208;assembly monitoring. Finally, based on the cutting&#8208;edge progress made during the last years, we summarize the current knowledge about tailoring a final function by introducing changes in self&#8208;assembly and link it to biomaterials&#8217; performance.

         <title>Harmonizing Enzyme&#8208;like Cofactors to Boost Nanozyme Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to nanozymes mimicking specific metallocofactors without other supporting cofactors, a metal&#8211;organic framework incorporating multiple nanocofactors demonstrates the enhanced peroxidase&#8208;like activity. The synergy of the atomic iron sites, linkers and zirconia nodes boosts electron transfer, providing insight into the construction of catalytic pockets at the atomic scale for a deep understanding of nanozyme catalysis.







Abstract
Engineering isolated metal sites resembling the primary coordination sphere of metallocofactors enables atomically dispersed materials as promising nanozymes. However, most existing nanozymes primarily focus on replicating specific metallocofactors while neglecting other supporting cofactors within active pockets, leading to reduced electron transfer (ET) efficiency and thus inferior catalytic performances. Herein, we report a metal&#8211;organic framework UiO&#8208;67 nanozyme with atomically dispersed iron sites, which involves multiple tailored enzyme&#8208;like nanocofactors that synergistically drive the ET process for enhanced peroxidase&#8208;like catalysis. Among them, the linker&#8208;coupled atomic iron site plays a critical role in substrate activation, while bare linkers and zirconia nodes facilitate the ET efficiency of intermediates. The synergy of three nanocofactors results in a 4.29&#8208;fold enhancement compared with the single effort of isolated metal site&#8208;based nanocofactor, holding promise in immunoassay for sensitive detection of chlorpyrifos. This finding opens a new way for designing high&#8208;performance nanozymes by harmonizing various nanocofactors at the atomic and molecular scale.

         <title>Synergistic Glutathione Depletion and STING Activation to Potentiate Dendritic Cell Maturation and Cancer Vaccine Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese&#8208;doped layered double hydroxide nanoparticles enhanced dendritic cell maturation via intracellular glutathione depletion and subsequent STING pathway activation. Effective antigen delivery and presentation mediated by the nanoparticles significantly triggered antitumor immune response and inhibited tumor growth in both therapeutic and prophylactic settings.







Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC) maturation and antigen presentation are key factors for successful vaccine&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. This study developed manganese&#8208;based layered double hydroxide (Mn&#8208;LDH) nanoparticles as a self&#8208;adjuvanted vaccine carrier that not only promoted DC maturation through synergistically depleting endogenous glutathione (GSH) and activating STING signaling pathway, but also facilitated the delivery of model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) into lymph nodes and subsequent antigen presentation in DCs. Significant therapeutic&#8208;prophylactic efficacy of the OVA&#8208;loaded Mn&#8208;LDH (OVA/Mn&#8208;LDH) nanovaccine was determined by the tumor growth inhibition in the mice bearing B16&#8208;OVA tumor. Our results showed that the OVA/Mn&#8208;LDH nanoparticles could be a potent delivery system for cancer vaccine development without the need of adjuvant. Therefore, the combination of GSH exhaustion and STING pathway activation might be an advisable approach for promoting DC maturation and antigen presentation, finally improving cancer vaccine efficacy.

         <title>Nucleophilic Reaction&#8208;Enabled Chloride Modification on CsPbI3 Quantum Dots for Pure Red Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Efficiency Exceeding 26&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) with a carrier&#8208;confined structure of CsPbI3/PbClx are demonstrated via the nucleophilic reaction during colloidal synthesis. The modification of a PbClx surface outside the CsPbI3 QDs regulates the exciton recombination, enabling high&#8208;performance pure red light&#8208;emitting diodes with an emission centered at 638&#8197;nm, a peak external quantum efficiency of 26.1&#8201;%, and superior operation stability.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance pure red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with an emission wavelength shorter than 650&#8197;nm are ideal for wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut displays, yet remain an unprecedented challenge to progress. Mixed&#8208;halide CsPb(Br/I)3 emitter&#8208;based PeLEDs suffer spectral stability induced by halide phase segregation and CsPbI3 quantum dots (QDs) suffer from a compromise between emission wavelength and electroluminescence efficiency. Here, we demonstrate efficient pure red PeLEDs with an emission centered at 638&#8197;nm based on PbClx&#8208;modified CsPbI3 QDs. A nucleophilic reaction that releases chloride ions and manipulates the ligand equilibrium of the colloidal system is developed to synthesize the pure red emission QDs. The comprehensive structural and spectroscopic characterizations evidence the formation of PbClx outside the CsPbI3 QDs, which regulates exciton recombination and prevents the exciton from dissociation induced by surface defects. In consequence, PeLEDs based on PbClx&#8208;modified CsPbI3 QDs with superior optoelectronic properties demonstrate stable electroluminescence spectra at high driving voltages, a record external quantum efficiency of 26.1&#8201;%, optimal efficiency roll&#8208;off of 16.0&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, and a half lifetime of 7.5&#8197;hours at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art pure red PeLEDs. This work provides new insight into constructing the carrier&#8208;confined structure on perovskite QDs for high&#8208;performance PeLEDs.

         <title>Lateral Heterometal Junction Rectifier Fabricated by Sequential Transmetallation of Coordination Nanosheet
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lateral heterojunction, fabricated by spatially confined transmetallation of a precursor zinc(II) benzenehexathiolato coordination nanosheet with Fe(II) and Cu(II) ions is reported. Structural differences between the transmetallated and the as&#8208;prepared nanosheets lead to physical and chemical differences. Band structure bending across the interface of the transmetallated nanosheets results in the observed rectifying behavior.







Abstract
Heterostructures of two&#8208;dimensional materials realise novel and enhanced physical phenomena, making them attractive research targets. Compared to inorganic materials, coordination nanosheets have virtually infinite combinations, leading to tunability of physical properties and are promising candidates for heterostructure fabrication. Although stacking of coordination materials into vertical heterostructures is widely reported, reports of lateral coordination material heterostructures are few. Here we show the successful fabrication of a seamless lateral heterojunction showing diode behaviour, by sequential and spatially limited immersion of a new metalladithiolene coordination nanosheet, Zn3BHT, into aqueous Cu(II) and Fe(II) solutions. Upon immersion, the Zn centres in insulating Zn3BHT are replaced by Cu or Fe ions, resulting in conductivity. The transmetallation is spatially confined, occurring only within the immersed area. We anticipate that our results will be a starting point towards exploring transmetallation of various two&#8208;dimensional materials to produce lateral heterojunctions, by providing a new and facile synthetic route.

         <title>Selective Photoelectrochemical Oxidation of Glycerol to Glyceric Acid on (002) Facets Exposed WO3 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(002) Facets exposed WO3 nanosheets display excellent performance in selective photoelectrochemical oxidization of glycerol to glyceric acid, reaching 73&#8201;% glyceric acid selectivity and 32.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 glyceric acid production at 0.9&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5G illumination.







Abstract
Glycerol is a byproduct of biodiesel production. Selective photoelectrochemical oxidation of glycerol to high value&#8208;added chemicals offers an economical and sustainable approach to transform renewable feedstock as well as store green energy at the same time. In this work, we synthesized monoclinic WO3 nanosheets with exposed (002) facets, which could selectively oxidize glycerol to glyceric acid (GLYA) with a photocurrent density of 1.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a 73&#8201;% GLYA selectivity and a 39&#8201;% GLYA Faradaic efficiency at 0.9&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5G illumination (100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Compared to (200) facets exposed WO3, a combination of experiments and theoretical calculations indicates that the superior performance of selective glycerol oxidation mainly originates from the better charge separation and prolonged carrier lifetime resulted from the plenty of surface trapping states, lower energy barrier of the glycerol&#8208;to&#8208;GLYA reaction pathway, more abundant active sites and stronger oxidative ability of photogenerated holes on the (002) facets exposed WO3. Our findings show great potential to significantly contribute to the sustainable and environmentally friendly chemical processes via designing high performance photoelectrochemical cell via facet engineering for renewable feedstock transformation.

         <title>Stereodivergent Protein Engineering of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase for Light&#8208;Driven Kinetic Resolution of Sec&#8208;Alcohol Oxalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselectivity&#8208;tailored, photoenzyme&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution of oxalates and oxamic acids prepared from the corresponding sec&#8208;alcohols or amines was possible by using a pair of stereocomplementary CvFAP variants with excellent selectivity (both giving up to 99&#8201;% e.e., E&gt;200). The enzymes were obtained by focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM)&#8208;guided stereodivergent protein engineering of fatty acid photodecarboxylase.







Abstract
Stereodivergent engineering of one enzyme to create stereocomplementary variants for synthesizing optically pure molecules with tailor&#8208;made (R) or (S) configurations on an optional basis is highly desirable and challenging. This study aimed to engineer fatty acid photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) using the focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy to obtain two highly stereocomplementary variants with excellent selectivity (both giving products with up to 99&#8201;% e.e.). These variants were used for the CvFAP&#8208;catalyzed light&#8208;driven kinetic resolution of oxalates or oxamic acids prepared from the corresponding sec&#8208;alcohols or amines, providing a new biotransformation process for preparing chiral sec&#8208;alcohols and amines. Molecular dynamics simulation, kinetic data and transient spectra revealed the source of selectivity. This study represents the first example of the kinetic resolution of sec&#8208;alcohols or amines catalyzed by a pair of stereocomplementary CvFAPs.

&lt;p&gt;Stereoselectivity-tailored, photoenzyme-catalyzed kinetic resolution of oxalates and oxamic acids prepared from the corresponding &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;-alcohols or amines was possible by using a pair of stereocomplementary &lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;FAP variants with excellent selectivity (both giving up to 99&#8201;% e.e., E&amp;gt;200). The enzymes were obtained by focused rational iterative site-specific mutagenesis (FRISM)-guided stereodivergent protein engineering of fatty acid photodecarboxylase.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stereodivergent engineering of one enzyme to create stereocomplementary variants for synthesizing optically pure molecules with tailor-made (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;) or (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;) configurations on an optional basis is highly desirable and challenging. This study aimed to engineer fatty acid photodecarboxylase from &lt;i&gt;Chlorella variabilis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;FAP) using the focused rational iterative site-specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy to obtain two highly stereocomplementary variants with excellent selectivity (both giving products with up to 99&#8201;% e.e.). These variants were used for the &lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;FAP-catalyzed light-driven kinetic resolution of oxalates or oxamic acids prepared from the corresponding &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;-alcohols or amines, providing a new biotransformation process for preparing chiral &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;-alcohols and amines. Molecular dynamics simulation, kinetic data and transient spectra revealed the source of selectivity. This study represents the first example of the kinetic resolution of &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;-alcohols or amines catalyzed by a pair of stereocomplementary &lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;FAPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combining Multiple Photosensitizer Modules into One Supramolecular System for Synergetic Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete metallo&#8208;cages that combine multiple photosensitizer modules synergistically have been constructed through a simple method using pyrylium&#8208;pyridinium salts and coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Compared with the modules, cages with a porphyrin core exhibit a significant enhancement in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an enhanced efficacy in photodynamic therapy (PDT).







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as an emerging cancer treatment, requires the development of highly desirable photosensitizers (PSs) with integrated functional groups to achieve enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) would provide an alternative approach for combining multiple PSs synergistically. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet powerful strategy of combining conventional chromophores (tetraphenylethylene, porphyrin, or Zn&#8208;porphyrin) with pyridinium salt PSs together through condensation reactions, followed by CDSA to construct a series of novel metallo&#8208;supramolecular PSs (S1&#8211;S3). The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is dramatically enhanced by the direct combination of two different PSs, and further reinforced in the subsequent ensembles. Among all the ensembles, S2 with two porphyrin cores shows the highest ROS generation efficiency, specific interactions with lysosome, and strong emission for probing cells. Moreover, the cellular and living experiments confirm that S2 has excellent PDT efficacy, biocompatibility, and biosafety. As such, this study will enable the development of more efficient PSs with potential clinical applications.

         <title>Unearthing Superior Inorganic UV Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Materials: A Mineral&#8208;Inspired Method Integrating First&#8208;Principles High&#8208;Throughput Screening and Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural minerals, with their adaptable framework structures exemplified by perovskite and lyonsite, have sparked substantial interest as potential templates for the design of advanced functional solid&#8208;state materials. Nonetheless, the quest for new materials with desired properties remains a substantial challenge, primarily due to the scarcity of effective and practical synthetic approaches. In this study, we have harnessed a synergistic approach that seamlessly integrates first&#8208;principles high&#8208;throughput screening and crystal engineering to reinvigorate the often&#8208;overlooked fresnoite mineral, Ba2TiOSi2O7. This innovative strategy has culminated in the successful synthesis of two superior inorganic UV nonlinear optical materials, namely Rb2TeOP2O7 and Rb2SbFP2O7. Notably, Rb2SbFP2O7 demonstrates a comprehensive enhancement in nonlinear optical performance, featuring a shortened UV absorption edge (260 nm) and a more robust second&#8208;harmonic generation response (5.1 &#215; KDP). Particularly striking is its significantly increased birefringence (0.15@546 nm), which is approximately 30 times higher than the prototype Ba2TiOSi2O7 (0.005@546 nm). Our research has not only revitalized the potential of the fresnoite mineral for the development of new high&#8208;performance UV nonlinear optical materials but has also provided a clearly defined roadmap for the efficient exploration of novel structure&#8208;driven functional materials with targeted properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Transcytosis&#8208;Based Renal Tubular Reabsorption of Luminescent Gold Nanoparticles for Enhanced Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transcytosis&#8208;based tubular reabsorption of endogenous proteins is a well&#8208;known energy&#8208;saving pathway that prevents nutrient loss. However, utilization of this well&#8208;known reabsorption pathway for the delivery of exogenous nanodrugs remains a challenge. In this study, using the surface mimic strategy of a specific PEPT1/2&#8208;targeted Gly&#8208;Sar peptide as a ligand, renal&#8208;clearable luminescent gold nanoparticles (P&#8208;AuNPs) were developed as protein mimics to investigate the transcytosis&#8208;based tubular reabsorption of exogenous substances. By regulating the influential factors (H+ content in tubular lumens and PEPT1/2 transporter counts in tubular cells) of Gly&#8208;Sar&#8208;mediated transcytosis, the specific and efficient interaction between P&#8208;AuNPs and renal tubular cells was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Efficient transcellular transportation significantly guided the reabsorption of P&#8208;AuNPs back into the bloodstream, which enhanced the blood concentration and bioavailability of nanoparticles, contributing to high&#8208;contrast tumor imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Biology&#8208;based Construction of Unnatural Perylenequinones with Improved Photodynamic Anticancer Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of structural complexity and diversity of natural products is crucial for drug discovery and development. To overcome high dark toxicity and poor photostability of natural photosensitizer perylenequinones (PQs) for photodynamic therapy, herein, we aim to introduce the structural complexity and diversity to biosynthesize the desired unnatural PQs in fungus Cercospora through synthetic biology&#8208;based strategy. Thus, we first elucidate the intricate biosynthetic pathways of class B PQs and reveal how the branching enzymes create their structural complexity and diversity from a common ancestor. This enables the rational reprogramming of cercosporin biosynthetic pathway in Cercospora to generate diverse unnatural PQs without chemical modification. Among them, unnatural cercosporin A displays remarkably low dark toxicity and high photostability with retention of great photodynamic anticancer and antimicrobial activities. Moreover,&#160;it is found that, unlike cercosporin, the unnatural cercosporin A could be selectively accumulated in cancer cells, providing potential targets for drug development. Therefore, this work provides a comprehensive foundation for preparing unnatural products with customized functions through synthetic biology&#8208;based strategies, thus facilitating drug discovery pipelines from nature.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein present an approach of photo&#8208;induced disproportionation for preparation of Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents. As a proof of concept, BODIPY&#8208;based photosensitizers were rationally designed and prepared. The photo&#8208;induced intermolecular electron transfer between homotypic chromophores leads to the disproportionation reaction, resulting in the formation of charged intermediates, cationic and anionic radicals. The cationic radicals efficiently oxidize the cellar important coenzyme, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), and the anionic radicals transfer electrons to oxygen to produce superoxide radicals (O2&#8722;&#8226;). One of our Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents that not only self&#8208;assembles in water but also effectively targets the endoplasmic reticulum. It displayed excellent photocytotoxicity even in highly hypoxic environments (2% O2), with a half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.96 &#956;M, and demonstrated outstanding antitumor efficacy in murine models bearing HeLa tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>H* Species Regulation by Mn&#8208;Co(OH)2 for Efficient Nitrate Electro&#8208;Reduction in Neutral Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the electrocatalytic NO3&#8208; reduction reaction (NO3&#8208;RR) under neutral condition, the activation of H2O to generate H* and the inhibition of inter&#8208;H* species binding, are critically important but remain challenging for suppressing the non&#8208;desirable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a Mn&#8208;doped Co(OH)2 (named as Mn&#8208;Co(OH)2) has been synthesized by in situ reconstruction in the electrolyte, which is able to dissociate H2O molecules but inhibits the binding of H* species between each other owing to the increased interatomic spacing by the Mn&#8208;doping. The Mn&#8208;Co(OH)2 electrocatalyst offers a faradaic efficiency (FE) of as high as 98.9 &#177; 1.7% at &#8208;0.6 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an energy efficiency (EE) of 49.90 &#177; 1.03% for NH3 production by NO3&#8208;RR, which are among the highest of the recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts in neutral electrolyte. Moreover, negligible degradation at &#8208;200 mA cm&#8208;2 has been found for at least 500 hours, which is the longest catalytic durations ever reported. This work paves a novel approach for the design and synthesis of efficient NO3&#8208;RR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactivatable Engineering of CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;Inducible DNAzyme Probe for In Situ Imaging of Nuclear Zinc Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNAzyme&#8208;based fluorescence probes for imaging metal ions in living cells have received much attention recently. However, employing in situ metal ions imaging within subcellular organelles, such as nucleus, remains a significant challenge. We developed a three&#8208;stranded DNAzyme probe (TSDP) that contained a 20&#8208;base pair recognition site of a CRISPR/Cas9, which blocks the DNAzyme activity. When Cas9, with its specialized nuclear localization function, forms an active complex with sgRNA within the cell nucleus, it cleaves the TSDP at the recognition site, resulting in the in&#8208;situ formation of catalytic DNAzyme structure. With this design, the CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;inducible imaging of nuclear Zn2+ is demonstrated in living cells. Moreover, the superiority of CRISPR&#8208;DNAzyme for spatiotemporal control imaging was highlighted by integrating it with photoactivation strategy and Boolean logic gate for dynamic monitoring nuclear Zn2+ in both HeLa cells and mice. Collectively, this conceptual design expands the DNAzyme toolbox for visualizing nuclear metal ions and thus provides new perspectives to nuclear metal&#8208;associated biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking the Impact of Koch&#8208;Carbonylated Organics During the Zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 Catalyzed Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A methanol&#8208;based economy offers an efficient solution to current energy transition challenges, where the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) process would be a key enabler in yielding synthetic fuels/chemicals from renewable sources. Despite its original discovery over half a century ago over the zeolite ZSM&#8208;5, the practical application of this process in a CO2&#8208;neutral scenario has faced several obstacles. One prominent challenge has been the intricate mechanistic complexities inherent in the MTH process over the zeolite ZSM&#8208;5, impeding its widespread adoption. This work takes a significant step forward by providing critical insights that bridge the gap in our understanding of the MTH process. It accomplishes this by connecting the (Koch&#8208;carbonylation&#8208;led) direct and dual cycle mechanisms, which operate during the early and steady&#8208;state phases of MTH catalysis, respectively. To unravel these mechanistic intricacies, we have performed catalytic and operando (i.e., UV&#8208;Vis coupled with an online mass spectrometer) and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic&#8208;based investigations on the MTH process, involving co&#8208;feeding methanol and acetone (cf. a key Koch&#8208;carbonylated species), including selective isotope&#8208;labeling studies. Our iterative research approach revealed that (Koch&#8208;)carbonyl group selectively promotes the side&#8208;chain mechanism within the arene cycle of the dual cycle mechanism, impacting the preferential formation of BTX fraction (i.e., benzene&#8208;toluene&#8208;xylene) primarily.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Tertiary amino acid derivatives constitute one of the most frequently occurring units in natural products and bioactive molecules. However, the efficient asymmetric synthesis of this motif still remains a significant challenge. Herein, we disclose a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive addition reaction of ketimine using &#945;&#8208;chloro carbonyl compound as a radical precursor, providing expedient access to a diverse array of enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;quaternary amino acid analogues. This protocol exhibits outstanding enantioselectivity and broad substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance. Preliminary mechanism studies rule out the possibility of Reformatsky&#8208;type addition and confirm the involvement of radical species in stereoselective addition process. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated through the rapid assembly of iterative amino acid units and oligopeptide, showcasing its versatile platform for late&#8208;stage modification of drug candidates.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible thermoelectric devices of nanomaterials have shown a great potential for applications in wearable to remotely located electronics with desired shapes and geometries. Continuous powering up the low power flexible electronics is a major challenge. &#160;We are reporting a flexible thermoelectric module prepared from silver telluride (Ag2Te) nanowires (NWs), which are chemically transformed from uniquely synthesized and scalable tellurium (Te) NWs. Conducting Ag2Te NWs composites have shown an ultralow total thermal conductivity ~ 0.22 W/mK surpassing the bulk melt&#8208;grown Ag2Te ~ 1.23 W/mK at ~ 300 K, which is attributed to the nanostructuring of the material. Flexible thermoelectric device consisting of 4 legs (n&#8208;type) of Ag2Te NWs on polyvinylidene fluoride membrane displays a significant output voltage (Voc) ~ 2.3 mV upon human touch and Voc ~ 18 mV at temperature gradient, DT ~ 50 K, which shows the importance of NWs based flexible thermoelectric devices to power up the low power wearable electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Anion Zinc Salt Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase Enabled Long&#8208;Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Bromine Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic additives with high&#8208;reduction potentials are generally applied in aqueous electrolytes to stabilize the Zn anode, while compromise safety and environmental compatibility. Highly concentrated water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes have been proposed to realize the high reversibility of Zn plating/stripping; however, their high cost and viscosity hinder their practical applications. Therefore, exploring low&#8208;concentration Zn salts, that can be used directly to stabilize Zn anodes, is of primary importance. Herein, we developed an asymmetric anion group, bi(difluoromethanesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (DFTFSI&#8208;)&#8208;based novel zinc salt, Zn(DFTFSI)2, to obtain a high ionic conductivity and a highly stable dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. Experimental tests and theoretical calculations verified that DFTFSI&#8208; in the Zn2+ solvation sheath and inner Helmholtz plane would be preferentially reduced to construct layer&#8208;structured SEI films, inhibiting hydrogen evolution and side reactions. Consequently, the Zn&#448;&#448;Zn symmetric cell with 1M Zn(DFTFSI)2 aqueous electrolyte delivers an ultralong cycle life for &gt;2500 h outperforming many other conventional Zn salt electrolytes. The Zn&#448;&#448;Br2 battery also exhibits a long lifespan over 1200 cycles at ~99.8% Coulombic efficiency with a high capacity retention of 92.5%. Furthermore, this outstanding performance translates well to a high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn&#448;&#448;Br2 battery (~5.6 mAh&#183;cm&#8208;2), cycling over 320 cycles with 95.3% initial capacity retained.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Organic additives with high-reduction potentials are generally applied in aqueous electrolytes to stabilize the Zn anode, while compromise safety and environmental compatibility. Highly concentrated water-in-salt electrolytes have been proposed to realize the high reversibility of Zn plating/stripping; however, their high cost and viscosity hinder their practical applications. Therefore, exploring low-concentration Zn salts, that can be used directly to stabilize Zn anodes, is of primary importance. Herein, we developed an asymmetric anion group, bi(difluoromethanesulfonyl)(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (DFTFSI-)-based novel zinc salt, Zn(DFTFSI)2, to obtain a high ionic conductivity and a highly stable dendrite-free Zn anode. Experimental tests and theoretical calculations verified that DFTFSI- in the Zn2+ solvation sheath and inner Helmholtz plane would be preferentially reduced to construct layer-structured SEI films, inhibiting hydrogen evolution and side reactions. Consequently, the Zn&#448;&#448;Zn symmetric cell with 1M Zn(DFTFSI)2 aqueous electrolyte delivers an ultralong cycle life for &amp;gt;2500 h outperforming many other conventional Zn salt electrolytes. The Zn&#448;&#448;Br2 battery also exhibits a long lifespan over 1200 cycles at ~99.8% Coulombic efficiency with a high capacity retention of 92.5%. Furthermore, this outstanding performance translates well to a high-areal-capacity Zn&#448;&#448;Br2 battery (~5.6 mAh&#183;cm-2), cycling over 320 cycles with 95.3% initial capacity retained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks in Semiconductor Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a specific class of hybrid, crystalline, nano&#8208;porous materials made of metal&#8208;ion&#8208;based &#8216;nodes&#8217; and organic linkers. Most of the studies on MOFs largely focused on porosity, chemical and structural diversity, gas sorption, sensing, drug delivery, catalysis, and separation applications. In contrast, much less reports paid attention to understanding and tuning the electrical properties of MOFs. Poor electrical conductivity of MOFs (~10&#8208;7 &#8211; 10&#8208;10 Scm&#8208;1), reported in earlier studies, impeded their applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and renewable energy storage. To overcome this drawback, the MOF community has adopted several intriguing strategies for electronic applications. The present review focuses on creatively designed bulk MOFs and surface&#8208;anchored MOFs (SURMOFs) with different metal nodes (from transition metals to lanthanides), ligand functionalities, and doping entities, allowing tuning and enhancement of electrical conductivity. Diverse platforms for MOFs&#8208;based electronic device fabrications, conductivity measurements, and underlying charge transport mechanisms are also addressed. Overall, the review highlights the pros and cons of MOFs&#8208;based electronics (MOFtronics), followed by an analysis of the future directions of research, including optimization of the MOF compositions, heterostructures, electrical contacts, device stacking, and further relevant options which can be of interest for MOF researchers and result in improved devices performance.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organocopper(III) Fluoride Triggering C&#8722;CF3 Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocopper(III) fluoride, [PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3F] (2), has been isolated and authenticated. Despite its stability, 2 reacts with alkynylsilanes leading to industrially relevant trifluoromethylalkynes (RC&#8801;CCF3). Mechanistic investigations, including the trapping of [PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3(C&#8801;CPh)] (4a), validates the operability of a CuI/CuIII redox shuttle in oxidative C&#8722;C couplings occurring through hitherto elusive organocopper(III) fluorides.







Abstract
Copper(III) fluorides are catalytically competent, yet elusive, intermediates in cross&#8208;coupling. The synthesis of [PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3F] (2), the first stable (isolable) CuIII&#8722;F, was accomplished via chloride addition to [CuIII(CF3)3(py)] (1) yielding [PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3Cl(py)] (1&#8901;Cl), followed by treatment with AgF. The CuIII halides 1&#8901;Cl and 2 were fully characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (Sc&#8208;XRD) and elemental analysis (EA). Complex 2 proved capable of forging C&#8722;CF3 bonds from silyl&#8208;capped alkynes. In&#8208;depth mechanistic studies combining probes, theoretical calculations, trapping of intermediate 4a ([PPh4][CuIII(CF3)3(C&#8801;CPh)]) and radical tests unveil the key role of the CuIII acetylides that undergo facile 2e&#8722; reductive elimination furnishing the trifluoromethylated alkynes (RC&#8801;CCF3), which are industrially relevant synthons in drug discovery, pharma and agrochemistry.

         <title>Rational Design of L&#8208;RNA Aptamer&#8208;Peptide Conjugate for Efficient Cell Uptake and G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;Mediated Gene Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel strategy for transporting L&#8208;RNA aptamers that target rG4s into the cytosol using cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs). Polyarginine residues (R8) were covalently attached to the L&#8208;aptamer by click chemistry and the first L&#8208;RNA aptamer&#8208;CPP conjugate (Tamra_Ahx_R8_L&#8208;Apt.4&#8208;1c) was generated. Our study demonstrates that Tamra_Ahx_R8_L&#8208;Apt.4&#8208;1c functions as an effective tool for regulating rG4&#8208;mediated gene expression.







Abstract
RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (D&#8208;rG4s) are prevalent in the transcriptome and play crucial regulatory roles in various biological processes. Recently, L&#8208;RNA aptamers have been reported to recognize functional rG4s with a strong binding affinity and specificity. However, owing to the poor cell penetration capacity of L&#8208;RNA aptamers, their biological applications are currently limited. Herein, we rationally design an L&#8208;RNA aptamer&#8208;peptide conjugate, Tamra_Ahx_R8_L&#8208;Apt.4&#8208;1c, which can efficiently translocate into the cytosol and target the rG4 of interest. Notably, we demonstrate diverse regulatory roles of Tamra_Ahx_R8_L&#8208;Apt.4&#8208;1c on rG4 motif present in different regions of mRNAs and further expand the application in different cell lines. Our novel and biocompatible conjugate enhances the cellular uptake of the L&#8208;RNA aptamer, and our robust strategy enables non&#8208;canonical RNA structures to be targeted by L&#8208;RNA aptamers for gene control in cells.

         <title>Pivotal Role of Geometry Regulation on O&#8722;O Bond Formation Mechanism of Bimetallic Water Oxidation Catalysts</title>

Does proximity make a difference? The progression of O&#8722;O bond formation through an oxyl/hydroxide coupling in water oxidation catalyzed by Cu2 complexes is greatly influenced by the catalyst's geometry.







Abstract
In this study, we highlight the impact of catalyst geometry on the formation of O&#8722;O bonds in Cu2 and Fe2 catalysts. A series of Cu2 complexes with diverse linkers are designed as electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Interestingly, the catalytic performance of these Cu2 complexes is enhanced as their molecular skeletons become more rigid, which contrasts with the behavior observed in our previous investigation with Fe2 analogs. Moreover, mechanistic studies reveal that the reactivity of the bridging O atom results in distinct pathways for O&#8722;O bond formation in Cu2 and Fe2 catalysts. In Cu2 systems, the coupling takes place between a terminal CuIII&#8722;OH and a bridging &#956;&#8722;O&#8901; radical. Whereas in Fe2 systems, it involves the coupling of two terminal Fe&#8211;oxo entities. Furthermore, an in&#8208;depth structure&#8211;activity analysis uncovers the spatial geometric prerequisites for the coupling of the terminal OH with the bridging &#956;&#8722;O&#8901; radical, ultimately leading to the O&#8722;O bond formation. Overall, this study emphasizes the critical role of precisely adjusting the spatial geometry of catalysts to align with the O&#8722;O bonding pathway.

         <title>Sulfonium Rearrangements Enable the Direct Preparation of Sulfenyl Imidinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;accelerated sulfonium rearrangement using simple amides establishes a direct route to sulfenyl imidinium salts, bearing two distinct electrophilic centers and three contiguous stereocenters, formed with high selectivity. Concurrently, access to versatile 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl or sulfonolactone motifs is established.







Abstract
Sulfenyl imidinium salts are a virtually unexplored class of intermediates in organic chemistry. Herein, we demonstrate how sulfonium rearrangements can be deployed to access these versatile synthetic intermediates, bearing three contiguous (and congested) stereogenic centers, with high levels of selectivity. The synthetic value of the scaffold was unraveled by selective transformations into a range of building blocks, including 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives and sulfonolactones.

         <title>Activation of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 Signaling and Inhibition of CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; Checkpoint with a Dual siRNA&#8208;Assembled Nanoadjuvant for Robust Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an RNA nanoadjuvant loaded with densely packed siRNA and covered with cationic liposomes. With high&#8208;order RNA structure, it works like an RNA virus to robustly activate RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 signaling to drive the maturation of APCs. Moreover, dual gene silencing of CD47 in tumor cells and SIRP&#945; in APCs leads to efficient inhibition of the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; checkpoint, thereby enhancing the phagocytosis of tumor cells by APCs for cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) play a crucial role in the anti&#8208;tumor immunity as they are responsible for capturing, processing, and presenting tumor antigens to T cells. However, their activation is often limited by the absence of adjuvants and the suppressive effects of immune checkpoints, such as CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945;. Herein, we present a nanoadjuvant that is self&#8208;assembled from long RNA building blocks generated through rolling circle transcription (RCT) reaction and further modified with cationic liposomes. Owing to the high load of densely packed RNA, this nanoadjuvant could robustly activate RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 signaling in APCs, leading to the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) toward an anti&#8208;tumor M1&#8208;like phenotype. In addition, with a well&#8208;designed template, the generated long RNA from RCT reaction includes two kinds of siRNA targeting both CD47 in tumor cells and SIRP&#945; in APCs. This dual gene silencing results in efficient inhibition of the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; checkpoint. Collectively, the robust activation of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 signaling and efficient inhibition of CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; checkpoint enhance the phagocytic activity of APCs, which in turn promotes the cross&#8208;priming of effector T cells and the activation of anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. This study therefore provides a simple and robust RNA nanoadjuvant for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Helicoselective Synthesis of Indolohelicenoids through Organocatalytic Central&#8208;to&#8208;Helical Chirality Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral&#8208;phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition&#8208;elimination cascade reaction was developed to access chiral azahelicenoid skeletons. This convergent approach offers an organocatalytic helicoselective route to obtain indolohelicenoids with high enantioselectivity. The prepared indolohelicenoids display positive photophysical and chiroptical properties, showcasing their potential utility in organic photoelectric materials.







Abstract
We report the helicoselective and convergent construction of indolohelicenoids with excellent efficiency and stereocontrol. This reaction proceeds through a chiral&#8208;phosphoric&#8208;acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cycloaddition and eliminative aromatization sequence, which can be finely controlled by adjusting the reaction temperature. Mechanistic studies reveal that the chiral phosphoric acid cooperatively serves as both a bifunctional and Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst, enabling one&#8208;pot central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality conversion. Additionally, the optical properties of the synthesized indolohelicenoids were characterized to explore their potential applications in organic photoelectric materials.

         <title>A Single Set of Well&#8208;Designed Aptamer Probes for Reliable On&#8208;site Qualitative and Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Quantitative Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aptasensor was developed with supersandwich DNA (SSW&#8208;DNA) modified on the outer surface of nanochannels with hydrophobic inner walls realizing the reliable on&#8208;site qualitative and laboratory ultra&#8208;sensitive quantitative detection of MC&#8211;LR. This work highlights the enhanced performance and broader applicability based on the well&#8208;designed single set of probes and nanochannels.







Abstract
Aptamer&#8208;based probes are pivotal components in various sensing strategies, owing to their exceptional specificity and versatile programmable structure. Nevertheless, numerous aptamer&#8208;based probes usually offer only a single function, limiting their capacity to meet the diverse requirements of multi&#8208;faceted sensing systems. Here, we introduced supersandwich DNA probes (SSW&#8208;DNA), designed and modified on the outer surface of nanochannels with hydrophobic inner walls, enabling dual functionality: qualitative detection for on&#8208;site analysis and quantitative detection for precise analysis. The fragmented DNAs resulting from the target recognition, are subsequently identified through lateral flow assays, enabling robust on&#8208;site qualitative detection of microcystin&#8208;LR with an impressively low limit of detection (LOD) at 0.01&#8197;&#956;g/L. Meanwhile, the nanochannels enable highly sensitive quantification of microcystin&#8208;LR through the current analysis, achieving an exceptionally low LOD at 2.5&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;&#956;g/L, with a broad dynamic range spanning from 1&#215;10&#8722;6 to 1&#215;102&#8197;&#956;g/L. Furthermore, the process of target recognition introduces just a single potential error propagation, which reduces the overall risk of errors during the entire qualitative and quantitative detection process. This sensing strategy broadens the scope of applications for aptamer&#8208;based composite probes, holding promising implications across diverse fields, such as medical diagnosis, food safety, and environmental protection.

         <dc:description>
The spiro[3.3]heptane core, with the non&#8208;coplanar exit vectors, was shown to be a saturated benzene bioisostere. This scaffold was incorporated into the anticancer drug sonidegib (instead of the meta&#8208;benzene), the anticancer drug vorinostat (instead of the phenyl ring), and the anesthetic drug benzocaine (instead of the para&#8208;benzene). The patent&#8208;free saturated analogs obtained showed a high potency in the corresponding biological assays.

         <title>Iminothioindoxyl Donors with Exceptionally High Cross Section for Protein Vibrational Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To observe site selective vibrational energy transfer (VET) in proteins in ultrafast pump probe experiments, an energy donor is required to inject vibrational energy. The only known donor amino acid azulenylalanine (AzAla) suffers from a low Vis extinction coefficient. Here, two novel iminothioindoxyl (ITI) based donor amino acids were introduced with a 50 times higher Vis extinction coefficient to reach superior VET signal intensities.







Abstract
Various protein functions are related to vibrational energy transfer (VET) as an important mechanism. The underlying transfer pathways can be experimentally followed by ultrafast Vis&#8208;pump/IR&#8208;probe spectroscopy with a donor&#8208;sensor pair of non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs) incorporated in a protein. However, so far only one donor ncAA, azulenylalanine (AzAla), exists, which suffers from a comparably low Vis extinction coefficient. Here, we introduce two novel donor ncAAs based on an iminothioindoxyl (ITI) chromophore. The dimethylamino&#8208;ITI (DMA&#8208;ITI) and julolidine&#8208;ITI (J&#8208;ITI) moieties overcome the limitation of AzAla with a 50 times higher Vis extinction coefficient. While ITI moieties are known for ultrafast photoswitching, DMA&#8208;ITI and J&#8208;ITI exclusively form a hot ground state on the sub&#8208;ps timescale instead, which is essential for their usage as vibrational energy donor. In VET measurements of donor&#8208;sensor dipeptides we investigate the performance of the new donors. We observe 20 times larger signals compared to the established AzAla donor, which opens unprecedented possibilities for the study of VET in proteins.

         <title>Precisely Manipulating Molecular Packing via Tuning Alkyl Side&#8208;Chain Topology Enabling High&#8208;Performance Nonfused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a series of low&#8208;cost nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) with precisely regulated alkyl side&#8208;chains. It is found that tuning the topology of alkyl side&#8208;chains can effectively manipulate molecular assemble. Hence, the NFREA DPA&#8208;4 with asymmetric alkyl side&#8208;chains exhibits a tight packing and high crystallinity, thus contributing to improved electron mobility and boosted power conversion efficiency (16.67&#8201;%).







Abstract
In the development of high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs), the self&#8208;organization of organic semiconductors plays a crucial role. This study focuses on the precisely manipulation of molecular assemble via tuning alkyl side&#8208;chain topology in a series of low&#8208;cost nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs). Among the three NFREAs investigated, DPA&#8208;4, which possesses an asymmetric alkyl side&#8208;chain length, exhibits a tight packing in the crystal and high crystallinity in the film, contributing to improved electron mobility and favorable film morphology for DPA&#8208;4. As a result, the OSC device based on DPA&#8208;4 achieves an excellent power conversion efficiency of 16.67&#8201;%, ranking among the highest efficiencies for NFREA&#8208;based OSCs.

         <title>Structural Distortion in the Wadsley&#8208;Roth Niobium Molybdenum Oxide Phase Triggering Extraordinarily Stable Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relief of octahedral distortion in niobium molybdenum oxides during cycling enhances the structural stability of battery active materials, resulting in an exceptional cycle lifespan of 15,000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A g&#8722;1. This mechanism offers new insights into stabilizing the material structures of Wadsley&#8208;Roth oxides for significantly prolonged battery life.







Abstract
Wadsley&#8208;Roth niobium oxide phases have attracted extensive research interest recently as promising battery anodes. We have synthesized the niobium&#8208;molybdenum oxide shear phase (Nb, Mo)13O33 with superior electrochemical Li&#8208;ion storage performance, including an ultralong cycling lifespan of at least 15000&#8197;cycles. During electrochemical cycling, a reversible single&#8208;phase solid&#8208;solution reaction with lithiated intermediate solid solutions is demonstrated using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, with the valence and short&#8208;range structural changes of the electrode probed by in situ Nb and Mo K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. This work reveals that the superior stability of niobium molybdenum oxides is underpinned by changes in octahedral distortion during electrochemical reactions, and we report an in&#8208;depth understanding of how this stabilizes the oxide structure during cycling with implications for future long&#8208;life battery material design.

         <title>Reconstructed Bismuth Oxide through in situ Carbonation by Carbonate&#8208;containing Electrolyte for Highly Active Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbonate in the electrolyte was found to affect the chemical evolution of the catalyst and further lead to changes in the catalyst performance. Especially, the Bi2O3 with weak CO32&#8722; adsorption underwent an in situ carbonation to form surface Bi2O2CO3 layer in CO2 purged KOH electrolyte. The reconstructed Bi2O2CO3/Bi2O3 heterostructure with strong electron interaction served as a highly active structure and promoted the formation of formate.







Abstract
The catalyst&#8208;reconstruction makes it challenging to clarify the practical active sites and unveil the actual reaction mechanism during the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR). However, currently the impact of the electrolyte microenvironment in which the electrolyte is in contact with the catalyst is overlooked and might induce a chemical evolution, thus confusing the reconstruction process and mechanism. In this work, the carbonate adsorption properties of metal oxides were investigated, and the mechanism of how the electrolyte carbonate affect the chemical evolution of catalysts were discussed. Notably, Bi2O3 with weak carbonate adsorption underwent a chemical reconstruction to form the Bi2O2CO3/Bi2O3 heterostructure. Furthermore, in situ and ex situ characterizations unveiled the formation mechanism of the heterostructure. The in situ formed Bi2O2CO3/Bi2O3 heterostructure with strong electron interaction served as the highly active structure for CO2RR, achieving a formate Faradaic efficiency of 98.1&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8 Vvs RHE. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the significantly tuned p&#8208;orbit electrons of the Bi sites in Bi2O2CO3/Bi2O3 optimized the adsorption of the intermediate and lowered the energy barrier for the formation of *OCHO. This work elucidates the mechanism of electrolyte microenvironment for affecting catalyst reconstruction, which contributes to the understanding of reconstruction process and clarification of the actual catalytic structure.

         <title>Phase Behavior of Charged Star Block Copolymers at Fluids Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase behavior of star block copolymers (s&#8208;BCPs) with a polystyrene (PS) core and a poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P2VP) as corona was investigated at the water/toluene interface. The morphology of the s&#8208;BCPs was hexagonal&#8208;packed nanoporous film with s&#8208;BCP comprising the matrix. The morphology of linear BCPs were found to be inverted, where hexagonally packed rigid spherical micelles of BCP formed multilayer.







Abstract
The phase behavior of block copolymers (BCPs) at the water&#8208;oil interface is influenced by the segmental interaction parameter (
) and chain architecture. We synthesized a series of star block copolymers (s&#8208;BCPs) having polystyrene (PS) as core and poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P2VP) as corona. The interaction parameters of block&#8208;block (
PS&#8208;P2VP) and block&#8208;solvent (
P2VP&#8208;solvent) were varied by adjusting the pH of the aqueous solution. Lowering pH increased the fraction of quaternized&#8208;P2VP (Q&#8208;P2VP) with enhanced hydrophilicity. By transferring the equilibrated interfacial assemblies, morphologies ranging from bicontinuous films at pH of 7 and 3.1 to nanoporous and nanotubular structure at pH of 0.65 were observed. The nanoporous films formed hexagonally packed pores in s&#8208;BCP matrix, while nanotubes comprised Q&#8208;P2VP as corona and PS as core. Control over pore size, d&#8208;spacing between pores, and nanotube diameters was achieved by varying polymer concentration, molecular weight, volume fraction and arm number of s&#8208;BCPs. Large&#8208;scale nanoporous films were obtained by freeze&#8208;drying emulsions. Remarkably, the morphologies of linear BCPs were inverted, forming hexagonal&#8208;packed rigid spherical micelles with Q&#8208;P2VP as core and PS as corona in multilayer. This work provides insights of phase behaviors of BCP at fluids interface and offer a facile approach to prepare nanoporous film with well&#8208;controlled pore structure.

&lt;sub&gt;P2VP-solvent&lt;/sub&gt;) were varied by adjusting the pH of the aqueous solution. Lowering pH increased the fraction of quaternized-P2VP (Q-P2VP) with enhanced hydrophilicity. By transferring the equilibrated interfacial assemblies, morphologies ranging from bicontinuous films at pH of 7 and 3.1 to nanoporous and nanotubular structure at pH of 0.65 were observed. The nanoporous films formed hexagonally packed pores in s-BCP matrix, while nanotubes comprised Q-P2VP as corona and PS as core. Control over pore size, d-spacing between pores, and nanotube diameters was achieved by varying polymer concentration, molecular weight, volume fraction and arm number of s-BCPs. Large-scale nanoporous films were obtained by freeze-drying emulsions. Remarkably, the morphologies of linear BCPs were inverted, forming hexagonal-packed rigid spherical micelles with Q-P2VP as core and PS as corona in multilayer. This work provides insights of phase behaviors of BCP at fluids interface and offer a facile approach to prepare nanoporous film with well-controlled pore structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intermediate Color Emission via Nanographenes with Organic Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanographenes (NGs) produced by top&#8208;down methods carry multiple functional groups. We utilized this aspect for the reproduction of purple light by adding red&#8208; and blue&#8208;light emitting fluorophores. Based on our results, NGs can be utilized as carriers of fluorophores capable of generating intermediate colors of light.







Abstract
Photoluminescence (PL) color can be tuned by mixing fluorophores emitting the three primary colors in an appropriate ratio. When color tuning is achieved on a single substrate, we can simplify device structures. We demonstrated that nanographenes (NGs), which are graphene fragments with a size of tens of nanometers, could be utilized as carriers of fluorophores. The addition of red&#8208; and blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting fluorophores on the edge successfully reproduced the purple light. The relative PL intensities of the fluorophores could be regulated by the excitation wavelength, enabling multicolor emission between blue and red light. Owing to the triphenylamine units of the fluorophores, the NGs showed PL enhancement due to aggregation. This characteristic was valuable for the fabrication of solid polymer materials. Specifically, the functionalized NGs can be dispersed into polyvinylidene difluoride. The resultant polymer films emitted red, blue, and purple color. Our study demonstrated the potential applicability of NGs for fluorophore carriers capable of reproducing intermediate colors of light.

         <title>Low&#8208;Electronegativity Cationic High&#8208;Entropy Doping to Trigger Stable Anion Redox Activity for High&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;Free Layered Cathodes in Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;electronegativity cationic high&#8208;entropy doping strategy was proposed to achieve significantly improved properties than that of commercial NCM&#8208;811. Configurational disorder originated from high&#8208;entropy doping in transition metal (TM) layer provides higher structure stability to trigger anion redox activity while electron transfer induced by applying TM dopants with lower electronegativity provides higher anion redox activity.







Abstract
LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM&#8208;811) exhibits the highest capacity in commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), and the high Ni content (80&#8201;%) provides the only route for high energy density. However, the cationic structure instability arisen from the increase of Ni content (&gt;80&#8201;%) limits the further increase of the capacity, and inevitable O2 release related to anionic structure instability hinders the utilization of anion redox activity. Here, by comparing various combinations of high&#8208;entropy dopants substituted Co element, we propose a low&#8208;electronegativity cationic high&#8208;entropy doping strategy to fabricate the high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free layered cathode (LiNi0.8Mn0.12Al0.02Ti0.02Cr0.02Fe0.02O2) that exhibits much higher capacity and cycling stability. Configurational disorder originated from cationic high&#8208;entropy doping in transition metal (TM) layer, anchors the oxidized lattice oxygen ((O2)n&#8722;) to preserve high (O2)n&#8722; content, triggering the anion redox activity. Electron transfer induced by applying TM dopants with lower electronegativity than that of Co element, increases the electron density of O in TM&#8208;O octahedron (TM&#8208;O6) configuration to reach higher (O2)n&#8722; content, resulting in the higher anion redox activity. With exploring the stabilization effect on both cations and anions of high&#8208;entropy doping and low&#8208;electronegativity cationic modified anion redox activity, we propose an innovative and variable pathway for rationally tuning the properties of commercial cathodes.

         <title>A Triply Linked Porphyrin&#8722;Norcorrole Hybrid with Singlet Diradical Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Norcorrole Ni(II) complexes have recently received considerable attention because they are readily accessible antiaromatic molecules. Their high stability under ambient conditions and ease of synthesis have enabled the exploration of the intrinsic properties of antiaromatic molecules. Here, we report the synthesis and properties of&#160;meso&#8722;meso&#160;singly linked porphyrin&#8722;norcorrole hybrids&#160;and a triply linked porphyrin&#8722;norcorrole hybrid. The singly linked and triply linked porphyrin&#8722;norcorrole hybrids were fully characterized, including an X&#8208;ray structural analysis. Due to their orthogonal conformation, the singly linked hybrids maintain the individual electronic properties of their porphyrin and norcorrole subunits, while the triply linked hybrid shows a significantly smaller electrochemical HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (0.45 eV) than that of Ni(II) dimesitylnorcorrole (1.08 eV). Furthermore, the triply linked hybrid exhibits singlet diradical characteristics, as confirmed by VT&#8208;NMR, ESR, and SQUID experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromatic Ketones as Mild Presodiating Reagents toward Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical presodiation (CP) is an effective strategy to enhance energy density of sodium ion batteries. However, the sodiation reagents reported so far are basically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) wth low reductive potential (~0.1 V vs. Na+/Na), which could easily cause over&#8208;sodiation and structural deterioration of the presodiated cathodes. In this work, Aromatic ketones (AKs) are rationally designed as mild presodiating reagents by introducing a carbonyl group (C=O) into PAHs to balance the conjugated and inductive effect. As the representatives, two compounds 9&#8208;Fluorenoneb (9&#8208;FN) and Benzophenone (BP) manifest favorable equilibrium potential of 1.55 V and 1.07 V (vs. Na+/Na), respectively. Note that 9&#8208;FN demonstrates versatile presodiating capability toward multiple Na uptake hosts (tunneled Na0.44MnO2, layered Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, polyanionic Na4Fe2.91(PO4)2P2O7, Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3), enabling greatly improved initial charging capacity of the cathode to balance the irrevisible capacity of the anode. Our results indicate that the Aromatic ketones are competitive presodiating cathodic reagents for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and will inspire more studies and application attempts in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Global Reactivity Profiling of the Catalytic Lysine in Human Kinome for Covalent Inhibitor Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advances in targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) have been made by using lysine&#8208;reactive chemistries. Few aminophiles possessing balanced reactivity/stability for the development of cell&#8208;active TCIs are however available. We report herein lysine&#8208;reactive activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs; 2&#8208;14) based on the chemistry of aryl fluorosulfates (ArOSO2F) capable of global reactivity profiling of the catalytic lysine in human kinome from mammalian cells. We concurrently developed reversible covalent ABPs (15/16) by installing salicylaldehydes (SA) onto a promiscuous kinase&#8208;binding scaffold. The stability and amine reactivity of these probes exhibited a broad range of tunability. X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry (MS) confirmed the successful covalent engagement between ArOSO2F on 9 and the catalytic lysine of SRC kinase.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Advances in targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs) have been made by using lysine-reactive chemistries. Few aminophiles possessing balanced reactivity/stability for the development of cell-active TCIs are however available. We report herein lysine-reactive activity-based probes (ABPs; 2-14) based on the chemistry of aryl fluorosulfates (ArOSO2F) capable of global reactivity profiling of the catalytic lysine in human kinome from mammalian cells. We concurrently developed reversible covalent ABPs (15/16) by installing salicylaldehydes (SA) onto a promiscuous kinase-binding scaffold. The stability and amine reactivity of these probes exhibited a broad range of tunability. X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry (MS) confirmed the successful covalent engagement between ArOSO2F on 9 and the catalytic lysine of SRC kinase. Chemoproteomic studies enabled the profiling of &amp;gt;300 endogenous kinases, thus providing a global landscape of ligandable catalytic lysines of the kinome. By further introducing these aminophiles into VX-680 (a noncovalent inhibitor of AURKA kinase), we generated novel lysine-reactive TCIs that exhibited excellent in vitro potency and reasonable cellular activities with prolonged residence time. Our work serves as a general guide for the development of lysine-reactive ArOSO2F-based TCIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Direct Synthesis by Organic Acid&#8208;Etching and Reconstruction Disclosure as Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Chemically bonded MOFs on supports are desirable yet lacking in routine synthesis, as they may allow variable structural evolution and the underlying structure&#8208;activity relationship to be disclosed. Herein, direct MOF synthesis is achieved by an organic acid&#8208;etching strategy (AES). Using &#960;&#8208;conjugated ferrocene (Fc) dicarboxylic acid as the etching agent and organic ligand, a series of MFc&#8208;MOF (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Zn) nanosheets are synthesized on the metal supports. The crystal structure is studied using X&#8208;ray diffraction and low&#8208;dose transmission electron microscopy, which is quasi&#8208;lattice&#8208;matched with that of the metal, enabling in&#8208;situ MOF growth. Operando Raman and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy disclose that the NiFc&#8208;MOF features dynamic structural rebuilding during OER. The reconstructed one showing optimized electronic structures with an upshifted total d&#8208;band center, high M&#8208;O bonding state occupancy, and localized electrons on adsorbates indicated by density functional theory calculations, exhibits outstanding OER performance with a fairly low overpotential (130 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2) and good stability (144 h). The newly established approach for direct MOF synthesis and structural reconstruction disclosure stimulate the development of more prudent catalysts for advancing OER.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Sustaining Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Chemiluminophore for High&#8208;Contrast Activatable Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Afterglow imaging holds great promise for ultrasensitive bioimaging due to its elimination of autofluorescence. Self&#8208;sustaining afterglow molecules (SAMs), which enable all&#8208;in&#8208;one photon sensitization, chemical defect formation and afterglow generation, possess a simplified, reproducible, and efficient superiority over commonly used multi&#8208;component systems. However, there is a lack of SAMs, particularly those with much brighter near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission and structural flexibility for building high&#8208;contrast activatable imaging probes. To address these issues, this study for the first time reports a methylene blue derivative&#8208;based self&#8208;sustaining afterglow agent (SAN&#8722;M) with brighter NIR afterglow chemiluminescence peaking at 710 nm. By leveraging the structural flexibility and tunability, an activatable nanoprobe (SAN&#8722;MO) is customized for simultaneously activatable fluoro&#8208;photoacoustic and afterglow imaging of peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;), notably with a superior activation ratio of 4523 in the afterglow mode, which is at least an order of magnitude higher than other reported activatable afterglow systems. By virtue of the elimination of autofluorescence and ultrahigh activation contrast, SAN&#8722;MO enables early monitoring of the LPS&#8208;induced acute inflammatory response within 30 min upon LPS stimulation and precise image&#8208;guided resection of tiny metastatic tumors, which is unattainable for fluorescence imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Meltable Aluminum Molecular Rings with Fluorescence and Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystal&#8722;liquid&#8722;glass, which combines the tunable properties of crystalline compounds with the processability of glasses, has emerged as a new class of materials for fabricating bulk&#8208;shapable devices in real applications. Inspired by the characteristics of deep eutectic solvent (DES) mixtures involving significant depressions in melting points compared to their neat constituent components, in this study, we designed and synthesized the first examples of meltable aluminum oxo clusters (AlOCs) via lattice doping with DESs at the molecular level. The abundant and strong hydrogen bonding between the aluminum molecular ring, DES components, and lattice solvents is postulated to be the root that affords melting point depressions and, thus, &#8220;melting&#8221; clusters. We prepared a transparent bubble&#8208;free glass film under autogenous pressure using a hot&#8208;press method. These cluster&#8208;based films exhibited luminescent and nonlinear optical properties similar to those of pristine crystalline compounds. Our study belongs to the interdisciplinary disciplines of chemistry and physics. It not only breaks the limitations of crystalline glass on metal and ligand types but also acts as a general guide for extending the range of meltable crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Better Aptamers: Structured Library Approaches, Selection Methods, and Chemical Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) has been used to discover thousands of aptamers since its development in 1990. Aptamers are short single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotides capable of binding to targets with high specificity and selectivity through structural recognition. While aptamers offer advantages over other molecular recognition elements in their ease of production, smaller size, extended shelf&#8208;life, and lower immunogenicity, they have yet to show significant success in real&#8208;world applications. By analyzing the importance of structured library designs, reviewing different SELEX methodologies, and the effects of chemical modifications, we provide a comprehensive overview on the production of aptamers for applications in drug delivery systems, therapeutics, diagnostics, and molecular imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered anchor peptide LCI with a cobalt cofactor enhances oxidation efficiency of polystyrene microparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A typical component of polymer waste is polystyrene (PS) used in numerous applications, but degraded only slowly in the environment due to its hydrophobic properties. To increase the polarity and reactivity of polystyrene, polar groups need to be introduced. Here, biohybrid catalysts based on an engineered anchor peptide LCI_F16C are presented, which are capable of attaching to polystyrene microparticles and hydroxylating benzylic C&#8208;H bonds in polystyrene microparticles using commercially available oxone as oxidant. LCI peptides achieve a dense surface coverage of PS through monolayer formation within minutes in aqueous solutions at ambient temperature. The catalytically active cobalt cofactor Co&#8208;L1 or Co&#8208;L2 with a modified NNNN macrocyclic TACD ligand (TACD = 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane) is covalently bound to the anchor peptide LCI through a maleimide linker. Compared to the free cofactors, a 12&#8208; to 15&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic activity using biohybrid catalysts based on LCI_F16C was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>High Mobility Emissive Excimer Organic Semiconductor Towards Color&#8208;tunable Light&#8208;emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) are highly integrated and minimized optoelectronic devices with significant potential superiority in smart displays and optical communications. To realize these various applications, it is urgently needed for color&#8208;tunable emission in OLETs, but remains a great challenge as a result of the difficulty for designing organic semiconductors  simultaneously integrating high carrier mobility, strong solid&#8208;state emission, and the ability for potential tunable colors. Herein, a high mobility emissive excimer organic semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;anthryl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (2,7&#8208;DAF) was reasonably designed by introducing a rotatable carbon&#8211;carbon single bond connecting two anthracene groups at the 2,7&#8208;sites of fluorene, and the small torsion angles simultaneously guarantee effective conjugation and suppress fluorescence quenching. Indeed, the unique stable dimer arrangement and herringbone packing mode of 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal enables its superior integrated optoelectronic properties with high carrier mobility of 2.16 cm2&#183;V&#8208;1&#183;s&#8208;1, and strong excimer emission with absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 47.4%. Furthermore, the voltage&#8208;dependent electrically induced color&#8208;tunable emission from orange to blue was also demonstrated for an individual 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal based OLET for the first time. This work opens the door for a new class of high mobility emissive excimer organic semiconductors, and provides a good platform for the study of color&#8208;tunable OLETs.</dc:description>

This work opens the door for a new class of high mobility emissive excimer organic semiconductors, and provides a good platform for the study of color-tunable OLETs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Formation of Pd&#8208;DNA Hybrids Using Tailored Palladium&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs: Towards Heteroleptic Pd&#8208;DNA Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of highly organized metal&#8208;DNA structures has significant implications in bioinorganic chemistry, molecular biology and material science due to their unique properties and potential applications. In this study, we report on the conversion of single&#8208;stranded polydeoxycytidine (dC15) into a Pd&#8208;DNA supramolecular structure using [Pd(Aqa)] complex (Aqa = 8&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyquinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid) through a self&#8208;assembly process. The resulting Pd&#8208;DNA assembly closely resembles a natural double helix, with continuous [Pd(Aqa)(C)] (C = cytosine) units serving as palladium&#8208;mediated base pairs, forming interbase hydrogen bonds and intrastrand stacking interactions. Notably, the design of the [Pd(Aqa)] complex favours the interaction with cytosine, distinguishing it from our previously reported [Pd(Cheld)] complex (Cheld = chelidamic acid). This finding opens possibilities for creating heteroleptic Pd&#8208;DNA hybrids where different complexes specifically bind to nucleobases. We confirmed the Pd&#8208;DNA supramolecular structural assembly and selective binding of the complexes using NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism, mass spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Initiating a High&#8208;Rate and Stable Aqueous Air Battery by Using Organic N&#8208;Heterocycle Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline metal&#8208;air batteries are advantageous in high voltage, low cost, and high safety. However, metal anodes are heavily eroded in strong alkaline electrolytes, causing serious side reactions including dendrite growth, passivation, and hydrogen evolution. To address this limitation, we successfully synthesized an organic N&#8208;heterocycle compound (NHCC) to serve as an alternative anode. This compound not only exhibits remarkable stability but also possesses a low redox potential (&#8722;1.04 V vs. Hg/HgO) in alkaline environments. To effectively complement the low redox potential of the NHCC anode, we designed a dual&#8208;salt highly concentrated electrolyte (4.0 M KOH + 10.0 M KCF3SO3). This electrolyte expands the electrochemical stability window to 2.3 V through the robust interaction between the O atom in H2O molecule with the K+ of KCF3SO3 (H&#8722;O&#183;&#183;&#183;KCF3SO3). We further demonstrated the K+ uptaken/extraction storage mechanism of NHCC anodes. Consequently, the alkaline aqueous NHCC anode&#8208;air batteries delivers a high battery voltage of 1.6 V, high&#8208;rate performance (101.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1) and long cycle ability (30,000 cycles). Our work offers a molecular engineering strategy for superior organic anode materials and develops a novel double superconcentrated conductive salt electrolyte for the construction of high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;cycle alkaline aqueous organic anode&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling M&#246;bius/H&#252;ckel Topology and Aromaticity in A Core Expanded [10]Annulene at Different Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of annulene's conformation, electronic properties and aromaticity has generated enduring interest over the years, yet it continues to present formidable challenges for annulenes with more than ten carbon atoms. In this study, we present the synthesis of a stable [10]cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylmethine derivative (1), which bears a resemblance to [10]annulene. 1 can be readily oxidized into its respective cations, wherein electrons are effectively delocalized along the backbone, resulting in different conformations and aromaticity. Both 1 and its tetracation (14+&#183;4SbF6&#8208;) exhibit a nearly planar conformation with a rectangular shape, akin to the E,Z,E,Z,Z&#8208;[10]annulene. In contrast, the radical cation (1&#8226;+&#183;SbCl6&#8208;) possesses a doubly twisted H&#252;ckel topology. Furthermore, the dication (12+&#183;2SbCl6&#8208;) displays conformational flexibility in solution and crystalizes with the simultaneous presence of M&#246;bius&#8208;twisted (1a2+&#183;2SbCl6&#8208;) and H&#252;ckel&#8208;planar (1b2+&#183;2SbCl6&#8208;) isomers in its unit cell. Detailed experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal that: (1) 1 demonstrates localized aromaticity with an alternating benzenoid/quinoid structure; (2) 1a2+&#183;2SbCl6&#8208; and 1b2+&#183;2SbCl6&#8208; with 48&#960; electrons are weakly M&#246;bius aromatic and H&#252;ckel antiaromatic, respectively; (3) 14+&#183;4SbF6&#8208; exhibits H&#252;ckel aromaticity (46&#960;) and open&#8208;shell diradical character.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Oxidation/Cyclization of Readily Available Imine Linkages to Access Benzoxazole&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzoxazole&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (BO&#8208;COFs), despite their exceptional chemical stability, are still in their infancy. This is primarily because the current prevalent methods require the use of special ortho&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;substituted aromatic amines as monomers. Herein, we report an innovative strategy to access BO&#8208;COFs directly from imine&#8208;linked COFs (Im&#8208;COFs) without pre&#8208;embedded OH groups, using a two&#8208;step sequential oxidation/cyclization process. The two&#8208;step process included the oxidation of Im&#8208;COFs into amide&#8208;linked COFs, followed by a copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization. Five representative BO&#8208;COFs were synthesized with retained crystallinity and high oxidization efficiency, offering the potential to convert a significant portion of Im&#8208;COFs into BO&#8208;COFs. The structural advantages of the newly designed BO&#8208;COFs were demonstrated through their application to photocatalytic organic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes for Wide&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Range Aluminum&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminum sulfur (Al&#8208;S) batteries are promising energy storage devices due to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and high safety. However, the high viscosity and inferior ion transport of conventionally used ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) limit the kinetics of Al&#8208;S batteries, especially at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. Herein, locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILE) formed via diluting the ILEs with non&#8208;solvating 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn) co&#8208;solvent are proposed for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range Al&#8208;S batteries. The addition of dFBn effectively promotes the fluidity and ionic conductivity without affecting the AlCl4&#8208;/Al2Cl7&#8208; equilibrium, which preserves the reversible stripping/plating of aluminum and further promotes the overall kinetics of Al&#8208;S batteries. As a result, Al&#8208;S cells employing the LCILE exhibit higher specific capacity, better cyclability, and lower polarization with respect to the neat ILE in a wide temperature range from &#8208;20 to 40 &#176;C. For instance, Al&#8208;S batteries employing the LCILE sustain a remarkable capacity of 507 mAh g&#8208;1 after 300 cycles at 20 &#176;C, while only 229 mAh g&#8208;1 is delivered with the dFBn&#8208;free electrolyte under the same condition. This work demonstrates the favorable use of LCILEs for wide&#8208;temperature Al&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Halide solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted significant attention due to their competitive ionic conductivity and good electrochemical stability. &#160;Among typical halide SEs (chlorides, bromides, and iodides), substantial efforts have been dedicated to chlorides or bromides, with iodide solid electrolytes receiving less attention.&#160; Nevertheless, compared with chlorides or bromides, iodides have both a softer Li sublattice and lower reduction limit, which enable iodides to possess potentially high ionic conductivity and intrinsic anti&#8208;reduction stability, respectively. &#160;Herein, we report a new series of iodide SEs: LixYI3+x (x = 2, 3, 4, or 9). &#160;Through synchrotron X&#8208;ray/neutron diffraction characterizations and theoretical calculations, we revealed that the LixYI3+x SEs belong to the high&#8208;symmetry cubic structure, and can accommodate abundant vacancies. &#160;By manipulating the defects in the iodide structure, balanced Li&#8208;ion concentration and generated vacancies enables an optimized ionic conductivity of 1.04 &#215; 10&#8208;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#8451; for Li4YI7.&#160; Additionally, the promising Li&#8208;metal compatibility of Li4YI7 is demonstrated via electrochemical characterizations (particularly all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries) combined with interface molecular dynamics simulations. &#160;Our study on iodide SEs provides deep insights into the relation between high&#8208;symmetry halide structures and ionic conduction, which can inspire future efforts to revitalize halide SEs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrazine&#8208;Isonitrile Bioorthogonal Fluorogenic Reactions Enable Multiplex Labeling and Wash&#8208;Free Bioimaging of Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing fluorogenic probes for simultaneous live cell labeling of multiple targets is crucial for understanding complex cellular events. The emerging [4+1] cycloaddition between tetrazine and isonitriles holds promise as a bioorthogonal tool, yet existing tetrazine probes lack reactivity and fluorogenicity. Here, we present the development of a series of tetrazine&#8208;functionalized bioorthogonal probes. By incorporating pyrazole adducts into the fluorophore scaffolds, the post&#8208;reacted probes displayed remarkable fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratios, up to 3184&#8208;fold. Moreover, these modifications are generalizable to various fluorophores, enabling a broad emission range from 473 to 659 nm. Quantum chemical calculations further elucidate the turn&#8208;on mechanisms. These probes enable simultaneous labeling of multiple targets in live cells, without the need for a washing step. Consequently, our findings pave the way for advanced multiplex imaging and detection techniques for cellular studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Position of Ester Group on N&#8208;Alkyl Chains of Benzotriazole&#8208;based Small Molecule Acceptors for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Side chain engineering plays a vital role in exploring high&#8208;performance small molecule acceptors (SMAs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of A&#8208;DA&#8217;D&#8208;A type SMAs by introducing different N&#8208;substituted alkyl and ester alkyl side chains on benzotriazole (BZ) central unit and aimed to investigate the effect of different ester substitution positions on photovoltaic performances. All the new SMAs with ester groups exhibit lower the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and more blue&#8208;shifted absorption, but relatively higher absorption coefficients than alkyl chain counterpart. After blending with the donor PM6, the ester side chain&#8208;based devices demonstrate enhanced charge mobility, reduced amorphous intermixing domain size and long&#8208;lived charge transfer state compared to the alkyl chain counterpart, which are beneficial to achieve higher short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), simultaneously. Thereinto, the PM6:BZ&#8208;E31 based device achieves a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.33%, which is the highest PCE among the OSCs based on the SMAs with BZ&#8208;core. Our work demonstrated the strategy of ester substituted side chain is a feasible and effective approach to develop more efficient SMAs for OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;synthetic Rhodium (III) Complexes in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photothermal Heterogeneous C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although photocatalytic C&#8208;H activation has been realized by using heterogeneous catalysts, most of them require high&#8208;temperature conditions to provide the energy required for C&#8208;H bond breakage. The catalysts with photothermal conversion properties can catalyze this reaction efficiently at room temperature, but so far, these catalysts have been rarely developed. Here, we construct bifunctional catalysts Rh&#8208;COF&#8208;316 and &#8208;318 to combine photosensitive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and transition&#8208;metal catalytic moiety using a post&#8208;synthetic approach. The Rh&#8208;COF enable the heterogeneous C&#8208;H activation reaction by photothermal conversion for the first time, and exhibit excellent yields (up to 98%) and broad scope of substrates in [4+2] annulation at room temperature, while maintaining the high stability and recyclability. Significantly, this work is the highest yield reported so far in porous materials catalyzing C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp2) coupling at room temperature. The excellent performances can be attributed to the COF&#8208;316, which enhances the photothermal effect (&#916;T = 50.9 oC), thus accelerating C&#8208;H bond activation and the exchange of catalyst with substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Incarnatapeptins A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of incarnatapeptins A and B, two novel marine natural products, was accomplished from readily available (S)&#8208;1&#8208;benzyloxycarbonylhexahydropyridazine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid. This route, whose longest linear sequence was 12 steps, provided the incarnatapeptins A and B in yields of 26.5% and 19.7%, respectively, and enabled the structure and stereochemistry of both natural products to be unambiguously confirmed. Highlights of our synthesis include the photoredox&#8208;mediated decarboxylative 1,4&#8208;addition reaction and a novel and practical N&#8208;acylation paradigm promoted by silver carbonate. The unusual facile atropisomerism of some linear peptidic intermediates was also observed by TLC analysis in the course of this work.</dc:description>

         <title>Localized Oxidation Embellishing Strategy Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cell (pero&#8208;SC) has attracted extensive studies as a promising photovoltaic technology, wherein the electron extraction and transfer exhibit pivotal effect to the device performance. The planar SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) has contributed the recent record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the pero&#8208;SCs, yet still suffers from surface defects of SnO2 nanoparticles which brings energy loss and phase instability. Herein, we report a localized oxidation embellishing (LOE) strategy by applying (NH4)2CrO4 on the SnO2 ETL. The LOE strategy builds up plentiful nano&#8208;heterojunctions of p&#8208;Cr2O3/n&#8208;SnO2 and the nano&#8208;heterojunctions compensate the surface defects and realize benign energy alignment, which reduces surface non&#8208;radiative recombination and voltage loss of the pero&#8208;SCs. Meanwhile, the decrease of lattice mismatch released the lattice distortion and eliminated tensile stress, contributing to better stability of the devices. The pero&#8208;SCs based on &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 with the SnO2 ETL treated by the LOE strategy realized a PCE of 25.72% (certified as 25.41%), along with eminent stability performance of T90&gt;700 h. This work provides a brand&#8208;new view for defect modification of SnO2 electron transport layer.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Highly Robust Full&#8208;Color Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Stable White Organic Afterglow from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, full&#8208;color and stable white organic afterglow materials with outstanding water, organic solvents, and temperature resistances have been developed for the first time by embedding the selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into melamine&#8208;formaldehyde polymer via solution polymerization. The afterglow quantum yields and lifetimes of the resulting polymer films were up to 22.7% and 4.83 s under ambient conditions, respectively. For the coronene&#8208;doped sample, its afterglow color was linearly tunable between yellow and blue by temperature, and it could still emit intense blue afterglow with a lifetime of 0.68 s at 440 K. Moreover, the films showed bright and stable white afterglow at 370 K with a lifetime of 2.80 s and maintained excellent afterglow performance after soaking in water and organic solvents for more than 150 days.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, full-color and stable white organic afterglow materials with outstanding water, organic solvents, and temperature resistances have been developed for the first time by embedding the selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into melamine-formaldehyde polymer via solution polymerization. The afterglow quantum yields and lifetimes of the resulting polymer films were up to 22.7% and 4.83 s under ambient conditions, respectively. For the coronene-doped sample, its afterglow color was linearly tunable between yellow and blue by temperature, and it could still emit intense blue afterglow with a lifetime of 0.68 s at 440 K. Moreover, the films showed bright and stable white afterglow at 370 K with a lifetime of 2.80 s and maintained excellent afterglow performance after soaking in water and organic solvents for more than 150 days. In addition, the application potential of the polymer films in information encryption and anti-counterfeiting was also demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Radical Addition Guides Selective Photocatalytic Intermolecular Thiol&#8208;Yne&#8208;Ene Molecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the realm of modern organic chemistry, harnessing the power of multicomponent radical reactions presents both significant challenges and extraordinary potential. This article delves into this scientific frontier by addressing the critical issue of controlling selectivity in such complex processes. We introduce a novel approach that revolves around the reversible addition of thiyl radicals to multiple bonds, reshaping the landscape of multicomponent radical reactions. The key to selectivity lies in the intricate interplay between reversibility and the energy landscapes governing C&#8208;C bond formation in thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene reactions. The developed approach not only allows to prioritize the thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;ene cascade, dominating over alternative reactions, but also extends the scope of coupling products obtained from alkenes and alkynes of various structures and electron density distributions, regardless of their relative polarity difference, opening doors to more versatile synthetic possibilities. In the present study, we provide a powerful tool for atom&#8208;economical C&#8208;S and C&#8208;C bond formation, paving the way for the efficient synthesis of complex molecules. Carrying out our experimental and computational studies, we elucidated the fundamental mechanisms underlying radical cascades, a knowledge that can be broadly applied in the field of organic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the synthesis of polymer&#8208;crosslinked protein assemblies with tunable microstructures, including single&#8208; and multi&#8208;layer protein vesicles, Janus protein vesicles and doughnut&#8208;shaped hierarchical&#8208;structured protein aggregates. The as&#8208;prepared protein aggregates display morphology&#8208;dependent cell uptake.







Abstract
The construction of variable structured multi&#8208;protein nano&#8208;assemblies is of great interest for the development of protein&#8208;based therapeutic systems. This study showcases the synthesis of polymer&#8208;protein assemblies with tunable structure like single&#8208; and multi&#8208;layer polymer&#8208;crosslinked protein vesicles, Janus protein vesicles and other hierarchical&#8208;structured assemblies by utilizing a dynamic template&#8208;assistant intermittent&#8208;assembly approach. The generalization of the methodology helps the protein assemblies to gain notable functional complexity. And we demonstrate compelling evidence highlighting the substantial impact of the topological morphology of protein nanoaggregates on their cellular uptake capacity.

         <title>Dual Nature of Thiophene Harnessed in the Design of Near&#8208;Infrared Emitters via Antiaromaticity Relief</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Murai and Yamaguchi report on near&#8208;infrared emitters derived from the dithieno[2,3&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;f]azepine core. Low band gaps were achieved by fusing antiaromatic azepine with thiophene rings equipped with electron&#8208;accepting moieties, which relieves the antiaromaticity of azepine through the formation of a quinoid structure. This novel approach provides dyes with fluorescence quantum yields of up to 0.02 at 878&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitters are of great interest for applications in bioimaging and modern technology. Yet the design of such materials with decent characteristics is challenging due to intrinsic limitations. In a recent article, Murai and Yamaguchi report the synthesis of NIR emitters with appreciable fluorescence quantum yields reaching 0.02 at 878&#8197;nm in CH2Cl2 solution. The low band gaps were achieved by a new design strategy exploiting antiaromaticity relief. This concept was realized for compounds consisting of an antiaromatic azepine central ring fused to thiophene moieties. In these systems, thiophene unfolds its dual nature. On the one hand, it contributes to the high antiaromaticity of azepine; on the other hand, it exerts a stabilizing effect on azepine through the formation of a quinoid structure, which reduces its antiaromaticity and shifts the absorption and emission maxima into the NIR region.

         <title>A Stable Extra&#8208;Large Pore and High&#8208;Silica Zeolite Derived from Ge&#8208;Rich Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multidimensional extra&#8208;large pore zeolite with highly hydrothermal stability, denoted as &#8208;IRT&#8208;HS, has been developed successfully, starting from Ge&#8208;rich germanosilicate precursor hydrothermally directed by a small and commercially available piperidinium&#8208;type organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). &#8208;IRT&#8208;HS, with the supermicropores, is structurally analogues to 28&#8208;membered ring &#8208;IRT topology as confirmed by various spectroscopic techniques. And it is the high&#8208;silica (Si/Ge=58) zeolite with the largest pore size as well. Notably, using acid&#8208;washed as&#8208;made Ge&#8208;rich &#8208;IRT precursor as the silicon source is crucial to restore partially collapsed structure into a stable framework by OSDA&#8208;assisted recrystallization. The calcined &#8208;IRT&#8208;HS maintains a high crystallinity, even when stored in a humid environment for extended periods or directly exposed to water. Additionally, high silica Al&#8208;containing analogue is also readily synthesized, serving as an active solid&#8208;acid catalyst in 1,3,5&#8208;triisopropylbenzene cracking reaction, yielding an impressive initial conversion up to 76.1% much higher than conventional large&#8208;pore Beta zeolite (30.4%). This work will pave the way for the designed synthesis of targeted high&#8208;silica zeolites with stable and extra&#8208;large pore frameworks, mimicking the structures of existing Ge&#8208;rich counterparts.</dc:description>

The high&#8208;entropy approach is applied to a monoclinic Prussian white material, introducing an innovative concept for developing robust cathodes for use in Na&#8208;ion batteries. In their Research Article (e202315371), Torsten Brezesinski, Ben Breitung, Yanjiao Ma and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that enhanced performance is linked to increased configurational entropy, and a proposed mechanism underscores the synergistic effects of suppressing phase transitions and mitigating gas evolution.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptide&#8208;Bismuth Bicycles
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycles can effectively penetrate human cell membranes. They are easy to synthesize, require only three positive charges for cell entry, and their uptake can be monitored by mass spectrometry due to the unique ability to trace bismuth. This discovery offers an alternative to fluorophore labeling and opens new possibilities for designing therapeutic agents with improved cellular uptake and traceability.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) play a significant role in the delivery of cargos into human cells. We report the first CPPs based on peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycles, which can be readily obtained from commercially available peptide precursors, making them accessible for a wide range of applications. These CPPs enter human cells as demonstrated by live&#8208;cell confocal microscopy using fluorescently labelled peptides. We report efficient sequences that demonstrate increased cellular uptake compared to conventional CPPs like the TAT peptide (derived from the transactivating transcriptional activator of human immunodeficiency virus 1) or octaarginine (R8), despite requiring only three positive charges. Bicyclization triggered by the presence of bismuth(III) increases cellular uptake by more than one order of magnitude. Through the analysis of cell lysates using inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS), we have introduced an alternative approach to examine the cellular uptake of CPPs. This has allowed us to confirm the presence of bismuth in cells after exposure to our CPPs.

     alt="Cell-Penetrating Peptide-Bismuth Bicycles**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peptide-bismuth bicycles can effectively penetrate human cell membranes. They are easy to synthesize, require only three positive charges for cell entry, and their uptake can be monitored by mass spectrometry due to the unique ability to trace bismuth. This discovery offers an alternative to fluorophore labeling and opens new possibilities for designing therapeutic agents with improved cellular uptake and traceability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) play a significant role in the delivery of cargos into human cells. We report the first CPPs based on peptide-bismuth bicycles, which can be readily obtained from commercially available peptide precursors, making them accessible for a wide range of applications. These CPPs enter human cells as demonstrated by live-cell confocal microscopy using fluorescently labelled peptides. We report efficient sequences that demonstrate increased cellular uptake compared to conventional CPPs like the TAT peptide (derived from the transactivating transcriptional activator of human immunodeficiency virus 1) or octaarginine (R&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), despite requiring only three positive charges. Bicyclization triggered by the presence of bismuth(III) increases cellular uptake by more than one order of magnitude. Through the analysis of cell lysates using inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), we have introduced an alternative approach to examine the cellular uptake of CPPs. This has allowed us to confirm the presence of bismuth in cells after exposure to our CPPs. Mechanistic studies indicated an energy-dependent endocytic cellular uptake sensitive to inhibition by rottlerin, most likely involving macropinocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilization of NH&#8722; Group Adjacent to Naked Silicon(II) Atom in Base Stabilized Aminosilylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the isolation of the first examples of free aminosilylenes 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b having &#8722;NH group next to the naked Si(II) atom. Aminosilylenes showed unique reactivity upon heating; an intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H activation with 1&#8201;a afforded cyclic silazane, whereas 1&#8201;b showed a rare 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift to afford rare silanimine.







Abstract
Aminosilylene, comprising reactive NH&#8722; and Si(II) sites next to each other, is an intriguing class of compounds due to its ability to show diverse reactivity. However, stabilizing the reactive NH&#8722; group next to the free Si(II) atom is challenging and has not yet been achieved. Herein, we report the first examples of base stabilized free aminosilylenes Ar*NHSi(PhC(NtBu)2) (1&#8201;a) and Mes*NHSi(PhC(NtBu)2) (1&#8201;b) (Ar*=2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl and Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl), tolerating a NH&#8722; group next to the naked Si(II) atom. Remarkably, 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b exhibited interesting differences in their reactivity upon heating. With 1&#8201;a, an intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of one of the benzhydryl methine hydrogen atoms to the Si(II) atom produced the five&#8208;membered cyclic silazane 2. However, with 1&#8201;b, a rare 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift to the Si(II) atom afforded a silanimine 3, with a hydride ligand attached to an unsaturated silicon atom. Further, the coordination capabilities of 1&#8201;a were also tested with Ru(II) and Fe(0) precursors. Treatments of 1&#8201;a with [Ru(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2 led to the isolation of a &#951;6&#8208;arene tethered complex [RuCl2{Ar*NHSi(PhC(tBuN)2)&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;Si&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene}] (4), whereas with the Fe(CO)5 precursor a Fe(0) complex [Fe(CO)4{Ar*NHSi(PhC(tBuN)2)&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;Si}] (5) was obtained. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to shed light on the structural, bonding, and energetic aspects in 1&#8211;5.

         <title>Rational Design of a Phosphorus&#8208;Centered Disbiradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of a phosphorus&#8208;centered disbiradical that exhibits highly dynamic behavior in solution leading to isomerization is presented. Among the various conformers, those that have significantly shorter distances between radical sites and thus can interact weakly through space dominate.







Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;centered disbiradicals, in which the radical sites exist as individual spin doublets with weak spin&#8208;spin interaction have not been known so far. Starting from monoradicals of the type [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8722;R], we have now succeeded in linking two such monoradical phosphorus centers by appropriate choice of a linker. To this end, biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;] (1) was treated with 1,6&#8208;dibromohexane, affording the brominated species {Br[P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)]2}2C6H12 (3). Subsequent reduction with KC8 led to the formation of the disbiradical {&#8901;[P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)]2}2C6H12 (4) featuring a large distance between the radical phosphorus sites in the solid state and formally the highest biradical character observed in a P&#8208;centered biradical so far, approaching 100&#8201;%. EPR spectroscopy revealed a three&#8208;line signal in solution with a considerably larger exchange interaction than would be expected from the molecular structure of the single crystal. Quantum chemical calculations revealed a highly dynamic conformational space; thus, the two radical sites can approach each other with a much smaller distance in solution. Further reduction of 4 resulted in the formation of a potassium salt featuring the first structurally characterized P&#8208;centered distonic radical anion (5&#8722;). Moreover, 4 could be used in small molecule activation.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Isoxeniolide A
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of the xenicane&#8208;type marine natural product isoxeniolide A has been accomplished through a ring&#8208;opening/ring&#8208;closing metathesis sequence and an intramolecular Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction to forge the nine&#8208;membered ring as the key enabling steps. The NHK cyclization was highly diastereoselective and provided the oxabicyclo[7.4.0]tridecene core of isoxeniolide A as a single stereoisomer.







Abstract
Isoxeniolide A is a highly strained xenicane diterpenoid of marine origin. This natural product is representative for a subfamily of xenicanes incorporating an allylic hydroxy group in the nine&#8208;membered ring; members of this xenicane subfamily so far have not been targeted by total synthesis. Herein, we describe the first asymmetric total synthesis of isoxeniolide A. Key to forming the challenging E&#8208;configured cyclononene ring was a diastereoselective intramolecular Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi reaction. Other important transformations include an enzymatic desymmetrization for absolute stereocontrol, a diastereoselective cuprate addition and the use of a bifunctional vinyl silane building block. Our strategy also permits access to the enantiomer of the natural product and holds potential to access a multitude of xenicane natural products and analogs for structure&#8211;activity relationship studies.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Molecular Engineering of Perylene Diimide Polymers with a Robust Built&#8208;in Electric Field for Enhanced Solar&#8208;Driven Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The built&#8208;in electric field&#160;of polymer semiconductors determines its interfacial space charge and band bending to separate electrons and holes. In their Research Article (e202318224), Yi&#8208;Jing Chen, Zhi&#8208;Xing Wu, Jing&#8208;Xin Jian et&#8197;al. report three perylene diimide (PDI) polymers with different molecular orientations of ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; and para&#8208;phenylenediamine linkers. By regulating the dipole moment of PDI derivatives, a robust BIEF was created to promote the separation of photogenerated carriers and achieve efficient solar&#8208;driven water splitting.

&lt;p&gt;The built-in electric field&#160;of polymer semiconductors determines its interfacial space charge and band bending to separate electrons and holes. In their Research Article (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202318224"&gt;e202318224&lt;/a&gt;), Yi-Jing Chen, Zhi-Xing Wu, Jing-Xin Jian et&#8197;al. report three perylene diimide (PDI) polymers with different molecular orientations of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-phenylenediamine linkers. By regulating the dipole moment of PDI derivatives, a robust BIEF was created to promote the separation of photogenerated carriers and achieve efficient solar-driven water splitting.

         <title>Identification of Cu(111) as Superior Active Sites for Electrocatalytic NO Reduction to NH3 with High Single&#8208;Pass Conversion Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visual demonstration of the s&#8208;p and d&#8208;p hybridization states between Cu and N atom in N&#8722;O during the adsorption and activation mechanism of NO molecules is brought. The &#8220;&#963;&#8208;&#960;* coordination bond&#8221; formed between N atom and Cu center is the essence of the interaction between the Cu center and NO molecule. The Cu3d electrons occupy the &#960;* orbitals in NO, eventually weakening the N&#8801;O triple bond.







Abstract
Opting for NO as an N source in electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis presents an intriguing approach to tackle energy and environmental challenges. However, blindly pursuing high NH3 synthesis rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE) while ignoring the NO conversion ratio could result in environmental problems. Herein, Cu nanosheets with exposed (111) surface is fabricated and exhibit a NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 yield rate of 371.89&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 (flow cell) and the highest FE of 93.19&#177;1.99&#8201;% (H&#8208;type cell). The NO conversion ratio is increased to the current highest value of 63.74&#8201;% combined with the development of the flow cell. Additionally, Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) clearly reveals that the &#8220;&#963;&#8208;&#960;* acceptance&#8208;donation&#8221; is the essence of the interaction between the Cu and NO as also supported by operando attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IRAS) in observing the key intermediate of NO&#8722;. This work not only achieves a milestone NO conversion ratio for electrocatalytic NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH3, but also proposes a new descriptor that utilizes orbital hybridization between molecules and metal centers to accurately identify the real active sites of catalysts.

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;like Niobovanadate Cage Built from {(Nb)V5} Pentagon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first fullerene&#8208;like all&#8208;inorganic polyoxovanadate cage, V30Nb12, has been successfully synthesized by introducing Nb to polyoxovanadates and the V30Nb12 cage is assembled by 12 {(Nb)V5} pentagons through sharing V centers with Ih symmetry, similar to fullerene C60.







Abstract
The striking aesthetic appeal of fullerene&#8208;like clusters has captured the interest of researchers. Nevertheless, the assembly of fullerene&#8208;like polyoxovadanadate (POV) cages remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of suitable pentagonal motif. Herein, we have successfully synthesized the first fullerene&#8208;like all&#8208;inorganic POV cage, {(V2O)V30Nb12O102(H2O)12} (V30Nb12), by introducing Nb into the POVs. V30Nb12 is assembled by 12 heterometallic {(Nb)V5} pentagons through sharing V centers with Ih symmetry, reminiscent of C60. To our knowledge, the fullerene&#8208;like V30Nb12 not only represents the highest&#8208;nuclearity POV cage but also stands as the first niobovanadate cluster. Notably, V30Nb12 exhibits excellent solution stability, as confirmed by ESI&#8208;MS, FT&#8208;IR and UV/Vis spectra. As there is no protection organic ligand on its outer surface, V30Nb12 can be further modified with Cu&#8208;complexes to form a fullerene&#8208;like cluster based zigzag chain (Cu&#8722;V30Nb12).

         <title>Tailoring Li Deposition by Regulating Structural Connectivity of Electrochemical Li Reservoir in Li&#8208;metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We elucidated that the kinetical pathway can be maintained by regulating the structural connectivity of the in situ induced electrochemical Li reservoir, which ensures efficient electron transfer and Li+ diffusion pathway. The well&#8208;distributed electrochemical Li reservoirs can serve as nucleation sites to promote uniform Li deposition and then improve the coulombic efficiency and cyclability of anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries effectively.







Abstract
Irregular Li deposition is the major reason for poor reversibility and cycle instability in Li metal batteries, even leading to safety hazards, the causes of which have been extensively explored. The structural disconnection induced by completely dissolving Li in the traditional testing protocol is a key factor accounting for irregular Li growth during the subsequent deposition process. Herein, the critical role played by the structural connectivity of electrochemical Li reservoir in subsequent Li deposition behaviors is elucidated and a morphology&#8208;performance correlation is established. The structural connection and resultant well&#8208;distributed morphology of the in situ electrochemical Li reservoir ensure efficient electron transfer and Li+ diffusion pathway, finally leading to homogenized Li nucleation and growth. Tailoring the geometry of Li reservoir can improve the coulombic efficiency and cyclability of anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries by optimizing Li deposition behavior.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Infrared Spectroelectrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an innovative operando plasmon&#8208;enhanced IR spectroelectrochemistry technique for the sensitive detection of interfacial species during electrochemical reactions. This platform is established by plasmonic antennae electrically connected via monolayer graphene and exhibits a remarkable signal enhancement. The enhanced IR features enable the reconstruction of electrochemical curves and the elucidation of reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
IR spectroelectrochemistry (EC&#8208;IR) is a cutting&#8208;edge operando method for exploring electrochemical reaction mechanisms. However, detection of interfacial molecules is challenged by the limited sensitivity of existing EC&#8208;IR platforms due to the lack of high&#8208;enhancement substrates. Here, we propose an innovative plasmon&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroelectrochemistry (EC&#8208;PEIRS) platform to overcome this sensitivity limitation. Plasmonic antennae with ultrahigh IR signal enhancement are electrically connected via monolayer graphene while preserving optical path integrity, serving as both the electrode and IR substrate. The [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; redox reaction and electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are investigated on the EC&#8208;PEIRS platform with a remarkable signal enhancement. Notably, the enhanced IR signals enable a reconstruction of the electrochemical curve of the redox reactions and unveil the CO2RR mechanism. This study presents a promising technique for boosting the in&#8208;depth understanding of interfacial events across diverse applications.

         <title>Molecular Engineering Enabling High Initial Coulombic Efficiency and Rubost Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Hard Carbon in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reported a novel molecular strategy to optimize commercial hard carbon (HC). A disodium phthalate (DP) molecule with two Na+ is capable of efficiently replenishing the Na+ loss during solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) generation. The as&#8208;designed DP&#8208;HC exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of &gt;96.3&#8201;% in NaPF6 in diglyme (G2) electrolyte, and is capable of servicing consistently for &gt;1600 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Hard carbon (HC) as a potential candidate anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) suffers from unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), which limits its commercial applications and urgently requires the emergence of a new strategy. Herein, an organic molecule with two sodium ions, disodium phthalate (DP), was successfully engineered on the HC surface (DP&#8208;HC) to replenish the sodium loss from solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. A stabilized and ultrathin (&#8776;7.4&#8197;nm) SEI was constructed on the DP&#8208;HC surface, which proved to be simultaneously suitable in both ester and ether electrolytes. Compared to pure HC (60.8&#8201;%), the as&#8208;designed DP&#8208;HC exhibited a high ICE of &gt;96.3&#8201;% in NaPF6 in diglyme (G2) electrolyte, and is capable of servicing consistently for &gt;1600 cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP)|DP&#8208;HC full&#8208;cell with a 98.3&#8201;% exceptional ICE can be cycled stably for 450 cycles, demonstrating the tremendous practical application potential of DP&#8208;HC. This work provides a molecular design strategy to improve the ICE of HC, which will inspire more researchers to concentrate on the commercialization progress of HC.

         <title>The Influence of Donor/Acceptor Interfaces on Organic Solar Cells Efficiency and Stability Revealed through Theoretical Calculations and Morphology Characterizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The donor/acceptor interface structures and features show an obvious influence on blending phase&#8208;separation morphology and charge transport behavior. It is not reasonable to simply judge the quality of fluorinated and chlorinated acceptors without suitable selection of donors, and regulating donor/acceptor interfaces can accurately present the photoelectric conversion ability of a novel acceptors.







Abstract
End&#8208;groups halogenation strategies, generally refers to fluorination and chlorination, have been confirmed as simple and efficient methods to regulate the photoelectric performance of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), but a controversy over which one is better has existed for a long time. Here, two novel NFAs, C9N3&#8208;4F and C9N3&#8208;4Cl, featured with different end&#8208;groups were successfully synthesized and blended with two renowned donors, D18 and PM6, featured with different electron&#8208;withdrawing units. Detailed theoretical calculations and morphology characterizations of the interface structures indicate NFAs based on different end&#8208;groups possess different binding energy and miscibility with donors, which shows an obvious influence on phase&#8208;separation morphology, charge transport behavior and device performance. After verified by other three pairs of reported NFAs, a universal conclusion obtained as the devices based on D18 with fluorination&#8208;end&#8208;groups&#8208;based NFAs and PM6 with chlorination&#8208;end&#8208;groups&#8208;based NFAs generally show excellent efficiencies, high fill factors and stability. Finally, the devices based on D18: C9N3&#8208;4F and PM6: C9N3&#8208;4Cl yield outstanding efficiency of 18.53&#8201;% and 18.00&#8201;%, respectively. Suitably selecting donor and regulating donor/acceptor interface can accurately present the photoelectric conversion ability of a novel NFAs, which points out the way for further molecular design and selection for high&#8208;performance and stable organic solar cells.

         <title>Immobilized Tetraalkylammonium Cations Enable Metal&#8208;free CO2 Electroreduction in Acid and Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A positively charged polyelectrolyte formed by the electrostatic interaction between poly(diallydimethylammonium)and graphene oxide is devised on the surface of Ag catalysts. This porous medium with immobilized cations augments CO2 electroreduction to CO in acid&#8208; and pure&#8208;water&#8208;fed zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an efficient pathway to convert CO2 into desirable products, yet its commercialization is greatly hindered by the huge energy cost due to CO2 loss and regeneration. Performing CO2RR under acidic conditions containing alkali cations can potentially address the issue, but still causes (bi)carbonate deposition at high current densities, compromising product Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) in present&#8208;day acid&#8208;fed membrane electrode assemblies. Herein, we present a strategy using a positively charged polyelectrolyte&#8212;poly(diallyldimethylammonium) immobilized on graphene oxide via electrostatic interactions to displace alkali cations. This enables a FE of 85&#8201;%, a carbon efficiency of 93&#8201;%, and an energy efficiency (EE) of 35&#8201;% for CO at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 on modified Ag catalysts in acid. In a pure&#8208;water&#8208;fed reactor, we obtained a 78&#8201;% CO FE with a 30&#8201;% EE at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 40&#8201;&#176;C. All the performance metrics are comparable to or even exceed those attained in the presence of alkali metal cations.

         <title>A Sulfur&#8208;Doped Copper Catalyst with Efficient Electrocatalytic Formate Generation during the Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A S&#8208;doped&#8208;Cu catalyst excluding post&#8208;transition metal was shown to exhibit a high Faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;% and a partial current density of 321&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 toward formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This owes to the plenary grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8722;S bonds in CuS after electrolysis, while the latter factor can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates to further improve the activity.







Abstract
Catalysts involving post&#8208;transition metals have shown almost invincible performance on generating formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Conversely, Cu without post&#8208;transition metals has struggled to achieve comparable activity. In this study, a sulfur (S)&#8208;doped&#8208;copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalyst is developed, exhibiting excellent performance in formate generation with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;% and a partial current density of 321&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Ex situ structural elucidations reveal the presence of abundant grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8722;S bonds from the covellite phase during CO2RR. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that S&#8722;S bonds can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates, further improving the activity of the formate pathway. This work is significant in modifying a low&#8208;cost catalyst (Cu) with a non&#8208;metallic element (S) to achieve comparable performance to mainstream catalysts for formate generation in industrial grade.

         <title>A Double&#8208;ligand Chelating Strategy to Iron Complex Anolytes with Ultrahigh Cyclability for Aqueous Iron Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;ligand chelating strategy was proposed to design Fe(TEA)MM complex as anolyte materials with high binding energy, robust coordination structure, highly electrochemical activity and good reversibility. All iron flow batteries based on Fe(TEA)MM anolytes and Fe(CN)6 catholytes reach a low capital cost of $&#8201;33.2&#8197;kWh&#8722;1 and record&#8208;breaking cycling stability without detectable energy efficiency and capacity decay during 1400 cycles.







Abstract
Aqueous all&#8208;iron flow batteries (AIFBs) are attractive for large&#8208;scale and long&#8208;term energy storage due to their extremely low cost and safety features. To accelerate commercial application, a long cyclable and reversible iron anolyte is expected to address the critical barriers, namely iron dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report a robust iron complex with triethanolamine (TEA) and 2&#8208;methylimidazole (MM) double ligands. By introducing two ligands into one iron center, the binding energy of the complex increases, making it more stable in the charge&#8208;discharge reactions. The Fe(TEA)MM complex achieves reversible and stable redox between Fe3+ and Fe2+, without metallic iron growth and HER. AIFBs based on this anolyte perform a high energy efficiency of 80.5&#8201;% at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibit a record durability among reported AIFBs. The efficiency and capacity retain nearly 100&#8201;% after 1,400 cycles. The capital cost of this AIFB is $&#8201;33.2&#8197;kWh&#8722;1 (e.g., 20&#8197;h duration), cheaper than Li&#8208;ion battery and vanadium flow battery. This double&#8208;ligand chelating strategy not only solves the current problems faced by AIFBs, but also provides an insight for further improving the cycling stability of other flow batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A double-ligand chelating strategy was proposed to design Fe(TEA)MM complex as anolyte materials with high binding energy, robust coordination structure, highly electrochemical activity and good reversibility. All iron flow batteries based on Fe(TEA)MM anolytes and Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; catholytes reach a low capital cost of $&#8201;33.2&#8197;kWh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and record-breaking cycling stability without detectable energy efficiency and capacity decay during 1400 cycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous all-iron flow batteries (AIFBs) are attractive for large-scale and long-term energy storage due to their extremely low cost and safety features. To accelerate commercial application, a long cyclable and reversible iron anolyte is expected to address the critical barriers, namely iron dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report a robust iron complex with triethanolamine (TEA) and 2-methylimidazole (MM) double ligands. By introducing two ligands into one iron center, the binding energy of the complex increases, making it more stable in the charge-discharge reactions. The Fe(TEA)MM complex achieves reversible and stable redox between Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, without metallic iron growth and HER. AIFBs based on this anolyte perform a high energy efficiency of 80.5&#8201;% at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and exhibit a record durability among reported AIFBs. The efficiency and capacity retain nearly 100&#8201;% after 1,400 cycles. The capital cost of this AIFB is $&#8201;33.2&#8197;kWh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (e.g., 20&#8197;h duration), cheaper than Li-ion battery and vanadium flow battery. This double-ligand chelating strategy not only solves the current problems faced by AIFBs, but also provides an insight for further improving the cycling stability of other flow batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emerging Light&#8208;Harvesting Materials Based on Organic Photovoltaic D/A Heterojunctions for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic water splitting to hydrogen is a highly promising method to meet the surging energy consumption globally through the environmentally friendly means. As the initial step before photocatalysis, harvesting photons from sunlight is crucially important, thus making the design of photosensitizers with visible even near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptions get more and more attentions. In the past three years, organic donor/acceptor (D/A) heterojunctions with absorptions extending to 950 nm, have emerged as the new star light&#8208;harvesting materials for photocatalytic water splitting, demonstrating exciting advantages over inorganic materials in solar light utilization, hydrogen yielding rate, etc. This Minireview firstly gives a brief discussion about the principle processes and determining factors for photocatalytic water splitting with organic photovoltaic D/A heterojunction as photosensitizers. Thereafter, the current progress is summarized in details by introducing typical and excellent D/A heterojunction&#8208;based photocatalytic systems. Finally, not only the great prospects but also the most challenging issues confronted by organic D/A heterojunctions are indicated along with a perspective on the opportunities and new directions for future material explorations.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Cyanopiperazines as Specific Covalent Inhibitors of the Deubiquitinating Enzyme UCHL1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyanamides have emerged as privileged scaffolds in covalent inhibitors of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). However, many compounds with a cyanopyrrolidine warhead show cross&#8208;reactivity toward small subsets of DUBs or toward the protein deglycase PARK7/DJ&#8208;1, hampering their use for the selective perturbation of a single DUB in living cells. Here, we disclose N&#8217;&#8208;alkyl,N&#8208;cyanopiperazines as structures for covalent enzyme inhibition with exceptional specificity for the DUB UCHL1 among 55 human deubiquitinases and with potent target engagement in cells. Notably, transitioning from 5&#8208;membered pyrrolidines to 6&#8208;membered heterocycles eliminated PARK7 binding and introduced context&#8208;dependent reversibility of the isothiourea linkage to the catalytic cysteine of UCHL1. Compound potency and specificity were analysed by a range of biochemical assays and with a crystal structure of a cyanopiperazine in covalent complex with UCHL1. The structure revealed a compound&#8208;induced conformational restriction of the cross&#8208;over loop, which underlies the observed inhibitory potencies. Through the rationalization of specificities of different cyanamides, we introduce a framework for the investigation of protein reactivity of bioactive nitriles of this compound class. Our results represent an encouraging case study for the refining of electrophilic compounds into chemical probes, emphasizing the potential to engineer specificity through subtle chemical modifications around the warhead.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalysis Meets Confinement: An Emerging Opportunity for Photoinduced Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembled metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) have been evolved as a paradigm of enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysts since they are able to synergize multifunctionalities inherent in metal and organic components and constitute microenvironments characteristic of enzymatic spatial confinement and versatile host&#8208;guest interactions, thus facilitating unconventional organic transformations via unique driving&#8208;forces such as weak noncovalent binding and electron/energy transfer. Recently, MOC&#8208;based photoreactors emerged as a burgeoning platform of supramolecular photocatalysis, displaying anomalous reactivities and selectivities distinct from bulk solution. This perspective recaps two decades journey of the photoinduced radical reactions by using photoactive metal&#8208;organic cages (PMOCs) as artificial reactors, outlining how the cage&#8208;confined photocatalysis was evolved from stoichiometric photoreactions to photocatalytic turnover, from high&#8208;energy UV&#8208;irradiation to sustainable visible&#8208;light photoactivation, and from simple radical reactions to multi&#8208;level chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivities. We will focus on PMOCs that merge structural and functional biomimicry into a single&#8208;cage to behave as multi&#8208;role photoreactors, emphasizing their potentials in tackling current challenges in organic transformations through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) or energy transfer (EnT) pathways in a simple, green while feasible manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Observation of Iron with Eight Coordination in Iron Trifluoride under High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of hypercoordination has been a subject of fundamental interest, especially for understanding structures that challenge conventional wisdom. The small ionic radii of Fe ions typically result in coordination numbers of 4 or 6 in stable Fe&#8208;bearing ionic compounds. While 8&#8208;coordinated Fe has been observed in highly compressed oxides, the pursuit of hypercoordinated Fe still faces significant challenges due to the complexity of synthesizing the anticipated compound with another suitable anion. Through first&#8208;principles simulation and advanced crystal structure prediction methods, we predict that an orthorhombic phase of FeF3 with exclusively 8&#8208;coordinated Fe is energetically stable above 18 GPa&#8212;a pressure more feasibly achieved compared to oxides. Inspired by this theoretical result, &#160;we conducted extensive experiments using&#160;a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell technique to investigate the crystal structures of FeF3 at high&#8208;pressure conditions. We successfully synthesized the predicted orthorhombic phase of FeF3 at 46 GPa, as confirmed by in&#8208;situ experimental X&#8208;ray diffraction data. This work establishes a new ionic compound featuring rare 8&#8208;coordinated Fe in a simple binary Fe&#8208;bearing system and paves the way for discovering Fe hypercoordination in similar systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterotrimeric G proteins are key mediators in the signaling of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCR) that are involved in a plethora of important physiological processes and thus major targets of pharmaceutical drugs. The cyclic depsipeptides YM&#8208;254890 and FR900359 are strong and selective inhibitors of the Gq subfamily of G proteins. FR900359 was first reported to be produced by unculturable plant symbiont, however, a culturable FR900359 producer was discovered recently by the standard strategy, screening of the producing strain from the environment. As another strategy, we introduce herein the different way to supply natural compounds of unculturable microorganism origin.

         <title>A High&#8208;Energy Aqueous All&#8208;Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable aqueous batteries are promising energy storage devices because of their high safety and low cost. However, their energy densities are generally unsatisfactory due to the limited capacities of ion&#8208;inserted electrode materials, prohibiting their widespread applications. Herein, a high&#8208;energy aqueous all&#8208;sulfur battery was constructed via matching S/Cu2S and S/CaSx redox couples. In such batteries, both cathodes and anodes undergo the conversion reaction between sulfur/metal sulfides redox couples, which display high specific capacities and rational electrode potential difference. Furthermore, during the charge/discharge process, the simultaneous redox of Cu2+ ion charge&#8208;carriers also takes place and contributes to a more two&#8208;electron transfer, which doubles the capacity of cathodes. As a result, the assembled aqueous all&#8208;sulfur batteries deliver a high discharge capacity of 447 mAh g&#8208;1 based on total mass of sulfur in cathode and anode at 0.1 A g&#8208;1, contributing to an enhanced energy density of 393 Wh kg&#8208;1.

However, their energy densities are generally unsatisfactory due to the limited capacities of ion-inserted electrode materials, prohibiting their widespread applications. Herein, a high-energy aqueous all-sulfur battery was constructed via matching S/Cu2S and S/CaSx redox couples. In such batteries, both cathodes and anodes undergo the conversion reaction between sulfur/metal sulfides redox couples, which display high specific capacities and rational electrode potential difference. Furthermore, during the charge/discharge process, the simultaneous redox of Cu2+ ion charge-carriers also takes place and contributes to a more two-electron transfer, which doubles the capacity of cathodes. As a result, the assembled aqueous all-sulfur batteries deliver a high discharge capacity of 447 mAh g-1 based on total mass of sulfur in cathode and anode at 0.1 A g-1, contributing to an enhanced energy density of 393 Wh kg-1. This work will widen the scope for the design of high-energy aqueous batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Full&#8208;Spectrum Responsive Naphthalimide/Perylene Diimide with a Giant Internal Electric Field for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;spectrum responsive naphthalimide/perylene diimide (NDINH/PDINH) supramolecular photocatalysts are obtained by co&#8208;assembly through a rapid solution dispersion method, creating a giant internal electric field (IEF) via the larger local dipole. The IEF can effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated carriers and promote charge&#8208;transfer excitation. The photocatalysts are capable of efficient overall water splitting.







Abstract
The co&#8208;assembly naphthalimide/perylene diimide (NDINH/PDINH) supramolecular photocatalysts were successfully synthesized via a rapid solution dispersion method. A giant internal electric field (IEF) in co&#8208;assembly structure was built by the larger local dipole. NDINH coated on PDINH could reduce the reflected electric field over PDINH to improve its responsive activity to ultraviolet light. Resultantly, an efficient full&#8208;spectrum photocatalytic overall water splitting activity with H2 and O2 evolution rate of 317.2 and 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for NDINH/PDINH together with optimized O2 evolution rate with 2.61&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 using AgNO3 as a sacrificial reagent were achieved. Meanwhile, its solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency was enhanced to 0.13&#8201;%. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was primarily attributed to the IEF between NDINH and PDINH, significantly accelerating transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, a direct Z&#8208;Scheme pathway of carriers contributed to a high redox potential. The strategy provided a new perspective for the design of supramolecular photocatalysts.

         <title>Tuning Active Site Flexibility by Defect Engineering of Graphene Ribbon Edge&#8208;hosted Fe&#8722;N3 Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper elucidates the critical role of vertical displacement of Fe atom, which can be modulated by defect engineering, in tuning the electron structure and stabilizing the transition state of rate&#8208;determining step, and demonstrates that the catalytic transfer hydrogenation activity is determined by the flexibility of Fe&#8722;N3 site, which is further affected by the Fe&#8722;N bond length. Importantly, this simple geometric parameter is tunable and readily probed experimentally.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped, carbon&#8208;supported transition metal catalysts are excellent for several reactions. Structural engineering of M&#8722;Nx sites to boost catalytic activity is rarely studied. Here, we demonstrate that the structural flexibility of Fe&#8722;N3 site is vital for tuning the electronic structure of Fe atoms and regulating the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) activity. By introducing carbon defects, we construct Fe&#8722;N3 sites with varying Fe&#8722;N bond lengths distinguishable by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. We investigate the CTH activity by density&#8208;functional theory and microkinetic calculations and reveal that the vertical displacement of the Fe atom out of the plane of the support, induced by the Fe&#8722;N3 distortion, raises the Fe 
orbital and strengthens binding. We propose that the activity is controlled by the relaxation of the reconstructed site, which is further affected by Fe&#8722;N bond length, an excellent activity descriptor. We elucidate the origin of the CTH activity and principles for high&#8208;performing Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts by defect engineering.

To flow or not to flow ? Assessing feasibility and guiding chemists with a priori computational intelligence for reaction optimization under continuous flow conditions.







Abstract
The use of micro/meso&#8208;fluidic reactors has resulted in both new scenarios for chemistry and new requirements for chemists. Through flow chemistry, large&#8208;scale reactions can be performed in drastically reduced reactor sizes and reaction times. This obvious advantage comes with the concomitant challenge of re&#8208;designing long&#8208;established batch processes to fit these new conditions. The reliance on experimental trial&#8208;and&#8208;error to perform this translation frequently makes flow chemistry unaffordable, thwarting initial aspirations to revolutionize chemistry. By combining computational chemistry and machine learning, we have developed a model that provides predictive power tailored specifically to flow reactions. We show its applications to translate batch to flow, to provide mechanistic insight, to contribute reagent descriptors, and to synthesize a library of novel compounds in excellent yields after executing a single set of conditions.

The synthesis of axially chiral azomethine imines through copper&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed ring closure of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides is described, showing high efficiency, mild conditions, broad scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. Biological studies revealed the neuroprotective activity of the S product for dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting apoptosis induced by oxaliplatin.







Abstract
Azomethine imines, as a prominent class of 1,3&#8208;dipolar species, hold great significance and potential in organic and medicinal chemistry. However, the reported synthesis of centrally chiral azomethine imines relies on kinetic resolution, and the construction of axially chiral azomethine imines remains unexplored. Herein, we present the synthesis of axially chiral azomethine imines through copper&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed ring&#8208;closure reactions of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides, showcasing high efficiency, mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. Furthermore, the biological evaluation revealed that the synthesized axially chiral azomethine imines effectively protect dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting apoptosis induced by oxaliplatin, offering a promising therapeutic approach for chemotherapy&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Remarkably, the (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;atropisomers displayed distinct neuroprotective activities, underscoring the significance of axial stereochemistry.

         <title>Origin of Stability and Activity Enhancements in Pt&#8208;based Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalysts via Defect&#8208;Mediated Dopant Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhanced activity and stability of surface&#8208;doped Pt alloy catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is linked to the formation of stable transition metal oxy(hydroxy) structures. Here, an atomic&#8208;scale description for group VI transition metal oxide&#8208;doped Pt metals is developed, and a link between structure and reactivity is established. Mo and Ir are identified as doping elements that stabilize Pt edge sites and enhance ORR activity.







Abstract
Platinum alloys are highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic conditions.

     alt="Origin of Stability and Activity Enhancements in Pt-based Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalysts via Defect-Mediated Dopant Adsorption"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enhanced activity and stability of surface-doped Pt alloy catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is linked to the formation of stable transition metal oxy(hydroxy) structures. Here, an atomic-scale description for group VI transition metal oxide-doped Pt metals is developed, and a link between structure and reactivity is established. Mo and Ir are identified as doping elements that stabilize Pt edge sites and enhance ORR activity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platinum alloys are highly efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic conditions. However, these alloys are susceptible to metal loss through leaching and degradation, leading to reduced catalyst stability and activity.

Here, to achieve atomic scale understanding of the exceptional activity and stability of these alloys, we present a detailed density functional theory description of the dopants&#8217; structures and impact on electrocatalyst properties.

         <title>Integrated Conversion of Lignocellulosic Biomass to Bio&#8208;Based Amphiphiles using a Functionalization&#8208;Defunctionalization Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated &#8220;functionalization&#8208;defunctionalization&#8221; approach efficiently produces bio&#8208;based surfactants directly from the hemicellulose and lignin fractions of lignocellulosic biomass. The performance of the resulting sugar and lignin&#8208;based surfactants are competitive with existing commercial products, highlighting the potential for using these biomass fractions as surfactants with minimal structural modification.







Abstract
Concerns over the sustainability and end&#8208;of&#8208;life properties of fossil&#8208;derived surfactants have driven interest in bio&#8208;based alternatives. Lignocellulosic biomass with its polar functional groups is an obvious feedstock for surfactant production but its use is limited by process complexity and low yield. Here, we present a simple two&#8208;step approach to prepare bio&#8208;based amphiphiles directly from hemicellulose and lignin at high yields (29&#8201;% w/w based on the total raw biomass and &gt;80&#8201;% w/w of these two fractions). Acetal functionalization of xylan and lignin with fatty aldehydes during fractionation introduced hydrophobic segments and subsequent defunctionalization by hydrogenolysis of the xylose derivatives or acidic hydrolysis of the lignin derivatives produced amphiphiles. The resulting biodegradable xylose acetals and/or ethers, and lignin&#8208;based amphiphilic polymers both largely retained their original natural structures, but exhibited competitive or superior surface activity in water/oil systems compared to common bio&#8208;based surfactants.

         <title>Surface Activation by Single Ru Atoms for Enhanced High&#8208;Temperature CO2 Electrolysis</title>

Stable single Ru atoms on the surface of Ce0.8Sm0.2O2&#8208;&#948; (SDC) could evidently modify the electronic structure of SDC surface for favorable oxygen vacancy formation and enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, finally evoking the electrocatalytic activity of SDC for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis.







Abstract
Cathodic CO2 adsorption and activation is essential for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis in solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs). However, the component of oxygen ionic conductor in the cathode displays limited electrocatalytic activity. Herein, stable single Ruthenium (Ru) atoms are anchored on the surface of oxygen ionic conductor (Ce0.8Sm0.2O2&#8208;&#948;, SDC) via the strong covalent metal&#8208;support interaction, which evidently modifies the electronic structure of SDC surface for favorable oxygen vacancy formation and enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, finally evoking the electrocatalytic activity of SDC for high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis. Experimentally, SOEC with the Ru1/SDC&#8208;La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; cathode exhibits a current density as high as 2.39&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.6&#8197;V and 800&#8201;&#176;C. This work expands the application of single atom catalyst to the high&#8208;temperature electrocatalytic reaction in SOEC and provides an efficient strategy to tailor the electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity of SOEC cathode at the atomic scale.

         <title>Cascade Reactions of Aryl&#8208;Substituted Terminal Alkynes Involving in Situ&#8208;Generated &#945;&#8208;Imino Gold Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of terminal aryl alkynes with sulfilimines was achieved. It proceeds via an intermolecular gold carbene generation/C&#8722;H annulation followed by a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization or Pictet&#8211;Spengler reactions to selectively form fused indoles. The formation of 2&#8208;substituted indoles and imidazoles derivatives through gold&#8208;catalyzed cyclization is also presented.







Abstract
An efficient, highly selective and divergent synthetic method to construct 2&#8208;substituted indoles and aryl&#8208;annulated carbazoles via the intermolecular generation of &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbenes from terminal alkynes or diynes in combination with sulfilimines is disclosed. Importantly, the tandem reaction is proposed to proceed through an intermolecular gold carbene generation/C&#8722;H annulation followed by the activation of a second alkyne leading to 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization, which is significantly different from previous dual activation or 1,6&#8208;carbene shift approaches for diyne systems. In the case of ortho&#8208;alkynylaniline as starting material, an unexpected regioselective formation of the indole moiety via the intermolecular path, instead of intramolecular hydroamination was discovered. This reactivity paved the way for a one&#8208;pot synthesis of the 11H&#8208;indolo [3,2&#8208;c] quinoline scaffold by exploiting the formed amino indole for a subsequent Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction with aldehydes. The photophysical properties of the carbazoles indicated good violet&#8208;blue emission with quantum yields up to 40&#8201;%.

         <title>Asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La Species Enabling Atomic&#8208;Level Donor&#8208;Acceptor Structure and Favored Reaction Thermodynamics for Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>

         <dc:description>
The asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species enables the establishment of an atomic&#8208;level donor&#8208;acceptor structure, facilitating the migration of electrons from La atoms to the reactive Cu atom sites. Intermediates adsorbed on Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species in the CH4 production from CO2 form are more thermodynamically favorable. The photocatalyst exhibits outstanding CH4 selectivity (91.6&#8201;%) and high CH4 production rate (125.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1), over ten times of that for CN.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction into ideal hydrocarbon fuels, such as CH4, is a sluggish kinetic process involving adsorption of multiple intermediates and multi&#8208;electron steps. Achieving high CH4 activity and selectivity therefore remains a great challenge, which largely depends on the efficiency of photogenerated charge separation and transfer as well as the intermediate energy levels in CO2 reduction. Herein, we construct La and Cu dual&#8208;atom anchored carbon nitride (LaCu/CN), with La&#8208;N4 and Cu&#8208;N3 coordination bonds connected by Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La bridges. The asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species enables the establishment of an atomic&#8208;level donor&#8208;acceptor structure, which allows the migration of electrons from La atoms to the reactive Cu atom sites. Simultaneously, intermediates during CO2 reduction on LaCu/CN demonstrate thermodynamically more favorable process for CH4 formation based on theoretical calculations. Eventually, LaCu/CN exhibits a high selectivity (91.6&#8201;%) for CH4 formation with a yield of 125.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1, over ten times of that for pristine CN. This work presents a strategy for designing multi&#8208;functional dual&#8208;atom based photocatalysts.

The photocatalyst exhibits outstanding CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity (91.6&#8201;%) and high CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production rate (125.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), over ten times of that for CN.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction into ideal hydrocarbon fuels, such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, is a sluggish kinetic process involving adsorption of multiple intermediates and multi-electron steps. Achieving high CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; activity and selectivity therefore remains a great challenge, which largely depends on the efficiency of photogenerated charge separation and transfer as well as the intermediate energy levels in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. Herein, we construct La and Cu dual-atom anchored carbon nitride (LaCu/CN), with La-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coordination bonds connected by Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La bridges. The asymmetric Cu&#8722;N&#8722;La species enables the establishment of an atomic-level donor-acceptor structure, which allows the migration of electrons from La atoms to the reactive Cu atom sites. Simultaneously, intermediates during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction on LaCu/CN demonstrate thermodynamically more favorable process for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; formation based on theoretical calculations. Eventually, LaCu/CN exhibits a high selectivity (91.6&#8201;%) for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; formation with a yield of 125.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, over ten times of that for pristine CN. This work presents a strategy for designing multi-functional dual-atom based photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzymatic Peptide and Protein Bromination: The BromoTrp Tag</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered variant of the Trp 6&#8208;halogenase Thal allows post&#8208;translational bromination of a tetrapeptide tag with C&#8208;terminal tryptophan in proteins on a preparative scale using the brominating E. coli coexpression strain Brocoli. The bromoarene can be derivatized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling at 37&#8201;&#176;C. This opens new avenues for bio&#8208;orthogonal modification of proteins by biocatalytic bromination of minimally tagged proteins.







Abstract
Bio&#8208;orthogonal reactions for modification of proteins and unprotected peptides are of high value in chemical biology. The combination of enzymatic halogenation with transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling provides a feasible approach for the modification of proteins and unprotected peptides. By a semirational protein engineering approach, variants of the tryptophan 6&#8208;halogenase Thal were identified that enable efficient bromination of peptides with a C&#8208;terminal tryptophan residue. The substrate scope was explored using di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrapeptide arrays, leading to the identification of an optimized peptide tag we named BromoTrp tag. This tag was introduced into three model proteins. Preparative scale post&#8208;translational bromination was possible with only a single cultivation and purification step using the brominating E. coli coexpression system Brocoli. Palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of the bromoarene was achieved with Pd nanoparticle catalysts at 37&#8201;&#176;C, highlighting the rich potential of this strategy for bio&#8208;orthogonal functionalization and conjugation.

         <title>Accelerating S&#8596;Li2S Reactions in Li&#8211;S Batteries through Activation of S/Li2S with a Bifunctional Semiquinone Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reaction pathway that a soluble semiquinone serves as bifunction catalyst for reducing S and oxidizing Li2S is firstly demonstrated to substantially improve the reaction kinetic of S&#8596;Li2S interconversion, and the assembled Li&#8722;S batteries exhibit the remarkable performance.







Abstract
The reaction rate bottleneck during interconversion between insulating S8 (S) and Li2S fundamentally leads to incomplete conversion and restricted lifespan of Li&#8722;S battery, especially under high S loading and lean electrolyte conditions. Herein, we demonstrate a new catalytic chemistry: soluble semiquinone, 2&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;semianthraquinone lithium (Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722;), as both e&#8208;/Li+ donor and acceptor for simultaneous S reduction and Li2S oxidation. The efficient activation of S and Li2S by Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722; in the initial discharging/charging state maximizes the amount of soluble lithium polysulfide, thereby substantially improve the rate of solid&#8211;liquid&#8208;solid reaction by promoting long&#8208;range electron transfer. With in situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the activation of S/Li2S is the rate&#8208;limiting step for effective S utilization under high S loading and low E/S ratio. Beyond that, the S activation ratio is firstly proposed as an accurate indicator to quantitatively evaluate the reaction rate. As a result, the Li&#8722;S batteries with Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722; deliver superior cycling performance and over 5 times higher S utilization ratio at high S loading of 7.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a current rate of 1&#8197;C compared to those without Li+TBAQ&#8901;&#8722;. We hope this study contributes to the fundamental understanding of S redox chemical and inspires the design of efficient catalysis for advanced Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>One Collision&#8212;Two Substituents: Gas&#8208;Phase Preparation of Xylenes under Single&#8208;Collision Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uncovers gas&#8208;phase synthesis of xylenes through an isomer&#8208;selective reaction of 1&#8208;propynyl radical with C5H8 isomers (2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene, 1,3&#8208;pentadiene). Our study established a hitherto unknown gas&#8208;phase route to xylenes and potentially more complex, disubstituted benzenes via a single collision event highlighting the significance of an alkyl&#8208;substituted ethynyl&#8208;mediated preparation of aromatic molecules in our Universe.







Abstract
The fundamental reaction pathways to the simplest dialkylsubstituted aromatics&#8212;xylenes (C6H4(CH3)2)&#8212;in high&#8208;temperature combustion flames and in low&#8208;temperature extraterrestrial environments are still unknown, but critical to understand the chemistry and molecular mass growth processes in these extreme environments. Exploiting crossed molecular beam experiments augmented by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronic structure and statistical calculations, this study uncovers a previously elusive, facile gas&#8208;phase synthesis of xylenes through an isomer&#8208;selective reaction of 1&#8208;propynyl (methylethynyl, CH3CC) with 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (isoprene, C5H8). The reaction dynamics are driven by a barrierless addition of the radical to the diene moiety of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene followed by extensive isomerization (hydrogen shifts, cyclization) prior to unimolecular decomposition accompanied by aromatization via atomic hydrogen loss. This overall exoergic reaction affords a preparation of xylenes not only in high&#8208;temperature environments such as in combustion flames and around circumstellar envelopes of carbon&#8208;rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, but also in low&#8208;temperature cold molecular clouds (10&#8197;K) and in hydrocarbon&#8208;rich atmospheres of planets and their moons such as Triton and Titan. Our study established a hitherto unknown gas&#8208;phase route to xylenes and potentially more complex, disubstituted benzenes via a single collision event highlighting the significance of an alkyl&#8208;substituted ethynyl&#8208;mediated preparation of aromatic molecules in our Universe.

         <title>Improving Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation through Dynamic Lattice Hydrogen Migration in Pd@Pt Core&#8208;Shell Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic lattice hydrogen (LH) migration mechanism is proposed to understand the two orders of magnitude enhancement of the kinetics for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on Pd@Pt core&#8211;shell model than pure Pd. Surface Pt atoms promote the H2 dissociation and the adsorbed hydrogen (Had) incorporation into the Pd lattice. Internal PdHx (PdHab) act as a hydrogen reservoir, providing LH to migrate to the surface Pt and combine with OH&#8722; to form water.







Abstract

     alt="Improving Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation through Dynamic Lattice Hydrogen Migration in Pd@Pt Core-Shell Electrocatalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dynamic lattice hydrogen (LH) migration mechanism is proposed to understand the two orders of magnitude enhancement of the kinetics for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) on Pd@Pt core&#8211;shell model than pure Pd. Surface Pt atoms promote the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation and the adsorbed hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;) incorporation into the Pd lattice. Internal PdH&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (PdH&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;) act as a hydrogen reservoir, providing LH to migrate to the surface Pt and combine with OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to form water.

         <title>Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to HCOOH and CO by a Phosphine&#8208;Bipyridine&#8208;Phosphine Ir(III) Catalyst: Photophysics, Nonadiabatic Effects, Mechanism, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly accurate multi&#8208;reference calculations reveal the photophysical processes of a PNNP&#8208;type iridium catalyst, namely [Ir(III)H]+, and its subsequent reduction reactions to either HCOOH or CO. The present results depict the efficient reaction scenario, explain the origin of the HCOOH selectivity, and contribute to design new photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is one of the best solutions to solve the global energy crisis and to realize carbon neutralization. The tetradentate phosphine&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;phosphine (PNNP)&#8208;type Ir(III) photocatalyst, Mes&#8208;IrPCY2, was reported with a high HCOOH selectivity but the photocatalytic mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we employ electronic structure methods in combination with radiative, nonradiative, and electron transfer rate calculations, to explore the entire photocatalytic cycle to either HCOOH or CO, based on which a new mechanistic scenario is proposed. The catalytic reduction reaction starts from the generation of the precursor metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) state. Subsequently, the divergence happens from the 3MLCT state, the single electron transfer (SET) and deprotonation process lead to the formation of one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced species and Ir(I) species, which initiate the reduction reaction to HCOOH and CO, respectively. Interestingly, the efficient occurrence of proton or electron transfer reduces barriers of critical steps. In addition, nonadiabatic transitions play a nonnegligible role in the cycle. We suggest a lower free&#8208;energy barrier in the reaction&#8208;limiting step and the very efficient SET in 3MLCT are cooperatively responsible for a high HCOOH selectivity. The gained mechanistic insights could help chemists to understand, regulate, and design photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction of similar function&#8208;integrated molecular photocatalyst.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Mixed Metal Sulfamates with Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Properties and Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of mixed alkali metal&#8208;alkaline earth metal sulfamate, Cs2Mg(NH2SO3)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O, with the consistent&#8208;orientation&#8208;alignment of polar [NH2SO3] tetrahedra exhibits an exceptionally large dipole moment, yielding a wide deep&#8208;UV transparent window, an enhanced SHG response of ca. 2.3&#8197;times that of KDP, and a suited birefringence of 0.054 at 546.1&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Enhancing anisotropy through the controlled arrangement of anionic groups is essential for improving the nonlinear optical (NLO) performance of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. In this study, we present the successful synthesis of the first examples of mixed alkali metal&#8208;alkaline earth metal sulfamate materials, including noncentrosymmetric Cs2Mg(NH2SO3)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O (1), as well as centrosymmetric K2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (2) and Rb2Ca(NH2SO3)4 (3). All three compounds feature promising deep ultraviolet cut&#8208;off edges, notably 1 with a cut&#8208;off edge below 180&#8197;nm. The synergy of Cs+ and Mg2+ cations in 1 facilitated the successful alignment of polar [NH2SO3] tetrahedra in a uniform orientation. Remarkably, 1 stands as the sole instance among reported sulfamate compounds with a co&#8208;parallel anionic arrangement, yielding a very large dipole moment compared to other non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials. Moreover, the substantial dipole moment of 1 yields an enhanced second harmonic generation response, approximately 2.3&#8197;times that of KH2PO4, and a large birefringence of 0.054 at 546.1&#8197;nm. The approach of regulating the arrangement of anionic groups using aliovalent cations holds promise for advancing the exploration of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated NLO materials.

A small&#8208;molecule n&#8208;type semiconductor&#8208;based organic electrochemical neuronal synapse (OENS) enables superior synapse characteristics in a single device with an unprecedented combination of facile fabrication, excellent ambient stability, and robust and flexible tunability. The OENS was used as a biosensor to detect dopamine at sub&#8208;micromolar level in aqueous electrolyte.







Abstract
The ion/chemical&#8208;based modulation feature of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) are critical to advancing next generation bio&#8208;integrated neuromorphic hardware. Despite achievements with polymeric OMIECs in organic electrochemical neuronal synapse (OENS). However, small molecule OMIECs based OENS has not yet been realized. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate an effective materials design concept of combining n&#8208;type fused all&#8208;acceptor small molecule OMIECs with subtle side chain optimization that enables robustly and flexibly modulating versatile synaptic behavior and sensing neurotransmitter in solid or aqueous electrolyte, operating in accumulation modes. By judicious tuning the ending side chains, the linear oligoether and butyl chain derivative gNR&#8208;Bu exhibits higher recognition accuracy for a model artificial neural network (ANN) simulation, higher steady conductance states and more outstanding ambient stability, which is superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art n&#8208;type OMIECs based OENS. These superior artificial synapse characteristics of gNR&#8208;Bu can be attributed to its higher crystallinity with stronger ion bonding capacities. More impressively, we unprecedentedly realized n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule OMIECs based OENS as a neuromorphic biosensor enabling to respond synaptic communication signals of dopamine even at sub&#8208;&#956;M level in aqueous electrolyte. This work may open a new path of small&#8208;molecule ion&#8208;electron conductors for next&#8208;generation ANN and bioelectronics.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete azooligomers and their corresponding assemblies were synthesized by an iterative exponential growth strategy involving dynamic helicity inversion and chirality transfer. The interconversion of H&#8208;aggregates and J&#8208;aggregates in discrete azooligomer assemblies results in different helicity reversals and morphological transitions.







Abstract
Unraveling the chirality transfer mechanism of polymer assemblies and controlling their handedness is beneficial for exploring the origin of hierarchical chirality and developing smart materials with desired chiroptical activities. However, polydisperse polymers often lead to an ambiguous or statistical evaluation of the structure&#8211;property relationship, and it remains unclear how the iterative number of repeating units function in the helicity inversion of polymer assemblies. Herein, we report the macroscopic helicity and dynamic manipulation of the chiroptical activity of supramolecular assemblies from discrete azobenzene&#8208;containing oligomers (azooligomers), together with the helicity inversion and morphological transition achieved solely by changing the iterative chain lengths. The corresponding assemblies also differ from their polydisperse counterparts in terms of thermodynamic properties, chiroptical activities, and morphological control.

         <title>Interphase Regulation by Multifunctional Additive Empowering High Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Enhanced Cycle Life and Thermal Safety</title>

A novel multifunctional additive of lithium tetrafluoro (1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) phosphate (LiTFTCP) is designed to effectively suppress the HF generation and facilitate the formation of a robust and heat&#8208;resistant cyano&#8208;enriched CEI layer as well as a stable LiF&#8208;enriched SEI layer, empowering NCM811/S650 full cells with enhanced cycle life and thermal safety.







Abstract
High energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) adopting high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes and silicon&#8208;based composite anodes always suffer from unsatisfied cycle life and poor safety performance, especially at elevated temperatures. Electrode /electrolyte interphase regulation by functional additives is one of the most economic and efficacious strategies to overcome this shortcoming. Herein, cyano&#8208;groups (&#8722;CN) are introduced into lithium fluorinated phosphate to synthesize a novel multifunctional additive of lithium tetrafluoro (1,2&#8208;dihydroxyethane&#8208;1,1,2,2&#8208;tetracarbonitrile) phosphate (LiTFTCP), which endows high nickel LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/SiOx&#8208;graphite composite full cell with an ultrahigh cycle life and superior safety characteristics, by adding only 0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% LiTFTCP into a LiPF6&#8208;carbonate baseline electrolyte. It is revealed that LiTFTCP additive effectively suppresses the HF generation and facilitates the formation of a robust and heat&#8208;resistant cyano&#8208;enriched CEI layer as well as a stable LiF&#8208;enriched SEI layer. The favorable SEI/CEI layers greatly lessen the electrode degradation, electrolyte consumption, thermal&#8208;induced gassing and total heat&#8208;releasing. This work illuminates the importance of additive molecular engineering and interphase regulation in simultaneously promoting the cycling and thermal safety of LIBs with high&#8208;nickel NCMxyz cathode and silicon&#8208;based composite anode.

         <title>Photocatalytic Production of Ethanolamines and Ethylenediamines from Bio&#8208;Polyols over a Cu/TiO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu/TiO2 catalyst with multiple active sites was developed to produce ethanolamines and ethylenediamines from bio&#8208;polyols via a photocatalytic process in one pot. Oxidation by photogenerated holes over TiO2 was responsible for the C&#8722;C bond cleavage of polyols, and metallic copper was active for reductive amination via self&#8208;hydrogen transfer. It affords a novel strategy for biomass conversion to aminated compounds under mild conditions.







Abstract
Valorization of biomass&#8208;derived polyols into high&#8208;value&#8208;added ethanolamines and ethylenediamines is highly attractive. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step photocatalytic protocol to convert bio&#8208;polyols into a 60&#8201;% yield of ethanolamines and ethylenediamines over a multifunctional Cu/TiO2 catalyst. This catalyst enables a tandem process of photocatalytic polyol C&#8722;C bond cleavage and reductive amination in one pot at room temperature, and also allows the selective conversion of various bio&#8208;polyols and amines. Mechanistic studies revealed that photogenerated holes in TiO2 promote the retro&#8208;aldol C&#8722;C bond cleavage or oxidative dehydrogenation of polyols, and photogenerated electrons accumulate on small&#8208;sized Cu clusters, which facilitate the reductive amination via hydrogen transfer and prevent the H2 generation. This strategy provides new opportunities for the development of non&#8208;noble metal photocatalysts and methods of biomass conversion under mild conditions.

         <title>A Homopolymer of Xanthenoxanthene&#8208;Based Polycyclic Heteroaromatic for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting homopolymer, hailing from an electron&#8208;rich peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene&#8208;based polycyclic aromatic monomer, produces uniform films with heightened hole mobility, amplified modulus, and constrained species diffusion. These attributes enable the construction of perovskite solar cells with an initial average efficiency of 24.6&#8201;%, which also exhibit enhanced thermostability at 85&#8201;&#176;C and operational durability.







Abstract
Highly efficient perovskite solar cells typically rely on spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as a hole transporter, achieving a 25.7&#8201;% efficiency record. However, these cells are susceptible to harsh 85&#8201;&#176;C conditions. Here, we present a peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene&#8208;based semiconducting homopolymer (p&#8208;TNI2) with matched energy levels and a high molecular weight, synthesized nearly quantitatively through facile oxidative polymerization. Compared to established materials, p&#8208;TNI2 excels in hole mobility, morphology, modulus, and waterproofing. Implementing p&#8208;TNI2 as the hole transport layer results in n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells with an initial average efficiency of 24.6&#8201;%, rivaling 24.4&#8201;% for the spiro&#8208;OMeTAD control cells under identical conditions. Furthermore, the p&#8208;TNI2&#8208;based cells exhibit enhanced thermostability at 85&#8201;&#176;C and operational robustness.

         <title>A Fully Amorphous, Dynamic Cross&#8208;Linked Polymer Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Operating at Subzero&#8208;Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>

We demonstrate a fully amorphous quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte with a dynamic cross&#8208;linked network composed of a star&#8208;shaped plasticising polymer and a linear poly&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane. The electrolyte achieves high Li+ conductivity (2.96&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and high tLi+ (0.81), and the as&#8208;prepared solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries exhibit high reversible capacity and long cycle life when operating at subzero temperature conditions.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries have shown prospects as safe, high&#8208;energy electrochemical storage technology for powering regional electrified transportation. Owing to limited ion mobility in crystalline polymer electrolytes, the battery is incapable of operating at subzero temperature. Addition of liquid plasticizer into the polymer electrolyte improves the Li&#8208;ion conductivity yet sacrifices the mechanical strength and interfacial stability with both electrodes. In this work, we showed that by introducing a spherical hyperbranched solid polymer plasticizer into a Li+&#8208;conductive linear polymer matrix, an integrated dynamic cross&#8208;linked polymer network was built to maintain fully amorphous in a wide temperature range down to subzero. A quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte with a solid mass content &gt;90&#8201;% was prepared from the cross&#8208;linked polymer network, and demonstrated fast Li+ conduction at a low temperature, high mechanical strength, and stable interfacial chemistry. As a result, solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries employing the new electrolyte delivered high reversible capacity and long cycle life at 25&#8201;&#176;C, 0&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C to serve energy storage at complex environmental conditions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries have shown prospects as safe, high-energy electrochemical storage technology for powering regional electrified transportation. Owing to limited ion mobility in crystalline polymer electrolytes, the battery is incapable of operating at subzero temperature. Addition of liquid plasticizer into the polymer electrolyte improves the Li-ion conductivity yet sacrifices the mechanical strength and interfacial stability with both electrodes. In this work, we showed that by introducing a spherical hyperbranched solid polymer plasticizer into a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-conductive linear polymer matrix, an integrated dynamic cross-linked polymer network was built to maintain fully amorphous in a wide temperature range down to subzero. A quasi-solid polymer electrolyte with a solid mass content &amp;gt;90&#8201;% was prepared from the cross-linked polymer network, and demonstrated fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conduction at a low temperature, high mechanical strength, and stable interfacial chemistry. As a result, solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries employing the new electrolyte delivered high reversible capacity and long cycle life at 25&#8201;&#176;C, 0&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C to serve energy storage at complex environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insulin&#8208;like Growth Factor 2&#8208;Tagged Aptamer Chimeras (ITACs) Modular Assembly for Targeted and Efficient Degradation of Two Membrane Proteins</title>

Insulin&#8208;like growth factor 2 (IGF2)&#8208;tagged aptamer chimeras (ITACs) enable robust targeted degradation of pathogenic membrane proteins and allow simultaneous degradation of two membrane proteins.







Abstract
Overexpression of pathogenic membrane proteins drives abnormal proliferation and invasion of tumor cells. Various strategies to durably knockdown membrane proteins with heterobifunctional degraders have been successfully developed, including LYTAC, KineTAC, and AbTAC. However, challenges including complicated synthetic procedures and the inability to simultaneously degrade multiple pathogenic proteins still exist. Herein, we developed insulin&#8208;like growth factor 2 (IGF2)&#8208;tagged aptamer chimeras (ITACs) that link the cell&#8208;surface lysosome&#8208;targeting receptor IGF2R and membrane proteins of interest (POIs) based on specific recognition of aptamers to the POIs and high&#8208;affinity binding of IGF2 to IGF2R. We demonstrated that ITACs exhibit robust degradation efficiency of various membrane proteins in multiple cell lines. Furthermore, systematic studies revealed that a moderate cell&#8208;surface IGF2R level is responsible for the excellent degradation performance of ITACs. Importantly, we further established a modular assembly strategy that allows assembly of one IGF2 with two aptamers with precise stoichiometry (dITACs), enabling cooperative and simultaneous degradation of two membrane proteins. This work provides an efficient and facile target membrane protein degradation platform and will shed light on the treatment of diseases related to the overexpression of membrane proteins.

         <title>Implanting Transition Metal into Li2O&#8208;Based Cathode Prelithiation Agent for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and Long&#8208;Life Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely implanting Co into specific Li sites within the Li2O framework adjusts band structures, weakens the Li&#8722;O interaction, and accelerates the decomposition kinetics of Li2O. It can serve as a cathode prelithiation agent to compensate for the irreversible lithium loss during the initial cycling, thus enhancing the energy density and cycle life of practical Li&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cells.







Abstract
Compensating the irreversible loss of limited active lithium (Li) is essentially important for improving the energy&#8208;density and cycle&#8208;life of practical Li&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cell, especially after employing high&#8208;capacity but low initial coulombic efficiency anode candidates. Introducing prelithiation agent can provide additional Li source for such compensation. Herein, we precisely implant trace Co (extracted from transition metal oxide) into the Li site of Li2O, obtaining (Li0.66Co0.11&#9633;0.23)2O (CLO) cathode prelithiation agent. The synergistic formation of Li vacancies and Co&#8208;derived catalysis efficiently enhance the inherent conductivity and weaken the Li&#8722;O interaction of Li2O, which facilitates its anionic oxidation to peroxo/superoxo species and gaseous O2, achieving 1642.7&#8197;mAh/g~Li2O prelithiation capacity (&#8776;980&#8197;mAh/g for prelithiation agent). Coupled 6.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% CLO&#8208;based prelithiation agent with LiCoO2 cathode, substantial additional Li source stored within CLO is efficiently released to compensate the Li consumption on the SiO/C anode, achieving 270&#8197;Wh/kg pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cell with 92&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Iodonium Initiators: Paving the Air&#8208;free Oxidation of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;component iodonium initiators with strong oxidability and different electron delocalization properties were designed to replace lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine in doped 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD), which can oxidize Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD without air assistance. The devices based on this oxidizing Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD showed excellent efficiencies of 25.16&#8201;% (certified: 24.85&#8201;% for 0.062&#8208;cm2) and 20.71&#8201;% for a 15.03&#8208;cm2 module as well as remarkable overall stability.







Abstract
To date, perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) with doped 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD) hole transporting layers (HTLs) have shown the highest recorded power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). However, their commercialization is still impeded by poor device stability owing to the hygroscopic lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and volatile 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine dopants as well as time&#8208;consuming oxidation in air. In this study, we explored a series of single&#8208;component iodonium initiators with strong oxidability and different electron delocalization properties to precisely manipulate the oxidation states of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD without air assistance, and the oxidation mechanism was clearly understood. Iodine (III) in the diphenyliodonium cation (IP+) can accept a single electron from Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and forms Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8901;+ owing to its strong oxidability. Moreover, because of the coordination of the strongly delocalized TFSI&#8722; with Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8901;+ in a stable radical complex, the resulting hole mobility was 30&#8197;times higher than that of pristine Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. In addition, the IP&#8208;TFSI initiator facilitated the growth of a homogeneous and pinhole&#8208;free Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD film. The pero&#8208;SCs based on this oxidizing HTL showed excellent efficiencies of 25.16&#8201;% (certified: 24.85&#8201;% for 0.062&#8208;cm2) and 20.71&#8201;% for a 15.03&#8208;cm2 module as well as remarkable overall stability.

         <title>Tetra&#8208;Coordinated W2S3 for Efficient Dual&#8208;pH Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metallic tetra&#8208;coordinated W2S3 crystal has been reported based on the theoretical structure prediction in combination with experimental results. For application in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) and anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolysers, W2S3 as the cathode catalyst yields excellent bifunctionality index (&#627;@1Acm&#8722;2,PEM=1.73&#8197;V, &#627;@1Acm&#8722;2,AEM=1.77&#8197;V) and long&#8208;term stability (471 h@PEM, 360 h@AEM).







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as promising catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) that play a crucial role in renewable energy technologies.

         <title>Red&#8208;Light Activation of a Microtubule Polymerization Inhibitor via Amide Functionalization of the Ruthenium Photocage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylamide functionalization of a green light&#8208;sensitive photoactivated chemotherapy agent based on ruthenium fine&#8208;tuned its excited states, dramatically improving red light absorption. The new prodrug inhibited microtubule polymerization under red light activation, efficiently killing cancer cells in vitro. In vivo, red light activation shrank non&#8208;melanoma skin tumors in mice, while in the dark the prodrug showed improved biosafety.







Abstract
Photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) is a promising cancer treatment modality that kills cancer cells via photochemical uncaging of a cytotoxic drug. Most ruthenium&#8208;based photocages used for PACT are activated with blue or green light, which penetrates sub&#8208;optimally into tumor tissues. Here, we report amide functionalization as a tool to fine&#8208;tune the toxicity and excited states of a terpyridine&#8208;based ruthenium photocage. Due to conjugation of the amide group with the terpyridine &#960; system in the excited state, the absorption of red light (630&#8197;nm) increased 8&#8208;fold, and the photosubstitution rate rose 5&#8208;fold. In vitro, red light activation triggered inhibition of tubulin polymerization, which led to apoptotic cell death both in normoxic (21&#8201;% O2) and hypoxic (1&#8201;% O2) cancer cells. In vivo, red light irradiation of tumor&#8208;bearing mice demonstrated significant tumor volume reduction (45&#8201;%) with improved biosafety, thereby demonstrating the clinical potential of this compound.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ultraviolet Electroluminescence from Multi&#8208;Resonance Phosphine Oxide Polycyclic Aromatics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new phosphine oxide based multi&#8208;resonance (MR) skeleton is demonstrated with CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO featuring highly efficient ultraviolet (UV) multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence, whose device achieved narrow&#8208;band emissions with peaks at &#8776;380&#8197;nm and full widths at half maximum of &#8776;30&#8197;nm, and especially record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies beyond 15&#8201;%.







Abstract
Efficient ultraviolet (UV) electroluminescent materials remain a great challenge, since short peak wavelength &lt;400&#8197;nm and narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) &lt;50&#8197;nm are simultaneously required. In this sense, multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring narrow&#8208;band emissions hold the promise for UV applications. Herein, a novel MR&#8208;TADF skeleton featuring carbazole&#8208;phosphine oxide (P=O) fused aromatics is developed to construct the first two UV MR emitters named CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO. In addition to synergistic resonance effects of P=O and N atom, sp3&#8208;hybrid P atom renders the curved polycyclic planes of CzP2PO and tBCzP2PO, giving rise to their narrowband UV emissions with peak wavelengths &lt;390&#8197;nm and FWHM&lt;35&#8197;nm. Besides configuration quasi&#8208;planarization for radiation enhancement and quenching suppression, P=O moiety further enhances singlet&#8208;triplet coupling to facilitate reverse intersystem crossing, resulting in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence quantum yield of 62&#8201;% in tBCzP2PO doped films. As consequence, tBCzP2PO endowed its UV organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with the peak at 382&#8197;nm and FWHM of 32&#8197;nm, and especially the record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.1&#8201;% among all kinds of UV devices. Our results demonstrate great potential of P=O based MR emitters in practical applications including optoelectronics, biology and medicine science.

         <title>Continuous Nanospace in Nanoporous Liquid Crystal Investigated by 129Xe NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
129Xe NMR spectroscopy of a columnar liquid&#8208;crystalline material fabricated using imine&#8208;bridged shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles revealed a spatiotemporally continuous void inside the column. The diameter of the channel&#8208;like nanospace was estimated to be 0.49&#8197;nm, and the diffusion coefficient of the Xe atoms inside the nanochannels was comparable to those of conventional microporous solid materials.







Abstract
Continuous nanopores within fluid materials could be used for novel chemical events such as the accommodation of guest molecules, unique arrays of the entrapped molecules, and chemical reactions in a dynamic molecular assembly. Columnar liquid crystals composed of a one&#8208;dimensionally stacked assembly of shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles form nanochannels owing to the intrinsic nanospace in the column. However, the existence of substantial nanoporosity has not been confirmed experimentally thus far. In this study, for the first time in the literature, we confirmed the presence of discrete and spatiotemporally continuous voids in a liquid&#8208;crystalline material. In 129Xe NMR spectroscopy of liquid crystalline columnar assembly of imine&#8208;bridged shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles under Xe atmosphere, the NMR signals of the Xe atoms entrapped in the liquid&#8208;crystalline macrocycle depended on the gas pressure and phase&#8208;transition temperatures. These results indicate that the encapsulation of Xe gas molecules within the discrete and oriented nanospaces of nanoporous liquid crystals is different from the homogeneous dissolution of the solute in an ordinary solution.

         <dc:description>
2D&#8208;silica nanosheets undergo edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge oriented interlocking and self&#8208;assembly, resulting in the formation of spherical micron&#8208;sized soccer ball&#8208;like hollow shells (SA&#8208;SiMS). The mechanically robust SA&#8208;SiMS with their with internally open support architecture provide a maximally accessible surface area for embedded metal&#8208;catalysts for high&#8208;temperature methane reforming.







Abstract
Controlled assembly of nanoparticles into well&#8208;defined assembled architectures through precise manipulation of spatial arrangement and interactions allows the development of advanced mesoscale materials with tailored structures, hierarchical functionalities, and enhanced properties. Despite remarkable advancements, the controlled assembly of highly anisotropic 2Dnanosheets is significantly challenging, primarily due to the limited availability of selective edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge connectivity compared to the abundant large faces. Innovative strategies are needed to unlock the full potential of 2D&#8208;nanomaterialsin self&#8208;assembled structures with distinct and desirable properties.

&lt;p&gt;2D-silica nanosheets undergo edge-to-edge oriented interlocking and self-assembly, resulting in the formation of spherical micron-sized soccer ball-like hollow shells (SA-SiMS). The mechanically robust SA-SiMS with their with internally open support architecture provide a maximally accessible surface area for embedded metal-catalysts for high-temperature methane reforming.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlled assembly of nanoparticles into well-defined assembled architectures through precise manipulation of spatial arrangement and interactions allows the development of advanced mesoscale materials with tailored structures, hierarchical functionalities, and enhanced properties. Despite remarkable advancements, the controlled assembly of highly anisotropic 2Dnanosheets is significantly challenging, primarily due to the limited availability of selective edge-to-edge connectivity compared to the abundant large faces. Innovative strategies are needed to unlock the full potential of 2D-nanomaterialsin self-assembled structures with distinct and desirable properties. This research unveils the discovery of controlled self-assembly of 2D-silica nanosheets (2D-SiNSs) into hollow micron-sized soccer ball-like shells (SA-SiMS).

         <title>Partially Ion&#8208;Paired Solvation Structure Design for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries under Extreme Operating Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A partially ion&#8208;paired solvation structure design is demonstrated that combines the beneficial characteristics of contact&#8208;ion pair (CIP) and solvent&#8208;separated ion pair (SSIP) structures. A facile desolvation and preferential reduction of anion/fluorinated co&#8208;solvent for LiF&#8208;dominated interphases are achieved without compromising ionic conductivity, effectively expanding the operational capabilities of lithium batteries under extreme conditions.







Abstract
Achieving increased energy density under extreme operating conditions remains a major challenge in rechargeable batteries. Herein, we demonstrate an all&#8208;fluorinated ester&#8208;based electrolyte comprising partially fluorinated carboxylate and carbonate esters. This electrolyte exhibits temperature&#8208;resilient physicochemical properties and moderate ion&#8208;paired solvation, leading to a half solvent&#8208;separated and half contact&#8208;ion pair in a sole electrolyte. As a result, facile desolvation and preferential reduction of anions/fluorinated co&#8208;solvents for LiF&#8208;dominated interphases are achieved without compromising ionic conductivity (&gt;1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 even at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). These advantageous features were found to apply to both lithium metal and sulfur&#8208;based electrodes even under extreme operating conditions, allowing stable cycling of Li&#8201;||&#8201;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) full cells with high SPAN loading (&gt;3.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and thin Li anode (50&#8197;&#956;m) at &#8722;40, 23 and 50&#8201;&#176;C. This work offers a promising path for designing temperature&#8208;resilient electrolytes to support high energy density Li metal batteries operating in extreme conditions.

         <title>Enhanced Methanol Synthesis over Self&#8208;Limited ZnOx Overlayers on Cu Nanoparticles Formed via Gas&#8208;Phase Migration Route</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn species evaporated from ZnO particles can migrate and deposit onto Cu surface to form Zn oxide (ZnOx) encapsulation layers i.e., strong metal&#8208;support interaction state under CO2 hydrogenation atmosphere at 450&#8201;&#176;C in ZnO||Cu catalyst. The gas&#8208;phase deposition of Zn species and growth of ZnOx overlayer on Cu surface is self&#8208;limited, which constructs an optimal number of ZnOx&#8208;Cu interface sites to have enhanced methanol synthesis activity.







Abstract
Supported metal catalysts are widely used for chemical conversion, in which construction of high density metal&#8208;oxide or oxide&#8208;metal interface is an important means to improve their reaction performance. Here, Cu@ZnOx encapsulation structure has been in situ constructed through gas&#8208;phase migration of Zn species from ZnO particles onto surface of Cu nanoparticles under CO2 hydrogenation atmosphere at 450&#8201;&#176;C. The gas&#8208;phase deposition of Zn species onto the Cu surface and growth of ZnOx overlayer is self&#8208;limited under the high temperature and redox gas (CO2/H2) conditions. Accordingly, high density ZnOx&#8208;Cu interface sites can be effectively tailored to have an enhanced activity in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. This work reveals a new route for the construction of active oxide&#8208;metal interface and classic strong metal&#8208;support interaction state through gas&#8208;phase migration of support species induced by high temperature redox reaction atmosphere.

         <title>Synthetic Strategies for the Selective Functionalization of Carbon Nanodots Allow Optically Communicating Suprastructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon Nanodots (CNDs) were employed as building blocks for crafting optical communicating assemblies. This approach relies on the selective functionalization of CNDs with clickable moieties and their subsequent controlled interconnection. This work provides new insights on the link between molecular and nanoscale events, paving the way to develop selective and addressable CNDs that can act as modular nanoscale synthons.







Abstract
The surface of Carbon Nanodots (CNDs) stands as a rich chemical platform, able to regulate the interactions between particles and external species. Performing selective functionalization of these nanoscale entities is of practical importance, however, it still represents a considerable challenge. In this work, we exploited the organic chemistry toolbox to install target functionalities on the CND surface, while monitoring the chemical changes on the material's outer shell through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Following this, we investigated the use of click chemistry to covalently connect CNDs of different nature en&#8208;route towards covalent suprastructures with unprecedent molecular control. The different photophysical properties of the connected particles allowed their optical communication in the excited state. This work paves the way for the development of selective and addressable CND building blocks which can act as modular nanoscale synthons that mirror the long&#8208;established reactivity of molecular organic synthesis.

         <dc:description>
A donor&#8211;acceptor polymer is reported, showing narrower band gap and higher electrical conductivity than its counterparts monopolymers and therefore excellent rate performance. Our findings provide a novel strategy for developing high performance organic electrode materials through molecular design and will pave a way towards high energy density organic batteries.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials have attracted a lot interest in batteries in recent years. However, most of them still suffer from low performance such as low electrode potential, slow reaction kinetics, and short cycle life. In this work, we report a strategy of fabricating donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers for facilitating the charge transfer and therefore accelerating the reaction kinetics by using the copolymer (p&#8208;TTPZ) of dihydrophenazine (PZ) and thianthrene (TT) as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The D&#8211;A conjugated polymer as p&#8208;type cathode could store anions and exhibited high discharge voltages (two plateaus at 3.82&#8197;V, 3.16&#8197;V respectively), a reversible capacity of 152&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, excellent rate performance with a high capacity of 124.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (&#8776;50&#8197;C) and remarkable cyclability. The performance, especially the rate capability was much higher than that of its counterpart homopolymers without D&#8211;A structure. As a result, the p&#8208;TTPZ//graphite full cells showed a high output voltage (3.26&#8197;V), a discharge specific capacity of 139.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent rate performance. This work provides a novel strategy for developing high performance organic electrode materials through molecular design and will pave a way towards high energy density organic batteries.

The D&#8211;A conjugated polymer as p-type cathode could store anions and exhibited high discharge voltages (two plateaus at 3.82&#8197;V, 3.16&#8197;V respectively), a reversible capacity of 152&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, excellent rate performance with a high capacity of 124.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (&#8776;50&#8197;C) and remarkable cyclability. The performance, especially the rate capability was much higher than that of its counterpart homopolymers without D&#8211;A structure. As a result, the p-TTPZ//graphite full cells showed a high output voltage (3.26&#8197;V), a discharge specific capacity of 139.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and excellent rate performance. This work provides a novel strategy for developing high performance organic electrode materials through molecular design and will pave a way towards high energy density organic batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adaptive and Ultrahigh&#8208;Affinity Recognition in Water by Sulfated Conjugated Corral[5]arene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new water&#8208;soluble corral&#8208;shaped conjugated host bearing ten sulfate groups at its two rims&#8212;namely, SC[5]A&#8212;was synthesized. SC[5]A not only exhibited ultrahigh binding affinities (up to 1011&#8197;M&#8722;1) towards a series of rod&#8208;shaped substrates, but also effectively bound (Ka=106&#8211;108&#8197;M&#8722;1) a wide range of functional substrates. Additionally, the application of SC[5]A in alleviating blood coagulation induced by hexadimethrine bromide was explored.







Abstract
The pursuit of synthetic receptors with high binding affinities has long been a central focus in supramolecular chemistry, driven by their significant practical relevance in various fields. Despite the numerous synthetic receptors that have been developed, most exhibit binding affinities in the micromolar range or lower. Only a few exceptional receptors achieve binding affinities exceeding 109&#8197;M&#8722;1, and their substrate scopes remain rather limited. In this context, we introduce SC[5]A, a conjugated corral&#8208;shaped macrocycle functionalized with ten sulfate groups. Owing to its deep one&#8208;dimensional confined hydrophobic cavity and multiple sulfate groups, SC[5]A displays an extraordinarily high binding strength of up to 1011&#8197;M&#8722;1 towards several size&#8208;matched, rod&#8208;shaped organic dications in water. Besides, its conformation exhibits good adaptability, allowing it to encapsulate a wide range of other guests with diverse molecular sizes, shapes, and functionalities, exhibiting relatively strong affinities (Ka=106&#8211;108&#8197;M&#8722;1). Additionally, we've explored the preliminary application of SC[5]A in alleviating blood coagulation induced by hexadimethrine bromide in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the combination of ultrahigh binding affinities (towards complementary guests) and adaptive recognition capability (towards a wide range of functional guests) of SC[5]A positions it as exceptionally valuable for numerous practical applications.

         <title>Fused&#8208;Ring Pyrrole&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Organic RTP Material for Persistent Afterglow Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) nano&#8208;probes with long emission wavelength faces challenges. In this work, organic RTP materials with near&#8208;infrared emission have been designed and cell membrane encapsulation has been used to optimize the nanomaterial process, achieving high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and imaging penetration depth.







Abstract
Organic near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials offer remarkable advantages in bioimaging due to their characteristic time scales and background noise elimination. However, developing near&#8208;infrared RTP materials for deep tissue imaging still faces challenges since the small band gap may increase the non&#8208;radiative decay, resulting in weak emission and short phosphorescence lifetime. In this study, fused&#8208;ring pyrrole&#8208;based structures were employed as the guest molecules for the construction of long wavelength emissive RTP materials. Compared to the decrease of the singlet energy level, the triplet energy level showed a more effectively decrease with the increase of the conjugation of the substituent groups. Moreover, the sufficient conjugation of fused ring structures in the guest molecule suppresses the non&#8208;radiative decay of triplet excitons. Therefore, a near&#8208;infrared RTP material (764&#8197;nm) was achieved for deep penetration bioimaging. Tumor cell membrane is used to coat RTP nanoparticles (NPs) to avoid decreasing the RTP performance compared to traditional coating by amphiphilic surfactants. RTP NPs with tumor&#8208;targeting properties show favorable phosphorescent properties, superior stability, and excellent biocompatibility. These NPs are applied for time&#8208;resolved luminescence imaging to eliminate background interference with excellent tissue penetration. This study provides a practical solution to prepare long&#8208;wavelength and long&#8208;lifetime organic RTP materials and their applications in bioimaging.

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;End Functionalized Polydienes: Allylic&#8208;Bearing Heteroleptic Aluminums for Selective Alkylation and Transalkylation in Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy has been developed for preparation of polydienes with high cis&#8208;stereoregularity and end&#8208;group functionalization efficiency. This approach utilizes a novel catalytic system in which allylic&#8208;Al moiety exhibits remarkable selectivity for alkylation and transalkylation and improves the end&#8208;group functionality efficiency for polydiene synthesis, showcasing its immense potential for development of advanced polymeric materials.







Abstract
There are still challenges in the preparation of difunctional stereoregular polydienes, especially for the construction of initiating chain&#8208;end functionalization. Coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) provides a way to achieve the goal but usually requires sophisticated functionalized catalysts as well as expensive chain transfer agents (CTAs). In this work, heteroleptic aluminum with oligo(dienyl) substituents (oligo&#8208;Al agents) were readily prepared by living anionic polymerization (LAP) technique. The oligo&#8208;Al agents used in Nd&#8208;mediated CCTPs of dienes exhibit highly selective alkylation and transalkylation features. Kinetics and transfer efficiency studies using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC, and Dosy NMR analyses revealed that the resulting polydienes possess substituents at the initiating chain&#8208;end that have transferred from the oligo&#8208;Al agents. The functionalization efficiency of the initiating chain&#8208;end is up to 99&#8201;%, and the molar mass regulation efficiency of heteroleptic aluminum is higher than that of the traditional CTA AliBu2H (0.608 vs. 0.410). Based on the experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose a mechanism in which allylic&#8208;Al acts as an efficient alkylating moiety in catalyst preformation and also as an effective transfer agent in polymerization. Taking advantage of these features, di&#8208;functionalized polyisoprene, polybutadiene, and poly(isoprene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) can be facilely synthesized.

         <title>Chemical Engineering of Artificial Transcription Factors by Orthogonal Palladium(II)&#8208;Mediated S&#8208;Arylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orthogonal palladium(II) strategy is reported for the site&#8208;selective editing of multiple cysteine residues in peptides and proteins. The power of this approach was demonstrated by the preparation of complex and uniquely modified proteins. The reported palladium(II) chemistry enables rapid and controlled protein editing, opening new avenues to engineer novel biomolecules for fundamental research and therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective functionalization strategies are in high demand to prepare well&#8208;defined homogeneous proteins for basic research and biomedical applications. In this regard, cysteine&#8208;based reactions have enabled a broad set of transformations to produce modified proteins for various applications. However, these approaches were mainly employed to modify a single reactive site with a specific transformation. Achieving site selectivity or multiple transformations, essential for preparing complex biomolecules, remains challenging. Herein we demonstrate the power of combining palladium(II)&#8208;mediated C&#8722;S bond formation and C&#8722;S bond cleavage reactions to selectively edit desired cysteine sites in complex and uniquely modified proteins. We developed an orthogonal palladium(II) strategy for rapid and effective diversification of multiple cysteine sites (3&#8211;6 residues) with various transformations. Importantly, we employed our approach to prepare 10 complex analogues, including modified, stapled, and multimeric proteins on a milligram scale. Furthermore, we also synthesized a focused library of stabilized artificial transcription factors that displayed enhanced stability and potent DNA binding activity.

&lt;p&gt;An orthogonal palladium(II) strategy is reported for the site-selective editing of multiple cysteine residues in peptides and proteins. The power of this approach was demonstrated by the preparation of complex and uniquely modified proteins. The reported palladium(II) chemistry enables rapid and controlled protein editing, opening new avenues to engineer novel biomolecules for fundamental research and therapeutic applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Site-selective functionalization strategies are in high demand to prepare well-defined homogeneous proteins for basic research and biomedical applications. In this regard, cysteine-based reactions have enabled a broad set of transformations to produce modified proteins for various applications. However, these approaches were mainly employed to modify a single reactive site with a specific transformation. Achieving site selectivity or multiple transformations, essential for preparing complex biomolecules, remains challenging. Herein we demonstrate the power of combining palladium(II)-mediated C&#8722;S bond formation and C&#8722;S bond cleavage reactions to selectively edit desired cysteine sites in complex and uniquely modified proteins. We developed an orthogonal palladium(II) strategy for rapid and effective diversification of multiple cysteine sites (3&#8211;6 residues) with various transformations. Importantly, we employed our approach to prepare 10 complex analogues, including modified, stapled, and multimeric proteins on a milligram scale. Furthermore, we also synthesized a focused library of stabilized artificial transcription factors that displayed enhanced stability and potent DNA binding activity. Our approach enables rapid and effective protein editing and opens new avenues to engineer new biomolecules for fundamental research and therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Boron&#8208;Dependent Antibiotic Derived from a Calcium&#8208;Dependent Antibiotic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The side&#8208;chain carboxylates of Asp1 and Asp7 in laspartomycin coordinate with a calcium cation to adopt the active conformation. When these residues were replaced by serine, calcium dependence was eliminated and the resulting synthetic analogue depended instead on phenylboronic acid for its antimicrobial activity.







Abstract
The prevalence of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial pathogens foreshadows a healthcare crisis. Calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotics (CDAs) are promising candidates to combat infectious diseases as many of them show modes of action (MOA) orthogonal to widespread resistance mechanisms. The calcium dependence is nonetheless one of the hurdles toward realizing their full potential. Using laspartomycin C (LspC) as a model, we explored the possibility of reducing, or even eliminating, its calcium dependence. We report herein a synthetic LspC analogue (B1) whose activity no longer depends on calcium and is instead induced by phenylboronic acid (PBA). In LspC, Asp1 and Asp7 coordinate to calcium to anchor it in the active conformation; these residues are replaced by serine in B1 and condense with PBA to form a boronic ester with the same anchoring effect. Using thin&#8208;layer chromatography, MS, NMR, and complementation assays, we demonstrate that B1 inhibits bacterial growth via the same MOA as LspC, i.e., sequestering the cell wall biosynthetic intermediate undecaprenyl phosphate. B1 is as potent and effective as LspC against several Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, including methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin&#8208;resistant Enterococcus. Our success in converting a CDA to a boron&#8208;dependent antibiotic opens a new avenue in the design and functional control of drug molecules.

         <title>Highly Efficient Spatially&#8211;Temporally Synchronized Construction of Robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich Solid&#8211;Electrolyte Interphases in Aqueous Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of constructing spatially&#8211;temporally synchronized (STS) robust solid&#8211;slectrolyte interphases (SEI) in aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries through synergistic chemical precipitation&#8208;electrochemical reduction was proposed. In this case, a robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI protective layer enables intelligent inherent growth at the active site of the hydrogen by the chemical capture of the OH&#8722; stemming from the HER to trigger the ionization balance of dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4&#8722;) shift to insoluble solid Li3PO4. It offers a new way to achieve anion/concentration&#8208;independent interfacial chemistry for the aqueous batteries.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) makes the electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes beyond the thermodynamics limitation of water. However, achieving the energetic and robust SEI is more challenging in aqueous electrolytes because the low SEI formation efficiency (SFE) only contributed from anion&#8208;reduced products, and the low SEI formation quality (SFQ) negatively impacted by the hydrogen evolution, resulting in a high Li loss to compensate for SEI formation. Herein, we propose a highly efficient strategy to construct Spatially&#8208;Temporally Synchronized (STS) robust SEI by the involvement of synergistic chemical precipitation&#8208;electrochemical reduction. In this case, a robust Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI enables intelligent inherent growth at the active site of the hydrogen by the chemical capture of the OH&#8722; stemmed from the HER to trigger the ionization balance of dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4&#8722;) shift to insoluble solid Li3PO4. It is worth highlighting that the Li3PO4 formation does not extra&#8208;consume lithium derived from the cathode but makes good use of the product of HER (OH&#8722;), prompting the SEI to achieve 100&#8201;% SFE and pushing the HER potential into &#8722;1.8&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl. This energetic and robust SEI offers a new way to achieve anion/concentration&#8208;independent interfacial chemistry for the aqueous batteries.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Dienyl Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of dienyl sulfoxides were accomplished with up to 98&#8201;% ee from both racemic allenyl carbonates and &#946;&#8208;sulfinyl esters employing cheap Ni(II) as precatalyst. Experimental and computational methods revealed an interesting associated outersphere mechanism which is uncommon in transition metal catalyzed asymmetric allylic nucleophilic substitution reactions.







Abstract
Sulfoxides are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry and as ligands in asymmetric catalysis. However, the efficient asymmetric synthesis of this structural motif remains limited. In this study, we disclosed a Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent reaction that utilizes both racemic allenyl carbonates and &#946;&#8208;sulfinyl esters. Our method employs cheap and more sustainable Ni(II) as a precatalyst and successfully overcomes the challenging poisoning effect and instability of sulfenate generated in situ. This enables the synthesis of a series of dienyl sulfoxides with enantioselectivity of up to 98&#8201;% ee. The product exhibits tremendous potential in various applications, including diastereoselective Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, coordination with transition metals, and incorporation into medicinal compounds, among others. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods, we have uncovered an interesting associated outersphere mechanism that contrasts with conventional mechanisms commonly observed in asymmetric transition metal catalysis.

         <title>meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Aniline Derivatives via Palladium/ S,O&#8208;Ligand/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meta&#8208;arylated anilines are directly synthesised via Pd/S,O&#8208;ligand/norbornene cooperative catalysis without the need for additional synthetic steps. This method can be applied to a wide variety of aniline derivatives to provide a unique method for their direct meta&#8208;arylation. The isolation of several Pd complexes provides some useful insights into the factors influencing the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation step.







Abstract
Aromatic amines are ubiquitous moieties in organic molecules and their direct functionalization is of great interest in many research areas due to their prevalence in pharmaceuticals and organic electronics. While several synthetic tools exist for the ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;functionalization of anilines, the functionalization of the less reactive meta&#8208;position is not easy to achieve with current methods. To date, the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of aniline derivatives has been restricted to either the use of directing groups &amp; templates, or their transformation into anilides &amp; quaternary anilinium salts. Herein, we report the first general and efficient meta&#8208;C&#8722;H&#8208;arylation of non&#8208;directed aniline derivatives via cooperative catalysis with a palladium&#8211;S,O&#8208;ligand&#8211;norbornene system. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with a wide range of aniline derivatives and aryl iodides, while being operationally simple and scalable. Our preliminary mechanistic investigation&#8211;including the isolation of several palladium complexes and deuterium experiments&#8211;reveal useful insights into the substituent&#8208;effects of both the aniline&#8208;substrate and the norbornene&#8208;mediator during the meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation step.

Herein, we report the first general and efficient &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H-arylation of non-directed aniline derivatives via cooperative catalysis with a palladium&#8211;S,O-ligand&#8211;norbornene system. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions with a wide range of aniline derivatives and aryl iodides, while being operationally simple and scalable. Our preliminary mechanistic investigation&#8211;including the isolation of several palladium complexes and deuterium experiments&#8211;reveal useful insights into the substituent-effects of both the aniline-substrate and the norbornene-mediator during the &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H activation step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantitative Construction of Boronic&#8208;Ester Linkages in Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tunable numbers of B atoms in the linkages have first been achieved to construct the catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to catalyze the carbon dioxide reduction. The COFs with high contents of the B atoms showed improved the activity and selectivity, due to more easily formation of the intermediate COOH*.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been utilized for catalyzing the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) due to their atomic metal centers and controllable pore channels, which are facilitated by different covalent bonds. However, the exploration of boron&#8208;based linkages in these catalytic COFs has been limited owing to potential instability. Herein, we present the construction of boronic ester&#8208;linked COFs through nucleophilic substitution reactions in order to catalyze the CO2RR. The inclusion of abundant fluorine atoms within the frameworks enhances their hydrophobicity and subsequently improves water tolerance and chemical stability of COFs. The content of boron atoms in the COF linkages was carefully controlled, with COFs featuring a higher density of boron atoms exhibiting increased electronic conductivity, enhanced reductive ability, and stronger binding affinity towards CO2. Consequently, these COFs demonstrate improved activity and selectivity. The optimized COFs achieve the highest activity, achieving a turnover frequency of 1695.3&#8197;h&#8722;1 and a CO selectivity of 95.0&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V. Operando synchrotron radiation measurements confirm the stability of Co (II) atoms as catalytically active sites. By successfully constructing boronic ester&#8208;linked COFs, we not only address potential instability concerns but also achieve exceptional catalytic performance for CO2RR.

         <title>Li6E5Li6: Tetrel Sandwich Complexes with 10&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a series of tetrel sandwich complexes characterized by ten &#960;&#8208;electrons ([Li6]5+[E5]10&#8722;[Li6]5+). These complexes are both thermochemically and kinetically stable and exhibit &#963;&#8208;aromaticity.







Abstract
When (4n +2) &#960;&#8208;electrons are located in single planar ring, it conventionally qualifies as aromatic. According H&#252;ckel's rule, systems possessing ten &#960;&#8208;electrons should be aromatic. Herein we report a series of D5h&#8197;Li6E5Li6 sandwich structures, representing the first global minima featuring ten &#960;&#8208;electrons E510&#8722; ring (E=Si&#8722;Pb). However, these &#960;&#8208;electrons localize as five &#960;&#8208;lone&#8208;pairs rather than delocalized orbitals. The high symmetry structure achieved is a direct consequence of &#963;&#8208;aromaticity, particularly favored in elements from Si to Pb, resulting in a pronounced diatropic ring current flow that contributes to the enhanced stability of these systems.

         <title>Polyoxometalate Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40 Electrolytes for High&#8208;energy All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalates are proposed as a groundbreaking platform for high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Benefiting from rational structure design, Li3PW12O4o electrolytes exhibit remarkable cost&#8208;effectiveness ($5.68&#8197;kg&#8722;1), electrochemical stability, and high ionic conductivity (0.89&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The lithium&#8208;metal batteries utilizing sustainable electrolyte achieve more than 200 cycles and the lithium&#8208;air batteries operate over 600 cycles.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) batteries promise both high energy density and safety while existing solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) fail to satisfy the rigorous requirements of battery operations. Herein, novel polyoxometalate SSEs, Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40, are synthesized, which exhibit excellent interfacial compatibility with electrodes and chemical stability, overcoming the limitations of conventional SSEs. A high ionic conductivity of 0.89&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.23&#8197;eV are obtained due to the optimized three&#8208;dimensional Li+ migration network of Li3PW12O40. Li3PW12O40 exhibits a wide window of electrochemical stability that can both accommodate the Li anode and high&#8208;voltage cathodes. As a result, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries fabricated with Li/Li3PW12O40/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 display a stable cycling up to 100 cycles with a cutoff voltage of 4.35&#8197;V and an areal capacity of more than 4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, as well as a cost&#8208;competitive SSEs price of $5.68&#8197;kg&#8722;1. Moreover, Li3PMo12O40 homologous to Li3PW12O40 was obtained via isomorphous substitution, which formed a low&#8208;resistance interface with Li3PW12O40. Applications of Li3PW12O40 and Li3PMo12O40 in Li&#8208;air batteries further demonstrate that long cycle life (650 cycles) can be achieved. This strategy provides a facile, low&#8208;cost strategy to construct efficient and scalable solid polyoxometalate electrolytes for high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

         <title>Enabling High Throughput Kinetic Experimentation by Using Flow as a Differential Kinetic Technique
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By performing a series of instantaneous rate experiments, flow chemistry can be used to collect differential kinetic profiles. The time taken to collect a profile becomes independent of the time it takes a reaction to reach completion. This effectively enables high throughput kinetic experimentation, where data can be collected faster than a reaction can run. The process can also probe catalytic stability, offering further mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Kinetic data is most commonly collected through the generation of time&#8208;series data under either batch or flow conditions. Existing methods to generate kinetic data in flow collect integral data (concentration over time) only. Here, we report a method for the rapid and direct collection of differential kinetic data (direct measurement of rate) in flow by performing a series of instantaneous rate measurements on sequential small&#8208;scale reactions. This technique decouples the time required to generate a full kinetic profile from the time required for a reaction to reach completion, enabling high throughput kinetic experimentation. In addition, comparison of kinetic profiles constructed at different residence times allows the robustness, or stability, of homogeneously catalysed reactions to be interrogated. This approach makes use of a segmented flow platform which was shown to quantitatively reproduce batch kinetic data. The proline mediated aldol reaction was chosen as a model reaction to perform a high throughput kinetic screen of 216 kinetic profiles in 90&#8197;hours, one every 25 minutes, which would have taken an estimated continuous 3500&#8197;hours in batch, an almost 40&#8208;fold increase in experimental throughput matched by a corresponding reduction in material consumption.

     alt="Enabling High Throughput Kinetic Experimentation by Using Flow as a Differential Kinetic Technique**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By performing a series of instantaneous rate experiments, flow chemistry can be used to collect differential kinetic profiles. The time taken to collect a profile becomes independent of the time it takes a reaction to reach completion. This effectively enables high throughput kinetic experimentation, where data can be collected faster than a reaction can run. The process can also probe catalytic stability, offering further mechanistic insights.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinetic data is most commonly collected through the generation of time-series data under either batch or flow conditions. Existing methods to generate kinetic data in flow collect integral data (concentration over time) only. Here, we report a method for the rapid and direct collection of differential kinetic data (direct measurement of rate) in flow by performing a series of instantaneous rate measurements on sequential small-scale reactions. This technique decouples the time required to generate a full kinetic profile from the time required for a reaction to reach completion, enabling high throughput kinetic experimentation. In addition, comparison of kinetic profiles constructed at different residence times allows the robustness, or stability, of homogeneously catalysed reactions to be interrogated. This approach makes use of a segmented flow platform which was shown to quantitatively reproduce batch kinetic data. The proline mediated aldol reaction was chosen as a model reaction to perform a high throughput kinetic screen of 216 kinetic profiles in 90&#8197;hours, one every 25 minutes, which would have taken an estimated continuous 3500&#8197;hours in batch, an almost 40-fold increase in experimental throughput matched by a corresponding reduction in material consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Bis(Boronic) Esters Featuring Acyclic, Non&#8208;Adjacent 1,3&#8208;Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an efficient method for synthesizing chiral 1,2&#8208;bis(boronic) esters bearing non&#8208;adjacent, acyclic 1,3&#8208;stereocenters. Notably, a novel activation mode for gem&#8208;diborylalkanes in asymmetric catalysis has been uncovered, avoiding two potential side&#8208;products encountered when using classical conditions. This innovative approach exhibits excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
The construction of acyclic, non&#8208;adjacent 1,3&#8208;stereogenic centers, prevalent motifs in drugs and bioactive molecules, has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge due to acyclic nucleophiles being distant from the chiral environment. In this study, we successfully synthesized highly valuable 1,2&#8208;bis(boronic) esters featuring acyclic and nonadjacent 1,3&#8208;stereocenters. Notably, this reaction selectively produces migratory coupling products rather than alternative deborylative allylation or direct allylation byproducts. This approach introduces a new activation mode for selective transformations of gem&#8208;diborylmethane in asymmetric catalysis. Additionally, we found that other gem&#8208;diborylalkanes, previously challenging due to steric hindrance, also successfully participated in this reaction. The incorporation of 1,2&#8208;bis(boryl)alkenes facilitated the diversification of the alkenyl and two boron moieties in our target compounds, thereby enabling access to a broad array of versatile molecules. DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and shed light on the factors responsible for the observed excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. These were determined to arise from ligand&#8208;substrate steric repulsions in the syn&#8208;addition transition state.

         <title>Rational Design and Reticulation of Infinite qbe Rod Secondary Building Units into Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks through a Global Desymmetrization Approach for Inverse C3H8/C3H6 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linker desymmetrization approach was used to fabricate infinite rod secondary building unit (SBU) based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) structures carrying unique gfc net. The rod SBU can be simplified as 1&#8208;periodic cylindric sphere packing described in 1978 as 44 (3,3) and in the RCSR database as qbe, which has rarely been observed in MOF chemistry. The resulting MOF has nonpolar/inert pore surfaces and unusual inverse C3H8/C3H6 separation potential.







Abstract
The development of reticular chemistry has enabled the construction of a large array of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with diverse net topologies and functions. However, dominating this class of materials are those built from discrete/finite secondary building units (SBUs), yet the designed synthesis of frameworks involving infinite rod&#8208;shaped SBUs remain underdeveloped. Here, by virtue of a global linker desymmetrization approach, we successfully targeted a novel Cu&#8208;MOF (Cu&#8208;ASY) incorporating infinite Cu&#8208;carboxylate rod SBUs with its structure determined by micro electron diffraction (MicroED) crystallography. Interestingly, the rod SBU can be simplified as a unique cylindric sphere packing qbe tubule made of [43.62] tiles, which further connect the tritopic linkers to give a newly discovered 3,5&#8208;connected gfc net. Cu&#8208;ASY is a permanent ultramicroporous material featuring 1D channels with highly inert surfaces and shows a preferential adsorption of propane (C3H8) over propene (C3H6). The efficiency of C3H8 selective Cu&#8208;ASY is validated by multicycle breakthrough experiments, giving C3H6 productivity of 2.2&#8197;L/kg. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that C3H8 molecules form multiple C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and atypical C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901; H&#8722;C van der Waals interactions with the inner nonpolar surfaces. This work therefore highlights the linker desymmetrization as an encouraging and intriguing strategy for achieving unique MOF structures and properties.

         <dc:description>
Axially chiral azomethine imines were efficiently constructed through Cu&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closures of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides. Biological studies revealed that the (S)&#8208;atropisomer product effectively protects dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting oxaliplatin&#8208;induced apoptosis, while the (R)&#8208;atropisomer lacks protective effects, as described by Bo Han, Gu Zhan, Bo Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202312663).

         <title>Nanofibers in Organelles: From Structure Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique stimuli in organelles could trigger in situ self&#8208;assembly of nanofibers with ordered structures, thus exhibiting differential influences on cells. In this minireview, we feature nanofibers in organelles, highlight their formation mechanism and triggering strategies, and discuss the biomedical applications and current challenges.







Abstract
Nanofibers are one of the most important morphologies of molecular self&#8208;assemblies, the formation of which relies on the diverse intermolecular interactions of fibrous&#8208;forming units. In the past decade, rapid advances have been made in the biomedical application of nanofibers, such as bioimaging and tumor treatment. An important topic to be focused on is not only the nanofiber formation mechanism but also where it forms, because different destinations could have different influences on cells and its formation could be triggered by unique stimuli in organelles. It is therefore necessary and timely to summarize the nanofibers assembled in organelles. This minireview discusses the formation mechanism, triggering strategies, and biomedical applications of nanofibers, which may facilitate the rational design of nanofibers, improve our understanding of the relationship between nanofiber properties and organelle characteristics, allow a comprehensive recognition of organelles affected by materials, and enhance the therapeutic efficiency of nanofibers.

Human&#8208;AI collaborative platform is described for synergistic design&#8208;synthesis&#8208;analysis workflow of SAHCs by integration of human&#8208;led atomistic insights with data&#8208;driven augmented toolbox towards accomplishing ultimate reality&#8208;enabled SAHCs manufacturing with atomic economy.







Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts with targeted functionality can be designed with atomic precision, but it is challenging to retain the structure and performance upon the scaled&#8208;up manufacturing. Particularly challenging is to ensure the &#8220;atomic economy&#8221;, where every catalytic site is most gainfully utilized. Given the emerging synergistic integration of human&#8208; and artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven augmented designs (AD), augmented analytics (AA), and augmented reality manufacturing (AM) platforms, this minireview focuses on single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts (SAHCs) and examines the current status, challenges, and future perspectives of translating atomic&#8208;level structural precision and data&#8208;driven discovery to next&#8208;generation industrial manufacturing. We critically examine the atomistic insights into structure&#8208;driven SAHCs functionality and discuss the opportunities and challenges on the way towards the synergistic human&#8208;AI collaborative data&#8208;driven platform capable of monitoring, analyzing, manufacturing, and retaining the atomic&#8208;scale structure and functions. Enhanced by the atomic&#8208;level AD, AA, and AM, evolving from the current high&#8208;throughput capabilities and digital materials manufacturing acceleration, this synergistic human&#8208;AI platform is promising to enable atom&#8208;efficient and atomically precise heterogeneous catalyst production.

Locally ordered single&#8208;atom catalysts (LO&#8208;SACs) exhibit remarkable potential in revolutionizing the limitations of SACs. To date, no review has comprehensively summarized this intriguing topic. This minireview focuses on the compelling characteristics, synthetic strategies, characterization methods, and applications of LO&#8208;SACs in electrocatalysis.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts manifest nearly 100&#8201;% atom utilization efficiency, well&#8208;defined active sites, and high selectivity. However, their practical applications are hindered by a low atom loading density, uncontrollable location, and ambiguous interaction with the support, thereby posing challenges to maximizing their electrocatalytic performance. To address these limitations, the ability to arrange randomly dispersed single atoms into locally ordered single&#8208;atom catalysts (LO&#8208;SACs) substantially influences the electronic effect between reactive sites and the support, the synergistic interaction among neighboring single atoms, the bonding energy of intermediates with reactive sites and the complexity of the mechanism. As such, it dramatically promotes reaction kinetics, reduces the energy barrier of the reaction, improves the performance of the catalyst and simplifies the reaction mechanism. In this review, firstly, we introduce a variety of compelling characteristics of LO&#8208;SACs as electrocatalysts. Subsequently, the synthetic strategies, characterization methods and applications of LO&#8208;SACs in electrocatalysis are discussed. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges are elaborated to encourage further exploration in this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Effects of Iron Species on Low Temperature CO2 Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;species will likely be present in large&#8208;scale systems, e.g. from steel components or contaminated electrolytes, so their role in low temperature CO2 electrolyzers must be understood. While they reportedly accelerate degradation of the polymer membrane and the CO2 reduction catalyst, they also enhance the oxygen evolution activity of catalysts. We use this duplicity to stress the need for holistic research of complex electrochemical systems.







Abstract
Electrochemical energy conversion devices are considered key in reducing CO2 emissions and significant efforts are being applied to accelerate device development. Unlike other technologies, low temperature electrolyzers have the ability to directly convert CO2 into a range of value&#8208;added chemicals. To make them commercially viable, however, device efficiency and durability must be increased. Although their design is similar to more mature water electrolyzers and fuel cells, new cell concepts and components are needed. Due to the complexity of the system, singular component optimization is common. As a result, the component interplay is often overlooked. The influence of Fe&#8208;species clearly shows that the cell must be considered holistically during optimization, to avoid future issues due to component interference or cross&#8208;contamination. Fe&#8208;impurities are ubiquitous, and their influence on single components is well&#8208;researched. The activity of non&#8208;noble anodes has been increased through the deliberate addition of iron. At the same time, however, Fe&#8208;species accelerate cathode and membrane degradation. Here, we interpret literature on single components to gain an understanding of how Fe&#8208;species influence low temperature CO2 electrolyzers holistically. The role of Fe&#8208;species serves to highlight the need for considerations regarding component interplay in general.

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;based Enzyme Cascades&#8212;Current Trends and Future Perspectives</title>

Nucleic acid nanostructures are capable of precisely arranging proteins at nanoscale distances and have thus proven to be powerful scaffolds for studying mechanistic effects in enzyme cascades. This minireview summarizes the current status of proposed underlying mechanistic effects, derives aspects for further systematic analysis, and discusses future perspectives for biocatalytic applications.







Abstract
The natural micro&#8208; and nanoscale organization of biomacromolecules is a remarkable principle within living cells, allowing for the control of cellular functions by compartmentalization, dimensional diffusion and substrate channeling. In order to explore these biological mechanisms and harness their potential for applications such as sensing and catalysis, molecular scaffolding has emerged as a promising approach. In the case of synthetic enzyme cascades, developments in DNA nanotechnology have produced particularly powerful scaffolds whose addressability can be programmed with nanometer precision. In this minireview, we summarize recent developments in the field of biomimetic multicatalytic cascade reactions organized on DNA nanostructures. We emphasize the impact of the underlying design principles like DNA origami, efficient strategies for enzyme immobilization, as well as the importance of experimental design parameters and theoretical modeling. We show how DNA nanostructures have enabled a better understanding of diffusion and compartmentalization effects at the nanometer length scale, and discuss the challenges and future potential for commercial applications.

         <title>Direct Decarboxylation of Trifluoroacetates Enabled by Iron Photocatalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron photocatalysis enables repurposing inexpensive trifluoroacetates as reagents for the C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation. Thanks to the complementary inner&#8208;sphere electron&#8208;transfer pathway, photodecarboxylation occurs under mild conditions and can be applied to complex molecules, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Trifluoroacetates are the most abundant and accessible sources of trifluoromethyl groups, which are key components in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The generation of trifluoromethyl reactive radicals from trifluoroacetates requires their decarboxylation, which is hampered by their high oxidation potential. This constitutes a major challenge for redox&#8208;based methods, because of the need to pair the redox potentials with trifluoroacetate. Here we report a strategy based on iron photocatalysis to promote the direct photodecarboxylation of trifluoroacetates that displays reactivity features that escape from redox limitations. Our synthetic design has enabled the use of trifluoroacetates for the trifluoromethylation of more easily oxidizable organic substrates, offering new opportunities for late&#8208;stage derivatization campaigns using chemical feedstocks, Earth&#8208;abundant catalysts, and visible&#8208;light.

         <title>Deconstructive Carboxylation of Activated Alkenes with Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel metal&#8208;free photochemical method for the deconstructive carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 is reported for the first time. The power of this strategy is demonstrated for the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of bioactive molecule derivatives and the synthesis of propionate nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs.







Abstract
Carboxylation with carbon dioxide (CO2) represents one notable methodology to produce carboxylic acids. In contrast to carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds, carbon&#8211;carbon bond cleavage for carboxylation with CO2 is far more challenging due to their inherent and less favorable orbital directionality for interacting with transition metals. Here we report a photocatalytic protocol for the deconstructive carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 to generate carboxylic acids in the absence of transition metals. It is emphasized that our protocol provides carboxylic acids with obviously unchanged carbon numbers when terminal alkenes were used. To show the power of this strategy, a variety of pharmaceutically relevant applications including the modular synthesis of propionate nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs and the late&#8208;stage carboxylation of bioactive molecule derivatives are demonstrated.

Symmetric motions of bound ligands contribute to the entropic changes upon binding but are difficult to detect via conventional methods. Here, Kotschy, S&#246;ldner et&#8197;al. develop solid&#8208;state NMR approaches focusing on the protons of the ligand to reveal an aromatic ring flip of the benzylic group of the inhibitor.







Abstract
The possible internal dynamics of non&#8208;isotope&#8208;labeled small&#8208;molecule ligands inside a target protein is inherently difficult to capture. Whereas high crystallographic temperature factors can denote either static disorder or motion, even moieties with very low B&#8208;factors can be subject to vivid motion between symmetry&#8208;related sites. Here we report the experimental identification of internal &#956;s timescale dynamics of a high&#8208;affinity, natural&#8208;abundance ligand tightly bound to the enzyme human carbonic anhydrase&#8197;II (hCAII) even within a crystalline lattice. The rotamer jumps of the ligand's benzene group manifest themselves both, in solution and fast magic&#8208;angle spinning solid&#8208;state NMR 1H R1&#961; relaxation dispersion, for which we obtain further mechanistic insights from molecular&#8208;dynamics (MD) simulations. The experimental confirmation of rotameric jumps in bound ligands within proteins in solution or the crystalline state may improve understanding of host&#8208;guest interactions in biology and supra&#8208;molecular chemistry and may facilitate medicinal chemistry for future drug campaigns.

&lt;p&gt;Symmetric motions of bound ligands contribute to the entropic changes upon binding but are difficult to detect via conventional methods. Here, Kotschy, S&#246;ldner et&#8197;al. develop solid-state NMR approaches focusing on the protons of the ligand to reveal an aromatic ring flip of the benzylic group of the inhibitor.

         <title>Stereoselective Hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;Diketones Catalyzed by Chiral Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical vicinal diketones with PhSiH3 was accomplished under the frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalysis, delivering 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols in high yields with &gt;99/1 dr values and up to 97&#8201;% ee. The chiral FLP catalyst exhibits the ability to control regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities, while silane PhSiH3 facilitates an intramolecular hydrosilylation of the second carbonyl group.







Abstract
The asymmetric reduction of 1,2&#8208;diketones for the synthesis of optically active 1,2&#8208;diols, especially 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols, remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we describe the first highly stereoselective hydrosilylation of unsymmetrical vicinal diketones with PhSiH3 by using a chiral frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalyst, giving a variety of 1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;diols in high yields with excellent d.r. values and up to 97&#8201;% ee. The chiral FLP catalyst exhibits the ability to control regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivites concurrently.

         <title>Carbonyl Olefin Metathesis and Dehydrogenative Cyclization of Aromatic Ketones and gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reaction of readily available aromatic ketones and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes under oxidant&#8208;free, acid&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free conditions for the synthesis of phenanthrenes. Carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis and dehydrogenative cyclization proceed in a one&#8208;pot reaction. The reactions show broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The beauty of one&#8208;pot cascade reaction lies in the efficient disconnection and construction of several bonds in a single reaction flask, without the isolation of any intermediates. Herein, we report the first photoinduced thermally promoted cascade reactions of readily available aromatic ketones and aromatic gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of phenanthrenes which possess potential utility in drug design and materials science. The reaction combines carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis (cascade photoinduced [2+2] cyclization and thermally controlled retro [2+2] cyclization) and dehydrogenative cyclization (cascade photoinduced conrotatory 6&#960; electrocyclization and collidine&#8208;promoted dehydrogenative aromatization) together in one pot. The oxidant&#8208;free, acid&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free reaction shows broad substrate scope and wide functional group tolerance.

         <title>Bifunctional Iminophosphorane Catalyzed Amide Enolization for Enantioselective Cyclohexadienone Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enolization of 2&#8208;arylacetamides, followed by an enantioselective intramolecular conjugate addition to tethered 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones, yielding saturated fused N&#8208;heterocycles, is described. The transformation is achieved by employing a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase catalyst and represents the first unactivated carboxamide deprotonation in a metal&#8208;free, catalytic, and enantioselective transformation.







Abstract
The organocatalytic enolization of 2&#8208;arylacetamides, followed by an enantioselective intramolecular conjugate addition to tethered 2,5&#8208;cyclohexadienones, yielding 3D fused N&#8208;heterocycles, is described. The transformation represents the first strong activating group&#8208;free activation of carboxamides via &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H deprotonation in a metal&#8208;free, catalytic, and enantioselective reaction, and is achieved by employing a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) superbase.

         <title>Defluorinative Alkylboration of Alkenes Enabled by Dual Photoredox and Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported here is a radical&#8208;based three&#8208;component defluorinative alkylboration of alkenes with trifluoromethyls and bis(pinacolato)diboron via dual photoredox/copper catalysis. This protocol offers efficient access to synthetically valuable &#947;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl boronates with high efficiency and reversed regioselectivity.







Abstract
A regioselectivity reversed three&#8208;component defluorinative alkylboration of alkenes with trifluoromethyls and bis(pinacolato)diboron via dual photoredox/copper catalysis is reported. The mild conditions are compatible with a wide array of nonactivated trifluoromethyl aromatics bearing electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;neutral substituents, trifluoroacetamides, and various nonactivated terminal and internal alkenes, enabling straightforward access to synthetically valuable &#947;&#8208;gem&#8208;difluoroalkyl boronates with high efficiency. Furthermore, this protocol is applicable to alkene&#8208;tethered trifluoromethyl aromatics to furnish gem&#8208;difluoromethylene&#8208;containing cyclic compounds. Synthetic applications and preliminary mechanistic studies are also presented.

         <title>Mechanochemical Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Nitrene Transfer Reactions: Direct Synthesis of N&#8208;Acyl Sulfonimidamides from Sulfinamides and Dioxazolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical nitrene transfer reaction towards N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides from sulfinamides and dioxazolones with the catalysis of iron(II) chloride is presented. This one&#8208;step solvent&#8208;free procedure shows better conversions rate and chemoselectivity compared to its solution&#8208;phase counterpart, providing a wide range of N&#8208;acyl sulfonimidamides in up to 87&#8201;% yield.

A mechanochemical synthesis of sulfonimidamides by iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed exogenous ligand&#8208;free N&#8208;acyl nitrene transfer to sulfinamides is reported. The one&#8208;step method tolerates a wide range of sulfinamides with various substituents under solvent&#8208;free ambient conditions. Compared to its solution&#8208;phase counterpart, this mechanochemical approach shows better conversion and chemoselectivity. Mechanistic investigations by ESI&#8208;MS revealed the generation of crucial nitrene iron intermediates.

&lt;p&gt;A mechanochemical nitrene transfer reaction towards N-acyl sulfonimidamides from sulfinamides and dioxazolones with the catalysis of iron(II) chloride is presented. This one-step solvent-free procedure shows better conversions rate and chemoselectivity compared to its solution-phase counterpart, providing a wide range of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl sulfonimidamides in up to 87&#8201;% yield. Mechanistically, crucial nitrene iron complex intermediates are suggested by ESI-MS.

         <title>One&#8208;Carbon Ring Expansion of Indoles and Pyrroles: A Straightforward Access to 3&#8208;Fluorinated Quinolines and Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,1&#8208;Dibromoalkanes as bromocarbene sources make one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of indoles and pyrroles facile, allowing for direct access to structurally diverse azines, especially the pharmaceutically important 3&#8208;fluorinated quinolines and pyridines. This straightforward protocol features bench&#8208;stable reagents, a broad range of substrates, and good compatibility with various functional groups.







Abstract
3&#8208;Fluorinated quinolines and pyridines are prevalent pharmacophores, yet their synthesis is often challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that dibromofluoromethane as bromofluorocarbene source enables the one&#8208;carbon ring expansion of readily available indoles and pyrroles to structurally diverse 3&#8208;fluorinated quinolines and pyridines. This straightforward protocol requires only a short reaction time of ten minutes and can be performed under air atmosphere. Preliminary investigations reveal that this strategy can also be applied to the synthesis of other valuable azines by using different 1,1&#8208;dibromoalkanes as bromocarbene sources.

         <title>Speciation of Transition Metal Dissolution in Electrolyte from Common Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal ion dissolution from the cathode, migration through the electrolyte, and deposition on the anode is one of the leading causes of cell failure when cycling lithium&#8208;ion batteries to high potentials (&gt;4.2&#8197;V). To better understand what is occurring in the electrolyte, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy was performed to determine the oxidation state(s) of Mn and Ni that has dissolved into the electrolyte from commonly used cathodes.







Abstract
Significant capacity loss has been observed across extended cycling of lithium&#8208;ion batteries cycled to high potential. One of the sources of capacity fade is transition metal dissolution from the cathode active material, ion migration through the electrolyte, and deposition on the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase on the anode. While much research has been conducted on the oxidation state of the transition metal in the cathode active material or deposited on the anode, there have been limited investigations of the oxidation state of the transition metal ions dissolved in the electrolyte. In this work, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy has been performed on electrolytes extracted from cells built with four different cathode active materials (LiMn2O4 (LMO), LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO), LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811), and (x Li2MnO3*(1&#8208;x) LiNiaMnbCocO2, with a+b+c=1) (LMRNMC)) that were cycled at either high or standard potentials to determine the oxidation state of Mn and Ni in solution. Inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry has been performed on the anodes from these cells to determine the concentration of deposited transition metal ions. While transition metal ions were found dissolved in all electrolytes, the oxidation state(s) of Mn and Ni were determined to be dependent on the cathode material and independent of cycling potential.

         <title>Precise Preparation of Triarylboron&#8208;Based Graphdiyne Analogues for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of triarylboron&#8208;based graphdiyne analogues (TAB&#8208;GDY) with clear structure and tunable pore size were prepared through copper mediated coupling reaction. Due to its rich microporous structure, the electron deficiency of the TAB group and the electron richness of the acetylene bond, TAB&#8208;GDY exhibits certain IAST selectivity in binary gas and is expected to be used for gas capture and separation.







Abstract
A series of triarylboron&#8208;based graphdiyne analogues (TAB&#8208;GDYs) with tunable pore size were prepared through copper mediated coupling reaction. The elemental composition, chemical bond, morphology of TAB&#8208;GDYs were well characterized. The crystallinity was confirmed by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and stacking modes were studied in combination with high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and structure simulation. The absorption and desorption isotherm revealed relatively high specific surface area of these TAB&#8208;GDYs up to 788&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 for TMTAB&#8208;GDY, which decreased as pore size enlarged. TAB&#8208;GDYs exhibit certain selectivity for CO2/N2 (21.9), CO2/CH4 (5.3), CO2/H2 (41.8) and C2H2/CO2 (2.3). This work has developed a series of boron containing two&#8208;dimensional frameworks with clear structures and good stability, and their tunable pore sizes have laid the foundation for future applications in the gas separation field.

         <title>Catalytic HF Shuttling between Fluoroalkanes and Alkynes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic method to transfer formal equivalents of HF from fluoroalkanes to an alkyne is reported. The method leads to a simple approach generating geminal difluoroalkanes and it tolerates numerous sensitive functional groups including halogen, protected amine, ester and thiophene substituents. Poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) was shown to act as an HF donor in place of the fluoroalkane.







Abstract
In this paper, we report BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 as a catalyst to shuttle equivalents of HF from a fluoroalkane to an alkyne. Reactions of terminal and internal aliphatic alkynes led to formation of difluoroalkane products, while diarylalkynes can be selectively converted into fluoroalkenes. The method tolerates numerous sensitive functional groups including halogen, protected amine, ester and thiophene substituents. Mechanistic studies (DFT, probe experiments) suggest the catalyst is involved in both the defluorination and fluorination steps, with BF3 acting as a Lewis acid and OEt2 a weak Lewis base that mediates proton transfer. In certain cases, the interconversion of fluoroalkene and difluoroalkane products was found to be reversible. The new catalytic system was applied to demonstrate proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept recycling of poly(vinylidene difluoride).

         <title>&#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Allylation of Trialkylamines with Allenes Promoted by Synergistic Borane/Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H allylation reactions of trialkylamines with allenes were accomplished by a synergistic borane/palladium catalysis. The borane and palladium catalysts promoted the formation of an enamine intermediate from a trialkylamine and a palladium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl intermediate from an allene, respectively.







Abstract
Functionalization of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of trialkylamines is challenging, especially for reactions at positions other than the &#945; position. Herein, we report a method for &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H allylation of trialkylamines. In these reactions, which involve synergistic borane/palladium catalysis, an enamine intermediate is first generated from the amine via &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydrogenation promoted by B(C6F5)3 and a base, and then the enamine undergoes palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction with an allene to give the allylation product. Because the hydride and the proton resulting from the initial dehydrogenation are ultimately shuttled to the product by B(C6F5)3 and the palladium catalyst, respectively, these reactions show excellent atom economy. The establishment of this method paves the way for future studies of C&#8722;H functionalization of trialkylamines by means of synergistic borane/transition&#8208;metal catalysis.

         <title>Deploying Cationic Cellulose Nanofiber Confinement to Enable High Iodine Loadings Towards High Energy and High&#8208;Temperature Zn&#8208;I2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable cationic cellulose nanofiber (cCNF) was employed as a host to confine charged iodine species. The robust physicochemical adsorption between cCNF and polyiodides effectively mitigated the shuttle effect and increased iodine loading, resulting in enhanced cycling stability and high energy density even at elevated temperatures, thereby demonstrating promising performance at the full&#8208;battery level.







Abstract
High iodine loading and high&#8208;temperature adaptability of the iodine cathode are prerequisites to achieving high energy density at full battery level and promoting the practical application for the zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) battery. However, it would aggravate the polyiodide shuttle effect when employing high iodine loading and working temperature. Here, a sustainable cationic cellulose nanofiber (cCNF) was employed to confine the active iodine species through strong physiochemical adsorption to enlarge the iodine loading and stabilize it even at high temperatures. The cCNF could accommodate dual&#8208;functionality by enlarging the iodine loading and suppressing the polyiodide shuttle effect, owing to the unique framework structure with abundant surface positive charges. As a result, the iodine cathode based on the cCNF could deliver high iodine mass loading of 14.1&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a specific capacity of 182.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, high areal capacity of 2.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stable cycling over 3000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, thus enabling a high energy density of 34.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and the maximum power density of 521.2&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a full Zn&#8208;I2 battery level. In addition, even at a high temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, the Zn&#8208;I2 battery could still deliver a stable cycling.

         <title>Pauling&#8208;Type Adsorption of O2 Induced by Heteroatom Doped ZnIn2S4 for Boosted Solar&#8208;Driven H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cleavage of O&#8722;O bonds drastically hinder the H2O2 production performance. This work presents a strategy that atomically heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 at substitutional and interstitial sites, which not only optimizes the coordination environment of Zn active sites but also facilitates electron transfer to the Zn sites and improves charge density, avoiding the breakage of O&#8722;O bonds and reducing the energy barriers to H2O2 production.







Abstract
Breaking the trade&#8208;off between activity and selectivity has perennially been a formidable endeavor in the field of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis, especially the side&#8208;on configuration of oxygen (O2) on the catalyst surface will cause the cleavage of O&#8722;O bonds, which drastically hinders the H2O2 production performance. Herein, we present an atomically heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 catalyst with tunable oxygen adsorption configuration to accelerate the ORR kinetics essential for solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production. Indeed, the spectroscopy characterizations (such as EXAFS and in situ FTIR) and DFT calculations reveal that heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 at substitutional and interstitial sites, which not only optimizes the coordination environment of Zn active sites, but also facilitates electron transfer to the Zn sites and improves charge density, avoiding the breakage of O&#8722;O bonds and reducing the energy barriers to H2O2 production. As a result, the oxygen adsorption configuration is regulated from side&#8208;on (Yeager&#8208;type) to end&#8208;on (Pauling&#8208;type), resulting in the accelerated ORR kinetics from 874.94 to 2107.66&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This finding offers a new avenue toward strategic tailoring oxygen adsorption configuration by the rational design of doped photocatalyst.

         <title>Tuning CH Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Based Receptors toward Picomolar Anion Affinity via the Inductive Effect of Distant Substituents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 5, January 25, 2024. </description>

Ultrahigh binding affinity of bambusuril receptors toward halides is achieved and continuously increases with increasing electron&#8208;withdrawing power of groups installed on its benzyl substituents, as measured by 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Inspired by nature, artificial hydrogen bond&#8208;based anion receptors have been developed to achieve high anion selectivity; however, their binding affinity is usually low. The potency of these receptors is usually increased by the introduction of aryl substituents, which withdraw electrons from their binding site through the resonance effect. Here, we show that the polarization of the C(sp3)&#8208;H binding site of bambusuril receptors, and thus their potency to bind anions, can be modulated by the inductive effect. The presence of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on benzyl substituents of bambusurils significantly increases their binding affinities to halides, resulting in the strongest iodide receptor reported to date with an association constant greater than 1013&#8197;M&#8722;1 in acetonitrile. A Hammett plot showed that while the bambusuril affinity toward halides linearly increases with the electron&#8208;withdrawing power of their substituents, their binding selectivity remains essentially unchanged.

Reaction of Ba0 vapour with an anthracene ligand gave a Ba anthracene complex that crystallizes as a cyclic octamer and reacts as a Ba0 synthon.







Abstract
A hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble barium anthracene complex was prepared by means of metal vapour synthesis. Reaction of 9,10&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)anthracene (Anth&#8242;&#8242;) with barium vapour gave deep purple Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;) which after extraction with diethyl ether crystallised as the cyclic octamer [Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;)&#8901;Et2O]8. Dissolution in benzene or toluene led to replacement of the Et2O ligand with a softer arene ligand and isolation of Ba(Anth&#8242;&#8242;)&#8901;arene. Diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY&#8197;NMR ) measurements in benzene&#8208;d6 indicate solution species with a molecular weight that equals a trimeric constitution. Natural population analysis (NPA) assigned charges of +1.70 and &#8722;1.70 to Ba and Anth&#8242;&#8242;, respectively, relating to highly ionic Ba2+/Anth&#8242;&#8242;2&#8722; bonding. Preliminary reactivity studies with air, Ph2C=NPh, or H2 show that the complex reacts as a Ba0 synthon by release of neutral Anth&#8242;&#8242;. This soluble molecular Ba0/BaII redox synthon provides new routes for the syntheses of barium complexes under mild conditions.

&#8220;We are excited by the possibilities of being able to use supramolecular systems to begin to engineer artificial cells that have complex collective behaviour&#226;&#166; Within the Langton group we are delighted to have hosted many very successful MChem project students, many of whom have played a valuable contribution to our ongoing research projects&#226;&#166;&#8221; Find out more about the collaborative work in the Langton group.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Langton group in the Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford (UK). They recently published an article on a synthetic supramolecular signaling system, in which light is used to initiate the release of diffusible chemical signals from one population of vesicles to another. This triggers transmembrane cation transport in the receiver vesicles and amplifies the signal, in a manner reminiscent of signaling mechanisms in biology. &#8220;Inter&#8208;Vesicle Signal Transduction Using a Photo&#8208;responsive Zinc Ionophore&#8221;, S.&#8197;A.

         <dc:description>Trifluoromethyl cationic carbyne (CF3C+:) possessing dual carbene&#8208;carbocation behavior emulated as trifluoromethyl metal&#8208;carbynoid (CF3C+=M) has not been explored yet, and its reaction characteristics are unknown. Herein, a novel &#945;&#8208;diazotrifluoroethyl sulfonium salt was prepared and used in Rh&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component [2 + 1 + 2] cycloadditions for the first time with commercially available N&#8208;fused heteroarenes and nitriles,&#160;yielding a series of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a] N&#8208;heterocycles that are of interest in medicinal chemistry, in which the insertion of trifluoromethyl Rh&#8208;carbynoid (CF3C+=Rh) into C=N bonds of N&#8208;fused heteroarenes was involved. This strategy demonstrates synthetic applications in late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals, construction of CD3&#8208;containing N&#8208;heterocycles, gram&#8208;scale experiments, and synthesis of phosphodiesterase 10A inhibitor analog. These highly valuable and modifiable imidazo[1,5&#8208;a] N&#8208;heterocycles exhibit good antitumor activity in vitro, thus demonstrating their potential applications in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming a Radical Polarity Mismatch in Strain&#8208;Release Pentafluorosulfanylation of [1.1.0]Bicyclobutanes: An Entryway to Sulfone&#8208; and Carbonyl&#8208;Containing SF5&#8211;Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first assortment of achiral pentafluorosulfanylated cyclobutanes (SF5&#8208;CBs) are now synthetically accessible through strain&#8208;release functionalization of [1.1.0]bicyclobutanes (BCBs) using SF5Cl. Methods for both chloropentafluorosulfanylation and hydropentafluorosulfanylation of sulfone&#8208;based BCBs are detailed herein, as well as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept that the logic extends to tetrafluoro(aryl)sulfanylation, tetrafluoro(trifluoromethyl)sulfanylation, and three&#8208;component pentafluorosulfanylation reactions. The methods presented enable isolation of both syn and anti isomers of SF5&#8208;CBs, but we also demonstrate that this innate selectivity can be overridden in chloropentafluorosulfanylation; that is, an anti&#8208;stereoselective variant of SF5Cl addition across sulfone&#8208;based BCBs can be achieved by using inexpensive copper salt additives. Considering the SF5 group and CBs have been employed individually as nonclassical bioisosteres, structural aspects of these unique SF5&#8208;CB &#8220;hybrid isosteres&#8221; were then contextualized using SC&#8208;XRD. From a mechanistic standpoint, chloropentafluorosulfanylation ostensibly proceeds through a curious polarity mismatch addition of electrophilic SF5 radicals to the electrophilic sites of the BCBs. Upon examining carbonyl&#8208;containing BCBs, we also observed rare instances whereby radical addition to the 1&#8208;position of a BCB occurs. The nature of the key C(sp3)&#8211;SF5 bond formation step &#8211; among other mechanistic features of the methods we disclose &#8211; was investigated experimentally and with DFT calculations. Lastly, we demonstrate compatibility of SF5&#8211;CBs with various downstream functionalizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid State Machinery of Multiple Dynamic Elements in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering coordinated rotational motion in porous architectures enables the fabrication of molecular machines in solids. A flexible two&#8208;fold interpenetrated pillared Metal&#8208;Organic Framework precisely organizes fast mobile elements such as bicyclopentane (BCP) (107Hz regime at 85 K), two distinct pyridyl rotors and E&#8208;azo group involved in pedal&#8208;like motion. Reciprocal sliding of the two sub&#8208;networks, switched by chemical stimuli, modulated the sizes of the channels and finally the overall dynamical machinery. Actually, iodine&#8208;vapor adsorption drives a dramatic structural rearrangement, displacing the two distinct subnets in a concerted piston&#8208;like motion. Unconventionally, BCP mobility increases, exploring ultra&#8208;fast dynamics (107 Hz) at temperatures as low as 44 K, while the pyridyl rotors diverge into a faster and slower dynamical regime by symmetry lowering. Indeed, one pillar ring gained greater rotary freedom as carried by the azo&#8208;group in a crank&#8208;like motion. A peculiar behavior was stimulated by pressurized CO2, which regulates BCP dynamics upon incremental site occupation. The rotary dynamics is intrinsically coupled to the framework flexibility as demonstrated by complementary experimental evidence (multinuclear solid&#8208;state NMR down to very low temperatures, synchrotron radiation XRD, gas sorption) and computational modelling, which helps elucidate the highly sophisticated rotor&#8208;structure interplay.</dc:description>

Reciprocal sliding of the two sub-networks, switched by chemical stimuli, modulated the sizes of the channels and finally the overall dynamical machinery. Actually, iodine-vapor adsorption drives a dramatic structural rearrangement, displacing the two distinct subnets in a concerted piston-like motion. Unconventionally, BCP mobility increases, exploring ultra-fast dynamics (107 Hz) at temperatures as low as 44 K, while the pyridyl rotors diverge into a faster and slower dynamical regime by symmetry lowering. Indeed, one pillar ring gained greater rotary freedom as carried by the azo-group in a crank-like motion. A peculiar behavior was stimulated by pressurized CO2, which regulates BCP dynamics upon incremental site occupation. The rotary dynamics is intrinsically coupled to the framework flexibility as demonstrated by complementary experimental evidence (multinuclear solid-state NMR down to very low temperatures, synchrotron radiation XRD, gas sorption) and computational modelling, which helps elucidate the highly sophisticated rotor-structure interplay.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;lifespan Zinc&#8208;ion Capacitors Enabled by Anodes Integrated with Interconnected Mesoporous Chitosan Membranes through Electrophoresis&#8208;driven Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advancement of highly secure and inexpensive aqueous zinc ion energy storage devices is impeded by issues, including dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution and corrosion of zinc anodes. It is essential to modify the interface of zinc anodes that homogenizes ion flux and facilitates highly reversible zinc planarized deposition and stripping. Herein, by coupling zinc ion coordination with acid&#8208;base neutralization under the driving of electrophoresis, manageable mesoscopic phase separation for constructing chitosan frameworks was achieved, thereby fabricating  interconnected mesoporous chitosan membranes based heterogeneous quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes integrated with anodes. The framework is constructed by twisted chitosan nanofiber bundles, forming a three&#8208;dimensional continuous spindle&#8208;shaped pore structure. With this framework, the electrolyte provides exceptional ion conductivity of 25.1 mS cm&#8208;1, with a puncture resistance strength of 2.3 GPa. In addition, the amino groups of chitosan molecule can make the surface of the framework positively charged.Thus, reversible zinc planarized deposition is successfully induced by the synergistic effect of stress constraint and electrostatic modulation. As a result, as&#8208;assembled zinc ion capacitor has an excellent cycle life and sustains the capacity by over 95% after 20000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g&#8208;1. This research presents a constructive strategy for stable electrolytes&#8208;integrated zinc anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Isomerization of Indigo within 1D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural products are attractive components to tailor environmentally friendly advanced new materials. We present surface&#8208;confined metallosupramolecular engineering of coordination polymers using natural dyes as molecular building blocks: indigo and the related Tyrian purple. Both building blocks yield identical, well&#8208;defined coordination polymers composed of (1 dehydroindigo : 1 Fe) repeat units on two different silver single crystal surfaces. These polymers are characterized atomically by submolecular resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy, bond&#8208;resolving atomic force microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. On Ag(100) and on Ag(111), the&#160;trans&#160;configuration of dehydroindigo results in N,O&#8208;chelation in the polymer chains. On the more inert Ag(111) surface, the molecules additionally undergo thermally induced isomerization from the&#160;trans&#160;to the&#160;cis&#160;configuration and afford N,N&#8208; plus O,O&#8208;chelation. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the coordination polymers of the&#160;cis&#8208;isomers on Ag(111) and of the&#160;trans&#8208;isomers on Ag(100) are energetically favoured. Our results demonstrate post&#8208;synthetic linker isomerization in interfacial metal&#8208;organic nanosystems.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Bifunctional Chemoselective Metabolome Analysis of Liver Patient Samples Using the Reagent 4&#8208;Nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bile ducts that has been associated with diverse metabolic carboxylic acids. Mass spectrometric techniques are the method of choice for their analysis. However, the broad investigation of this metabolite class remains challenging. Derivatization of carboxylic acids represents a strategy to overcome these limitations but available methods suffer from diverse analytical challenges. Herein, we have designed a novel strategy introducing 4&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine as a new chemoselective moiety for the first time for carboxylic acid metabolites. This moiety was selected as it rapidly forms a stable amide bond and also generates a new ketone, which can be analyzed by our recently developed&#160;quant&#8208;SCHEMA method specific for carbonyl metabolites. Optimization of this new method revealed a high reproducibility and robustness, which was utilized to validate 102 metabolic carboxylic acids using authentic synthetic standard conjugates in human plasma samples including nine metabolites that were newly detected. Using this sequential analysis of the carbonyl&#8208; and carboxylic acid&#8208;metabolomes revealed alterations of the ketogenesis pathway, which demonstrates the vast benefit of our unique methodology. We anticipate that the developed azirine moiety with rapid functional group transformation will find broad application in diverse chemical biology research fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Chirality Transfer from Circularly Polarized Light to Single Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their broken symmetry, chiral plasmonic nanostructures have unique optical properties and multiple applications. However, there is still a lack of comprehension about how chirality transfer between circularly polarized light (CPL) and these structures occurs. Here, we thoroughly investigate the plasmon&#8208;assisted growth of chiral nanoparticles from achiral Au nanocubes (AuNCs) via CPL without the involvement of any chiral molecule stimulators. We identify the structural chirality of our synthesized chiral plasmonic nanostructures by using circular differential scattering (CDS) spectroscopy correlated with scanning electron microscopy imaging at both the single&#8208;particle and ensemble levels. Theoretical simulations, including hot&#8208;electron surface maps, reveal that the plasmon&#8208;induced chirality transfer is mediated by the asymmetric distribution of hot electrons on achiral AuNCs under CPL excitation. Furthermore, we shed light on how this plasmon&#8208;induced chirality transfer can also be utilized for chiral growth in bimetallic systems, such as Ag or Pd on AuNCs. Results presented here reveal fundamental aspects of chiral light&#8208;matter interaction, influencing the future design and optimization of chiral sensors and chiral catalysis, among others.</dc:description>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Assisted Self&#8208;Assembly of Hexa&#8208;Substituted Carpyridines into 1D Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extent of the influence that molecular curvature plays on the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular polymers remains an open question in the field. We began addressing this fundamental question with the introduction of &#8220;carpyridines&#8221;, which are saddle&#8208;shaped monomers that can associate with one another through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and in which the rotational and translational movements are restricted. The topography displayed by the monomers led, previously, to the assembly of highly ordered 2D materials even in the absence of strong directional interactions such as hydrogen bonding. Here, we introduce a simple strategy to gain control over the dimensionality of the formed structures yielding classical unidimensional polymers. These have been characterized using well&#8208;established protocols allowing us to determine and confirm the self&#8208;assembly mechanism of both fibers and sheets. The calculated interaction energies are significantly higher than expected for flexible self&#8208;assembling units lacking classical &#8220;strong&#8221; non&#8208;covalent interactions. The versatility of this supramolecular unit to assemble into either supramolecular fibers or 2D sheets with strong association energies highlights remarkably well the potential and importance of molecular shape for the design of supramolecular materials and the applications thereof.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic H2 Generation: Controlled and Optimized Dispersion of Single Atom Co&#8208;Catalysts Based on Pt&#8208;TCPP Planar Adsorption on TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When using single atoms (SAs) as a co&#8208;catalyst in photocatalytic H2 generation, achieving a well&#8208;dispersed, evenly distributed and adjustable SA surface density on a semiconductor surface is a challenging task. In the present work we use the planar adsorption of tetrakis&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TCPP) and its platinum coordinated analogue, Pt&#8208;TCPP, onto anatase TiO2 surfaces to establish a spatially controlled decoration of SAs. We show that the surface Pt SA density can be very well controlled by co&#8208;adsorption of Pt&#8208;TCPP and TCPP in the planar monolayer regime, and by adjusting the Pt&#8208;TCCP to TCPP ratio a desired well dispersed surface density of SAs up to 2.6 &#215; 105 atoms &#181;m&#8208;2 can be established (which is the most effective Pt SA loading for photocatalysis). This distribution and the SA state is maintained after a thermal treatment in air, and an optimized SA density as well as a most active form of Pt for photocatalytic H2 evolution can be established and maintained.</dc:description>

This distribution and the SA state is maintained after a thermal treatment in air, and an optimized SA density as well as a most active form of Pt for photocatalytic H2 evolution can be established and maintained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peptide and Enzyme Catalysts Work in Concert in Stereoselective Cascade Reactions &#8211; Oxidation Followed by Conjugate Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes and peptide catalysts consist of the same building blocks but require vastly different environments to operate best. Here, we show that an enzyme and a peptide catalyst can work together in a single reaction vessel to catalyze a two&#8208;step cascade reaction with high chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Abundant linear alcohols, nitroolefins, an alcohol oxidase, and a tripeptide catalyst provided chiral &#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes in aqueous buffer. High yields (up to 92%) and stereoselectivities (up to 98% ee) were achieved for the cascade through the rational design of the peptide catalyst and the identification of common reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrastable, Superrobust, and Recyclable Supramolecular Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs), crosslinked by noncovalent bonds, have emerged as reorganizable and recyclable polymeric materials with unique functionality. However, poor stability is an imperative challenge faced by SPNs, because SPNs are susceptible to heat, water, and/or solvents due to the dynamic and reversible nature of noncovalent bonds. Herein, the design of a noncovalent cooperative network (NCoN) to simultaneously stabilize and reinforce SPNs is reported, resulting in an ultrastable, superrobust, and recyclable SPN. The NCoN is constructed by multiplying the H&#8208;bonding sites and tuning the conformation/geometry of the H&#8208;bonding segment to optimize the multivalence cooperativity of H&#8208;bonds. The rationally designed H&#8208;bonding segment with high conformational compliance favors the formation of tightly packed H&#8208;bond arrays comprising higher&#8208;density and stronger H&#8208;bonds. Consequently, the H&#8208;bonded crosslinks in the NCoN display a covalent crosslinking effect but retain on&#8208;demand dynamics and reversibility. The resultant ultrastable SPN not only displays remarkable resistance to heat up to 120 &#176;C, water soaking, and a broad spectrum of solvents, but also possesses a superhigh true stress at break (1.1 GPa) and an ultrahigh toughness (406 MJ m&#8208;3). Despite the covalent&#8208;network&#8208;like stability, the SPN is recyclable through activating its reversibility in a high&#8208;polarity solvent heated to a threshold temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Senolysis Enabled by Senescent Cell&#8208;Sensitive Bioorthogonal&#160;Tetrazine Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although clearance of senescent cells has been proved to slow down aging process and promote anti&#8208;cancer chemotherapy, the development of senolytics remains challenging. Herein, we report a senolytic strategy enabled by senescent cell&#8208;sensitive bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation. Our design is engineering a galactose (Gal) moiety into dihydrotetrazine, which serves both as recognition moiety for senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal) and a caging group for control of tetrazine activity. We demonstrate that Gal&#8208;Tz enables efficient click&#8208;release of fluorescent HCA and doxorubicin (Dox) from TCO caged HCA and Dox prodrug to detect and eliminate senescent HeLa and A549 cells over non&#8208;senescent counterparts with 16.44 senolytic index. Furthermore, we leverage the strategy for selective activation and delivery of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as senolytics. PROTAC prodrug TCO&#8208;ARV&#8208;771 can be selectively activated by Gal&#8208;Tz and delivered into senescent HeLa and A549 cells to induce BRD4 degradation. The proof of concept of PROTACs as senolytics may offer an efficient way for intervention of cell senescence due to their unique capacity capable of degrading targeted proteins in a sub&#8208;stoichiometric and catalytic fashion. The results of the study establish the bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation approach as a viable strategy for selective removal of senescent cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Electrocatalytic and Thermocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Propionaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction can convert CO2 to value&#8208;added chemicals, but its selectivity toward C3+ products are very limited. One possible solution is to run the reactions in hybrid processes by coupling electrocatalysis with other catalytic routes. In this contribution, we report the cascade electrocatalytic and thermocatalytic reduction of CO2 to propionaldehyde. Using Cu(OH)2 nanowires as the precatalyst, CO2/H2O is reduced to concentrated C2H4, CO, and H2 gases in a zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactor. The thermochemical hydroformylation reaction is separately investigated with a series of rhodium&#8208;phosphine complexes. The best candidate is identified to be the one with the 1,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)butane diphosphine ligand, which exhibits a propionaldehyde turnover number of 1148 under a mild temperature and close to atmospheric pressure. By coupling and optimizing the upstream CO2 electroreduction and downstream hydroformylation reaction, we achieve a propionaldehyde selectivity of ~38% and a total C3 oxygenate selectivity of 44% based on reduced CO2. These values represent a more than seven times improvement over the best prior electrochemical system alone or over two times improvement over other hybrid systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Resistance&#8208;Based S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Deep Mineralization of Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep mineralization of low concentration toluene (C7H8) is one of the most significant but challenging reactions in photocatalysis. It is generally assumed that hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) as the main reactive species contribute to the enhanced photoactivity, however, it remains ambiguous at this stage. Herein, a S&#8208;scheme ZnSn(OH)6&#8208;based heterojunction with AlOOH as water resistant surface layer is in situ designed for tuning the free radical species and achieving deep mineralization of C7H8. By employing a combination of in situ DRIFTS and materials characterization techniques, we discover that&#160;the dominant intermediates such as benzaldehyde and benzoic acid instead of toxic phenols are formed under the action of holes (h+) and superoxide radicals (&#183;O2&#8208;). These dominant intermediates turn out to greatly decrease the ring&#8208;opening reaction barrier. This study offers new possibilities for rationally tailoring the active species and thus directionally producing dominant intermediates via designing water resistant surface layer.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Generally, two&#8208;dimensional gold nanomaterials have unique properties and functions that offer exciting application prospects. However, the crystal phases of these materials tend to be limited to the thermodynamically stable crystal structure. Herein, we report a DNA framework&#8208;templated approach for the ambient aqueous synthesis of freestanding and microscale amorphous gold nanosheets with ultrathin sub&#8208;nanometer thickness. We observe that extended single&#8208;stranded DNA on DNA nanosheets can induce site&#8208;specific metallization and enable precise modification of the metalized nanostructures at predefined positions. More importantly, the as&#8208;prepared gold nanosheets can serve as an electrocatalyst for glucose oxidase&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation, exhibiting enhanced electrocatalytic activity (~ 3&#8208;fold) relative to discrete gold nanoclusters owing to a larger electrochemical active area and wider band gap. The proposed DNA framework&#8208;templated metallization strategy is expected to be applicable in a broad range of fields, from catalysis to new energy materials.</dc:description>
