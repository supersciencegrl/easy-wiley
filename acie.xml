         <title>On&#8208;Demand Photodegradable and Thermo&#8211;reversible, Soft, Transparent Dithioacetal Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8211;reversible, chemically cross&#8211;linked polymers capable of altering their physicochemical and mechanical properties on demand, upon application of external stimuli (e.g., light, temperature), are highly desirable for the development of multifunctional materials. Herein, we report a facile chemical platform for the synthesis of photodegradable and thermo&#8211;reversible, model hydrogels consisting of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the elastic strands and dithioacetal moieties at the cross&#8211;link points. The gels were synthesized via an acid&#8211;catalyzed step&#8211;growth reaction of a difunctional PEG&#8211;thiol macromer with a wisely selected aromatic dialdehyde cross&#8208;linker. The formation of the photosensitive dithioacetal bonds at the cross&#8722;links rendered the hydrogels photodegradable, whereas the production of the initial comonomers as the main photoproducts after irradiation, endowed the material with thermoreversible properties. The linear viscoelastic behavior of water swollen gels, their photodegradation under UV (&#955; = 254 nm) irradiation at very low intensity (0.063 mW cm&#8211;1) and the reversible reformation of the hydrogel upon heating, were investigated by dynamic shear rheology. Mechanistic insights for the photodegradation mechanism of the system were gained by 1H NMR spectroscopy kinetic studies on a model dithioacetal compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Plant Polyphenols Into Amorphous Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phenolic&#8208;mediated molecular splicing and ring&#8208;locking strategy enables the fabrication of amorphous RTP systems with lifetimes up to 124&#160;ms. The resulting phosphorescent nanoparticles exhibit exceptional biocompatibility, enabling high&#8208;contrast, time&#8208;resolved luminescence imaging, offering a sustainable approach for biomedical RTP applications.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials have potential applications in optoelectronics and bioimaging but encounter significant challenges. Traditional heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;based and crystalline systems are often toxic and environmentally sensitive, while strategies involving host&#8211;guest doping and encapsulation frequently suffer from phase separation and limited controllability&#8212;ultimately resulting in poor repeatability and restricted applications. Here, we developed a novel polyphenol&#8208;mediated molecular splicing and ring&#8208;locking strategy to incorporate benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BZT) into polyphenol molecules, yielding a range of eco&#8208;friendly and processable amorphous single&#8208;component systems with a lifetime of up to 124&#160;ms. Experimental and calculational analyses confirm that phosphorescence arises from synergistic interactions between polyphenol and BZT. Furthermore, phosphorescent nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized via nanoprecipitation in tetrahydrofuran with 30% water content. These well&#8208;dispersed, metal&#8208;free NPs demonstrate excellent biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity, facilitating time&#8208;resolved luminescence imaging with minimal background fluorescence interference both in vitro and in vivo. This research establishes a versatile and sustainable design strategy for developing high&#8208;performance amorphous RTP materials using plant polyphenols, offering promising prospects for advanced biomedical applications.

         <title>Sub&#8208;1 nm CuO&#8208;Phosphomolybdic Acid Nanosheets for Ultrasound&#8208;Controlled Pyroptosis Activation and Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under US irradiation, copper oxide&#8208;phosphomolybdic acid (CuO&#8208;PMA) effectively generates &#185;O&#8322; and &#8226;O&#8322;&#8315;, depletes GSH, and controls the valence transition of Cu(II)/Cu(I), enhancing the generation of &#8226;OH. This process leads to mitochondrial oxidative stress, releases damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, and activates pyroptosis, triggering a strong antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Inducing pyroptosis effectively transforms immunosuppressive &#8220;cold tumors&#8221; into immunogenic &#8220;hot tumors&#8221; to enhance tumor immunotherapy. However, uncontrolled pyroptosis activation risks systemic inflammation and tumor metastasis. In this study, we used a solvothermal method to synthesize a sub&#8208;1&#160;nm copper oxide&#8208;phosphomolybdic acid nanosheet (CuO&#8208;PMA) for ultrasound (US)&#8208;controlled reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to induce pyroptosis. Owing to the narrow bandgap of CuO&#8208;PMA, the electron holes are rapidly separated under US irradiation, then quickly migrate through the sub&#8208;nanosheet structure to the surface to catalyze the formation of singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) and superoxide anions (&#8226;O&#8322;&#8315;), while simultaneously consuming glutathione (GSH). Furthermore, leveraging electron delocalization properties, US triggered the directional migration of electrons in CuO&#8208;PMA, facilitating the Cu(II)&#8208;to&#8208;Cu(I) transition to enhance hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) production. The ROS burst together with ions and h+&#8208;mediated GSH exhaustion synergistically provokes mitochondrial oxidative stress, activating the caspase&#8208;1/GSDMD axis to induce pyroptosis. In vivo experiments demonstrated that CuO&#8208;PMA significantly inhibited tumor growth and showed excellent antitumor immunotherapeutic effects. This sub&#8208;nanosheet amplifies ROS generation in response to the electronic delocalization characteristics of the US, which provides a new strategy for the ultrasound&#8208;controlled pyroptosis activation (sonopyroptosis) and tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Entire Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;I Electrochemiluminescence Enhancement of Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entire near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I) ECL enhancement strategy of gold nanoclusters (NCx, x represents the ligand of gold nanoclusters) is reported by regulating absorption wavelength of gold nanorods to precisely match ECL emission wavelength of gold nanoclusters (NCxRy, y represents the longitudinal plasmon resonance absorption wavelength of the gold nanorods), and the ECL intensity of NCxRy is 3&#8211;4 times higher than that of individual NCx.








Abstract
Herein, entire near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I) electrochemiluminescence (ECL) enhancement of gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) is achieved by continuously regulating the plasmon resonance absorption wavelength of gold nanorods (Au NRs) to precisely match ECL emission wavelength of Au NCs (abbreviated as Au NCs/Au NRs), which challenges the drawbacks of traditional single wavelength ECL enhancement strategy. Interestingly, within the range of 670&#8211;820&#160;nm, the ECL intensity of Au NCs/Au NRs is 3&#8211;4 times higher than that of individual Au NCs due to the acceleration of electron&#8208;hole recombination and radiation transition rate through high energy electromagnetic field. As a proof of concept, the Au NCs/Au NRs with the ECL emission of 670&#160;nm is employed as high&#8208;efficiency ECL emitter to achieve high&#8208;resolution ECL image and construct biosensor for realizing ultrasensitive detection of matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2) related to liver failure. Significantly, the proposed ECL enhancement strategy effectively enhances the ECL emission of metal nanoclusters (M NCs) over a wide wavelength range and advances a new path for other tunable nanomaterials to enhance the ECL emission of M NCs, which is expected to be applied to in the field of multispectral ECL imaging, multimodal optoelectronic devices, and spectrum&#8208;resolved multiplexed biosensing systems.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Dearomatization of Naphthalene and Anthracene with Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes Through Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated intramolecular dearomatization strategy of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with anthracene and naphthalene was reported. Bicyclo[4.1.1] frameworks could be obtained and (1,2,3)&#8208;cyclization of BCBs was achieved through this strategy along with further transformations. Mechanistic studies have shown that the key singlet biradical intermediate leads to the generation of two products, and the substituent on BCBs bridgehead position play a decisive role in product selectivity. 








Abstract
Cyclization of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) is an effective way to construct saturated polycyclic 3D structures. Herein we report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced intramolecular dearomative reaction to forge bicyclo[4.1.1] frameworks through (1,3)&#8208;cyclization of BCBs. Moreover, the unprecedented (1,2,3)&#8208;cyclization of BCBs through 1,4&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process was also realized along with the further transformations. The mechanistic studies revealed that the reaction was initially carried out by an energy transfer (EnT) process and the key open&#8208;shell singlet biradical intermediate may undergo [4&#960;&#160;+&#160;2&#963;] cycloaddition or 1,4&#8208;HAT process leading to the formation of two products and we found that the selectivity of product is related to the substituents at the BCBs bridgehead position. Our findings are supported by control experiments, deuterium labeling and kinetic studies, cyclic voltammetry, Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments, as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

&lt;p&gt;A visible-light-mediated intramolecular dearomatization strategy of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with anthracene and naphthalene was reported. Bicyclo[4.1.1] frameworks could be obtained and (1,2,3)-cyclization of BCBs was achieved through this strategy along with further transformations. Mechanistic studies have shown that the key singlet biradical intermediate leads to the generation of two products, and the substituent on BCBs bridgehead position play a decisive role in product selectivity. 

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Engineering the Microporous Environment of Flexible Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Bifunctionality for Promoting the Separation of Ethylene from a Ternary Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed flexible metal&#8211;organic framework featuring an engineered microporous environment with bifunctionality was achieved to provide high binding affinity for both CO2 and C2H2 and to enable efficient one&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from a ternary mixture of CO2/C2H2/C2H4.








Abstract
The separation of ethylene (C2H4) from mixtures with carbon dioxide (CO2) and acetylene (C2H2) is of great industrial importance but remains a critical challenge. Here, we report that a rationally designed flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (FMOF), featuring a specifically engineered microporous environment with bifunctionality, can promote the efficient one&#8208;step separation of C2H4 from a ternary mixture. Adsorption isotherms and dynamic breakthrough tests provide experimental evidence confirming the selective adsorption of CO2 and C2H2 over C2H4 on such a FMOF, as well as its ability to separate C2H4 from a CO2/C2H2/C2H4 ternary mixture. Theoretical calculations and simulations provide critical insights into the flexible adsorption process and the separation mechanism of the FMOF. The bifunctionality incorporated in FMOF provides exceptionally strong binding of CO2 and C2H2 but inhibition of C2H4, which, in turn, enables high adsorption selectivity for CO2/C2H4 and C2H2/C2H4. This FMOF has high potential for industrial applications in the separation of C2H4 from gas mixtures.

         <title>Spinel&#8208;Layered Heterostructure Enables Reversible Oxygen Redox in Lithium Manganese Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered lithium manganese oxide with spinel heterostructures (LMO&#8208;SH) was prepared via a novel synthetic method. It has lithium&#8208;rich local environments and exhibits reversible oxygen redox activities, distinct from the conventional Li2MnO3. The spinel heterostructure provides extra Li+ pathways to activate the bulk activity and traps oxygen molecules (O2) for reversible reduction.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based layered oxides (LRMOs) have emerged as promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), primarily due to their exceptional capacity originating from oxygen redox chemistry. Although Li2MnO3 (LMO) has been conventionally identified as the oxygen redox&#8208;active component in LRMOs, this layered material shows neither bulk redox activity nor reversible anion redox behavior in the absence of other transition metals (e.g., Ni and Co). Herein, we report a structural&#8208;engineered lithium manganese oxide with spinel&#8208;layered heterostructures (designated as LMO&#8208;SH), which exhibits reversible oxygen redox activities between lattice oxygen (O2&#8722;) and molecular oxygen (O2) &#8211; the first documented instance of such redox behavior in a manganese&#8208;based material. Through combining experimental characterization and theoretical modeling, we establish that the interfacial architecture between the spinel and layered phases facilitates the Li+ diffusion kinetics while simultaneously activating bulk oxygen redox processes. This mechanistic understanding not only advances fundamental knowledge of redox chemistry in LMO&#8208;based materials but also establishes new design principles for developing high&#8208;capacity cathodes through strategic phase engineering.

         <title>Versatile Halide&#8208;Pair&#8208;Driven Multicomponent Polymerization for Library Synthesis of Sequence&#8208;Controlled Semiconducting Dendronized Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halide&#8208;pair&#8208;driven multicomponent polymerization (MCP) strategy enables the efficient synthesis of diverse sequence&#8208;controlled semiconducting poly(triarylamine)s (PTAAs), including dendronized variants, advancing the development of next&#8208;generation organic materials.








Abstract
Sequence&#8208;controlled semiconducting polymers represent a new frontier in organic electronics, where precise molecular sequence directly dictates device performance. However, achieving both high sequence fidelity and structural diversity remains a significant challenge using conventional synthetic protocols. To address this issue, we introduce a versatile halide&#8208;pair&#8208;driven multicomponent polymerization (MCP) strategy that enables the library synthesis of sequence&#8208;controlled semiconducting poly(triarylamine)s (PTAAs). By optimizing halide pairing in conjunction with a rationally designed Buchwald ligand&#8211;Pd system featuring catalyst&#8208;transfer capability, we achieved efficient sequential cascade aminations, thereby enabling the MCP. The versatility of this strategy was demonstrated through the synthesis of a library of sequence&#8208;controlled PTAAs, including dendronized variants, underscoring its potential as a general platform for functional semiconducting material discovery.

         <title>Highly Crystalline and Oriented Thin Films of Fully Conjugated 3D&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a fully conjugated, 3D covalent organic framework (COF) based on cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh); the synthesis employs modulated conditions to achieve thin films with high crystallinity. The COTh&#8208;1P COF shows potential for optoelectronic applications, thanks to its &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, the preferential film orientation, and charge dynamics insights obtained from optical pump terahertz probe studies.








Abstract
Fully conjugated 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a newly emerged class of materials that expands reticular chemistry to extended electron delocalization for optoelectronic applications. To overcome the limitations of sp3&#8208;connected 3D frameworks, the pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral motif cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh) has gained attention for forming fully conjugated 3D COFs. We report on a novel COTh building block, featuring functional formyl groups directly attached to the core's conjugated thiophenes. The modulation synthesis approach with mono&#8208;functionalized inhibitors enables the formation of COTh&#8208;1P COF, which exhibited remarkable crystallinity and permanent porosity. By following this approach and by optimizing the synthesis conditions for the solvothermal growth of thin films, we fabricated the first preferentially oriented conjugated 3D COF films on various substrates without pre&#8208;functionalization. With these thin films, optical pump terahertz probe studies allowed us, for the first time with 3D&#8208;fully conjugated COFs, to provide insights into the excited state and charge&#8208;carrier dynamics of these unique organic frameworks. Low effective masses are discovered for valence and conduction bands by density functional theory simulations.

     alt="Highly Crystalline and Oriented Thin Films of Fully Conjugated 3D-Covalent Organic Frameworks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work introduces a fully conjugated, 3D covalent organic framework (COF) based on cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh); the synthesis employs modulated conditions to achieve thin films with high crystallinity. The COTh-1P COF shows potential for optoelectronic applications, thanks to its &#960;-conjugated structure, the preferential film orientation, and charge dynamics insights obtained from optical pump terahertz probe studies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fully conjugated 3D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a newly emerged class of materials that expands reticular chemistry to extended electron delocalization for optoelectronic applications. To overcome the limitations of sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-connected 3D frameworks, the pseudo-tetrahedral motif cyclooctatetrathiophene (COTh) has gained attention for forming fully conjugated 3D COFs. We report on a novel COTh building block, featuring functional formyl groups directly attached to the core's conjugated thiophenes. The modulation synthesis approach with mono-functionalized inhibitors enables the formation of COTh-1P COF, which exhibited remarkable crystallinity and permanent porosity. By following this approach and by optimizing the synthesis conditions for the solvothermal growth of thin films, we fabricated the first preferentially oriented conjugated 3D COF films on various substrates without pre-functionalization. With these thin films, optical pump terahertz probe studies allowed us, for the first time with 3D-fully conjugated COFs, to provide insights into the excited state and charge-carrier dynamics of these unique organic frameworks. Low effective masses are discovered for valence and conduction bands by density functional theory simulations. The ability to create crystalline and oriented films of fully &#960;-conjugated 3D COTh-based COFs on non-modified substrates is expected to open the way for integration of such frameworks into diverse optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Balancing Tetrahedral and Cation Entropies for Long&#8208;lifespan Low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, their&#160;application&#160;is hindered by Zn anode instability and reduced ionic conductivity at low temperatures. Here, we identified two decisive factors for low&#8208;temperature performance and anode stability of batteries: tetrahedral entropy and cation entropy. The former is closely related to antifreezing ability of electrolyte, while the latter is associated with&#160;the desolvation&#160;kinetics&#160;of&#160;Zn2+. We propose an effective strategy to balance the above two thermodynamic quantities by precisely tuning the molar fraction of the 1,3&#8208;butanediol (BDO) cosolvent with notable&#160;glass&#8208;forming ability. BDO enhances the tetrahedral entropy due to the disruption of the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks among water molecules, decreasing the solid&#8208;liquid transition temperature from &#8208;16.4 to &#8208;101 &#176;C. Additionally, BDO modifies the solvated structure of Zn&#178;&#8314;&#160;to limit the active water content, thus suppressing by&#8208;reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The optimized electrolyte enables long&#8208;term cycling of Zn||Zn symmetric cells for over 4000 h at &#8208;40 &#176;C&#160;under 0.1 mA cm&#8208;2/0.1 mAh cm&#8208;2,&#160;and renders PANI||Zn full cells capable of working across a broad temperature range (&#8208;40 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C). This work offers a guideline to design stable&#160;and low&#8208;temperature AZIBs, expanding the application scope&#160;for aqueous electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Co sites in n&#8208;n type heterojunction enable selective electrochemical co&#8208;valorization of HMF and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO are two highly investigated areas. Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial&#8208;engineered CoS/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C n&#8208;n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record&#8208;low onset potential of 1.12 V (vs. RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO2RR, which outperform the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO2RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50&#8208;hour continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co&#8208;N4 electron&#8208;deficient and Co&#8208;S electron&#8208;rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction via charge accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Reinforce Buried Interface Anchoring for High&#8208;Efficiency Tandem Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been commonly used as a single&#8208;component hole transport layer (HTL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but suffer from facile &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and self&#8208;aggregations in solution and consequently poor anchoring ability with the atop perovskite layer. Herein, we developed a synergistic SAM (syn&#8208;SAM) strategy through blending a non&#8208;planar molecule 3,3&#8208;(4&#8208;amino&#8208;4H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;diyl)&#8208;dibenzo acid (ABT) bearing multiple anchoring sites with the commonly used Me&#8208;4PACz SAM. The coexistence of these two components leverages &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and hydrogen bonding to mitigate aggregation effects, affording dense and uniform SAM, thereby enhancing anchoring at the perovskite buried interface and alleviating interfacial charge recombination. ABT incorporation further helps to mitigating tensile strain in perovskite film. Additionally, this strategy offers advantages of multi&#8208;device compatibility. The single&#8208;junction champion inverted PSC devices based on syn&#8208;SAM deliver power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.75% (certified 25.45%) and 22.76% (area: 0.105 cm2) for 1.56 eV and 1.68 eV bandgap perovskites, respectively. Moreover, this approach is beneficial for the monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells based on fully textured surfaces of heterojunction (HJT) silicon bottom cells, affording PCEs of 31.56% (area: 1.07 cm2) and 26.57% (area: 20.06 cm2). All devices exhibit excellent long&#8208;term storage and thermal stability even under non&#8208;encapsulated conditions</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In photoactive metal complexes the localization of photoexcited charges dictates the site of chemical reactivity, but few studies measure the charge redistribution in these systems with spatial precision. Herein, we track the inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer processes that underpin light&#8208;driven charge separation in the well&#8208;studied &#8220;molecular lightswitch&#8221; [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ (aqueous [RutheniumII(2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine)2(dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine)]2+[Cl&#8208;]2) by probing the electronic structure of ligand nitrogen atoms in real&#8208;time using ultrafast x&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and first principles calculations. We confirm the localization of excited electron density on the phenazine N atoms of dppz and we newly identify two parallel electron transfer pathways to populate this state. &#160;Sub&#8208;70 fs electron transfer to the phenazine portion of dppz is observed and attributed to intra&#8208;ligand electron transfer following Ru&#8208;to&#8208;dppz metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excitation. This fast charge transfer was not reported in prior ultrafast studies. The slower (ca. 2 ps) charge transfer reported extensively in time&#8208;resolved optical absorption and emission studies is reassigned here to inter&#8208;ligand electron &#8220;hopping&#8221; between nearly isoenergetic ligand moieties following Ru&#8208;to&#8208;bpy MLCT excitation. The results demonstrate much faster charge separation than previously identified in this well&#8208;studied system, highlighting how extended azaacene ligand motifs promote the competitive charge transfer processes needed to drive light&#8208;driven electron transfer chemistry.</dc:description>

Herein, we report a dual&#8208;sided multidentate coordination (DMC) strategy to construct two butterfly&#8208;shaped UV organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid crystals&#8212;(C6H4NO2)2SbF (PCSF) and (C10H6NO2)2SbF (QCSF)&#8212;in which planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated bidentate ligands symmetrically chelate stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP) Sb3+ centers. This coordination architecture enforces coplanar alignment of optical functional units and promotes dense &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, thereby significantly enhancing macroscopic birefringence. Notably, QCSF achieves a record&#8208;high birefringence of &#916;n = 0.87 at 546&#8239;nm, surpassing all previously reported lone&#8208;pair&#8208;containing halide crystals with UV transparency. The exceptional optical performance is attributed to the unique [SbN2O2F] coordination geometry, near&#8208;planar molecular configuration, and extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the observed anisotropy stems from synergistic orbital coupling between the Sb centers and the &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic ligands. This work introduces a broadly applicable molecular design paradigm for next&#8208;generation birefringent crystals that simultaneously offer high optical anisotropy and UV transparency.</dc:description>

         <title>A Guest Cation Screening Principle for Enabling Customized Cathode/Electrolyte Interface Chemistry and Self&#8208;Enhanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intrinsic structural instability and sluggish reaction kinetics at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface are two critical concerns that block the application of MnO2 cathode in high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This work proposes a theoretical screening principle to select the compatible guest cation for MnO2 host, not only to strengthen the structure but also customize high&#8208;efficiency cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI). As identified, Sr2+ is selected as the suitable intercalation ion that enable in&#8208;situ forming the SrSO4 CEI after partial release upon charge process. Moreover, density functional theory calculation and multiple characterization research indicate that such SrSO4 interphase shows an electronic insulation to stabilize the interfacial pH, inhibit the Mn dissolution, and promote the efficient de&#8208;solvation of hydrated zinc ions. Benefited from the self&#8208;optimizing cathode/electrolyte interface chemistry, the 2.5% Sr&#8208;MnO2 one exhibits higher specific capacity (304.1 mA h g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1), better rate capability (115 mA h g&#8208;1 at 10 A g&#8208;1), as well as higher capacity retention of 87.9% after 1000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1, when compared with pure &#948;&#8208;MnO2 electrode. This study provides a new insight on understanding the functions of ion intercalation engineering to design robust layered cathode for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Zwitterionic Electrolyte Additive for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Ammonium Alkyl Sulfonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte additive is an important component of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. At present, commercial film&#8208;forming additives can only work on either anode or cathode so as to increase the complexity and decrease the efficiency of the electrolyte. In this work, we designed and synthesized a novel zwitterionic 3&#8208;(triethylammonium)&#8208;propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (TEAPS) additive, which can adsorb on the surface of both graphite anode and LiCoO2 cathode in propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte. The kinetically and thermodynamically favorable film&#8208;forming reaction of TEAPS promotes the formation of a robust F/S/N&#8208;species Domaine interface, thereby enables greatly improved cycling performance. It is believed that the zwitterionic TEAPS will work as a novel versatile additive for high&#8208;performance LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating hydrophobic and hydrophilic building blocks for high&#8208;performance organic electrochemical transistors and biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) with mixed ionic&#8210;electronic transport features have demonstrated significant potential in biosensing applications. Semiconductor polymers grafted with hydrophilic side chains have notably enhanced performance and applications. However, water&#8208;induced overswelling and doping in biocompatible aqueous environments hinder high&#8208;sensitivity detection. In this study, we introduce two block copolymers, DPP&#8208;b&#8208;Pg2T&#8208;T and NDI&#8208;b&#8208;Pg2T&#8208;T, which integrate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments to achieve balanced ionic/ electronic conductivities and the sensing performance. These materials effectively suppress swelling and water doping, resulting in low noise signals in aqueous electrolytes. Consequently, devices based on two polymer materials exhibit superior ion concentration variation performance and enhanced sensing capabilities, with an improved sensitivity to dopamine (DA) of up to 266 mV/dec.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Hydrogen Oxidation for Hydroxide Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells Catalyzed by Fivefold&#8208;Twinned Nickel Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The independent regulation of multiple intermediates is critically important for optimizing the electronic structure of nickel (Ni), thereby improving its catalytic performance in the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). However, conventional regulation strategies based on the Hammer&#8211;N&#248;rskov d&#8208;band model often change the HBE and OHBE in a synchronized manner. Herein, we find that a catalyst consisting of fivefold&#8208;twinned ultrasmall Ni nanoparticles could tune hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE) individually via the strain effect. Experimental and theoretical calculations suggest that tensile strain in proximity to the twin boundary (TB) significantly enhances OHBE, allows for adjustable HBE due to unique geometric effects, and greatly reduces HBE at specific sites, enabling an unprecedented HOR activity. The catalyst has a high jk,m value of 106 mA mgNi&#8208;1, which is 24.2 times greater than that of Ni/C. The hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) with a fivefold&#8208;twinned Ni nanoparticle anode delivers a peak power density (PPD) of 805 mW&#8201;cm&#8208;2 with a H2/O2 gas feed, which is the highest among Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts reported thus far. Furthermore, the catalyst also exhibits excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance, taking a giant step forward toward the commercialization of platinum group metal (PGM)&#8208;free HEMFCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Precision Screening and Surgical Resection of Pan&#8208;Cancer Using a Tandem&#8208;Locked NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Probe with Optimized Activation Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of fluorescent probes for cancer detection and imaging that balance high sensitivity, precision, and broad applicability remains a significant challenge. Although &#8220;dual&#8208;locked&#8221; probes have been devised to enhance diagnostic accuracy via two biomarkers, most fall short in sensitivity, response&#8208;time and generalizability for pan&#8208;cancer use. We address these gaps with ACy&#8208;H&#8208;NTR, a cascaded&#8208;activation, doubly&#8208;quenched NIR&#8208;II probe. Engineered to respond to hypoxia and acidity&#8212;universal tumor hallmarks&#8212;it offers fast&#8208;response, high sensitivity and specificity for pan&#8208;cancer screening and imaging. In contrast to existing probes, its tandem&#8208;locked design ensures robust activation exclusively within pan&#8208;tumor microenvironments, effectively reducing false positives and delineating precise diagnostic boundaries. Its NIR&#8208;II emission and &#8220;activation&#8208;retention&#8221; mechanism enhances tumor imaging efficacy, and effectively tackles issues of rapid clearance and background noise, achieving 4.9&#8208;fold higher tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) ratio than ICG and retaining tumor specificity for over 2 days. In pan&#8208;cancer models, it enables high&#8208;contrast imaging (T/N ~7.8) and precise resection with sub&#8208;2 mm margins. Crucially, it differentiates human carcinoma from adjacent tissues with sharp boundaries, confirming clinical potential. By integrating a tandem&#8208;locked and doubly&#8208;quenched design that simultaneously optimizes activation efficiency, NIR&#8208;II imaging capabilities, and activation&#8208;retention mechanisms, this probe overcomes current limitations to enable precise pan&#8208;cancer identification and surgical navigation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction with organic oxidation is regarded as an ideal strategy for achieving carbon neutrality. However,&#160;enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency is persistently blocked by low photogenerated carrier yields and unavoidable fast electron/hole recombination. Herein, we propose to design a plasmonic&#8208;ferroelectric heterojunction (WO3&#8208;x/K4Nb6O17), which enhances localized electromagnetic field and ferroelectric polarization field simultaneously through the cooperative coupling of localized surface plasmon resonance&#160;effect in WO3&#8208;x and ferroelectric polarization in K4Nb6O17, thereby not only promoting energetic hot&#8208;carriers generation, but also accelerating bulk charge separation. Ultimately, hot&#8208;electrons and photoelectrons are directionally transferred and extracted to K4Nb6O17 surface for CO2 reduction, whereas massive holes are accumulated in WO3&#8208;x for benzylicalcohol activation. Under mild&#8208;conditions, WO3&#8208;x/K4Nb6O17 exhibits superior CO yield (294.76&#181;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1), which is 9.87 and 6.27&#8208;folds higher than that of K4Nb6O17 and WO3&#8208;x, respectively. Meanwhile, compared to the simple dehydrogenation of benzylicalcohol to benzaldehyde in K4Nb6O17 and WO3&#8208;x, WO3&#8208;x/K4Nb6O17 prefers to trigger benzylicalcohol C&#8208;C coupling for directed production of more value&#8208;added hydrobenzoin (313.15&#181;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1). This work would open a conceptual vista for designing multi&#8208;field coupling structures to facilitate charge spatial separation and directional transfer, which would inspire further establishment of efficient novel photocatalysts and solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion systems to meet the green and sustainable development goals.</dc:description>

         <title>Doping Bulky Fluorinated Organic Anion to Construct Highly Efficient Anion&#8208;&#960;+ Type Photosensitizers for Cancer Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion&#8208;&#960;+ type photosensitizers with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature have demonstrated promising potential in photodynamic therapy (PDT) against cancer. However, previous reports mainly focused on modifying the &#960;+ core but often overlooked the crucial role of anions. Herein, we present a facile strategy to modulate the fluorescence intensity and cellular uptake of anion&#8208;&#960;+ type AIE photosensitizers by doping bulky fluorinated organic anions into nanoparticles (NPs). Anion&#8208;&#960;+ type AIE photosensitizer DPBCF&#8208;Br with different ratios of bulky anions (TB or FTB) were encapsulated into DSPE&#8208;PEG2000 to obtain NPs (named DF&#8208;TBX or DF&#8208;FTBX, X denotes the molar ratios of TB or FTB to DPBCF&#8208;Br). Expectedly, as the doping molar ratios increased, a progressive enhancement in fluorescence intensity of the obtained NPs was observed. This can be ascribed to the steric effect of bulky organic anions and the formation of a hydrophobic environment within the NPs. Interestingly, the optimal cellular uptake was achieved at X=8 in DF&#8208;TB8 and DF&#8208;FTB8, resulting from the balance between lipophilicity and electronegativity. Ultimately, DF&#8208;FTB8 demonstrated outstanding cellular imaging capabilities and high intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, achieving efficient cancer phototheranostics. This facile bulky anion doping strategy will pave a new way for the construction of robust anion&#8208;&#960;+ type photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>C(sp2)&#8211;H Bond Activation with a Heterometallic Nickel&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Aluminium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present a ligand&#8208;catalysed bond breaking and making process that occurs with a Ni&#8211;&#8205;Al heterometallic complex. While combinations of Ni pre&#8208;catalysts and Al additives are known for site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H functionalisation, detailed studies of such systems are rare. Combining [Ni(COD)2] and [(BDI)AlH2] (1; BDI = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyldiketiminate), results in facile formation of a Ni&#8211;&#8205;Al heterometallic complex [(&#951;4&#8209;COD)Ni{&#956;&#8209;H)2Al(BDI)}] (2; COD = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene). Once generated, this species can effect the C(sp2)&#8211;H activation of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or pyridine with concomitant H2 evolution; a process that is accelerated through addition of PCy3. The mechanism was studied through kinetics, kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), isotope labelling studies, and modelling. The reaction is 1st order in PCy3 and proceeds with a KIE of 0.9&#8208;1.1. Support is provided for a pathway involving the synergistic action of both metals, promoted by reversible coordination of the phosphine. The data suggest that both C&#8211;H oxidative addition and H2 reductive elimination steps in this system are readily accessible, and are not rate limiting. This finding has implications for future catalyst design using combinations of Ni and Al metals and suggests that control of ligand exchange steps, may be the most important consideration in determining the rate of reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric, Corner&#8208;Sharing CuO5 and CuO6 Motifs in Cu&#8208;Based Metallic Perovskite Oxides Boosting Asymmetric C&#9472;C Coupling for CO2 Electroreduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique type of Cu&#8208;based metallic perovskite oxides with asymmetric, corner&#8208;sharing CuO5 and CuO6 motifs were reported to promote asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalyst, La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948; was the most effective Cu&#8208;based&#8208;perovskite catalyst for C2+ production and performed comparably with or better than most reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts.








Abstract
Cu&#8208;based perovskite oxides feature significant potential for CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) but encounter insufficient C2+ selectivity primarily due to the inherent symmetric charge distribution at Cu sites hindering asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling. Here we report a unique type of Cu&#8208;based metallic perovskite oxides with asymmetric, corner&#8208;sharing CuO5 and CuO6 motifs to boost asymmetric C&#9472;C coupling for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. For the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalyst of La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948;, their ordered, corner&#8208;sharing CuO5 pyramids and CuO6 octahedra feature localized charge density redistribution, creating abundant asymmetric Cu&#9472;Cu dual sites with distinct electronic structures and also strengthening Cu&#9472;O covalency. In CO2RR (in both alkaline and acidic media), La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948; greatly promotes C2+ formation while producing negligible CH4, showing a Faradaic efficiency ratio (C2+ to CH4) of up to 180. Moreover, La0.8Ba0.2CuO3&#8208;&#948;, achieving a remarkable C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 85.0% at 400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, together with well&#8208;boosted stability, outperforms previously reported Cu&#8208;based&#8208;perovskite catalysts. Our experiments and theoretical calculations attribute the superb performance mainly to the following factors: the asymmetric CuO5&#9472;CuO6 sites promoting differentiated *CO adsorption/hydrogenation to favor asymmetric *CO&#9472;*CHO coupling; the strengthened Cu&#9472;O covalency stabilizing the Cu sites. Extending this strategy to two additional pairs of Cu&#8208;based perovskite oxides generates similarly successful results.

         <title>Intracellular Delivery of Native Proteins by BioReversible Arginine Modification (BioRAM) on Amino Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioreversible Arginine Modification of amine&#8208;containing protein residues (termed BioRAM) allows the serum&#8208;compatible, readily accessible, and efficient delivery of native proteins into live cells. Combined with cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP) additives, BioRAM results in intracellular RNase A activity at nanomolar concentrations, thus enabling the cellular delivery of native protein cargoes without additional genetic engineering. 








Abstract
Protein&#8208;based tools are emerging as innovative solutions to interfere with biological pathways in molecular biology and medicine. They offer advantages over traditional small molecules due to their adaptable structural diversity and their ability to engage previously inaccessible cellular targets. However, most proteins do not penetrate the lipid bilayer of mammalian cells and are therefore restricted to extracellular targets. Despite recent advances, a general method for the delivery of functional proteins into human cells remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a bioreversible protein modification strategy of amines using short arginine&#8208;containing peptides (termed BioRAM) that enables cytosolic delivery starting from genetically non&#8208;engineered proteins. We optimized the bioconjugation strategy to achieve fast intracellular cleavage and complete recovery of the native protein. In combination with our previously established cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;additive protocol, we show superior delivery of fluorescent protein and functional RNase A into the cytosol, achieving physiological response. Moreover, we are able to demonstrate the excellent performance of BioRAM in the presence of serum, thereby broadening the scope for intracellular applications of functional proteins.

&lt;p&gt;Protein-based tools are emerging as innovative solutions to interfere with biological pathways in molecular biology and medicine. They offer advantages over traditional small molecules due to their adaptable structural diversity and their ability to engage previously inaccessible cellular targets. However, most proteins do not penetrate the lipid bilayer of mammalian cells and are therefore restricted to extracellular targets. Despite recent advances, a general method for the delivery of functional proteins into human cells remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a bioreversible protein modification strategy of amines using short arginine-containing peptides (termed BioRAM) that enables cytosolic delivery starting from genetically non-engineered proteins. We optimized the bioconjugation strategy to achieve fast intracellular cleavage and complete recovery of the native protein. In combination with our previously established cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)-additive protocol, we show superior delivery of fluorescent protein and functional RNase A into the cytosol, achieving physiological response. Moreover, we are able to demonstrate the excellent performance of BioRAM in the presence of serum, thereby broadening the scope for intracellular applications of functional proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Symmetry Breaking Enabled Stable Oxygen Redox in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes via &#960;&#8208;Type Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial Li/Ni disordered via hydrothermal treatment is achieved in Li&#8208;rich cathode materials to trigger a robust &#960;&#8208;type interaction between metal and ligand. The reductive coupling (charge transfer from O 2p to Ni t2g) and induced symmetry breaking of NiO6 is confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, which avoids excessive irreversible oxygen release from non&#8208;bonding O 2p state.








Abstract
Effectively stabilizing oxygen redox is the most challenging task for the practical applications of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;rich cathode materials. However, how to accurately tune the oxygen energy level to achieve reversible redox remains puzzling so far. In this work, we achieve stable oxygen redox in layered Li&#8208;rich materials over the whole voltage range without irreversible O2 release by adjusting the interlayer metal cation environment adjacent to the ligand. Combining synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical analysis of metal&#8208;ligand orbital combinations, we confirm the obvious charge transfer from O to Ni due to the &#960;&#8208;type interaction between Ni 3d spin&#8208;down t2g orbitals and O 2p orbitals. Furthermore, Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the Ni coordination environment after Li extraction under the &#960;&#8208;type interaction, which enhances the intrinsic competition between anion and cation oxidation, keeping &#960;* state (from O 2p splitting) below the metal band to avoid over&#8208;oxidation. As a result, the modified material shows improved electrochemical performance and stable structural/interface evolution. This work provides new insights into the relationship between the adjacent metal environment and the ligand O redox reactions.

         <title>Nuclear Quantum Confinement Enables Robust Deuterium Bonds for Highly Reversible Aluminum Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum confinement by leveraging D as a quantum bridge is engineered to tailor stronger intra&#8208; and intermolecular D&#8208;bonds, effectively suppressing water reactivity and achieving exceptional HER inhibition. The induced Al3+ solvation structures further inhibit the decomposition of water at the interface and improve Al redox reversibility.








Abstract
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) fundamentally limits aluminum electroreduction in aqueous electrolytes by dominating interfacial charge transfer. Here, we suppress HER by engineering deuterium bonds (D&#8208;bonds) through nuclear quantum effects, confining D between D&#8322;O and DMF molecules. This quantum confinement weakens hydrogen delocalization and restructures the Al3+ solvation sheath, reducing water activity kinetically and thermodynamically. The regulated electrolyte enables uniform aluminum nucleation and dense plating layers, achieving 569&#160;h (0.05&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and 379&#160;h (0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) cycling stability in the 2D2O/1DMF electrolyte, which outperforms traditional sulfate electrolytes by 3.6 and 6.1 times, respectively. Our work uniquely leverages nuclear quantum confinement to engineer robust D&#8208;bonds, simultaneously suppressing HER and enabling atomic&#8208;level control over aluminum ion solvation structures for unprecedented Al redox reversibility in sulfate electrolytes. This exemplification pushes the electrolyte engineering from extensive component adjustment to quantum precision engineering, which provides an innovative solution for the high&#8208;activity water&#8208;based battery system

         <title>Synergy of Oxygen Vacancies and Ni Single Atoms toward Efficient Urea Photosynthesis from CO2 and N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct photochemical synthesis of urea under mild conditions presents considerable promise. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic urea synthesis is severely restricted by the co&#8208;adsorption and activation of inert CO2 and N2 molecules. Herein, an ingenious&#160;design of a high&#8208;performance Ni1/TiO2&#8208;X catalyst by strategically coupling Ni single atoms and oxygen vacancies (Ov) onto urchin&#8208;like TiO2 architecture. By virtue of the unique synergistic catalysis between atomically dispersed Ni species and precisely engineered Ov sites, the Ni1/TiO2&#8208;X catalyst achieves a remarkable urea production rate of 15.73 &#181;mol/gcat./h. Further mechanistic studies reveal that the atomically dispersed Ni sites facilitate N2 adsorption and activation, generating *N2 species, while the adjacent Ov sites activate CO2 to form *CO intermediates. More intriguingly, the *CO species can migrate from the Ov site to the nearby Ni active centers, where they spontaneously undergo thermodynamic coupling with *N2 to form a &#8220;tower&#8208;like&#8221; urea precursor (*NCON* intermediate), subsequently converting to urea. The present work establishes a dual&#8208;active&#8208;site mechanism, comprising isolated Ni centers and adjacent Ov sites, which synergistically lowers the activation barrier for urea photosynthesis and accelerates reaction kinetics, and pioneers a transition strategy for the environmentally friendly and efficient synthesis of high&#8208;value products.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Sieving Effect of Multi&#8208;Atomic Bismuth Interfaces for Efficient Formate Electrosynthesis and Evolution at Industrial Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing multi&#8208;atomic interfaces architectures are promising for electrocatalytic CO2&#160;conversion, yet their synthesis and stability under industrial current densities remain challenging. Herein, multi&#8208;atomic Bi interfaces&#160;(Bi0/Bi&#948;+&#160;moiety) were precisely engineered by embedding atomically dispersed Bi centers, encompassing both Bi single atoms and Bi atomic clusters into the substrate of porous Bi2O3&#8208;x nanosheets. The composite showcases outstanding CO2 conversion performance, attaining remarkable faradaic efficiency for formate (FEformate) of 96.48% (at ultralow potential of &#8208;0.5 V vs. RHE) and 92.26% in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, along with exceptional long&#8208;term stability over 150 h. Depending on designed CH3OH electrooxidation catalyst (CuOx/ZnCo(OH)x) at the anode, which couples CO2 conversion at the cathode, symmetrical/asymmetrical electrolyzer system were developed. The approach could obtain high&#8208;added value products with FEformate &gt;90% at both electrodes, achieving production rate of 4980 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8208;2&#160;under industrial current density. Combined In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations unravel that multiple atomic interfaces featuring interfacial atomic sieving effect effectively enhance preferential binding of *H and *CO2 to form *OCHO, while simultaneously suppressing the undesired recombination of hydrogen species into H2, rationalizing the high selectivity.

         <title>Antisolvent&#8208;bathing Strategy with Ultra&#8208;wide Processing Window for Making High&#8208;efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells in Ambient Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most record&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells rely on spin&#8208;coating with antisolvent dripping, which is fundamentally incompatible with roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing. The crystallization kinetics of dynamic wet film during spin coating differs widely from the static wet film during roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll fabrication, which makes the existing crystallization control strategies become inapplicable while upscaling. The crystallization regulation of static wet film remains a critical challenge, particularly under ambient conditions. In this study, we employed antisolvent&#8208;bathing method that can efficiently regulate the crystallization process of static wet films made by drop coating. Through systematic investigation of solvent&#8208;antisolvent interdiffusion kinetics and in&#8208;situ crystallization monitoring via time&#8208;resolved UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, we identify alkyl chlorides (particularly chloroform) as optimal bathing agents. The champion device made by CF bathing achieved an efficiency of 24.49% under ambient conditions (RH 30&#8211;50%), representing the highest efficiency for perovskite solar cells made by antisolvent bathing method. The device showed negligible decay after 2256 hours storage in N2 atmosphere. The method demonstrates exceptional environmental resilience to humidity and solvent accumulation, accompanied with an ultra&#8208;wide processing window (10 s&#8211;10 min bathing duration, &gt;2 min post&#8208;bathing delay tolerance).</dc:description>

         <title>Metalloenzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation for the Synthesis of Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral amines are prevalent in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic catalysts. Their increasing demand has driven the advancement of synthetic methods. In this study, we developed a metalloenzyme&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation method for the synthesis of chiral amines. Given the challenges of traditional chemical synthesis, which relies on precious metals and complex synthetic ligands, our approach utilizes base metals derived from natural metalloenzymes for transfer hydrogenation and employs protein scaffolds to achieve stereochemical control. Furthermore, in contrast to natural NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent C=N bond reductases, this strategy utilizes silanes as reducing agents and is entirely orthogonal to conventional NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent cellular functions. This reactivity highlights the potential to develop new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymatic functions capable of addressing challenges in both organic synthesis and biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Fe&#8208;N4&#8208;anchored Carbon Layer Patched TiO2 Cavities to Construct an "In&#8208;lattice Heterojunction" for Enhanced Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient charge separation and carrier transfer are critical determinants of the performance of photocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR) which are critical for agricultural and chemical industries. In this study, a novel type of heterostructure, termed an "in&#8208;lattice heterojunction&#8221;, has been constructed by introducing a Fe&#8208;N4&#8208;anchored carbon layer (Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C) onto the surface of defective TiO2 (D&#8208;TiO2), as well as implanting it into the cavities of D&#8208;TiO2. The in&#8208;lattice heterojunction, defined as FNCTO, achieves efficient radial carrier transfer along the Ti&#8208;C&#8208;N&#8208;Fe in&#8208;lattice atomic channel and greatly promoted N2 adsorption benefiting photocatalytic NRR. Thus, FNCTO exhibits an excellent photocatalytic N2 reduction into NH3 activity (88 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1), obviously higher than that of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C sites on non&#8208;cavity P25, illustrating the crucial role of cavity patch induced in&#8208;lattice heterojunction. This study paves a way for the development of high&#8208;performance Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C atomic photocatalysts based on non&#8208;carbon materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Alkylation of Ambident Nucleophiles Enables Selective&#160;N&#8209;Functionalization of Heterocycles and Late&#8208;Stage Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The alkylation with electrophilic haloalkanes is a key methodology in chemical synthesis to build desired molecules. While alkylation of compounds bearing a single nucleophilic site is routine, the selective alkylation of polyfunctional molecules with multiple competing nucleophilic positions of comparable reactivity is often very challenging. In this work, we report a generalizable solution for selective alkylation chemistry that combines the selectivity of enzyme catalysis with the reactivity of off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf alkylation reagents. We employ engineered transferases in a modular cyclic cascade and use functionalized N&#8208;heteroarenes as challenging proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept substrates. This catalytic alkylation approach is mild, highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective, proceeds on gram&#8208;scale, provides rapid access to important N&#8208;alkylated heterocyclic building blocks and enables challenging late&#8208;stage alkylations. This study demonstrates a generalizable strategy to streamline synthetic routes to many pharmaceutically important compounds by selective biocatalytic alkylation of polyfunctional molecules and ambident nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Universal Chemical Presodiation Under Air Condition for Highly Stable Na&#8208;deficient Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal chemical presodiation strategy using Na&#8208;Bpy/DEE is proposed for Na&#8208;deficient oxide cathodes under air condition, which promotes formation of uniform and robust NaF&#8208;rich interface during presodiation. This minimizes stress accumulation and structure distortion upon Na+ intercalation/extraction to exhibit high&#8208;capacity retention.








Abstract
Layered transition&#8208;metal oxides have attracted growing attention for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs); however, their application is hindered by low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) due to Na&#8208;deficiency and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase formation. Herein, a universal chemical presodiation pathway is reported with Na&#8208;bipyridine dissolved in diethyl ether (Na&#8208;Bpy/DEE) for stable Na&#8208;deficient P2&#8208;Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 (NNMO) electrode under air condition. The strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing N&#8208;functional groups of Bpy&#8226;&#8722; radicals endow its air insensitivity, and it reduces the NNMO cathode for compensation of Na+ from the weakly solvating DEE. This results in a uniform and robust NaF&#8208;rich interface to prevent surface lattice disorder of NNMO, which is caused by local stress, and preserve structure integrity. The presodiated NNMO electrode shows high ICE of 100% and reversible capacity of 158.3 mAh g&#8722;1, and its pouch cell coupled with hard carbon presents high&#8208;capacity retention of 95.9% after 200 cycles. This work proposes an industrially feasible presodiation strategy to highly efficient SIBs.

         <title>A Bifunctional Organic Photocatalyst for Efficient Single&#8208;Electron and Energy Transfer Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thioaryl hydroxycoumarins are versatile, metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for both single&#8208;electron (SET), and energy transfer (EnT) pathways, enabling radical and triplet energy transfer reactions with a single organic scaffold.








Abstract
Bifunctional photocatalysts capable of mediating both single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) and energy transfer (EnT) processes are rare and typically metal based. Here, we present 3&#8208;thioaryl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins, a new family of cost&#8208;effective organic photocatalysts that leverage a stabilized charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excited state to achieve both strong reducing power and efficient energy transfer. The spatial separation of the HOMO and LUMO stabilizes the CT state, enhancing SET reactivity (E*red&#160;=&#160;&#8722;3.08&#160;V vs. SCE) while maintaining a sufficiently high triplet energy (ET&#160;=&#160;67 kcal mol&#8722;1) for EnT&#8208;driven transformations. This dual reactivity enables the activation of redox&#8208;inert substrates (Ered&#160;&lt;&#160;&#8722;2.8&#160;V vs. SCE) via SET reduction, generating radicals suitable for diverse C&#9472;S, C&#8208;&#9472;P, C&#9472;B, and C&#9472;C bond&#8208;forming transformations, alongside EnT&#8208;based processes such as E/Z olefin isomerization and [2&#160;+&#160;2] photocycloadditions. Mechanistic studies, supported by photophysical and theoretical analyses, confirmed the catalyst's bifunctionality.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Electronically Polarized Fe&#8208;N5 Catalysts Redirect Polymerization&#8208;Driven Phenolic Pollutant Removal Toward Sustainable Carbon Sequestration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;range electronically polarized Fe&#8208;N5 catalyst is developed, enabling specific and efficient peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;catalyst complex generation. BPA removal is redirected by tailored PMS complexes from conventional radical&#8208;mediated mineralization pathways to interfacial polymerization. A 4&#8211;668 times higher total organic carbon (TOC) removal than reported for iron&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;SACs) is achieved, with sustainable practical wastewater treatment and carbon sequestration observed (&gt;1700&#160;h operation).








Abstract
A sustainable strategy for simultaneous pollutant removal and carbon sequestration is offered by the peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;mediated electron transfer mechanism.

&lt;p&gt;A long-range electronically polarized Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst is developed, enabling specific and efficient peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-catalyst complex generation. BPA removal is redirected by tailored PMS complexes from conventional radical-mediated mineralization pathways to interfacial polymerization. A 4&#8211;668 times higher total organic carbon (TOC) removal than reported for iron-based single-atom catalysts (Fe-SACs) is achieved, with sustainable practical wastewater treatment and carbon sequestration observed (&amp;gt;1700&#160;h operation).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sustainable strategy for simultaneous pollutant removal and carbon sequestration is offered by the peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-mediated electron transfer mechanism. However, it remains challenging to achieve catalysts with durable and high activity. A novel catalyst design strategy leveraging boron doping that induces long-range electronic polarization to precisely modulate PMS complexation dynamics on single-atom catalysts (SACs) is proposed in this study. It is demonstrated that B-doping induces asymmetric Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; coordination at the atomic iron centers (Fe&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;-BNC) while creating electron-enriched carbon auxiliary sites. The electron distribution is synergistically optimized by this dual-site configuration through lowering the d-band center and establishing a polarized charge transfer pathway. Complexes with enhanced oxidation potential are generated by the engineered Fe&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;-BNC/PMS, redirecting bisphenol A degradation from conventional radical-mediated mineralization to an interfacial polymerization pathway via outer-sphere electron transfer. Remarkably, &amp;gt;3 times higher total organic carbon (TOC) removal activity compared to state-of-the-art catalysts and 4 orders of magnitude higher reactivity than conventional carbon nitride (CN) catalyst are exhibited by the optimized catalyst. Excellent operational stability (&amp;gt;1700&#160;h continuous operation) with &amp;gt;120&#160;L actual wastewater treatment capacity is demonstrated by practical implementation in a continuous-flow microreactor.

         <title>Tailoring Co Coordination Mode in COF Nanosheets for Efficient Solar&#8208;driven Reduction of Non&#8208;neat CO2 into Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO2&#160;where&#160;CO2 enrichment and purification&#160;is an energy&#8208;intensive process. Herein, we report a Co&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF with asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO2. The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst Co17.7&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from neat CO2 and 180.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from 40 vol% CO2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 116.0 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits widely and continuously adjustable CO/H2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the COF by formation of atomic dispersed N&#8208;Co&#8208;O4 sites, enhances dissociation of water and CO2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for the photoreduction CO2 to syngas.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C Addition of Glycinate to Nitroalkenes by Pyridoxal/Nd Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridoxal/Nd dual catalytic system enables asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C Michael addition of NH2&#8208;unprotected glycinate to nitroalkenes, providing a highly efficient approach to make biologically significant &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters in good yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.








Abstract
Direct enantioselective &#945;&#8208;C Michael addition of NH2&#8208;unprotected glycinate to nitroalkenes is a significant organic transformation, which may provide a highly efficient strategy to make bioactive chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters. However, it is extremely challenging to achieve this reaction due to the interference of the reactive NH2 group, potential [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition side reaction and complicated stereoselective control. Carbonyl catalysis is an effective strategy to activate glycinate by forming an imine to facilitate the conjugate addition. With a pyridoxal/Nd dual catalytic system, direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C conjugate addition of glycinate to nitroalkenes has been successfully developed for the first time, producing a broad range of chiral &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid esters in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities (up to 98% yield, &gt;20:1 dr, 98% ee). The products can be easily converted into various biologically significant chiral molecules maintaining the same enantiopurity.

         <title>Unlocking the Power of Lewis Basicity in Oxide Lattice Oxygens: A Regulating Force for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Kinetics in Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lewis basicity of lattice oxygen is activated in our high entropy spinel oxide (LB&#8208;HEO). Through Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction, LB&#8208;HEO attracts acidic Li+, leading to more disorder and Li+ defects in the discharge product Li2O2 of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries. This promotes Li+ diffusion in Li2O2 and interfacial electron transfer, eventually improving the decomposition kinetics during charging. It provides a new perspective on the regulation of Li+ behavior to achieve better electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) require fast oxygen conversion kinetics to achieve good cycling performance and high energy efficiency. In the text of catalysts for LOBs, the Lewis basicity of lattice oxygens (OL) in common transition metal oxides is often underestimated due to the weak electron donor characteristic of OL. In this work, a new spinel&#8208;type high entropy oxide with Lewis basicity (LB&#8208;HEO) was synthesized through a Joule&#8208;heating method. OL was activated by regulating the tetrahedral site&#8208;OL&#8208;octahedral site (MTd&#8208;OL&#8208;MOh) units in the spinel&#8208;type HEO, enhancing the LB. Used as a cathode catalyst for LOBs, LB&#8208;HEO could attract Li+ and increase the disorder in discharge product, lithium peroxide (Li2O2), promoting the delithiation process and the interfacial charge transfer at the LB&#8208;HEO|Li2O2 interface. The activation energy of interfacial charge transfer was significantly reduced from 63.5 to 22.4 kJ mol&#8722;1. As a result, a low charging overpotential of 0.97 V and a long cycling lifespan of 135 cycles at 100 mA g&#8722;1 were achieved with a capacity limitation of 1000 mAh g&#8722;1. The strategy based on the regulation of Li+ behavior through its interaction with Lewis bases provides a promising prospect for the design of non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for high&#8208;performance LOBs.

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of Intermediate Adsorption and Active Hydrogen Supply Enable Pulsed Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Hydroxylamine Electroreduction with Nearly 100% Faradaic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical hydroxylamine (NH2OH) synthesis from NOx under ambient conditions presents a sustainable alternative to energy&#8208;intensive industrial methods, but its selectivity remains limited by unbalanced active hydrogen (H*) supply and intermediate adsorption. Herein, we develop boron&#8208;doped amorphous Bi metallene arrays for efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH electroreduction. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the amorphous structure and B&#8208;induced p&#8208;sp orbital hybridization modulate the electronic structure, optimizing intermediate adsorption while enhancing H* generation. These synergistic effects collectively reduce the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step, significantly improving catalytic activity and selectivity. The catalyst achieves an NH&#8322;OH Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 85.3% at &#8722;0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). By employing a pulsed potential strategy, the FE further increases to nearly 100%, surpassing most reported counterparts. This work not only proposes a novel catalyst design leveraging amorphous engineering and orbital hybridization but also demonstrates the efficacy of pulsed electrolysis in steering reaction pathways for electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Induced Atomic Diffusion in a Molecular Metal Cluster Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the formation and dynamic behavior of atomic vacancy in an organometallic palladium cluster complex. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR analysis and theoretical calculations of the Pd12 cluster [Pd12(C7H7)6][B(ArF)4]2 suggest that an atomic vacancy migrates rapidly at the surface of the metal cluster on the NMR timescale, leading to the vacancy&#8208;induced atomic diffusion in a molecule.








Abstract
The presence of atomic vacancies in a close&#8208;packed material is believed to allow the migration of atoms adjacent to the vacancies, which induces dynamics of atoms. However, it is not known whether atoms in discrete molecules can undergo vacancy&#8208;induced dynamics. We describe herein the generation of a close&#8208;packed Pd12 cluster complex [Pd12(C7H7)6][B(ArF)4]n (n&#160;=&#160;2, 3) with a Pd&#8208;atom vacancy, and the observation of the diffusion of Pd atoms. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR analysis, X&#8208;ray structure analysis, and theoretical calculations indicate that an atomic vacancy is located at the surface sites of the Pd12 core, and that it migrates rapidly on the NMR timescale. This means that all 11 palladium atoms at the surface undergo self&#8208;diffusion with a low energy barrier. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that atomic diffusion occurs within a molecule through the vacancy mechanism.

         <title>Remote and Spatiotemporal Modulation of Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly of Croconaine Dyes via NIR Laser Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we demonstrate a light&#8208;mediated strategy for fabricating supramolecular polymers and copolymers. By tuning laser power, irradiation time, and wavelength, supramolecular structures can be precisely controlled. The spatial precision of laser irradiation further enables localized supramolecular polymerization and sol&#8211;gel transitions. These findings establish a dynamic platform for regulating supramolecular nanomaterials with tailored structures and functions.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymerization holds great promise for the fabrication of well&#8208;defined nanostructures. However, achieving precise spatiotemporal control over the dynamic assembly of supramolecular polymers using external stimuli remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation strategy that exploits the intrinsic photothermal properties of croconaine&#8208;based molecular building blocks to modulate the aggregation&#8211;dissociation equilibrium of seeds, thereby enabling the formation of supramolecular polymers and copolymers. Light irradiation provides enhanced tunability through adjustments in laser power, irradiation time, and wavelength. Notably, the spatial precision afforded by laser irradiation allows for localized seed dissociation, offering a new approach for spatially controlled supramolecular polymerization. This method also enables efficient light&#8208;mediated gel formation, spatially selective sol&#8211;gel transitions, and healing in supramolecular organogels. These findings demonstrate a light&#8208;responsive strategy for regulating supramolecular polymerization and open new avenues for constructing nanomaterials with programmable structures and functions.

         <title>Reductive N2 Cleavage and Nitride Insertion Reactivity at Molybdenum Complexes Supported by a Rigid PNP Pincer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive N2 cleavage at an acridane PNP pincer&#8208;supported Mo center leads to the first crystallographically characterized example of an unusual Mo(IV) nitride species featuring a bridging N2 coordination stabilized via Mo&#8208;N2 d&#960;&#8208;p&#960; backbonding interactions. Nitride functionalization with CO leads to Mo(II) isocyanate species.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;nitride species represent key reactive intermediates in reductive N2 cleavage and functionalization. Toward a better understanding of nitride transfer reactivity, we present a series of Mo&#8208;nitride complexes supported by a rigid diphosphino&#8208;acridane pincer ligand. Notably, the stepwise reduction of a MoIVCl3 complex under N2 allows the isolation of a bridging diazenido intermediate as well as a dinuclear Mo&#8208;nitride species (4) accommodating a bridging N2 moiety. This is the first example of a Mo(IV) nitride&#8208;N2 species, and extensive 15N&#8208;labeling studies were performed to characterize the bridging dinitrogen, diazenido, and nitride moieties. The structure of 4 adopts two orthogonal &#960;&#8208;backbonding interactions between N2 and two structurally rigidified MoIV(N) fragments featuring a filled d&#960; orbital. Effective &#960;&#8208;backbonding from such a MoIV(N) fragment leads to the isolation of PMe3, CO, and CNtBu substituted analogues. Further, reactivity of the Mo&#8208;nitride species with &#960;&#8208;acidic CO and isocyanide leads to the formation of MoII&#8208;isocyanate and &#8208;carbodiimide species, respectively. Computational studies suggest that nitride carbonylation proceeds via an associative nitride insertion pathway, encouraging further studies in direct N2 fixation to value&#8208;added products via nitride functionalization.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Origin of Room Temperature Methanol Synthesis over hcp&#8208;PdMo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In their Research Article (e202505634), Feilong Xing, Hideo Hosono, Masaaki Kitano, and co&#8208;workers report that CO2 hydrogenation to methanol is facilitated at room temperature @#@on adjacently arranged Pd and Mo sites on the hcp&#8208;PdMo catalyst. Mo acts as the reaction site for the activation of CO2 into CO and O, while Pd serves as the H2 dissociation site. The ordered structure of the hcp&#8208;PdMo catalyst enhances the transfer of H atoms from Pd to Mo sites, facilitating the hydrogenation of CO intermediate on Mo to form CH3OH and simultaneously reducing the Mo sites even at room temperature.

         <title>Sulfur Mediated Interfacial Proton&#8208;Directed Transfer Boosts Electrocatalytic Nitric Oxide Reduction to Ammonia over Dual&#8208;Site Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;mediated electron redistribution and proton&#8208;directed transfer at the Cu&#8208;Co interface significantly boost electrocatalytic NO reduction to NH3 over the S&#8208;Cu@Co/C catalyst. The changes in the electronic structure of Cu and Co promote NO adsorption and water dissociation. Meanwhile, sulfur accelerates the transfer of protons generated at Co sites to Cu sites, thereby facilitating NO hydrogenation and suppressing HER.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis represents a sustainable strategy that simultaneously realizes the nitrogen cycle and resource integration. The key issue hindering the NORR efficiency is accelerating proton (*H) transfer to facilitate NO hydrogenation while inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we demonstrate an interface&#8208;engineered sulfur&#8208;mediated Cu@Co electrocatalyst (S&#8208;Cu@Co/C) that boosts NORR performance through dual modulation of electronic structure and proton transfer on active sites. A comprehensive program of experimental and theoretical calculations was employed to discover that sulfur incorporation induces electron redistribution in the Cu&#8211;Co interface, creating electron&#8208;rich sulfur and electron&#8208;deficient metals. This electronic configuration synergistically enhances NO adsorption on Cu sites and promotes water dissociation on Co sites. More critically, sulfur could direct the rapid transfer of *H from Co to Cu sites, thereby accelerating the NO hydrogenation and suppressing HER. Consequently, S&#8208;Cu@Co/C achieves an NH3 yield rate of 655.3 &#181;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell and a Faradaic efficiency of 92.4% in an H&#8208;cell. Remarkably, the catalyst could maintain continuous electrolysis tests and steady NH3 yield up to 100&#160;h. This work provides innovative insights into the fabrication of efficient electrocatalysts via heteroatom&#8208;mediated interfacial engineering strategies.

         <title>Topochemical Polymerization of Retro&#8208;Isomeric Peptides for Tuning the Polymer Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized two retro&#8208;isomeric peptide monomers containing hydrophobic amino acids for topochemical azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. Crystals of both the retro&#8208;isomers underwent TAAC polymerization to yield isomeric &#8220;difficult peptide&#8221; polymer mimics with differences in reactivity, regioselectivity, and properties. Our study shows that sequence reversal is a new way to obtain structurally and functionally diverse polymers via topochemical polymerization.








Abstract
Peptidomimetic polymers containing hydrophobic amino acids and nonpeptidic linkages are interesting for various applications, particularly hydrophobic coatings. We synthesized two retro&#8208;isomeric peptide monomers decorated with azide and alkyne, viz. N3&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;NHCH2CCH (M1) and its retro&#8208;isomer N3&#8208;L&#8208;Val&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;NHCH2CCH (M2), for topochemical azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) polymerization. On heating the crystals at 100&#160;&#176;C, both monomers underwent TAAC polymerization, yielding isomeric &#8220;difficult peptide&#8221; polymer mimics. The monomers showed stark differences in reactivity and regiochemistry of the product formed. Monomer M1 yielded polymer P1 having a 1:1 ratio of 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;linkages, and monomer M2 reacted regiospecifically, giving 1,4&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;linked polymer P2. We investigated the hydrophobicity of these isomeric polymers by measuring water contact angles (WCA) of surfaces coated with these polymers; P1 and P2 showed WCA of 120&#176; and 132&#176;, respectively. Our study demonstrates that sequence reversal is a novel approach for accessing structurally and functionally different polymers via topochemical polymerization.

         <title>Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Response and Self&#8208;Powered CPL Detection in Unique Triangular&#8211;Tetrahedral Chiral Copper(I) Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (R/S)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 halides exhibit a unique triangular&#8211;tetrahedral polyhedral configuration and enhanced nonlinear susceptibility. This kind of Cu(I)&#8208;based halide exhibits efficient second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), third&#8208;harmonic generation, and excellent circularly polarized light (CPL) detection performance. The (R/S)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 could be applied in self&#8208;powered CPL photodetection and X&#8208;ray detection with high sensitivity and radiation resistance.








Abstract
The low&#8208;coordination polyhedral architecture of Cu(I)&#8208;based chiral metal halides induces significant structural distortions, endowing these materials with remarkable circularly polarized light (CPL) activity and exceptional nonlinear optical (NLO) performance. However, achieving highly selective CPL detection with large dissymmetry factors (glum) in Cu(I)&#8208;based chiral metal halides remains a significant challenge. Herein, we prepared 1D chiral (R/S)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 (where MPZ is 2&#8208;methylpiperazine) halides with the unique triangular&#8211;tetrahedral configuration in the noncentrosymmetric cubic P1211 space group, resulting in substantial structural distortions, which significantly impact nonlinear susceptibility. Consequently, (R)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 halide exhibits efficient second harmonic generation (SHG), which is 7.29 times as high as that of KH2PO4. Additionally, (R)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 halide also exhibits remarkable third harmonic generation (THG) response, and gTHG&#8208;CD is as high as +0.309, which is the first demonstration of THG&#8208;based CPL detection in Cu(I)&#8208;based metal halides. The self&#8208;powered CPL photodetectors based on (R/S)&#8208;MPZCu2Cl4 show high CPL distinguishability at 0&#160;V and further achieve self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection with excellent low&#8208;dose detection and radiation resistance. Our study provides valuable insights into the structure&#8211;performance relationship in chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid Cu(I) halides, paving the way for next&#8208;generation multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

         <dc:description>
Multiple resonance (MR) emitters play a pivotal role in recent advances in optoelectronics. However, conventional synthetic approaches to MR frameworks have intrinsic limitations in site&#8208;selectivity. In their Research Article (e202509606), Takuji Hatakeyama et&#160;al. demonstrate that previously inaccessible positions in MR frameworks can now be unlocked through late&#8208;stage C&#9472;N bond cleavage. This breakthrough, symbolized by the opening treasure chest on the cover, opens new pathways for designing advanced MR materials with greater molecular diversity and flexibility.

Sande's formula suggests that anion migration has a more significant impact on the deposition behavior of Li+ compared to cation migration. In their Research Article (e202504398), Jun Jiang, Junwu Zhu, Yongsheng Fu et&#160;al. propose a bidirectional ion kinetic regulator. By controlling the bidirectional migration of anions (TFSI&#8208;) and cations (Li+), they successfully delayed the formation of lithium dendrites. This study provides a novel strategy for the development of high&#8208;safety and stable lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Local Electric Field Microenvironment&#8208;Induced Dynamic Spatial Confinement to Stabilize I+ Toward High&#8208;Mass&#8208;Loading and Stable Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A local electric field (LEF) microenvironment is induced by the abundant polyquaternary ammonium cations in polydimethylammonium iodide (PDDA&#8208;I), which effectively spatially confine nucleophilic species (Cl&#8722;) on the cathode.This design dynamically coordinates the dense ligand sites around I+, ensuring the stable conversion of I+ ion even under high iodine mass loading conditions.








Abstract
Four&#8208;electron iodine conversion chemistry (I&#8722;/I2/I+) endows zinc&#8211;iodine batteries with competitive energy density. The stability of I+ conversion relies on its interaction with sufficient nucleophilic species (e.g., Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;). However, under high iodine loading, nucleophilic species fail to afford sufficient coordination strength and number within thick iodine cathode to stabilize I+, thus compromising the high&#8208;voltage plateau and capacity. Here, we effectively spatially confine nucleophilic species (Cl&#8722;) on the cathode by &#9472;C&#9472;N+&#8208;induced localized electric field (LEF) microenvironment in polyquaternary ammonium iodide (PDDA&#8208;I). Spatial confinement maximizes Cl&#8722; concentration on the cathode ensuring highly reversible I0/I+ conversion, even in the low&#8208;concentrated ZnCl2 addition and high iodine loading. Importantly, the dynamically regulated Cl&#8722; maintains a balance with iodine species at the &#9472;C&#9472;N+ sites during cycling, effectively limiting the shuttling effect of polyiodides. Consequently, even adopting a high iodine loading of 16.03&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the PDDA&#8208;I still maintains a distinct four&#8208;electron&#8208;conversion dual voltage plateau with a remarkable capacity of 4.97 mAh cm&#8722;2. An impressive lifespan of 10&#160;000 cycles is achieved at 12.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 with a capacity decay of 0.0012% per cycle, exceeding conventional iodine cathodes by 20&#8208;fold. This work provides an important reference for high&#8208;performance four&#8208;electron conversion zinc&#8211;iodine batteries at high iodine loading.

         <title>Tandem&#8208;Activatable PROTAC Prodrug for Tumor Biomarker&#8208;Driven Near&#8208;Infrared Opto&#8208;Proteolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem&#8208;activatable PROTAC prodrug (TAP) is developed to stepwisely activate near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and proteolytic activity in the presence of tumor biomarker enzyme Cathepsin B (CatB) and NIR light. TAP represents the first tandem&#8208;activatable PROTAC approach under a collaborative control by endogenous and exogenous triggers, holding great promise for precise spatiotemporal on&#8208;tumor proteolysis in vivo.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;specific protein degradation is crucial for successful cancer treatment by proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC), which however still remains challenging. Here, we report a tandem&#8208;activatable PROTAC prodrug (TAP) strategy for precise on&#8208;tumor proteolysis in vivo. TAP is constructed by caging PROTAC with a tumor&#8208;homing cyclopeptide through a tandem&#8208;locking linker, which comprises a singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) cleavable moiety, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) and a Cathepsin B (CatB)&#8208;cleavable dipeptide substrate. The proteolytic activity of TAP is initially turned off but can be sequentially switched on by tumor biomarker enzyme CatB and NIR light. Such a tandem&#8208;lock design ensures that PROTAC exclusively degrade oncoprotein target in tumor. The results revealed that TAP carried out a tumor&#8208;selective degradation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) under the cooperative action by CatB and NIR light, which further synergized with photodynamic therapy (PDT) by the PS to suppress tumor growth. This work thus presents the first tandem&#8208;activatable approach for spatiotemporally controlled proteolysis to minimize the off&#8208;tumor toxicity of PROTAC.

         <title>Selective and Energy Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion through Anion Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed blended OH&#8722; and Cl&#8722; electrolyte to alter the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction microenvironment, achieving ethanol faradaic efficiency of 50% at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The blended anions cooperatively promoted ethanol production by increasing *CO coverage and modulating the reactivity of key branching intermediate *CHCOH.








Abstract
Ethanol, with its high market value and stable global demand, stands out as an attractive product of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. However, achieving high ethanol selectivity and energy efficiency at industrial current densities remains challenging. In this study, we employed a blended anion modulation strategy to enhance the selectivity and energy efficiency of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion. The Cu2(OH)3F pre&#8208;catalyst achieved Faradaic efficiencies of 50% and 93% for ethanol and C2+, respectively, at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a blended electrolyte consisting of 2&#160;M KOH and 1&#160;M KCl. Comprehensive electrochemical tests, combined with in situ characterizations and theoretical analysis, revealed that chloride and hydroxide increased *CO coverage for efficient C&#9472;C coupling. Moreover, hydroxide stabilizes the *CHCOH intermediate through hydrogen bonding with the adsorbed hydroxide on the catalyst surface, while Cl synergistically enhances its reactivity by promoting water dissociation toward the ethanol pathway.

         <title>Exceptional Second Harmonic Generation in Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Oxyfluoroniobate Crystals via Structural Fingerprint Optimization of Polar Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structural fingerprint optimization strategy is proposed for the 1[TMOF4]&#8734; chain&#8208;based compounds, aimed at modifying the geometric features of functional chains to maximize the optical nonlinearity. In the ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal (H3O)(Biu)2(NbOF4), the structural fingerprints of the functional chains satisfy the ideal criteria, resulting in a record&#8208;breaking second harmonic generation (SHG) response (10.8&#160;&#215;&#160;KH2PO4) among all known transition metal (TM) oxyfluorides. 








Abstract
Partial fluorination of oxides has positioned oxyfluorides as a promising class of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials owing to their balanced optical properties. However, effectively arranging optical chromophores to achieve strong optical nonlinearity remains challenging. In this study, we explore the structural chemistry of 1[NbOF4]&#8734; chain&#8208;based oxyfluoroniobates and establish a molecular geometric framework to quantify key structural fingerprint factors, namely, the &#8736;(O&#9472;Nb&#9472;O&#8242;) bond angle, &#967;[F,Nb,Nb&#8242;,F&#8242;] torsion angle, chain alignment, and distortion of [NbO2F4] nodes. Theoretical calculations confirm that these factors critically influence second harmonic generation (SHG) activity. By integrating &#960;&#8208;conjugated biuret (C2H5N3O2) molecules with optimally aligned 1[NbOF4]&#8734; chains, we synthesized (H3O)(Biu)2(NbOF4) (Biu&#160;=&#160;biuret), a crystal exhibiting a record&#8208;breaking SHG response, reaching 10.8 times that of KH2PO4, among transition metal (TM) oxyfluorides. Its moderate birefringence (&#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.062 @1064&#160;nm) and wide band gap (Eg&#160;=&#160;4.50&#160;eV) further support its potential as a high&#8208;performance ultraviolet (UV) NLO material. These results highlight the power of structural fingerprint optimization in fully activating polar chains and offer a new strategy for designing next&#8208;generation UV NLO crystals with enhanced SHG performance.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of solution&#8208;processed amorphous zero&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide hybrid (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films for direct X&#8208;ray detection is demonstrated. The amorphous films exhibit efficient molecular sensitization, with ZnBr42&#8722; species serving as X&#8208;ray absorbers and TPPCarz&#8314; moieties as charge transporters. The resulting detectors achieve a detection sensitivity of 2165&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 at 20&#160;V&#160;mm&#8722;1 and a detection limit of 6.01&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1. 








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) are emerging materials with significant potential for optoelectronic applications, including direct X&#8208;ray detectors. While 0D OMHH single crystals exhibit excellent X&#8208;ray detection properties, their scalability remains a significant challenge due to the time&#8208;intensive growth process and difficulty in producing large single crystals exceeding a few centimeters. This limitation hinders their practicality for large&#8208;area detector applications. Here, we report for the first time the development of amorphous 0D OMHH films via solution processing for efficient direct X&#8208;ray detection. By reacting a non&#8208;crystalline organic halide, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phosphonium bromide (TPPCarzBr), with zinc bromide (ZnBr2), we have successfully produced amorphous 0D (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films with controlled thickness via facile solution processing. The organic cations (TPPCarz&#8314;) feature a lower bandgap than the ZnBr42&#8722; anions, enabling efficient molecular sensitization, where ZnBr42&#8722; anions serve as X&#8208;ray absorbers and TPPCarz&#8314; cations as charge transporters. Direct X&#8208;ray detectors based on 0D (TPPCarz)2ZnBr4 films demonstrate outstanding performance, achieving a stable X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity of 2,165&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8315;1cm&#8315;2 at 20&#160;V&#160;mm&#8315;&#185; and a detection limit of 6.01&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8315;&#185;. The amorphous nature of these films enhances their processability, allowing for fabrication in various sizes and shapes, and making them highly adaptable for scalable detector applications.

         <title>Robust Imidazole&#8208;Linked 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Electrochemical Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring stable and functional linkages through  facile   one&#8208;pot   cyclocondensation reactions represents one of the frontiers in the development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which can enhance structural robustness and diversity while broadening their application potential. In this study, we report a facile synthetic strategy using p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) as a proton mediator to construct two imidazole&#8208;linked COFs (TABQ&#8208;COF and TAPT&#8208;COF) via one&#8208;pot cyclocondensation of aromatic aldehydes with ortho&#8208;diamines. These two COFs not only possess good crystallinity, but also exhibit excellent physico&#8208;chemical stability and contain abundant redox&#8208;active sites, which endows them with charming advantages for electrochemical energy storage. Remarkably, when employed as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), TAPT&#8208;COF delivered a reversible capacity of 517 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.05 A g&#8208;1while maintaining outstanding cycling stability with minimal capacity degradation (&lt;0.035% per cycle) over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8208;1. This superior performance stems from synergistic contributions of abundant redox&#8208;active centers (C=O and C=N groups), which enable efficient Na+ storage through multi&#8208;electron redox mechanisms. This study highlights the strategic advantage of structurally stable COFs with precisely engineered redox&#8208;active motifs via facile synthesis for advancing high&#8208;performance electrochemical energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Mass Transport and Charge Transfer in COF&#8208;Based Photocatalysts With Three&#8208;Dimensional Ordered Macropores for Benzylamine Oxidation and Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step self&#8208;sacrificing template strategy enables the synthesis of 3DOM&#8208;COFs with ordered macropores. Coupled with ZnCdS, the resulting S&#8208;scheme heterojunction efficiently catalyzes benzylamine oxidation and H&#8322; evolution. The 3DOM structure accelerates mass transfer and charge transfer, enhancing overall photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown promise as photocatalysts for chemical transformations. However, their dense micropores and poor pore connectivity hinder mass transport and charge separation/transfer, limiting their efficiency. Herein, we develop a one&#8208;step self&#8208;sacrificing template strategy to synthesize three&#8208;dimensional ordered macroporous COFs (3DOM&#8208;COFs). This approach uniquely integrates in situ Tp&#8211;Tta COF crystallization with synchronized degradation of polystyrene templates under solvothermal conditions. This method introduces unreported kinetic match between template decomposition and framework growth. Such a confined growth mechanism leads to structurally robust and highly ordered macroporosity without post&#8208;processing. 3DOM architecture enables uniform dispersion of fine ZnCdS nanoparticles for the generation a 3DOM&#8208;COF based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction, which exhibits remarkable performance in the oxidation of benzylamine (BA) for simultaneous N&#8208;benzylbenzaldimine production with 99% selectivity at a rate of 15.1&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and H2 generation with a rate of 17.8&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. The 3DOM architecture confers 50&#8208;fold faster mass transport than bulk COFs, while the heterojunction facilitates directional charge separation and interface charge transfer. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the heterojunction optimizes reaction thermodynamics by lowering the potential energy barriers of BA activation. The work pioneers a template&#8208;concurrent synthesis paradigm, resolving COFs' critical pore engineering challenges.

         <title>Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO in 100%: The Synergistic Effect of Nickel and Europium in Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of 3d&#8208;4f nanoclusters with analogous structures were synthesized, and the {Ni24Eu10} cluster demonstrates high stability and exceptional performance in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO, which can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between the Ni(II) and Eu(III) metal centers within its [Ni4Eu] assembly units.








Abstract
Heterometallic transition&#8208;rare earth metal (3d&#8208;4f) clusters with synergistic catalytic activity are rarely identified. Herein, two families of closely related 3d&#8208;Eu clusters were designed to analyze the role of Eu(III) ions during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO. The [M24Eu8] family, where M&#160;=&#160;Co or Ni, shows much lower activity (CO production &lt; 2078&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) compared to the [M24Eu10] family (CO production &gt; 5838&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This is due to the two additional Eu(III) ions in the apical position of the latter which are very active for converting CO2 into CO. Moreover, we found the nickel analogues are better than the cobalt ones, especially for [Ni24Eu10] which exhibits 100% CO selectivity and very high efficacy of 6545.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, while the [Co24Eu10] only shows 55% CO selectivity. Therefore, the coexistence of both apical Eu(III) and Ni(II) ions has been experimentally revealed to be critical for this exceptional catalytic performance of the [Ni24Eu10] cluster. As such, this work unambiguously reveals a synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts and may open a new avenue for more sophisticated reaction design by using the heterometallic coordination clusters.

The [M&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;Eu&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;] family, where M&#160;=&#160;Co or Ni, shows much lower activity (CO production &amp;lt; 2078&#160;&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to the [M&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;Eu&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;] family (CO production &amp;gt; 5838&#160;&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This is due to the two additional Eu(III) ions in the apical position of the latter which are very active for converting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into CO. Moreover, we found the nickel analogues are better than the cobalt ones, especially for [Ni&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;Eu&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;] which exhibits 100% CO selectivity and very high efficacy of 6545.3&#160;&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, while the [Co&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;Eu&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;] only shows 55% CO selectivity. Therefore, the coexistence of both apical Eu(III) and Ni(II) ions has been experimentally revealed to be critical for this exceptional catalytic performance of the [Ni&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;Eu&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;] cluster. As such, this work unambiguously reveals a synergistic effect of bimetallic catalysts and may open a new avenue for more sophisticated reaction design by using the heterometallic coordination clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Framework Nucleic Acid&#8208;Mediated DNAzyme Chaperoning for Sensitive Trace Metal Ion Mapping on Live Neuronal Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the beneficial effects of molecular chaperones on the stability and functionality of proteins, we present in this study the development of tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDF) as chaperones for DNAzymes. Integration of TDF with DNAzymes significantly improves sensitivity and stability, facilitating precise and quantitative mapping of local trace metal ion concentrations on live neuronal cell membranes. This adaptable approach sets a foundation for developing sensitive nanodevices based on DNAzymes.








Abstract
The transient release of metal ions at neuronal cell membranes holds significant implications in neurophysiology and pathology. Consequently, there is a pressing need for sensitive methodologies capable of quantitatively mapping local metal ion concentrations in live cells, aiming to unravel potential mechanisms underlying neurological disorders. DNAzymes have emerged as versatile tools for metal ion detection in live cells, owing to their specificity and other inherent advantages. Efforts to broaden their utility have focused on enhancing the stability and sensitivity of DNAzymes. Inspired by the beneficial effects of molecular chaperones on the stability and functionality of proteins, we present in this study the development of tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDF) as chaperones for DNAzymes, aiming at enhancing the stability and activity of DNAzymes. Integration of TDF with DNAzymes is shown to significantly enhance metal ion detection performance, resulting in elevated stability and a two&#8208;fold increase in sensitivity, attributed to alterations in the local net charge induced by TDF. In vitro investigations demonstrate that the nanodevice developed here faithfully maps Cu2+ concentrations within a range of 0&#8211;10&#160;&#181;M on the membrane of neuronal cells, meeting the requirements for Cu2+ sensing under both physiological and pathological conditions. This work presents an easily adaptable approach to enhance the performance of DNAzymes and lays the foundations for the development of other DNAzyme&#8208;based sensitive detection nanodevices.

         <title>Janus Superiority of Membranes in Chemical Engineering and Beyond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the Janus superiority of membrane materials in chemical engineering processes, with a focus on their design and fabrication principles, transport mechanisms, and diverse applications. It highlights their roles in chemical engineering and their multiscale impacts and concludes by discussing current challenges and future research directions. 








Abstract
Janus configurations, characterized by their inherent asymmetry, enable directional mass transfer in membrane materials that drive novel and energy&#8208;efficient chemical processes. This Janus superiority spans applications from nanoscale molecular and ionic transport to macro&#8208;scale separation systems with asymmetric spatial architectures. This review provides an analysis of the material foundations including design principles, structure regulation, and scalability challenges underlying Janus membranes. We explore the physics that governs their unique behavior and examine their diverse applications across chemical engineering, including phase transfer, and molecular or ionic transport. Through a multiscale perspective, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of Janus superiority in advancing chemical engineering technologies. Finally, we discuss the hurdles in translating theoretical advances into practical applications and propose promising avenues for future research to harness the full potential of Janus membranes and systems in addressing global challenges related to energy, sustainability, and beyond.

         <title>Revealing the Correlation of Loading&#8208;to&#8208;Performance of Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Two types of Ru configurations of single atoms anchored on graphene&#8208;like framework supporting WC1&#8208;x substrates with was constructed by simple Joule heating rapid carbonization for high&#8208;efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The spatial distance between Ru&#8208;anchored active sites governed by Ru content plays a crucial role in modulating the electronic structure at the reactive center. This tailored electronic feature reduces the reaction energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determine step, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance of HER.









Abstract
The correlation between metal loading and overall catalytic performance remains elusive for single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts (SACs), which hinders the oriented optimization of active site densities and scalable synthesis of them. To effectively address this issue, Ru single atoms with different loading are anchored on the graphene&#8208;like framework and tungsten carbide substrate (WC1&#8208;x) to investigate the synergistic effect among different local configurations. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the loading of Ru atoms critically governs the interatomic distance between adjacent metal active sites at second shell coordination. In situ Raman spectroscopy shows that WC1&#8208;x nanoparticles can break the hydrogen bond network by reorienting H2O molecule adsorption and promoting the availability of active H2O among electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the moderate distance between active sites could further lower the reaction barrier and enhance the catalytic activity. Consequently, the optimal sample Ru&#8208;WC1&#8208;x with 0.76&#160;wt% Ru loading exhibits a low overpotential of 7&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2 and the anion exchange membrane electrolyzer to stably operate for 100&#160;h at 1&#160;A&#8901;cm&#8722;2. Such correlation of spatial effects between different active sites were universally demonstrated in similar systems anchored with either Pt, Ir, or Co elements.

         <title>Acetone Derivatives for Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Methylation, Trideuteromethylation, and 13C&#8208;Methylation of (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthetic method enables methylation, trideuteromethylation, and 13C&#8208;methylation of (hetero)aryl halides using cost&#8208;effective methylation reagent (TDTP, TDTPCD3, and TDTP&#8208;13CH3) derived from acetone and isotopic analogs. This homogeneous catalysis protocol bypasses traditional organometallic reagents, operates via methyl radical generation and cross&#8208;coupling, and tolerates diverse functional groups and complex substrates.








Abstract
The development of low&#8208;cost, readily available, and broadly applicable reagents for the methylation, trideuteromethylation, and 13C&#8208;methylation of aryl chlorides is crucial. Using acetone and its isotopic derivatives as feedstocks, we have prepared the methylating, trideuteromethylating, and 13C&#8208;methylating agents TDTP (2&#8208;(1,5,5&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridine), TDTP&#8208;CD3, and TDTP&#8208;&#185;3CH3. Under nickel catalysis and without any additional redox reagent, these reagents efficiently methylate a wide range of (hetero)aryl chlorides, chlorine&#8208;containing complex molecules and phenolic derivatives, showing efficient functional&#8208;group tolerance and scalability; they, therefore, hold great promise for drug discovery and complex molecule synthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction begins with nickel&#8208;catalyzed generation of a methyl radical, followed by radical cross&#8208;coupling.

Noncovalent interactions in Ni(bpy)3Br2 aggregates induce spontaneous symmetry breaking, elevating the Ni d&#8208;band center. This electronic modulation lowers the energy barriers for CO2 activation and *COOH formation, significantly enhancing CO2 photoreduction kinetics with high CO selectivity. 








Abstract
Efficient CO2 activation remains a pivotal challenge in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, necessitating precise electronic modulation of catalytic centers to overcome kinetic limitations. In this work, we engineer Ni(bpy)3Br2 cocatalyst aggregates via noncovalent self&#8208;assembly and systematically unravel the role of aggregation in governing photocatalytic performance. A synergistic combination of experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrates that symmetry disruption within the aggregates induces localized charge redistribution. Such a charge redistribution triggers a 0.6&#160;eV upshift in the Ni d&#8208;band center, which delivers lower Gibbs free energies for the formation of *CO2 and *COOH. The optimized aggregates achieve a record&#8208;high quantum yield of 26.84% at 450&#160;nm with 99.3% CO selectivity, representing the highest performance reported to date for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion systems. Importantly, the d&#8208;band center of the Ni sites can be precisely modulated by varying the aggregation degree of Ni(bpy)3Br2. This work not only advances a novel d&#8208;band center modulation strategy for electronic configuration engineering but also provides in&#8208;depth atomic&#8208;level insights into the aggregation&#8208;induced symmetry&#8208;regulated d&#8208;band center.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis and Characterization of Tetraazanonacene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraazanonacene featuring four isolated pyridine&#8208;like rings was synthesized on Au(111) via STM tip manipulation. Its properties were characterized using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, density functional theory, and multireference calculations. The study highlights how the distribution of nitrogen atoms influences the electronic structure and aromaticity of azaacenes.








Abstract
Isosteric replacement of CH units of acenes by nitrogen induces significant changes in their electronic, redox, and spectroscopic properties. Here, we describe the on&#8208;surface synthesis of a nonacene analogue substituted with four nitrogen atoms on a Au(111) surface by a two&#8208;step atom manipulation, employing a bis vinylene&#8208;bridged precursor synthesized in solution. The generated tetraazanonacene has been investigated by scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM), combined with first&#8208;principles calculations. We found that, compared to the pristine nonacene, the electronegative nitrogen atoms lower the frontier orbitals, resulting in an increased STS transport gap of 1.49&#160;eV. Furthermore, the formation of four pyridine&#8208;like rings induces a stronger modulation of the aromaticity in tetraazanonacene compared to substitution patterns where nitrogen atoms form pyrazine&#8208;like rings. This observation is different from the nucleus independent chemical shift investigation of previous reported tetraazaundecacene, for which a stronger open&#8208;shell character is expected. Our work provides access to the synthesis of extended azaacenes and to an understanding of their properties.

         <title>Embracing Complexity: Peptides as Tuneable Scaffolds in the Construction of Discrete Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular chemistry has advanced rapidly, with scientists using fundamental understanding to generate function from simple building blocks. However, synthetic systems are still in their infancy when compared to biology. The increasing use of peptides in supramolecular structures provides a clear roadmap to more complex function; introducing chiral, information&#8208;rich, building blocks from a readily available pool. Peptides have historically been incorporated as modular additions to discrete supramolecular architectures, to interface with biological systems. More recently, supramolecular chemists have embraced the complexity of secondary and tertiary structures, and peptides&#8217; intrinsic propensity for folding, to enable the formation of supramolecular architectures built from peptides, leveraging their innate properties. We explore the urgent need to embrace complex, chiral, folded building blocks in discrete supramolecular architectures, and illustrate how this will provide opportunities for novel functions and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Collision&#8208;Induced Fragmentation of Oligosaccharides: Mechanistic Insights for Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Based Glycomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural alterations in oligosaccharide structure are often associated with disease, positioning clinical glycomics an emerging tool for diagnostics. This is most commonly achieved using a controlled collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) of larger oligosaccharides into fragments and measuring their mass in a mass spectrometer. Due to the complexity of oligosaccharides, and particularly their unusual fragmentation mechanisms, the underlying processes are poorly understood. Deciphering glycan fragmentation and making it understandable is highly desirable and would transform the field of glycomics from an expert technique into a widely applicable tool available to non&#8208;specialists. Here, we review the current knowledge of glycan fragmentation mechanisms in CID, with particular emphasis on hexose migrations and the anomeric memory. We discuss challenges and perspectives for future investigations, opening the window to widespread use of glycomics in clinical applications based on a fundamental understanding of glycan fragmentation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Main goals of contemporary research in chemistry are to create new materials with unique properties and to understand the chemical bonding in them, especially between metal atoms in larger structures. The isolation of a single lanthanide atom in a In/Bi cage offers a non&#8208;standard bonding situation, which deserves thorough exploration. In this study, the bonding behavior of La, In, and Bi atoms in the ternary cluster [(La@In2Bi11)2Bi2]6&#8722; and the complex [La(C5Me4H)3] used for its synthesis are characterized and compared by applying high energy resolution X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and computations. A clearly detectable covalent La(5d)&#8211;Bi(6p) interaction, induced in a highly electron&#8208;rich environment, is illustrated. The electronic structure of the La atom can be described as having the character of an ion being trapped and bonded in a heterometallic Bi/In cage. The advanced X&#8208;ray spectroscopic experimental tools applied here enable comparative studies of binding properties, focusing on different metals within the intermetalloid cluster. These tools can be employed iteratively to support the development of synthetic strategies that aim at tuning bond characteristics at the boundary of covalent and metallic bonding, thereby advancing the chemical and physical properties of novel multinary cluster compounds. The results were corroborated by GW and Bethe&#8208;Salpeter&#8208;equation (GW&#8208;BSE) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Structure&#8208;Selective On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Isokekulene versus Kekulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of different facets of metal nanoparticles in steering reaction pathways is crucial for the design of heterogeneous catalysts with superior selectivity. As a prominent class of reactions, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;hydrogen (C&#8208;H) bond activation is widely used for the synthesis of base chemicals, modern organic materials, and pharmaceuticals. Here, we report orthogonal selectivity in intramolecular cyclodehydrogenation of a nonplanar cyclic precursor steered by different facets of a copper single crystal. On the Cu(110) surface, the previously unknown cycloarene isokekulene forms with a high selectivity of 92 %, whereas reaction on the Cu(111) surface exclusively yields kekulene (&gt; 99 %). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy with CO&#8208;functionalized tips and density functional theory, we identify two adsorption geometries of the precursor which react to the respective products. Isokekulene adopts two nonplanar adsorption configurations and exhibits strong molecule&#8208;substrate interactions, explaining its preferential formation on Cu(110). This combined in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface synthesis approach represents an alternative route for the highly&#8208;selective synthesis of molecules that are challenging to synthesize and process via conventional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;scale Mott&#8208;Schottky Analogy in SnCu Nanoalloy Promote High&#8208;Efficiency Urea Electrosynthesis at Ultralow Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic urea synthesis from CO2 and NO3&#8208; offers a sustainable strategy to address environmental challenges and growing urea demand. However, current systems suffer inefficient C&#8208;N coupling due to poor selectivity toward critical C/N&#8208;intermediates. Herein, we engineered atomic&#8208;scale Mott&#8208;Schottky analogy in SnCu nanoalloy to create electron&#8208;enriched Cu sites, enabling remarkable urea production through quadruple synergy. Sn2Cu delivered exceptional urea yield (28.9 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat.&#8208;1) with 46.7% Faradaic efficiency (FE) in H&#8208;cell, while demonstrating practical potential with superior catalytic performance (yield: 72.6 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat.&#8208;1, FE: 41.3%, stability: 60 hours) at &#8208;0.52 V in flow cell. In&#8208;situ synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed electron&#8208;enriched Cu active sites enhanced CO2/NO3&#8208; co&#8208;adsorption and *CO coverage, while steering reaction pathway toward *CO&#8208;*NHO coupling and suppressing hydrogen evolution, thereby reducing rate&#8208;determining step energy barrier and prioritizing C&#8208;N coupling. This work develops a structure&#8208;adsorption&#8208;reactivity framework, providing fundamental guidance for advanced urea electrocatalyst design.</dc:description>

However, current systems suffer inefficient C-N coupling due to poor selectivity toward critical C/N-intermediates. Herein, we engineered atomic-scale Mott-Schottky analogy in SnCu nanoalloy to create electron-enriched Cu sites, enabling remarkable urea production through quadruple synergy. Sn2Cu delivered exceptional urea yield (28.9 mmol h-1 gcat.-1) with 46.7% Faradaic efficiency (FE) in H-cell, while demonstrating practical potential with superior catalytic performance (yield: 72.6 mmol h-1 gcat.-1, FE: 41.3%, stability: 60 hours) at -0.52 V in flow cell. In-situ synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed electron-enriched Cu active sites enhanced CO2/NO3- co-adsorption and *CO coverage, while steering reaction pathway toward *CO-*NHO coupling and suppressing hydrogen evolution, thereby reducing rate-determining step energy barrier and prioritizing C-N coupling.

         <title>Tertiary Phosphine Diversification via Photochemical P&#8722;C Chemoselective Cleavage of Phosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Differentially substituted phosphines are indispensable in medicines, materials, and catalysis, yet their customizable synthesis, traditionally depending on unstable P&#8211;H/halogen reagents, remains formidably challenging. Here, we report a photoredox strategy enabling controllable aryl substitution through chemoselective P&#8211;C cleavage. By engineering electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes between phosphonium salts and tertiary amines, this metal&#8208;free protocol realizes three consecutive hydrocarbyl exchanges for delivering tri&#8208;diverse&#8208;aryl phosphines with transition metal contamination elimination and broad functional group tolerance including unprotected amines and hydroxyls, facilitating late&#8208;stage modification of drugs/commercial ligands and construction of P,O,S&#8208;tridentate architectures and chiral P&#8208;stereogenic centers. Mechanistic studies reveal the dynamic pentacoordinated&#8208;phosphorane&#8208;complex formation nature and the radical&#8208;intermediate pathway, while the chemoselectivity originates from different strengths of P&#8211;C bonds. This work establishes a modular and sustainable platform for programming&#8208;level precision phosphine engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen Adsorption Sites with Low Polarizability for&#160;Benchmark N2/CH4&#160;Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective adsorption of N2 from CH4 is an industrially promising but challenging process given their similar sizes and physicochemical properties. Herein, we report a robust metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu&#8208;MFU&#8208;4l) featuring open Cu(I) sites of low polarizability for benchmark N2/CH4 separation. The presence of open Cu(I) sites in the framework was confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ CO&#8208;adsorbed infrared spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Gas sorption isotherms revealed that Cu&#8208;MFU&#8208;4l exhibited a significant difference between N2 and CH4 uptakes, resulting in a high N2/CH4 uptake ratio (1.94) and kinetic selectivity (2.20), of which the N2/CH4 uptake ratio was the highest among all MOFs reported to date. Breakthrough experiments confirmed Cu&#8208;MFU&#8208;4l as the best porous adsorbent hitherto reported for binary N2/CH4 separation, based on the record&#8208;high breakthrough selectivity (2.43) and CH4 productivity (0.47 mmol g&#8722;1). High&#8208;purity CH4 (99.99%) could also be obtained from ternary and even six&#8208;component CH4 mixtures by a one&#8208;step separation process. In situ infrared spectroscopy and computational modelling studies revealed that the open Cu(I) sites could better distinguish N2 and CH4.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Ag atoms induce Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on WO3 for ultrastable acid ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on one&#8208;dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeds ~90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.6 ~ &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE of approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield reaching 5.24 &#177; 0.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. The catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ~94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly, we succeeded in obtaining a NH3 production rate of 104.08 mmol h&#8208;1 at &#8722;3.5 V, and maintained the stability toward NO3RR for over 30 h with FE &gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate&#160;that the formation of Ag&#8208;N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities.</dc:description>

         <title>High H2 Recovery Properties of Carbon Molecular Sieve Membranes with Sub&#8208;nanometer Precision Derived from Dual Cross&#8208;linked Polyimide Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy&#8208;efficient purification technologies are essential&#160;for advancing a sustainable hydrogen economy. Carbon&#160;molecular sieve membranes (CMSMs) have emerged as promising candidates; however, achieving&#160;precise sub&#8208;Angstrom micropore control and ensuring structural stability remain significant challenges. Here, we introduce&#160;a dual&#160;cross&#8208;linked&#160;strategy to engineer&#160;microporosity of the resulting&#160;CMSMs&#160;by&#160;utilizing&#160;decarbonylated 3,5&#8208;diaminobenzoic acid&#8208;induced rigid network (Type A) in conjunction with sulfur bond&#8208;induced flexible network&#160;(Type B). The 6F&#8208;D&#8208;S&#8208;CMS membrane exhibits a&#160;record&#8208;high H2&#160;permeability of 3,464 Barrer with&#160;H2/CH4&#160;selectivity of 3,807, surpassing&#160;the Robeson upper bound. Upon pyrolysis at 850&#176;C,&#160;the 6F&#8208;D&#8208;S&#8208;CMS&#8208;850 membrane achieves exceptional selectivity values:&#160;H2/CH4&#160;at 6,538,&#160;H2/N2&#160;at 1,634&#160;and H2/CO2&#160;at 149&#8212;outperforming&#160;most&#160;reported CMS&#160;membranes.&#160;Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the Type B&#160;network suppressed CH4&#160;adsorption (3.6 vs. 6.2 cm3/g) and significantly enhanced the small pore volume ratio (VH2/VCH4: 10.3 vs. 2.1) during carbonization, thereby eliminating non&#8208;selective pathways and reducing inter&#8208;skeletal spacing (4.09 &#197; vs. 3.78 &#197;), which enables precise molecular sieving.

         <title>Structural Basis for a Scaffolding Role of the COM Domain in Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multi&#8208;domain enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of therapeutically relevant natural products. Efficient peptide synthesis relies on intricate domain interactions, whose underlying principles remain poorly understood. The communication&#8208;mediating (COM) domains facilitate interactions between separate NRPS subunits. For unknown reasons, COM domains co&#8208;occur with epimerization (E) domains, are partially embedded within the adjacent condensation (C) domains and can also be found as internal cis&#8208;COM domains. These features set COM domains apart from other docking domains. We present the first crystal structure of a cis&#8208;COM domain within an E&#8208;COM&#8208;C domain arrangement from modules 4 and 5 of bacitracin synthetase 3 (BacC). The structure reveals a compactly folded COM domain sandwiched between E and C domains, suggesting a role of the COM domain in orienting these domains for efficient peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) shuttling. Through mutational analyses, dipeptide formation assays, and proximity&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;crosslinking experiments, we investigated both cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;COM domains and provide evidence supporting a principal role of COM domains as scaffolds of NRPS architecture. Their function as docking domains may be a secondary consequence of their division into separate donor and acceptor parts.</dc:description>

For unknown reasons, COM domains co-occur with epimerization (E) domains, are partially embedded within the adjacent condensation (C) domains and can also be found as internal cis-COM domains. These features set COM domains apart from other docking domains. We present the first crystal structure of a cis-COM domain within an E-COM-C domain arrangement from modules 4 and 5 of bacitracin synthetase 3 (BacC). The structure reveals a compactly folded COM domain sandwiched between E and C domains, suggesting a role of the COM domain in orienting these domains for efficient peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) shuttling. Through mutational analyses, dipeptide formation assays, and proximity-dependent photo-crosslinking experiments, we investigated both cis- and trans-COM domains and provide evidence supporting a principal role of COM domains as scaffolds of NRPS architecture. Their function as docking domains may be a secondary consequence of their division into separate donor and acceptor parts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioelectrosynthesis of Signaling Molecules for Selective Modulation of Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioelectrosynthesis holds great potential for studying and regulating biological systems through the in situ synthesis and delivery of cell signaling molecules with high spatiotemporal precision. Despite recent advancements, precise control over multiple signaling molecules within a single platform remains challenging. Here, we introduce a bioelectrosynthesis approach capable of selectively producing two types of signaling molecules from a single precursor. This system leverages multi&#8208;metal sulfide electrocatalysts inspired by denitrifying enzymes, which generate signaling molecules, nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3), from nitrite ions. By controlling catalytic active sites, NO or NH3 can be selectively produced under mild electric fields in physiologically relevant conditions. In situ product analyses and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that NO intermediate binding affinity determines product selectivity. These electrocatalysts integrate seamlessly with biological systems, allowing precise, on&#8208;demand modulation of NO&#8208; or NH3&#8208;mediated signaling pathways in human cell lines. By combining electrochemical precision with selective cell control, this strategy may advance the study and regulation of biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Activation of CO and Pyridine by an Aluminum(I) Complex Ligated with a Silylene&#8208;Borane Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cooperative main&#8208;group systems based on alumylenes are highly attractive due to their potential for activating and transforming inert chemical bonds and small molecules. However, their development has been hindered by the scarcity of suitable supporting ligands. Herein, we report the synthesis of an amphiphilic carboranyl silylene&#8208;borane ligand (1) and demonstrate its effectiveness in stabilizing an aluminum(I) complex 2. Complex 2 has been unambiguously characterized by spectroscopic analysis, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and DFT calculations, which reveals a unique structure featuring both silicon(II)&#8594;aluminum(I) and aluminum(I)&#8594;boron(III) donor&#8211;acceptor bonds. Notably, the synergistic interplay between the silylene&#8208;borane ligand and the aluminum(I) center in 2 drives its unusual reactivity toward CO and pyridine activation, facilitating cleavage of the C&#8801;O bond and dearomatization of pyridine.</dc:description>

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nano Ir&#8208;Based Alloy Clusters&#160;by Hierarchical Confinement Effect for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of sub&#8208;nanoscale noble metal catalysts is pivotal for&#160;enhancing electrocatalytic performance, yet achieving precise control over particle size at this scale remains a critical challenge.&#160;In this work, we propose a hierarchical confinement strategy&#160;which combines spatial confinement at nanoscale and anchoring confinement at atomic scale, to overcome the size limitations imposed by high&#8208;temperature sintering.&#160;Using this strategy, a series of uniformly sized (~1 nm) Ir&#8208;based alloy clusters,&#160;including IrMn, IrFe, IrCo, and IrNi, are successfully fabricated. The synthesized sub&#8208;nanoscale&#160;IrCo alloy clusters&#160;(denoted as sub&#8208;IrCo cluster)&#160;demonstrate exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, with an ultralow overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA/cm&#178; and a remarkable mass activity 87.5&#160;times greater than that of commercial IrO2. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the incorporation of N enhances the interaction between&#160;Ir atoms and the support,&#160;which inhibits particle agglomeration. This&#160;work provides an&#160;effective strategy for&#160;preventing&#160;particle sintering via a hierarchical confinement effect and achieves&#160;precise size control&#160;at sub&#8208;nanoscale,&#160;opening&#160;a new avenue for the development&#160;of efficient noble metal catalysts with high atomic utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Genetically Encoded Homocysteine Precursor to Probe Protein Active Sites and to Addict Escherichia coli to a Noncanonical Amino Acid Directly Involved in Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) incorporated into proteins by stop codon suppression are powerful tools to probe and expand protein structure and function. Although homocysteine (Hcy) is a ubiquitous, naturally occurring amino acid, it was excluded from the universal genetic code. Hcy is very interesting, yet mostly unexplored, for probing protein active sites, because of its subtle structural and electronic differences to cysteine and serine, which are widespread catalytic residues in enzymes. We report the genetic encoding of a new protected Hcy precursor, HcyX, that can be conveniently deprotected by chemical reductants or bioorthogonal reagents. We find varying and sometimes remarkable levels of activity for different purified enzymes with Hcy at catalytic positions. By exploiting partial intracellular deprotection to Hcy, we show that two proteins rendered Hcy&#8208;dependent, an intein and thymidylate synthase, can rescue growth of E. coli by catalyzing a reaction essential for cell survival. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples in which cell growth is linked to a genetically incorporated ncAA directly involved in catalysis. We further demonstrate that Hcy&#8208;based disulfide bonds are chemically more stable than cysteine disulfides. Together, these findings open new paths for the experimental evolution of the genetic code.</dc:description>

         <title>Bipyridine&#8211;Thiosumanene Isomeric Lewis Bases for Synergistic Defect Passivation and Hole Extraction Enables over 26% Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interface defects between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) seriously limit the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed two isomers, 4BT and 5BT, based on 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;thiosumanene&#8208;functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as novel Lewis bases with dual capabilities for deep&#8208;level defects (Pb2+, VI) passivation and promoting hole extraction. By shifting the pyridine bridging unit from the tetra to the penta positions, these molecules undergo a configurational transformation from an orthogonal (4BT) to a planar structure (5BT). The configuration&#8208;functionality relationship was comprehensively investigated through theorical and experimental analyses. The planar configuration of 5BT&#160;enables more Lewis base sites to interact with perovskite, exhibiting more pronounced deep&#8208;level defect passivation effect, while improving hole extraction capability. Consequently, the 5BT&#8208;modified n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs achieved a champion PCE of 26.15% (certified at 26.12%) and superior operational stability by retaining 94.0% of the initial PCE according to ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol. This work offers a unique molecular designing mechanism to address the interfacial&#8208;related issues for high&#8208;performance PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Overlooked Dual Phosphorescence of Lappert&#8217;s Diamino Stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first stable heavy carbene homologues, the heavy tetrylenes, were reported in 1973 by Lappert and co&#8208;workers. These tetrylenes were extensively investigated with respect to ground state reactivity such as small molecule activation, insertion into &#963;&#8208;bonds, coordination chemistry, materials chemistry or catalysis. Their photophysical properties remained essentially unexplored. We report that Lappert&#8217;s bright yellow coloured diamino stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 shows thermally activated dual orange/green phosphorescence with microsecond lifetime in fluid solution at room temperature, which has been overlooked for more than 50 years. These unique electronic and photophysical properties are studied in detail by temperature&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved emission and absorption spectroscopy and are corroborated by (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory calculations. The mechanism of photochemical radical formation has been disclosed involving unprecedented stannylene excimers with second&#8208;order Jahn&#8208;Teller distorted structures. The present study provides new insights towards a rational design of tetrel(II) complexes with long&#8208;lived emissive excited states with Lappert&#8217;s diamino stannylene being the prototype.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Co&#8208;Assembled Liquid Crystal Polymer Network Enabled by In&#8208;Situ Photopolymerization for High&#8208;Performance CP&#8208;OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) show great promise for next&#8208;generation display technologies. However, achieving high dissymmetry factors (|gEL|) in circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) remains a significant challenge. In this study, we construct a novel chiral co&#8208;assembled cholesteric liquid crystal polymer network (ChLC&#8208;PN) as an emitting layer (EML) to enhance CP&#8208;EL performance via a facile in&#8208;situ photopolymerization strategy. The ChLC&#8208;PN was fabricated by UV&#8208;induced polymerization (365 nm, 200 mW/cm&#178;, 2 min, N&#8322; atmosphere) of a chiral co&#8208;assembly system comprising liquid crystal monomer (LCM) and chiral inducers (R/S&#8208;Cz). Notably, the resulting (R/S&#8208;Cz)0.01&#8208;(LCP)0.99 based devices demonstrate sky&#8208;blue CP&#8208;EL with a maximum |gEL| value of 0.012. This work presents the first report of high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;OLEDs utilizing a chiral co&#8208;assembled cholesteric liquid crystal rigid polymer network, offering a promising platform for simple, stable, and scalable fabrication of future CP&#8208;OLED devices.</dc:description>

However, achieving high dissymmetry factors (|gEL|) in circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP-EL) remains a significant challenge. In this study, we construct a novel chiral co-assembled cholesteric liquid crystal polymer network (ChLC-PN) as an emitting layer (EML) to enhance CP-EL performance via a facile in-situ photopolymerization strategy. The ChLC-PN was fabricated by UV-induced polymerization (365 nm, 200 mW/cm&#178;, 2 min, N&#8322; atmosphere) of a chiral co-assembly system comprising liquid crystal monomer (LCM) and chiral inducers (R/S-Cz). Notably, the resulting (R/S-Cz)0.01-(LCP)0.99 based devices demonstrate sky-blue CP-EL with a maximum |gEL| value of 0.012.

         <title>Visual &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;to&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Turn Transition in Luminescent Polymeric Vesicles for Color&#8208;Reporting Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The secondary structures of polymers significantly influence their properties; however, understanding and modulating polymer conformations remain substantial challenges. Particularly, the &#946;&#8208;turn conformation, which is prevalent in proteins, has not been reported in synthetic polymers due to its unclear formation mechanism and extremely poor stability. Additionally, there is a lack of visualization techniques to track conformational and functional transitions in polymers. Here, we designed and synthesized a novel tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;decorated poly(L&#8208;cysteine) derivative. Utilizing thioether oxidation as the driving force and strong aromatic&#8208;aromatic interactions between TPE molecules as stabilizing mechanism, we reported for the first time a conformational transition from &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#946;&#8208;turn in polymers. This transition not only significantly enhances fluorescence intensity but also induces chirality and circularly polarized light (CPL) of TPE, providing a new dual&#8208;modal approach to real&#8208;time monitoring of conformational changes of polymer chains. Furthermore, the conformational transition can trigger specific drug release, with the release process visualized and quantitatively analyzed through fluorescent colors. Such conformation&#8208;mediated structural and functional transformations hold significant potential for specific drug delivery and theragnosis of diseases such as cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Conduction Band Convergence and Modular Nanostructures: Driving High Thermoelectric Performance in n&#8208;type PbSe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>n&#8208;type lead chalcogenides showing high thermoelectric performance are rare due to the larger energy offset between the two lowest energy conduction bands minima, leaving ample opportunity to modulate electronic structure for improving their thermoelectric performance. Here, we present a remarkable thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of ~1.8 at 873 K in n&#8208;type PbSe doped with MoCl5 by modulation of the conduction bands, while simultaneously suppressing the phonon transport. Doping MoCl5 in PbSe induces notable convergence of conduction bands and an increased density of states near the Fermi level, mainly due to the contribution of Mo 4d orbital hybridized with the Se 4p&#8208;Pb 6p. This results in an improved Seebeck coefficient, despite maintaining a high n&#8208;type charge carrier concentration resulting in an excellent power factor (&#963;S2) of ~21 &#956;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at 873 K for PbSe + 1 mol% MoCl5. When the solid solution limit of the doping exceeds, it forms unique modular nano&#8208;heterostructures (5&#8208;30 nm) of PbSe&#8208;MoSe2 misfit layered compounds embedded in PbSe matrix. These nano&#8208;heterostructures significantly intensify phonon scattering, leading to an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;&#8343;&#8336;&#8348;) of 0.20 W m&#8208;1 K&#8208;1 at ~725 K in PbSe + 1 mol% MoCl5 sample.</dc:description>

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Luminescence Thermometry with Magnetic Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide(III) materials display remarkable optical properties, making them valuable for advancing remote luminescent sensors. The narrow emission bands and energy&#8208;transfer processes can be tailored to respond to external stimuli, such as temperature changes and magnetic fields. The application of magnetic fields lifts the Zeeman degeneracy, creating electronic spin polarization, and giving rise to magneto&#8208;optical phenomena. Magnetic circularly polarized luminescence (MCPL) is a magneto&#8208;optical technique in which the differential emission of left and right circularly polarized light is induced by a magnetic field oriented parallel or antiparallel to the light propagation axis. In the context of lanthanide(III) materials, this technique has only been explored in a few studies as a characterization tool. In this study, we present MCPL for a Dy(III) complex for the first time, highlighting its significant potential for magneto&#8208;luminescence thermometry. By studying the [Dy(acac)3(phen)] complex (phen: 1,10&#8208;Phenanthroline; acac: acetylacetonate) as an example, a maximum relative sensitivity of 30.6% K&#8208;1 was observed, highlighting the tremendous potential that MCPL emitters hold in the field of luminescent thermometers.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinuclear Au(0) Complex Supported by Tridentate P&#8722;Mg&#8722;P Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite significant advances in gold chemistry, the synthesis and stabilization of gold centers in a low oxidation state, particularly dinuclear Au(0) species, remain a considerable challenge. In this work, we report the successful isolation of a novel dinuclear Au(0) complex stabilized by tridentate P&#8211;Mg&#8211;P ligands. Computational studies demonstrate that the Au(0)&#8211;Au(0) &#963;&#8208;bond acts as a two&#8208;electron donor to the Mg centers. Reactivity studies further revealed the complex&#8217;s unprecedented ability to perform two&#8208;electron reductions on a range of substrates, akin to the behavior of well&#8208;established Mg(I) and Zn(I) dimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancing Solid&#8208;State Calcium Batteries: Achieving Fast Ionic Conductivity at Near Ambient Conditions in Calcium Hydridoborates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries based on abundant elements, such as calcium, offer a promising route to safer, cheaper, and more sustainable energy storage. Here we report a series of fast Ca2+&#8208;conducting compounds of methylamine calcium tetrahydridoborates, Ca(BH4)2&#183;xCH3NH2 (0 &lt; x &lt; 4.9) and related nanocomposites stabilized by inert MgO nanoparticles (50 nm). Three new crystal structures are identified: a three&#8208;dimensional network of octahedrally coordinated Ca2+ complexes for x = 1, a molecular structure of neutral complexes for x = 4, and a structure of cationic complexes for x = 6. The thermal stability generally decreases with increasing CH3NH2 content, and samples with x &gt; 2 slowly release CH3NH2 in &#8216;open&#8217; atmosphere at room temperature, but are stabilized in &#8216;closed&#8217; environments, e.g. capillaries. The ionic conductivity increases with CH3NH2 content and correlates with increased void space and structural flexibility, reaching &#963;(Ca2+) = 5.0&#8729;10&#8208;5 S cm&#8208;1 at 60 &#176;C for x = 4. Moreover, the effect of nanocomposite formation provided mechanical stability and a doubling of the ionic conductivity for&#160;Ca(BH4)2&#183;4CH3NH2&#8722;MgO (50 wt%), reaching &#963;(Ca2+) = 1.3&#8729;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 at 60 &#176;C. These findings demonstrate how local structure and nanoscale interfacial effects govern calcium transport, offering new design principles for functional calcium solid electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Electric Double Layer and Zn (100) Deposition Enabled by Anions for Highly Stable Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling the growth orientation of zinc (Zn) is an effective method of stabilizing Zn anodes. Although Zn (100) exhibits faster Zn electroplating/stripping kinetics than Zn (002), its high chemical reactivity results in susceptibility to water&#8208;induced side reactions. Herein, a two&#8208;pronged electrolyte engineering strategy is proposed to enhance the reversibility of Zn anodes, that is, modulating vertically oriented Zn (100) plating while simultaneously constructing a water&#8208;poor electrical double layer (EDL). Mechanistic studies revealed that the difluoro(oxalato)borate (DFOB&#8722;) anions of sodium&#8208;difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) function as a Zn2+ trapping agent at the inner Helmholtz layer, displacing active water molecules and inducing the preferential deposition of Zn on the Zn (100) crystal facets, thus effectively inhibiting both side reactions and dendrite growth. Consequently, a symmetrical cell with the ZnSO4/NaDFOB electrolyte exhibited a long lifetime of over 950 h under severe conditions of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 5 mAh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a practical Zn||NH4V4O10 pouch cell could achieves a high capacity of 156 mAh at industrial&#8208;level mass loading of 16.6 mg cm&#8722;2. This work provides insights for achieving stable Zn anodes via electrolyte engineering&#8208;triggered crystallographic orientation and EDL regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Molecular Carbons based on Quadruple [n]Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a molecular design strategy that combines structural multiplicity and &#960;&#8208;extension on a quaterrylene diimide scaffold to construct efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emitters. Through a carefully controlled synthesis involving sequential regioselective Suzuki coupling followed by Sholl&#8208;type oxidative cyclization, we successfully obtained two novel quadruple [n]helicenes (QnH). Comprehensive experimental characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrated their distinct configurational preferences: Q5H exclusively adopted the meso (P,P,M,M) configuration, while Q6H produced only the (P,P,P,P)/(M,M,M,M) enantiomeric pair. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction unambiguously confirmed the unique &#8220;four&#8208;bladed propeller&#8221; structure of (P,P,M,M)&#8208;Q5H. Both compounds demonstrated intense NIR fluorescence emission with photoluminescence quantum yields (&#934;PL) of 47% for Q5H and 37% for Q6H. The chiral (P,P,P,P)/(M,M,M,M)&#8208;Q6H enantiomers showed exceptional chiroptical properties, including intense Cotton effects reached 719 M&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1 at 410 nm, a high absorption dissymmetry factor |gabs| of 0.035, and prominent CPL activity across 600 to 800 nm with a CPL brightness (BCPL) of 96 M&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Nano&#8208;ZrO2 Exsolution from Ni&#8208;Zr&#8208;O Mixed Oxides Enables Facile Fabrication of ZrO2/Ni Inverse Catalysts for Efficient COx Methanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni&#8208;based inverse catalysts with nano&#8208;oxide dispersed on metallic substrates have emerged as promising candidates for low&#8208;temperature CO2&#160;methanation, but it remains challenging in facile synthesis of well&#8208;dispersed&#160;oxide&#8208;metal interactions. Herein,&#160;a spontaneous oxide exsolution strategy for the fabrication of Ni&#8208;based inverse catalyst via&#160;monodispersed&#160;Zr&#160;species of&#160;Ni&#8208;Zr&#8208;O mixed oxide&#160;is demonstrated, where precisely tailored calcination and reduction of the mixed oxide enable in situ nano&#8208;ZrO2&#160;segregation on the metallic Ni matrix.&#160;The formation evolution of inverse configuration is elucidated through comprehensive ex/in situ&#160;characterizations. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy&#160;reveals the electron transfer between&#160;the exsolved ZrO2&#160;and the Ni matrix, indicating the presence of metal&#8208;oxide&#160;interactions. The prepared ZrO2/Ni inverse catalyst achieves ~90% CO2&#160;conversion and &gt;99% CH4&#160;selectivity at low&#8208;temperature of 200&#160;&#176;C, and also demonstrates excellent catalytic performance and dynamic operational stability in complex COx&#160;hydrogenation reactions, validating its industrial applicability under realistic syngas&#8208;equivalent feedstock conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Metastable Macrocyclic Bis&#8208;Meisenheimer Adduct</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electron&#8208;deficient tetranitroazacalixarene is shown to undergo reversible cyanide capture via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, yielding an unprecedented class of metastable dianionic macrocycle incorporating two Meisenheimer units, fully characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR, and electronic absorption spectroscopies. Acting as a chemical fuel, cyanide transiently drives the formation of this adduct, which can spontaneously regenerate the parent macrocycle under mild conditions, representing a rare demonstration of metastability in a Meisenheimer complex. The dynamic behavior of this system, reminiscent of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium assemblies, is finely tunable through macrocycle concentration, counterion nature, solvent, and temperature. Detailed crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses reveal that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a key role in stabilizing the adduct. Comparative studies with simpler analogues further highlight the importance of macrocyclic preorganization and non&#8208;covalent interactions in governing this reversible reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Establishing 3d&#8208;4d Orbital Hybridization for Efficient Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal catalytic CO2 conversion offers a promising way to address the energy and environmental issues, however, the development of self&#8208;supporting catalyst with high activity and selectivity remains a great challenge. Here, we report the decoration of PdCo alloy on self&#8208;supporting carbon cloth with N&#8208;doped carbon arrays (PdCo&#8208;NC/CC) for efficient photothermal catalytic methanation. In situ spectra and density function theoretical (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the 3d&#8208;4d hybridization between Co and Pd enables an increase in the energy level of the dz2&#8208;5&#963; and dyz&#8208;2&#960;* states in the CO/PdCo alloy, thus enhancing the binding strength of the *CO intermediate and accelerating the CO hydrogenation. Specifically, the self&#8208;supporting substrate provides highly dispersed metal sites for CO2 methanation while serves as a photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat converter to improve the temperature of reaction system. As a result, PdCo&#8208;NC/CC exhibits unprecedent photothermal performance toward CO2 methanation, delivering a CH4 generation rate as high as 15.23 mol gmetal&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a selectivity of 100% in batch reaction under the irradiation of Xenon lamp without any external thermal source. Moreover, the continuous flow photothermal reaction can be smoothly proceeded over 100 h, demonstrating the high stability of PdCo&#8208;NC/CC in CO2 hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom Pore Engineering in Carbon Molecular Sieves Realizes Diffusion&#8208;Gated Kinetic Sieving of Alkenes from Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sub&#8208;&#229;ngstrom pore engineering offers a new paradigm for molecular separations. Here, we report sucrose&#8208;derived carbon molecular sieves with precisely tailored sub&#8208;&#229;ngstrom slit pores that enable diffusion&#8208;gated kinetic sieving for the challenging separation of alkenes from alkanes. The optimized materials, C&#8208;Suc&#8208;650 and C&#8208;Suc&#8208;750, set new industry&#8208;leading standards for the kinetic separation of C3H6/C3H8 and C2H4/C2H6, respectively. Through a combination of breakthrough experiments, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) simulations, and molecular dynamics modeling, we demonstrate that these sieves consistently achieve &gt;99.9% alkene purity, with outstanding selectivity, rapid uptake kinetics, and remarkably low energy consumption. Mechanistic studies reveal that slit pore architecture uniquely enhances alkene diffusion while hindering alkane movement, establishing a clear design principle for next&#8208;generation, energy&#8208;efficient gas separations. These results provide a blueprint for exploiting diffusion&#8208;gated kinetic sieving at the sub&#8208;&#229;ngstrom scale to address longstanding challenges in industrial gas purification.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Assisted Confined Synthesis of Metal Nanoparticles in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Enzyme&#8208;Metal Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of enzymatic and metal catalysis in cascade reactions offers a highly efficient approach for producing high&#8208;value chemicals, such as chiral pharmaceuticals. However, overcoming the inherent incompatibility between metal and enzyme catalysts and optimizing their stability and activity to achieve effective synergy, remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an enzyme&#8208;assisted, confined synthesis of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) within the nanochannels of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), to construct efficient enzyme&#8208;metal hybrid catalysts for cascade reactions.&#160;The COF nanochannels stabilize the enzyme during MNP formation and the catalytic process, and synergize with the enzyme to regulate the size, dispersion, and electronic state of the MNPs through surface amino acid residues, realizing the co&#8208;encapsulation and dual&#8208;optimization of both components.&#160;Using Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) and Pd nanoparticles as a model system, Pd/CALB@COF exhibits an 8.2&#8208;fold higher yield in the kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic 1&#8208;phenylethylamine (1&#8208;PEA), and a 2.7&#8208;fold enhancement in racemization&#160;conversion,&#160;compared to counterparts without COF. Their synergy in dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) delivers&#160;~91% yield, &gt;98% enantiomeric excess (e.e.) value, and recyclability, with applicability to various chiral amines. This strategy has been validated across different metal&#8208;enzyme systems, establishing a versatile platform for designing efficient enzyme&#8208;metal cascade systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Ag&#8314;&#8208;Mediated Structural Reconstruction of a Metastable Cu35 Cluster Toward Cu&#8211;Ag Heterometallic Architectures for Superior Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled structural transformations of metal nanoclusters (NCs) via dynamic bond reorganization provide fundamental insights into cluster reactivity and open avenues for functionality tuning. Here, we report a thiacalix[4]arene&#8208;protected Cu(I)&#8208;alkynide cluster, {NaCu35(TC4A)4(Ph&#8208;C&#8801;C)20} (Cu35), which exhibits remarkable structural plasticity. This metastable cluster can grow into a Cu36 species via ion substitution or undergo thermal&#8208;induced fragmentation to form a smaller Cu14 cluster. Under thermal etching by Ag+ ion, structural reconstruction is triggered, leading to the formation of the bimetallic Cu14Ag6 and Cu40Ag16 clusters. The structural reorganization significantly alters the catalytic outcomes in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. While the monometallic Cu35 and Cu14 favor gaseous CH4/C2H4 production, the bimetallic Cu14Ag6 demonstrates remarkable selectivity for ethanol synthesis. Notably, Cu14Ag6 achieves an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 49.27% for ethanol production, alongside a high partial current density of &#8208;67.94 mA cm&#8208;2. This marks the highest ethanol selectivity reported to date for atomically precise cluster catalysts. Mechanistic investigations reveal that, compared to homometallic Cu&#183;&#183;&#183;Cu dual sites (which typically favor C2H4), the unique Ag&#183;&#183;&#183;Cu&#183;&#183;&#183;Cu tri&#8208;metallic microstructure in Cu14Ag6 is more thermodynamically favorable for asymmetric C&#8722;C coupling between *CHO and *OCH2, facilitating the formation of the key *CHO&#8722;*OCH2 intermediate, which drives the ethanol&#8208;selective pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuterated Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Pure&#8208;Green Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with CIE Coordinates of (0.16, 0.75) and Long Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters, especially high&#8208;order B/N MR&#8208;TADF emitters, offer new opportunities in obtaining wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut, high color purity and highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Extending the device durability is still very challengeable for these emitters. Deuteration of emitters to slow down their degradation and lengthen device lifespan is a promising strategy. However, how to access deuterated high&#8208;order MR&#8208;TADF emitters remains to be explored. Herein, a synthetic protocols of high&#8208;order B/N products is proposed using deuterated starting materials and sequential borylation. Combining with fine&#8208;tuning electronic effect through adjusting position of tert&#8208;butyl (tBu) substituents, we successfully obtained deuterated triboron MR&#8208;TADF material &#969;'&#8208;DABNA&#8208;D that delivers precisely tuned pure&#8208;green emission with close&#8208;to&#8208;unity quantum yield and rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). The resulting binary OLED approaches the BT.2020 standard with CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.75) and demonstrates impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 34.6% at maximum and 30.7% at 1000 cd m&#8208;2. Additionally, an Ir(ppy)3&#8208;sensitized device shows excellent operational stability, with an extrapolated lifetime (LT80) of 6078 hours at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m&#8208;2. This study hence offers a promising methodology towards high performance OLED with long device lifetime.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Strain Relief via Zinc Acetate Enables High&#8208;Efficiency InP Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroepitaxial shell growth on quantum dots (QDs) is essential for tailoring carrier dynamics but is often hampered by core&#8208;shell interface strain, which becomes more prominent in environmentally friendly InP QDs due to their significant size effect. While post&#8208;treatment of InP cores with zinc compounds is a common approach to alleviate interface strain, conventional synthesis methods often fail to achieve effective doping, typically leaving zinc on core surface rather than within lattice. Herein, we present a dual&#8208;mode strain relief strategy using the small&#8208;molecule precursor Zn(Ac)2. Its ionic bonding character and low steric hindrance enable efficient Zn doping into the InP core and promote uniform epitaxial shell growth, leading to a 50% reduction in interfacial strain and a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield in InP QDs. This approach simultaneously addresses two major sources of strain: lattice mismatch between the core and shell, and steric hindrance from bulky surface ligands. The fabricated green InP&#8208;based QLED achieved a high external quantum efficiency of 26.3% and a current efficiency of 108.3 cd A&#8208;1. We believe this strategy provides a general and scalable strain engineering platform for QDs, with broad applicability across various material systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insights into Phase Formation of Sodium Layered Cathodes Materials with Prominent Electrochemical Performances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical performances of layered cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are intimately dependent on their structural characteristics. However, realizing accurate regulation of phase structure by phase engineering is challenging, primarily due to constrained synthesis methods and the existing gaps in understanding of specialized phase structures. In this study, a series of P'2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.05Ti0.1Mn0.85O2 cathode material with prominent electrochemical performances were successfully synthesized, based on an in&#8208;depth understanding of structural insights into P'2 phase. By analyzing the structural evolution and Mn&#8208;valence changes during synthesis process, we found that oxygen vacancies play a significant role in determining the P'2&#8208;P2 phase transition. Moreover, these structural insights not only identified the oxygen release and uptake behaviors in phase formation but also expanded synthesis strategy with enhanced operational feasibility. Benefits from expanded Mn redox range and stable oxygen vacancies during electrochemical cycling, the obtained P'2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.05Ti0.1Mn0.85O2 demonstrated a capacity increase of over ~40 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 C, maintaining ~93 mAh g&#8208;1 even after 1000 cycles at 10 C, with an impressive retention rate of 87.5%. This research significantly advances the comprehension of both synthesis mechanism and electrochemical properties optimization mechanisms of P'2 phase materials, offering a pragmatic strategy for elevating the performance of SIB materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;level design of acid&#8208;base pairs in oxides for selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides with ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) with NH3 (NH3&#8208;SCR) poses considerable potential in the abatement of NOx emissions. However, the efficient adsorption and speedy reaction of reactants following the specific mechanism in a favorable way is still a challenge for enhancing catalysis. Herein, we propose the strategy aimed at adjusting electronic properties of Ce&#8208;Ov&#8208;W acid&#8208;base pairs through constructing oxygen vacancies on Ce/WOx, thereby fostering SCR activity. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that Ce&#8208;Ov&#8208;W acid&#8208;base pairs not only provide more Ce3+ sites for promoting the reactivity of adsorbed NO, but also accelerate the reaction between NH3 and gaseous NO owing to the generation of W5+ species with superior surface acidity, which enhance Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood and Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanisms, respectively. Consequently, the designed catalysts achieve over 90% NOx conversion above 250&#176;C and exhibit higher activity than normal Ce/WO3 and V/W&#8208;TiO2 commercial catalysts, with anti&#8208;poisoning of SO2 and H2O under harsh working conditions, expecting to provide the guidance for promoting de&#8208;NOx industrial application.</dc:description>

         <title>Polycation Engineering in Polymeric Metal Halides Enables Tunable and Multicolor Emission from Single Transition&#8208;Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional metal halides have emerged a versatile platform for the development of light&#8208;emitting materials, but achieving tunable or even multicolor emission from a material containing a single type of metal has proven highly challenging. Here, we leverage the &#8220;structural tolerance&#8221; of recently&#8208;developed polymeric metal halides to integrate two distinct coordination units of a single metal into a material, thereby achieving highly tunable optical properties in single&#8208;phase metal halides. By manipulating the steric hindrance of polycations, facilely adjustable green, red or bicolor emission can be realized in manganese bromides, which originates from controllable transformation from manganese&#8208;bromine tetrahedra into octahedra. This design principle is further extended to polymeric copper halides, wherein broad self&#8208;trapped exciton emissions derived from distinct copper&#8208;iodine polyhedrons allow the emission colors to be linearly tunable from blue to yellow, encompassing pure white light, by tailoring the composition, excitation wavelength, or temperature. This study opens avenues for facile and precise modulation of the optical properties of metal halides by exploiting the intrinsic coordinative diversity of metal elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Logic&#8208;Gated Release of a Dual Payload from a &#946;&#8208;Lactam Mechanophore with a Rotaxane Actuator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The force&#8208;controlled release of functional molecules has attracted interest due to its potential use in drug delivery and self&#8208;healing applications. Clever mechanochemical devices have been developed to that effect, but most are limited by the payload (type, number) they can deliver and their responsiveness to a single stimulus (force). However, the applications envisaged above require the precise delivery of a complex payload. In this context, a device able to release a diverse set of cargo molecules in response to a varied number of stimuli is desired. Here we present a rotaxane&#8208;based device that can release a dual payload in response to two different stimuli: force and water. The first payload is released mechanically, while the release of the second cargo requires both force and water in a way reminiscent of a logic AND gate. Our device is built around a &#946;&#8208;lactam mechanophore that is activated by a rotaxane actuator to release a ketene and reveal an imine that anchors the second cargo to the axle of the rotaxane; hydrolysis of the imine releases the second cargo molecule. The concept was demonstrated with the efficient release of 2 drugs, hymecromone and gemcitabine, both in solution and in bulk.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;induced Fe&#8208;LMCT Catalysis for Redox&#8208;coupled Conversion of NOx and SO2 mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coexistent nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in flue gas pose inherent challenges for simultaneous removal due to their disparate reactivities. Conventional sequential treatments for their simultaneous removal face major issues of catalyst deactivation and byproduct generation. Here, we develop a subtle strategy using light&#8208;induced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) catalysis with Fe(II) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA&#8208;Fe&#7477;&#7477;) to achieve redox&#8208;coupled conversion of NO and SO2 mixtures. LMCT excitation in EDTA&#8208;FeII induces directional charge separation under irradiation, routing photogenerated electrons to Fe&#7477;&#7477; for driving selective NO&#8208;to&#8208;N2 conversion (selectivity: 99.89%), while photogenerated holes oxidize SO2 to SO42&#8722; (selectivity: 96.34%). This spatial segregation of redox pathways suppresses N2O generation, enabling continuous operation with a 90.39% removal ratio for NO and nearly 100% for SO2. Mechanism studies reveal the LMCT&#8208;enhanced charge transfer from carboxyl/amino groups to Fe centers, while in&#8208;situ EPR confirms the &#8226;SO32&#8722; radical&#8208;mediated h+ scavenging that accelerates charge separation and utilization. This work establishes Fe&#8208;LMCT catalysis as a sustainable platform for gas&#8208;phase pollutants remediation, achieving unprecedented selectivity through precise redox pathway control.</dc:description>

         <title>Orchestrating Penta&#8208;Element Interplay in Gradient&#8208;Porous Carbons for Advanced Sodium&#8208;Ion Hybrid Capacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between the active sites induced by promete and the Na+ storage capacity as well as anion adsorption/desorption has been established through a combination of electrochemical analysis, machine learning potentials, and molecular dynamics simulations, which enhances the kinetics and capacity balance of anode and cathode for sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) offer a cutting&#8208;edge synergy between battery&#8208;level energy density and supercapacitor&#8208;like power density, yet face critical challenges in balancing the kinetic and capacity mismatch between Faradaic anodes and capacitive cathodes. Herein, we present a penta&#8208;element doped gradient&#8208;porous carbon (PE&#8208;GPC) with a nanosphere architecture, engineered with high&#8208;entropy principles and a gradual pore density variation to enhance mass transport and charge storage. Operando spectroscopy and machine learning potentials unveil a concerted penta&#8208;element interplay: thiophene&#8208;like S configurations mediate dynamic redox processes, enabling pseudocapacitive Na&#8314; and anion storage, while fluorine functionalities foster a self&#8208;rejuvenating NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), stabilizing long&#8208;term cycling. Meanwhile, the synergistic N/B/P triad engineers a hierarchical defect network that enhances electronic conductivity and fine&#8208;tunes ion adsorption energetics. This orchestrated interplay empowers the SIHC full cell with a high energy density of 196&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, a formidable power density (10.4&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1), and an impressive 88.2% capacity retention after 9000 cycles. By establishing a high&#8208;entropy stabilization paradigm, this work paves the way for multi&#8208;ion storage architectures, offering a universal strategy to bridge the charge&#8208;transfer imbalance in advanced energy devices.

         <title>Engineering Graphene Nanoribbons via Periodically Embedding Oxygen Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of oxygen&#8208;doped graphene nanoribbons (O&#8208;doped chevron&#8208;GNR and O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR) were synthesized on Au(111) via in situ formation of pyrans. Both O&#8208;doped GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors but exhibit different sensitivities to oxygen dopants, which is attributed to the difference in the density of states near the Fermi level between the substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts.








Abstract
Heteroatom doping is an important method for engineering graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) because of its ability to modify electronic properties by introducing extra electrons or vacancies. However, precisely integrating oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs is unexplored, and the resulting electronic properties remain elusive. Here, we achieve the precise embedding of oxygen atoms into the lattice of GNRs via in situ formation of pyrans, synthesizing two types of oxygen&#8208;doped GNRs (O&#8208;doped chevron&#8208;GNR and O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR). Using scanning tunneling microscopy, noncontact atomic force microscopy, and density functional theory calculations, the atomic structures and electronic properties of O&#8208;doped GNRs are determined, demonstrating that both GNRs are direct bandgap semiconductors with different sensitivities to oxygen dopants. Oxygen dopants have a minor impact on the bandgap of chevron&#8208;GNR but a significant effect on the bandgap of chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, which is attributed to the difference in density of states near the Fermi level between substituted intrinsic carbon atoms and their pristine counterparts. Compared with the pristine chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, the band structure of O&#8208;doped chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR exhibits unexpected band edges transition, which is ascribed to sp2&#8208;hybridized oxygen atoms which introduces additional electrons to the conduction band of chiral (2,1)&#8208;GNR, leading to the upward shift of Fermi surface.

Compared with the pristine chiral (2,1)-GNR, the band structure of O-doped chiral (2,1)-GNR exhibits unexpected band edges transition, which is ascribed to &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized oxygen atoms which introduces additional electrons to the conduction band of chiral (2,1)-GNR, leading to the upward shift of Fermi surface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Dual Recycling in Photo&#8208;Curable Polycyanurate Thermosets Derived from Bio&#8208;Resources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;pathway recycling strategy for polycyanurate thermosets is presented. The thermosets are prepared by curing a bio&#8208;derived eugenol&#8208;based triazine monomer with various dithiols via thiol&#8208;ene photopolymerization. Recyclability is enabled through two distinct SNAr&#8208;based depolymerization approaches: selective monomer recovery and closed&#8208;loop polymer regeneration. The recycled materials retain their original performance.








Abstract
Polycyanurate thermosets are extensively utilized in high&#8208;performance applications due to their exceptional thermal and mechanical properties. However, their inherently crosslinked nature has traditionally rendered them nonrecyclable, limiting their sustainability. Recent studies have demonstrated that these networks can undergo dynamic rearrangement under specific conditions, enabling reversibility. In this study, a bio&#8208;derived cyanurate monomer from eugenol was synthesized and polymerized via thiol&#8208;ene photopolymerization, yielding recyclable polycyanurate thermosets with robust material properties. The dynamic character of these networks was leveraged through nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) chemistry, unlocking two distinct recycling pathways: i) selective monomer recovery and ii) closed&#8208;loop polymer regeneration. Depolymerization in the presence of eugenol enabled the selective recovery of well&#8208;defined monomeric components, while phenol&#8208;mediated cleavage facilitated polymer breakdown into chemically recyclable intermediates, which were directly reassembled into reformed thermosets. Both recycling pathways resulted in regenerated polymers that retained their original thermal, mechanical, and thermomechanical properties, demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of this approach. By establishing a controlled depolymerization and reassembly framework, this study introduces a sustainable design strategy for achieving closed&#8208;loop recycling in high&#8208;performance thermosets, providing a scalable pathway toward circular polymer materials.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Defect Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Tandem CO2 Electroreduction and Carbonylation Reactions from Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;system tandem approach&#8212;comprising a membrane separation CO&#8322; system, a CO&#8322; reduction reaction system, and a carbonylation reaction system&#8212;directly converts flue gas to high&#8208;value&#8208;added organic chemicals, establishing a practical paradigm for sustainable chemical manufacturing that simultaneously addresses challenges in carbon capture, renewable energy storage, and green synthesis of fine chemicals. 








Abstract
Tandem CO2 reduction with carbonylation reactions represents a promising approach to convert greenhouse gases into valuable chemicals. Herein, we propose a universal &#8220;N/O mixed pre&#8208;coordination pyrolysis&#8221; strategy to construct vacancy&#8208;defect single atom catalysts (Ni1&#8208;, Mn1&#8208;, Fe1&#8208;, Co1&#8208;, and Cu1&#8208;NC) with M&#8208;N3 coordination microenvironment. This vacancy&#8208;defect endows Ni1&#8208;NC with excellent performance for CO2 electroreduction, achieving a CO faradaic efficiency exceeding 90% across a wide range of current densities up to 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The generated CO was directly fed to carbonylation reactions, producing organic chemicals with yields of up to 91.7% and leading to produce 1.13&#160;g of benzophenone in a single run. For the first time, the membrane separation CO2 system was integrated with tandem catalytic system, enabling direct utilization of flue gas for benzophenone synthesis with a 76.6% yield. This work offers a sustainable, eco&#8208;friendly method for CO2 separation and utilization by feeding industrial waste gas to carbonylation reactions.

         <title>Ultrathin PtSe2 Nanowires in Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PtSe2 NWs grow anisotropically along the &lt;110&gt; direction inside the SWCNTs, and expose abundant zigzag edges, which contribute to the higher catalytic activity for HER. The as&#8208;prepared PtSe2 NWs exhibit excellent HER activity at extremely low Pt loading of 4.684&#160;wt%, with an overpotential of 47&#160;mV@10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 41.7&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Platinum selenide (PtSe2) has shown great potential for application in electrocatalysis. One&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanostructures are particularly advantageous for enhancing catalytic performance, as they expose abundant active sites at the edges and enable rapid charge transport. However, the synthesis of 1D PtSe2 nanostructures for efficient electrocatalysis remains a challenge. Here, we report the controllable synthesis of ultrathin (0.4&#8211;2.0&#160;nm) PtSe2 nanowires (NWs) using single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as a confined template via direct selenization by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The atom&#8208;resolved electron microscope combined with spectroscopy and theoretical calculations revealed that PtSe2 NWs grow anisotropically along the &lt;110&gt; direction inside the SWCNTs, possessing zigzag edges and higher thermodynamical stability. Owing to the rich&#8208;edges with abundant unsaturated Pt atoms, the as&#8208;prepared PtSe2 NWs exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at an extremely low Pt loading of 4.684&#160;wt%, with an overpotential of 47&#160;mV@10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 41.7&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1. This work provides a novel strategy for synthesizing 1D ultrathin NWs and offers the potential to achieve low&#8208;cost and efficient Pt&#8208;based catalysts in the future.

         <title>Tunable Endo/Exo Selectivity in Direct Catalytic Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions with Polyfunctional Lewis Acid / Azolium&#8211;Aryloxide Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept for catalytic asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with iminoesters employs modular polyfunctional Lewis acid/azolium&#8208;aryloxide betaine catalysts, controlling endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;selectivity through adjustments of metal center, azolium, and sterics. DFT studies reveal an almost perfect spatial fit of functional sites, enabling precise orchestration of the catalytically relevant moieties involved&#8212;reminiscent of enzymatic catalysis.








Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions (1,3&#8208;DCA) using iminoesters as ylide precursors offer a powerful approach to accessing stereochemically complex, biologically relevant pyrrolidines. Although previous studies have already achieved impressive stereoselectivities, catalytic productivity remains a challenge, with turnover numbers (TON) typically below 20. In this article, we introduce a novel concept for catalytic 1,3&#8208;DCA that enables remarkable productivity for both endo (TON up to 4000) and the more challenging exo products (TON up to 1500). This approach, making use of modular polyfunctional Lewis acid/azolium&#8208;aryloxide catalysts, allows for precise control over endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;diastereoselectivity. The switch from endo&#8208; to exo&#8208;selectivity is accomplished by modifying the metal center, the azolium moiety, and steric factors. As detailed DFT studies reveal, both the endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;selective catalyst systems exhibit an almost perfect spatial alignment of their key functional sites, allowing for a unique interplay of Br&#248;nsted acids and bases, Lewis acids, and hydrogen bonding. The computational studies further demonstrate that these polyfunctional catalysts dramatically lower the energetic barriers of the concerted or stepwise cycloaddition key steps. However, they also precisely orchestrate and accelerate all accompanying transformations&#8212;reminiscent of enzymatic machineries.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Molecule Junction Based on a Covalent Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A calix[4]resorcinarene&#8208;based molecular cage featuring a large [6&#160;+&#160;12] octahedral structure has been employed as a single&#8208;molecule junction. The connection between sulfur atoms in adjacent benzothiadiazole groups and the gold electrodes and leads to a stable junction with a conductance of 10&#8722;3.5 G0.








Abstract
As the applications of molecular cages hinge on their properties, understanding the true nature of the cage structures is imperative. Single&#8208;molecule conductance technique offered a unique opportunity to explore the property of an individual cage structure, yet the undefined cage&#8208;electrode connection remains challenging. Herein, we designed a new single&#8208;molecule junction based on covalent organic cages with sulfur atoms on the edges as defined anchor groups. Using scanning tunneling microscopy break junction method, the single&#8208;molecule conductance was found at 10&#8722;3.5 G&#8320;, indicating the formation of a stable junction by the cage. The investigation, combining control structures and theoretical studies, confirmed that the conductance signal originates from the connection between gold electrodes and sulfur atoms in adjacent benzothiadiazole groups. This well&#8208;defined connection allowed us to analyze electron transport within the cage structure, providing new insights into the property investigation of functional cages.

         <title>Unveiling the Influence of Cyanogen Vacancies in Prussian Blue for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop an anionic complexation strategy to construct cyanide vacancy&#8208;architected Prussian blue frameworks. Through controlled ligand&#8208;field perturbation, the engineered vacancies activate reversible Fe low&#8208;spin &#8596; high&#8208;spin transitions during cycling, creating adaptive structural accommodation that stabilizes Fe redox centers. This vacancy&#8208;mediated spin&#8208;state engineering establishes a new design paradigm for manipulating electron configuration through defect&#8208;property coupling in coordination materials.








Abstract
Prussian blue (PB), recognized as a promising cathode material, has gained significant attention for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical energy density, low cost, and ease of synthesis. However, the influence of anion vacancies on the stability of the PB framework remains controversial, impeding a comprehensive grasp of their precise role in electrochemical performance and the controlled synthesis of PB with smaller anionic vacancies remains challenging due to the limitations inherent in current synthesis strategies. Herein, we present an anion complexation method to synthesize PB materials with tunable cyanide vacancy concentrations. Furthermore, we propose a vacancy&#8208;driven mechanism that promotes spin transitions coupled with lattice bending, which are more reversible at low&#8208;spin Fe sites, leading to excellent low&#8208;spin stability and the design of materials with outstanding electrochemical performance. This anion complexation method not only provides a novel synthetic pathway for PB materials but also advances the understanding of the composition&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships between cyanide vacancy configurations and spin transition mechanism, highlighting its potential for future energy storage applications.

         <title>Orbital Coupling&#8208;Engineered Coordination&#8208;Unsaturated CuAg Nanochains Drives Spontaneous Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semihydrogenation and Zn&#8208;C2H2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination unsaturated Cu&#8208;Ag cross&#8208;linked nanochains (Cu0.5Ag CNCs) is synthesized for ethylene electrocatalytic production, achieving an ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 95.1% at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2. The orbital coupling between the Cu0.5Ag CNCs catalyst and the C2H2 molecules is enhanced and forms a high *H demand surface, where the acetylene hydrogenation process occurs spontaneously without energy barrier. It provides a new way to realize the orbital coupling engineering of coordination unsaturated bimetallic catalysts.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of acetylene (C2H2) offers a mild and sustainable pathway for ethylene production, yet it faces critical challenges including competitive C&#9472;C coupling for 1,3&#8208;butadiene due to insufficient proton supply and hydrogen evolution under high current densities. To address these limitations, we design a coordination&#8208;unsaturated CuAg bimetallic catalyst with cross&#8208;linked nanochains (Cu0.5Ag CNCs), which synergistically regulates proton dynamics, maintaining high activity from 0.1 to 0.6 A cm&#8722;2 and achieving an ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 95.1% at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic studies reveal that the introduction of Cu makes the d&#8208;band center in Cu0.5Ag CNCs upshift toward the Fermi level, strengthening orbital coupling with C2H2 and creating a high *H demand surface. In situ spectroscopic and density functional theory analyses demonstrate that coordination&#8208;unsaturated Cu&#8208;Ag interfacial sites promote spontaneous C2H2 hydrogenation, especially bypassing formation barriers of *C2H2 and *C2H3. This thermodynamic superiority originates from sufficient proton supply and exothermic *H consumption for C2H2 hydrogenation. Furthermore, the catalyst enables a Zn&#8208;C2H2 battery with a power density of 2.12&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, showcasing dual functionality in electrosynthesis and energy storage. Our work establishes a paradigm for coordination unsaturated bimetallic catalyst design through orbital coupling engineering, providing atomic&#8208;level insights into proton&#8208;mediated reaction control for sustainable chemical manufacturing.

         <title>Selection of Ribofuranose&#8208;Isomer Among Pentoses by Phosphorylation with Diamidophosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diamidophosphate phosphorylates the four pentoses under mild aqueous conditions. Ribofuranosyl&#8208;cyclicphosphates are formed efficiently, while the other three pentoses react slowly to form furanosyl&#8208; and/or pyranosyl&#8208;forms. The selective formation of ribofuranosyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclicphosphate occurs even when starting from a mixture of sugars suggesting an alternative pathway for abiotic synthesis of ribonucleotides in a prebiotic context.








Abstract
The unique structure&#8211;function relationship of the ribofuranose ring in RNA has inspired various chemical pathways to select for the ribofuranose form (over the ribopyranose form), especially in a prebiotic context. Herein we show that the reaction of diamidophosphate (DAP) with the four pentoses&#8212;ribose, arabinose, xylose, and lyxose&#8212;naturally selects the ribofuranose form more efficiently when compared to the other three pentoses. All four pentoses form the initial diamidophosphate&#8208;adduct; however, ribose undergoes rapid conversion to ribofuranose&#8208;1,2&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;cyclicphosphate products, while the other three pentoses show significant accumulation of the initially formed DAP&#8208;adducts and slow conversion to the cyclicphosphate products. Arabinose and xylose show a distribution between furanose&#8208; and pyranose&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclicphosphate products, while lyxose forms the furanose&#8208;1,2&#8208; and pyranose&#8208;2,3&#8208;cyclicphosphate products. This trend is also manifested when starting from a mixture of pentoses where ribofuranose 1,2&#8208;amidocyclicphosphate dominates the product distribution. Such selection for ribofuranose among pentoses by phosphorylation i) provides another venue of how a ribofuranose structure can selectively emerge through abiotic chemical reaction suitable for elaboration toward RNA and ii) adds to the body of experimental work addressing the chemical origin of RNA.

         <title>Design Strategies Based on Electronic Interactions for Effective Catalysts in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design of effective bidirectional electrocatalyst focused on electronic interactions in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Development of effective bidirectional catalyst is essential for high&#8208;energy density and long&#8208;life lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The catalytic activity of catalyst is directly related to the degree of the interaction between the catalysts and adsorbates. In the review, we introduce the design strategy for catalysts with high catalytic activity focused on the electronic structure and properties of catalysts and reactants.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are considered promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to their high energy density (&gt;500&#160;W h kg&#8722;1). However, LSBs exhibit an unsatisfactory energy density (&lt;400&#160;W h kg&#8722;1) and cycle life (&lt;300 cycles) because of the shuttle effect caused by soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPS) intermediates and the sluggish conversion reaction kinetics caused by insulating sulfur (S8) and lithium sulfide (Li2S). Although various types of catalysts, including metal&#8208;based compounds to single&#8208;atom catalysts, have been reported to address these issues, most catalysts exhibited limited catalytic activity under practical lean electrolyte conditions (&lt;5&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1). A comprehensive understanding of the synthetic strategy and catalytic mechanism of catalysts is essential for their design, but understanding the electronic effects of the catalysts and LiPS is more important. Furthermore, the electronic design of these catalysts is not well understood. In this review, we introduce the catalytic mechanisms in LSBs and discuss catalyst design strategies in terms of electronic effects on the interactions between reactants and catalysts, with a primary focus on heterogeneous catalytic systems. We additionally consider how the electronic property of homogeneous systems, particularly redox mediators, affects catalytic behavior under lean electrolyte conditions and propose future research directions for catalyst development in LSBs.

&lt;p&gt;Design of effective bidirectional electrocatalyst focused on electronic interactions in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Development of effective bidirectional catalyst is essential for high-energy density and long-life lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The catalytic activity of catalyst is directly related to the degree of the interaction between the catalysts and adsorbates. In the review, we introduce the design strategy for catalysts with high catalytic activity focused on the electronic structure and properties of catalysts and reactants.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electronic Structure Origins of Distinct Hydrogenation Activities Observed for Linear and Bent Bimetallic &#956;&#8208;Nitrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work represents the first research that employs a combination of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations to clearly elucidate the contribution of electronic structure to the distinct hydrogenation reactivity of bent and linear bimetallic nitrides. 








Abstract
Hydrogenation of metal nitrides is of particular interest due to the direct relevance to Haber&#8211;Bosch ammonia synthesis. Notably, for all bi&#8208; and multi&#8208;nuclear bridging nitrides reported thus far, only those featuring bent M&#9472;N&#9472;M cores can react with dihydrogen (H2) and related H2&#8208;derived species, while the vast majority of linear M&#9472;N&#9472;M congeners cannot. Herein, we present a detailed electronic&#8208;structure study of prototypical bimetallic bent &#956;&#8208;nitrides [Cp*FeIV(&#956;&#8208;SEt)2(&#956;&#8208;N)FeIVCp*][PF6] (1, Cp*&#160;=&#160;&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5) and [Cp*CoIII(&#956;&#8208;SAd)(&#956;&#8208;N)CoIIICp*] (3, Ad&#160;=&#160;adamantyl) and linear &#956;&#8208;nitride [(TPP)FeIV(&#956;&#8208;N)FeIV(TPP)][PF6] (2, TPP2&#8722;&#160;=&#160;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraphenylporphinato), as well as &#956;&#8208;imide [Cp*CoIII(&#956;&#8208;SAd)(&#956;&#8208;NH)CoIIICp*][BPh4] (4), using various spectroscopic techniques, in particular, 15N solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, coupled with density functional theory calculations. An in&#8208;depth analysis of their distinct 15N shielding tensors revealed that bent &#956;&#8208;nitrides invariably possess a high&#8208;lying proton&#8208;accepting molecular orbital (MO) and a low&#8208;lying electron&#8208;accepting MO. These electronic&#8208;structure features are key to the bent &#956;&#8208;nitrides affecting hydrogenolysis via either two&#8208;electron oxidation of H2 or H2 heterolysis. However, because of symmetry, linear &#956;&#8208;nitrides lack potent proton&#8208;accepting MOs, which rationalizes their disparate hydrogenation activities.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific On&#8208;Site Activation of Cisplatin via Cascade Catalytic&#8208;Redox Reactions for Highly Efficient Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;lock protected PtII nanomedicine has been developed, which performs cascade unlocking of cisplatin (cDDP) via catalytic&#8208;redox reactions, thus achieving tumor&#8208;specific &#8220;on&#8208;site&#8221; activation of cDDP in the nucleus accompanied with substantial induction of ferroptosis for highly efficient chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
The therapeutic efficiency of platinum drugs is always limited by low utilization, side effects, and Pt&#8208;resistance. Herein, a double&#8208;lock protected PtII nanomedicine named PtNP@Cu has been developed, which performs cascade unlocking of dechlorinated cisplatin (DP) via catalytic&#8208;redox reactions, thus achieving tumor&#8208;specific &#8220;on&#8208;site&#8221; activation of cisplatin (cDDP) in the nucleus accompanied with substantial induction of ferroptosis of cancer cells. This design avoids the premature release of active PtII species in normal cells or in the cytoplasm of cancer cells before reaching nucleus, thereby ensuring maximum amplification of Pt&#8208;DNA crosslinking with tumor&#8208;specificity. Meanwhile, substantial GSH depletion and ROS production induced by cascade catalytic&#8208;redox reactions results in ferroptosis of cancer cells, which further reduces GSH&#8208;mediated cDDP detoxification, overcomes Pt&#8208;resistance, and enhances immunogenicity, ultimately realizing highly efficient tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapy and antitumor immunity in vivo. This work provides a new strategy for effectively and comprehensively addressing the issues of low utilization, side effects, and drug resistance problems of platinum drugs, which is also promising for chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Unexpected Redox Role of WO3 in V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 Catalysts for Selective Reduction of NO by Forming V&#8211;W Dinuclear Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the NH3&#8208;SCR reaction over V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 catalyst, WO3 not only serves as an acidic promoter and structural regulator, but also plays a redox role. The WO3 directly participates in the oxidative activation of NH3, and hence explicitly exerts a redox effect by forming V&#8211;W dinuclear sites with V2O5.








Abstract
Promoters can greatly improve the activity of catalysts; however, the mechanism by which they interact with the primary catalyst to enhance catalytic activity is not always clear. It has been widely demonstrated that WO3 in V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 catalysts acts as a promoter to enhance the surface acidity and regulate the dispersion of active V2O5 species, while it is believed that the redox process takes place entirely at the V sites in the selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 (NH3&#8208;SCR). Here, by combining in situ spectroscopic measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we validate that the WO3 directly participates in the oxidative activation of NH3, and hence explicitly exerts a redox effect in NH3&#8208;SCR by forming V&#8211;W dinuclear sites with V2O5. This study sheds new light on a long&#8208;standing puzzle regarding the role of WO3 as a promoter and hence advances the understanding of the working principle of V2O5&#8208;WO3/TiO2 catalysts.

         <title>Unveiling Zinc Stripping and Molecular Engineering for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that the zinc stripping process is more prone to cause severe side reactions than the deposition process, resulting in the formation of dendrites and &#8220;dead zinc.&#8221; In this regard, a dynamic molecular protection strategy is proposed to regulate the zinc stripping and deposition processes simultaneously, achieving long&#8208;lasting protection of the zinc anodes.








Abstract
The unstable zinc anode is a key challenge limiting the cycle life of rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The current research primarily focuses on the zinc plating process, with strategies to induce uniform zinc deposition for a stable zinc anode. Here, we demonstrate that the zinc stripping process has a more significant impact on the subsequent zinc deposition, which exacerbates the formation of by&#8208;products, dendrites, and &#8220;dead zinc.&#8221; Therefore, we propose using aspartyl&#8208;phenylalanine methyl ester (APM) molecules to regulate the zinc stripping, achieving uniform stripping of the zinc anode by increasing the stripping overpotential across high&#8208;energy barriers. Simultaneously, its localized hydrophobic functional groups effectively inhibit the byproducts triggered by solvated water molecules. The experimental results show that the Zn&#8208;APM symmetric cell exhibits excellent cycling stability, with stable cycling over 6500&#160;h (&gt;9 months) at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 700&#160;h at 70% zinc utilization with 10&#160;&#181;m zinc. In addition, the Zn&#8208;APM||Zn0.58V2O5&#183;H2O full cell exhibits 80% capacity retention after 500 cycles at a loading of 8.1&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Comparative Study of Solvatomorphs of Stryker's Reagent Using MicroED and Quantum Mechanics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new solvate form of Stryker's reagent was crystallized from benzene which has regular octahedra with equivalent Cu&#8211;Cu interatomic distances. Quantum crystallography approach HAR led to reliable position of hydrides in both the forms. The reported THF solvate form has edge bridging hydrides while the newly discovered form may have both edge and face bridging hydrides supported by structural and topological analysis. 








Abstract
The atomic position of hydrogen atoms in metal hydrides has been a long&#8208;standing structural question in inorganic chemistry given that hydride delivery is integral to diverse chemical reactions. Microcrystal electron diffraction (microED), with it's increased sensitivity toward hydrogen atoms relative to X&#8208;ray diffraction, offers a potential path to addressing this challenge. Herein, the first microED study of Stryker's reagent is reported, resulting in the structure of a new benzene solvate. Improved accuracy for hydrogen atom positions was obtained via a quantum crystallography (QCr) approach, Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR). Structural and topological analysis supports edge bridging hydrides in the microED structure of a THF solvate form, consistent with previous diffraction studies. Interestingly, analysis of a new benzene solvate, discovered in this study, is consistent with mixed edge&#8208; and face&#8208;bridging hydrides.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered CRISPR/Cas12a for Genomic Editing and Tumor Regression</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;triggered CRISPR/Cas12a machinery for gene editing is introduced. The machinery is applied for endogenous DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) gene editing and for in vitro disruption of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene. The machinery is used for in vivo knockout and disruption of the HGF gene in HepG2 tumors, resulting in effective apoptosis and necrosis of the tumor tissues.








Abstract
A photo&#8208;triggered CRISPR/Cas12a machinery for in vitro and in vivo gene editing is introduced. The system consists of a caged, inactive ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl phosphate ester photo&#8208;responsive crRNA, which, upon light&#8208;induced deprotection, yields the active CRISPR/Cas12a gene editing machinery (LAC12aGE). The LAC12aGE system induces specific thymidine&#8208;rich (TTTN) protospacer&#8208;adjacent motif (PAM)&#8208;guided double&#8208;stranded breaks in genomic DNA, which upon non&#8208;homologous end&#8208;joining lead to gene repair. The LAC12aGE machinery is applied for gene editing of an exogenous dual fluorescent reporter gene in living cells, as well as the endogenous gene encoding DNA methyltransferase 1. In addition, the LAC12aGE is applied for in vitro gene editing and disruption of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene in HepG2 cells, where knockout of the HGF gene results in inhibited cell proliferation and migration, as well as enhanced apoptosis. Moreover, the in vivo knockout and disruption of the HGF gene in HepG2 tumors by the LAC12aGE machinery is demonstrated. The cyclic temporal development of the LAC12aGE system in tumors shows effective inhibition of tumor growth and enhanced apoptosis/necrosis of tumor tissues compared to control systems.

Under mild conditions (120 &#176;C, 0.6&#160;MPa), the system achieves complete PET conversion within 2 h, producing dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and ethylene glycol (EG) at yields of 94% and 98%, respectively.








Abstract
The global plastic waste crisis, particularly from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), demands sustainable recycling solutions. PET methanolysis offers a promising route to recover high&#8208;purity dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), but achieving scalable, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly processes under mild conditions remains challenging. This study introduces a bio&#8208;based catalytic system using guaiacol and potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3) under mild conditions (120 &#176;C, 0.6&#160;MPa), achieving 94% DMT and 98% ethylene glycol (EG) yields within 2 h. Unlike conventional acid&#8208;catalyzed or co&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted methanolysis methods, the phenolic hydroxyl group of guaiacol critically stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate, significantly enhancing catalytic efficiency. The system demonstrates broad versatility across various polyesters and real&#8208;world PET waste streams, including mixed textiles and colored plastics, while enabling selective depolymerization. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) confirm its low carbon footprint, energy efficiency, and industrial viability. This cost&#8208;effective and scalable strategy offers a sustainable solution for PET recycling, addressing both environmental and economic challenges while advancing resource circularity in the plastic industry.

Self&#8208;assembly reactions of [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (CpR&#160;=&#160;C5(CH3)5 and C5(4&#8208;EtC6H4)5) with coinage metal salts and white phosphorus afforded an unprecedented novel class of mixed polyphosphorus ligand complexes in which metal ions multiply coordinate intact P4 tetrahedra. The bulkiness of the used CpR ligand and the right choice of the solvent tune the structure and the content of P4 in the coordination products that can release P4 upon decomplexation.








Abstract
Two&#8208; and three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly reactions of [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (CpR&#160;=&#160;C5(CH3)5 (Cp*, 1a), C5(4&#8208;EtC6H4)5) (CpPEt, 1b)) with the coinage metal salts [Cu(CH3CN)4][SbF6] or AgSbF6 were investigated to study the prerequisites for the potential coordination of white phosphorus by using a sterically encumbered CpR ligand and noncoordinating anions. In the self&#8208;assembly reactions with white phosphorus, either 0D or 1D coordination complexes are formed, all of which feature coordinated intact P4 tetrahedra and thus comprise an unprecedented class of mixed polyphosphorus ligand complexes capable of complete release of P4 in solution confirmed by NMR studies. The bulkiness of the used CpR ligand and the correctly chosen solvent allowed for obtaining more beneficial structural motifs, the first discrete tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinated cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand complexes, that provide the maximal content of coordinated P4 molecules per species known so far. All products are characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.

         <title>Tuning Local Proton Concentration and *OOH Intermediate Generation for Efficient Acidic H2O2 Electrosynthesis at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis was achieved on F&#8208;CNTs with Faradaic efficiency of 95.6% at 1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. F&#8208;doping regulated the electronic structure, enhanced nanoconfinement effect and oxygen mass transfer of CNTs, leading to a local alkaline microenvironment and promoted *OOH generation for acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction is a sustainable method for on&#8208;site H2O2 synthesis. The H2O2 in acidic media has wide downstream applications, but acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis suffers from poor efficiency due to high proton concentration and unfavourable *OOH (key intermediate) generation. Herein, acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis was enhanced by regulating local proton availability and *OOH generation via fluorine&#8208;doped on inner and outer walls of carbon nanotubes (F&#8208;CNTs). It was efficient and stable for H2O2 electrosynthesis with Faradaic efficiency of 95.6% and H2O2 yield of 606.6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 at 1.0 A&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 0.05&#160;M H2SO4, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. The F&#8208;doping regulated the electronic structure of CNTs with elevated p&#8208;band center, and F&#8208;doping on its inner and outer walls also enhanced nanoconfinement effect and superhydrophobicity, respectively. As a result, a local alkaline microenvironment was created on F&#8208;CNTs surface during acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis. The energy barrier for *OOH generation was significantly reduced and oxygen mass transfer was boosted. Their synergistic effects promoted acidic H2O2 electrosynthesis. This work provides new insights into the mechanism for regulating H2O2 electrosynthesis.

We report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective double [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition between bisalkynyl malononitriles and terminal alkynes. Chiral spirobipyridines bearing ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituents can be synthesized with the help of chiral bisoxazolinephosphine ligands.








Abstract
Chiral spirobiindanes are recognized as the privileged structures in the field of asymmetric catalysis. However, the structurally similar chiral spirobipyridines have not yet been explored as chiral ligands or organocatalysts due to the absence of efficient synthetic methods. Herein, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of spirobipyridines via double [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction. Spirobipyridines with ortho&#8208; or meta&#8208;substituents could be obtained with exclusive regioselectivity and up to 99% ee in the presence of cobalt and bisoxazolinephosphine ligands. Spirobipyridines coordinate with transition metals as chiral ligands. Spirobipyridine dioxides can be applied as chiral organocatalysts in the asymmetric allylation of aldehydes.

         <title>Spatially Engineering the Internal Microstructure of a Single Crystal via Nanoparticle Occlusion</title>

The spatially controlled occlusion of polymeric nanoparticles into cuprous oxide (Cu2O) systematically alters lattice distortion, oxygen vacancy content, and catalytic efficiency in the resulting composite crystals, offering a robust framework for the development of advanced functional composite materials.








Abstract
Single crystals are characterized by their continuous, highly ordered atomic lattices. Therefore, introducing impurities or structural defects into their matrices presents a major challenge, particularly in a spatially&#8208;controlled manner. Herein, we demonstrate a nanoparticle occlusion approach that enables the microstructure of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) single crystals to be engineered in a tunable way. This is achieved by directly incorporating poly(glycerol monomethacrylate)51&#8208;block&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate)100 [G51&#8208;B100] diblock copolymer nanoparticles into growing Cu2O crystals, leading to the formation of G51&#8208;B100@Cu2O composite crystals with structural defects localized at the G51&#8208;B100/Cu2O interfaces. The spatial distribution of these defects can be systematically engineered, ranging from the surface region to the entire crystal. Remarkably, the G51&#8208;B100 occlusion endows the resulting composite crystals with excellent catalytic performance in dye degradation under dark conditions, with activity correlated to the extent of nanoparticle occlusion. This study offers a unique strategy to create interfacial defects in single crystals, imparting emerging functionalities to the resulting composites.

         <title>Visible Light Excited Time&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Color Tuning in Carbon Dots via Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the discovery of confining carbon dots (CDs) into boric acid matrix realizing the precise regulation of color from red to white with delay time increase under white light (WL) excitation. And composites can emit persistent afterglow at high temperatures up to 393&#160;K under WL excitation. Its time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) and high stability lay a solid foundation for higher&#8208;order cryptographic and anticounterfeiting.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;efficiency time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials that can be activated under visible light with strong stability remains challenging. In this study, carbon dots (CDs) were confined in the boric acid matrix to activate surface crosslinking emissive clusters and modulate charge transfer (CT) interaction, facilitating green and red dual emissive centers to coexist in composites. The presence of halogen atoms strengthened the interactions between CDs and boric acid. Notably, the CT interaction can offer excitons at low energy levels and allow for a much lower energy requirement for charge separation, making the red emissive center more dominant under visible light excitation. The interplay of dual centers featuring sufficient color differentiation and different decay rates activated characteristic TDPC evolution resulting in dynamic afterglow evolution from red to white under visible light excitation. Moreover, the formation of rigid boric acid crystalloid network resulted in an ultra&#8208;strong confinement at high temperature, enabling the composites to emit long persistent afterglow at high temperatures of up to 393&#160;K under visible light excitation. The study provides new light on the design of TDPC materials and represents a significant advancement toward expanding the application in information security.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Divergent Hydroboration/Multiboration of Terminal Alkynes via Markovnikov Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free and Markovnikov&#8208;type process for divergent hydroboration/multiboration of terminal alkynes has been achieved, enabling the transformation of diverse aryl and alkyl alkynes into valuable but previously inaccessible &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronate, 2,2&#8208;diborylalkane, 1,2,2&#8208;triborylalkane, and 1,2&#8208;diborylalkane with excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities by simply modulating the proton additive and solvent.








Abstract
Hydroboration/multiboration of alkynes has been considered a straightforward route for the construction of high&#8208;value alkenylboronates and multiborylalkanes, especially reflected by the productions of &#946;&#8208;alkenylboronates and related multiborylalkanes based on the anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;type transformations of terminal alkyne. However, the syntheses of branched &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronates and related multiborylalkanes remain elusive due to the thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable Markovnikov hydroboration process. Herein, we present a conceptually novel metal&#8208;free approach for Markovnikov hydroboration of terminal alkynes to achieve the &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronates. Derived from it, we have successfully realized unprecedented tailor&#8208;made multiborations (2,2&#8208;dihydroboration, 1,2,2&#8208;triboration, and 1,2&#8208;dihydroboration) of alkynes by simply changing the proton sources and solvents. The broad substrate scope and outstanding chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities of the developed approaches unlock opportunities to exploit these formerly unattainable organoboronates, thereby expanding uncharted chemical space. The preliminary mechanistic studies highlight the synergistic roles of amide solvents, suitable proton sources, and B2cat2 in facilitating these tunable transformations.

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination in Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Enables Fast Charge Dynamics and Hierarchical Active Sites for Two&#8208;Stage Kinetics in Photodegradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This investigation demonstrates an efficient synthetic methodology for the fabrication of atomically dispersed cobalt species anchored on carbon nitride substrate, featuring distinctive asymmetric Co&#9472;C2N3 coordination environments and hierarchical active sites. The unique electronic structure of this single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits strengthened driving force and boosted charge carrier transport properties, manifesting in two&#8208;stage reaction kinetics during the photocatalytic degradation of bisphenol A contaminants in wastewater.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted growing interest in solar&#8208;driven catalysis, though challenges persist due to symmetrical metal coordination, which results in limited driving force and sluggish charge dynamics. Additionally, uneven energy and mass distribution complicate reaction pathways, ultimately restricting solar energy utilization and catalytic efficiency. Herein, we synthesized cobalt single atoms decorated carbon nitride catalysts featuring a highly asymmetric Co&#9472;C2N3 coordination, tailored for photocatalytic organic pollutants removal. Advanced experimental studies and simulation results collectively revealed that the unique microenvironment surrounding Co single atoms improved charge dynamics and created reactive hot spots, facilitating the generation of reactive oxygen species during the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. These enhanced charge dynamics, combined with hierarchical active sites, resulted in two&#8208;stage reaction kinetics and excellent stability for the degradation of bisphenol A in wastewater, distinctly outperforming the first&#8208;stage kinetics observed for polymeric carbon nitride. This work advances the understanding of structure&#8208;performance relationships in SAC&#8208;based photocatalytic degradation and offers valuable insights for the design of next&#8208;generation SACs in environmental catalysis.

         <title>Supramolecular TADF Materials from Calix[3]Acridan and Guest&#8208;Linked Polymers for Rapid and Visual Detection of Trace Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the rapid and visual detection of trace benzene was reported by utilizing supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence polymeric materials GPs@C[3]A based on luminescence color change mechanism, and the limit of detection concentration for benzene vapor reached 3.5&#160;mg L&#8722;1. Moreover, GP1@C[3]A was fabricated into a visualized and convenient paper&#8208;based sensor strip for detecting benzene in cyclohexane.








Abstract
In this work, a new strategy for rapid and visual detection of trace benzene vapor was reported by utilizing supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence (STADF) polymeric materials via luminescence change mechanism. Consequently, a new type of multi&#8208;color STADF polymeric materials GPs@C[3]A were constructed by host&#8211;guest complexation between calix[3]acridan (C[3]A) and different guest&#8208;linked polymers (GPs). Interestingly, by adjusting the added molar proportion of C[3]A, multi&#8208;color TADF property of GPs@C[3]A could also be easily tuned. Notably, when a 20% molar ratio of C[3]A was added, GP1@C[3]A exhibited white luminescence. Especially, by using the high selectivity of C[3]A toward benzene and its differential binding affinities for acceptor guests versus benzene, rapid detection of trace benzene vapor was achieved in few seconds with the naked eyes. The limit of detection concentrations for benzene reached 3.5&#160;mg L&#8722;1, indicating GPs@C[3]A could be used as an excellent sensor for rapid detection of benzene at trace level. Furthermore, GP1@C[3]A could also be fabricated into a visualized and convenient paper&#8208;based sensor strip for detecting benzene in cyclohexane. This work offers an innovative idea for the application of STADF materials in detection, and also addresses the key challenge of simultaneously improving sensitivity, selectivity and visualization in benzene detection.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, a new strategy for rapid and visual detection of trace benzene vapor was reported by utilizing supramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence (STADF) polymeric materials via luminescence change mechanism. Consequently, a new type of multi-color STADF polymeric materials GPs@C[3]A were constructed by host&#8211;guest complexation between calix[3]acridan (C[3]A) and different guest-linked polymers (GPs). Interestingly, by adjusting the added molar proportion of C[3]A, multi-color TADF property of GPs@C[3]A could also be easily tuned. Notably, when a 20% molar ratio of C[3]A was added, GP1@C[3]A exhibited white luminescence. Especially, by using the high selectivity of C[3]A toward benzene and its differential binding affinities for acceptor guests versus benzene, rapid detection of trace benzene vapor was achieved in few seconds with the naked eyes. The limit of detection concentrations for benzene reached 3.5&#160;mg L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, indicating GPs@C[3]A could be used as an excellent sensor for rapid detection of benzene at trace level. Furthermore, GP1@C[3]A could also be fabricated into a visualized and convenient paper-based sensor strip for detecting benzene in cyclohexane. This work offers an innovative idea for the application of STADF materials in detection, and also addresses the key challenge of simultaneously improving sensitivity, selectivity and visualization in benzene detection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterointerfacial Charge Modulation of p&#8208;Type Covalent Organic Frameworks on Graphene Achieving High&#8208;Performance Cl&#8722; Ion Storage with Ultralong Cycling Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type COF/graphene hybrid electrode (TAPArGO) with strong interfacial &#960;&#8211;&#960; coupling and dual conductivity engineering is developed for efficient Cl&#8315; ion storage. The electrode exhibits outstanding energy output and ultralong cycling stability, offering new opportunities for next&#8208;generation energy storage and desalination technologies.








Abstract
The charge and ion transport dynamics, storage capacity, and cycling performance of Faradaic Cl&#8722; ion storage electrodes have recently constrained advancements in supercapacitor (SC) and capacitive deionization (CDI). Herein, a high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type COF (TAPA&#8208;COF)&#8208;based Cl&#8722; ion storage material (TAPArGO) with exceptional cycling stability was synthesized via an in situ condensation reaction utilizing graphene as a conductive substrate. The interfacial coupling involving graphene and TAPA&#8208;COF increases the interfacial electron density, boosting local charge accumulation and Cl&#8722; ion storage capacity. Additionally, the dual conductive strategy of incorporating graphene and extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization of TAPA&#8208;COF enhances the redox kinetics, while the triphenylamine N redox centers and flexible graphene network improve cycling stability. Consequently, the Cl&#8722; ion asymmetric SC employing the TAPArGO&#8208;75 positive electrode achieves a specific energy output of 52.4 Wh kg&#8722;1 at 950 W kg&#8722;1, with exciting cycling durability retaining 96.8% of the initial capacity after 100&#160;000 cycles. Furthermore, the hybrid CDI system based on the TAPArGO&#8208;75 positive electrode demonstrates a specific adsorption capacity of 55.0 mg g&#8722;1, along with remarkable cycling desalination/regeneration ability (99.8% after 200 desalination/regeneration cycles). This study expands the application potential of COF&#8208;based materials for high&#8208;performance Cl&#8722; ion storage.

         <title>Non&#8208;Innocent Ligands as Mediators for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Initiated Element&#8211;Carbon Bond Homolysis in Main Group Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the facilitation of E&#9472;C bond homolysis of main group compounds with visible light by the coordination of redox non&#8208;innocent ligands. Important conceptual coherencies, potential applications, and future challenges are highlighted with respect to selected literature reports.








Abstract
Photoinitiated homolysis of element&#8211;carbon bonds is an important method for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals in catalysis and organometallic or polymer chemistry. In this respect, the use of earth&#8208;abundant main group elements such as aluminum or silicon is attractive. Generally, subvalent species derived from these typically redox&#8208;inactive elements are unstable and within their high&#8208;valent configuration +III (Al) or +IV (Si) comparatively strong E&#9472;C bonds are formed. Therefore, E&#9472;C homolysis usually requires shortwave UV irradiation, which hampers their use as radical sources. Some reports in the literature show that visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced E&#9472;C homolysis is possible when a redox non&#8208;innocent ligand (NIL) is coordinated to the organometallic fragment. In a simplified view, the NILs provide chromophoric moieties, which can absorb energy in form of light and subsequently convert it to break the element&#8211;carbon bonds. The resulting main group element radicals are in turn stabilized by delocalization of the unpaired electron, effectively lowering the dissociation energy of the E&#9472;C bond. In this article, the effects of NILs as mediators for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced E&#9472;C bond homolysis in main group chemistry are discussed on the basis of selected literature reports, and future opportunities and challenges are highlighted.

         <title>Theodor F&#246;rster: Life and FRET from 1933 to 1951. A Viewpoint from the Archives</title>

Theodor F&#246;rster's name is forever linked to FRET (F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer) and while his development of FRET theory is well known and recognized, only few is documented about his scientific career and life from 1933 to 1951. By reviewing documents from different archives, this Viewpoint Article discusses F&#246;rster's life and career before, during, and after National Socialism in Germany.








Abstract
FRET stands for F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. While much is known about resonance energy transfer, much less is known about F&#246;rster&#8211;apart from the fact that he was the one who translated FRET from a theoretical phenomenon into a broadly usable method for investigating and understanding biomolecular interactions on the nanoscale. Arguably, a major reason for the limited recognition of Theodor F&#246;rster is his scientific career during the Nazi time in Germany about which little is documented. By reviewing documents from different archives, this Viewpoint Article&#8211;on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his death&#8211;sheds some light on F&#246;rster's life from 1933 to 1951 and describes how a young scientist struggled during dark times in history.

The phase separation of self&#8208;assembled hosts in a gel from liquid guests is a convenient approach for heterogeneous encapsulation. In their Communication (e202504207), Dong Yang and co&#8208;workers report a class of gels formed through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of &#8220;aniono&#8221; helicates, which can be utilized as filling material in columns and show the ability to selectively encapsulate and release choline. This study introduces the concept of flowing a solution containing guests through a host&#8208;containing gel for effective guest separation. The process of guest binding could be also monitored in real time via electrical characterization.

Developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers relies on simple, easily accessible building blocks with minimal steric hindrance and strong electron deficiency. Xugang Guo and co&#8208;workers report a quinoid building block, thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione (TTD), in their Research Article (e202501196). The TTD&#8208;based polymers exhibit tunable charge carrier polarity from p&#8208;type to ambipolar and ultimately to n&#8208;type upon thermal annealing, along with outstanding n&#8208;type thermoelectric performance.

Like attracts like, they say; however, decades elapsed before mixed polyphosphorus ligand complexes were finally self&#8208;assembled. In their Research Article (e202503614), Eugenia Peresypkina, Manfred Scheer et&#160;al. demonstrate that reactive white phosphorus molecules can be captured by a polynuclear silver complex based on pentaphosphaferrocene and controllably released in solution. The cover image plays around the concept of high loading of intact tetrahedral P4 molecules within the carrier complex.

Organoautocatalyzed transamination metathesis of challenging cyclic tertiary amines is reported. In their Research Article (e202505275), Svetlana B. Tsogoeva and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the use of an in situ&#8208;formed pyrrolidinium salt as an efficient organoautocatalyst, enabling double C(sp2)&#8208;N bond metathesis at room temperature via a domino reaction mechanism. This metal&#8208; and additive&#8208;free transformation advances green, waste&#8208;reducing, and sustainable approaches in organic synthesis.

         <title>From Binary to Higher&#8208;Order Organic Cocrystals: Design Principles and Performance Optimization</title>

From binary to higher&#8208;order organic cocrystals: strategic design principles, precision synthesis, and multifunctional applications. The emergence of ternary and higher&#8208;order cocrystalline systems, comprising three or more components, has revolutionized the paradigm of material design by significantly expanding both structural diversity and functional potential. These advanced architectures not only exhibit enhanced design versatility through synergistic molecular engineering but also enable unprecedented modulation of physicochemical properties, thereby introducing novel optoelectronic, mechanical, and stimuli&#8208;responsive functionalities.








Abstract
Organic cocrystals, particularly the evolution from binary to higher&#8208;order structures, have garnered considerable attention due to their tunable intermolecular interactions and unique material properties. Binary cocrystals, formed through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, charge transfer, and hydrogen/halogen bonding, allow for precise control over molecular packing and enhanced optoelectronic properties. In contrast, higher&#8208;order cocrystals, incorporating three or more components, enable greater complexity and functional diversity. Strategies such as homologation via isostructural substitution, hierarchical intermolecular interactions, and long&#8208;range Synthon Aufbau Modules facilitate the synthesis of these advanced materials. The shift toward higher&#8208;order cocrystals paves the way for novel applications in fields such as deep learning for cocrystal prediction, drug design, organic solar cells, and NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion. However, challenges related to molecular screening, ratio optimization, scalable synthesis, and long&#8208;term stability remain critical hurdles for the broader implementation of these materials in practical applications.

Binary cocrystals, formed through &#960;-&#960; stacking, charge transfer, and hydrogen/halogen bonding, allow for precise control over molecular packing and enhanced optoelectronic properties. In contrast, higher-order cocrystals, incorporating three or more components, enable greater complexity and functional diversity. Strategies such as homologation via isostructural substitution, hierarchical intermolecular interactions, and long-range Synthon Aufbau Modules facilitate the synthesis of these advanced materials. The shift toward higher-order cocrystals paves the way for novel applications in fields such as deep learning for cocrystal prediction, drug design, organic solar cells, and NIR-II photothermal conversion. However, challenges related to molecular screening, ratio optimization, scalable synthesis, and long-term stability remain critical hurdles for the broader implementation of these materials in practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive Organic Crystals: Molecular Design and Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over the past decade, red&#8208;emissive organic molecular crystals have advanced through molecular design (donor&#8208;acceptor structures, &#960;&#8208;conjugation) and crystal engineering to overcome aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and energy gap limitations. Featuring high quantum yields, tunable deep&#8208;red/NIR emission, and flexibility, they enable applications in flexible waveguides, lasers, and bio&#8208;integrated optoelectronics.








Abstract
Red&#8208;emissive organic materials play a pivotal role in optoelectronics, including displays, optical communications, organic lasers, and biomedicine, owing to their high penetration and low scattering properties. However, conventional polymer and thin&#8208;film emitters often face efficiency losses at long wavelengths and limited operational stability. Organic molecular crystals have emerged as promising alternatives by offering high purity, low defect density, and unique optical anisotropy. Among them, red&#8208;emissive organic molecular crystals (ROMCs) remain relatively underdeveloped compared to their blue and green counterparts. Moreover, the inherent brittleness of most crystals poses significant challenges for their integration into flexible and wearable devices. This review highlights recent advances in the design and development of ROMCs, emphasizing molecular and crystal engineering strategies to overcome photophysical limitations and impart mechanical flexibility. Emerging applications in organic lasers, optical waveguides, and bioimaging are discussed, alongside key challenges and future research directions. By bridging fundamental understanding and practical deployment, this perspective offers a comprehensive roadmap for the rational design of flexible, red&#8208;light&#8208;emitting crystalline materials for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic platforms.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Targeted Protein Degradation: An Emerging Therapeutics Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as a powerful therapeutic approach, with numerous candidates molecules now advancing into clinical development. Recent innovations have incorporated nanoparticles to facilitate and enhance these degradation processes, yielding synergistic effects. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of nanoparticle&#8208;mediated targeted degradation, outlining recent advances, key challenges, and future opportunities to guide progress in this rapidly evolving field.








Abstract
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as a transformative therapeutic strategy for eliminating disease&#8208;associated proteins, with relevance across disorders ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration. Since its inception nearly two decades ago, TPD has attracted strong academic and commercial interest, with multiple candidates advancing into clinical trials. Despite this progress, the field faces persistent challenges, including limited solubility, poor cellular uptake, and unpredictable structure&#8211;activity relationship of small&#8208;molecule degraders, which complicate rational design. To address these limitations, alternative platforms such as nanoparticle&#8208;mediated protein degraders (NanoPDs) have gained attention. First reported 17 years ago, NanoPDs harness a diverse array of materials, degradation mechanisms, and linker chemistries to achieve protein clearance through novel pathways. Although promising, their clinical translation remains constrained by barriers such as lysosomal entrapment, protein corona formation, and biocompatibility concerns. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of nanoparticle&#8208;mediated TPD. We emphasize the design principles underlying nano&#8211;bio interfaces and explore the role of proximity&#8208;induced biology as a mechanism for orchestrating protein interactions. Finally, we highlight critical challenges and key questions that must be addressed to fully realize the therapeutic potential of NanoPDs.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Cation Effects in Electrolytes for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cations play a pivotal role in controlling electrocatalytic reaction pathways, selectivity, and kinetics. A deeper mechanistic understanding of cation effects offers opportunities to overcome the activity&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off in electrocatalytic reactions, enabling the rational design of more efficient electrolyte systems.








Abstract
Traditional understanding of electrocatalytic reactions has primarily focused on the covalent interactions between adsorbates and catalyst surfaces, often overlooking the significant influence of the electrolyte on the catalytic process. Recently, researchers have highlighted the pivotal role of cations in the electrolyte, demonstrating their capability to modulate the reaction pathways and thus the activity and selectivity. These findings underscore the need for a deeper, atomic&#8208;level understanding of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. This perspective presents the mechanisms through which cations affect electrocatalysis, with a focus on the hydrogen&#8208;bond network, the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates, the electric field within the electrochemical double layer, and the local electronic properties of catalysts. It provides a summary of the influences of cations on various electrocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). At the end, future research directions are provided to maximize the potential of leveraging the cation effects in the design of more efficient electrolyte systems.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review goes to data&#8208;driven. An exhaustive literature survey provides an overview of research status on aerogels, a category of highly porous solids with unique physicochemical properties. Statistical/data&#8208;driven analysis tells us positive/negative aspects; aerogels have a promising potential to contribute to emerging energy/environmental issues, while they are causing an academic fever with irresponsible exaggerations and a flood of unreliable data.








Abstract
A thoroughly data&#8208;driven review on the chemistry, properties, and applications of aerogels is provided. Aerogel is a category of solid materials having homogeneous, highly porous nanostructures. Unique physicochemical properties of aerogels have attracted much attention in wide fields due to their potentials for energy/environmental issues in the 21st century, while an exponentially increasing number of papers are causing an academic fever and unreliable data issues. Statistical analysis based on an exhaustive literature survey from almost all the papers with &#8220;aerogel&#8221; in their titles reveals a flood of freeze&#8208;dried aerogels mainly consisting of organic polymers and organic&#8211;inorganic composites. Process&#8208;property data from polymer aerogel papers are analyzed by a machine&#8208;learning approach aiming to establish data infrastructure toward future aerogel studies. Data&#8208;evidenced critical discussion specifies a tendency in unreliable thermal conductivity data of these papers.

         <title>Dopant and Exfoliation Induced Simultaneous Modification of Charge Density and C&#9472;C Coupling Sites for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into higher carbon products demands precise catalyst engineering. In this study, we implemented a dual doping strategy in AgBiP&#8322;S&#8326; to optimize charge density and enhance active sites for C&#9472;C coupling. This approach successfully enabled the synthesis of ethylene through the photoreduction of CO2, showcasing the effectiveness of the modified catalyst design.








Abstract
The photochemical conversion of CO2 into C2+ products has emerged as an attractive method for synthesizing valuable chemicals and fuels using abundant solar energy. However, the challenge lies in enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of C2+ product formation. In this study, we employed a heteroatom doping strategy to optimize the photocatalytic parameters and achieve excellent efficiency and selectivity in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ product formation. Our experimental analysis revealed that the local electronic structure of the catalyst, modified by In&#8208;doping, enables enhanced efficiency. Additionally, the incorporation of Cu facilitates the coupling of C1 intermediates, resulting in excellent selectivity towards C2+ products. The CO2 reduction performance is further enhanced through exfoliation, which increases the exposure of active sites and extends the charge carrier lifetime by reducing the charge diffusion length. We report that the rate of formation of C2H4 reached 54.3&#160;&#181;mol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;g&#8722;1 with an outstanding selectivity of 91% over the exfoliated CuIn&#8208;doped AgBiP2S6 catalyst. By elucidating the role of heteroatom doping and exfoliation in enhancing both the efficiency and selectivity of C2+ product formation, our study contributes to advancing the development of sustainable and efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion technologies.

This approach successfully enabled the synthesis of ethylene through the photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, showcasing the effectiveness of the modified catalyst design.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photochemical conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into C2+ products has emerged as an attractive method for synthesizing valuable chemicals and fuels using abundant solar energy. However, the challenge lies in enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of C2+ product formation. In this study, we employed a heteroatom doping strategy to optimize the photocatalytic parameters and achieve excellent efficiency and selectivity in the photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to C2+ product formation. Our experimental analysis revealed that the local electronic structure of the catalyst, modified by In-doping, enables enhanced efficiency. Additionally, the incorporation of Cu facilitates the coupling of C1 intermediates, resulting in excellent selectivity towards C2+ products. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction performance is further enhanced through exfoliation, which increases the exposure of active sites and extends the charge carrier lifetime by reducing the charge diffusion length. We report that the rate of formation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; reached 54.3&#160;&#181;mol&#183;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an outstanding selectivity of 91% over the exfoliated CuIn-doped AgBiP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst. By elucidating the role of heteroatom doping and exfoliation in enhancing both the efficiency and selectivity of C2+ product formation, our study contributes to advancing the development of sustainable and efficient photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silylchromium&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Semihydrogenation of Undirected Allenes by Sila&#8208;Metalation and &#946;&#8208;Silyl Elimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substituted allenes without a directing group underwent chromium&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and regioselective semihydrogenation with an (alkyl)(amino)carbene&#8208;phosphine ligand and a chlorosilane additive. The silylchromium complex formed in situ promotes semihydrogenation through a pathway involving sila&#8208;metalation of the allene and &#946;&#8208;silyl elimination, with the silyl group acting as a noninnocent ligand to give E&#8208;alkene products selectively. 








Abstract
The semihydrogenation of simple allenes remains an issue because of the difficulty in controlling of selectivity without coordination assistance from directing groups, wherein over&#8208;hydrogenated alkanes and E/Z&#8208;mixed stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208;isomers can be potentially formed. We report here an electron&#8208;rich cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;phosphine&#8208;ligated chromium(III) complex serving as precatalyst in promoting the selective semihydrogenation of undirected allenes by forming active silylchromium species. The semihydrogenation allows the selective addition of H2 to the less substituted and electron&#8208;rich alkyl&#8208;substituted C&#9552;C bonds of allenes while enabling the suppression of competitive over&#8208;hydrogenation, proving generally to form trisubstituted E&#8208;alkenes in high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity. By this CAAC&#8208;phosphine&#8208;Cr&#8208;catalyzed selective semihydrogenation, unsaturated nitro, nitrile, alkenyl, and hydrogenation&#8208;sensitive bromide, chloride, and fluoride were compatible with various substitution environments. The in situ forming silylchromium as active catalyst by reaction of low&#8208;valent chromium complex with chlorosilane was established by studying the catalytic and stoichiometric reactivity of this species in the semihydrogenation. Deuterium labeling experiments, HRMS, XPS, EPR, and magnetic susceptibility analysis of the related intermediates and theoretical studies support a pathway involving sila&#8208;metalation of allene and &#946;&#8208;silyl elimination processes with silyl as noninnocent ligand, leading to the E&#8208;alkene products.

         <title>Lysine&#8208;Targeting, Covalent Inhibitors of Bromodomain BD1 of BET Proteins in Live Cells and Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully developed the first BD1&#8208;targted covalent inhibitor (TCI), BDS4, by utilizing 2&#8208;ethynylbenzaldehyde (EBA). Importantly, BDS4 retained robust activity against fibrosis in cells and animals when compared to the marginal effects of BD2 inhibitor RVX&#8208;208. Our developed tool showed clear advantages of long&#8208;lasting domain&#8208;selective TCI in delineating the district function of BD1 and BD2. 








Abstract
The bromodomain extra&#8208;terminal (BET) family of proteins are valuable therapeutic targets for cancer and other diseases. The adverse events of current pan&#8208;BET inhibitors (BETi) make the development of BET BD1&#8208; or BD2&#8208;selective inhibitors as a fresh avenue to overcome safety challenges. On the basis of various lysine&#8208;reactive covalent warheads herein we report a set of activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs; P3&#8211;P7) capable of global profiling of ligandable lysines within bromodomains (BRDs) in live cells and animals. Chemoproteomic experiments with P7, which utilizes 2&#8208;ethynylbenzaldehyde (EBA), identified 16 endogenous BRDs, thus giving a global landscape of ligandable lysines in BRDs. By further introducing EBA and salicylaldehyde into PLX51107 (a noncovalent BETi), we generated lysine&#8208;reactive, irreversible (BDS1&#8211;4) and reversible (BDS5&#8211;6) BD1 covalent inhibitors. Mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the successful covalent engagement between EBA and K91 near the acetylated lysine (Kac)&#8208;binding site of BD1 in BRD4. BDS4 showed 104&#8208;fold selectivity for BD1 over BD2 with prolonged anticancer effects. Importantly, BDS4 retained robust activity against fibrosis in cells and animals when compared to RVX&#8208;208 (a reported BD2&#8208;selective noncovalent inhibitor), which showed only marginal effects. Our work serves as a useful tool to delineate distinct functions of BD1 and BD2 in future studies.

         <title>Aptamer as a Molecular Tethering Agent Induces PrPC Aggregation and Degradation to Inhibit Melanoma Proliferation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a molecular tethering agent, TTe&#8208;TTe, that binds to the octapeptide repeat region of glycosylated PrPC. TTe&#8208;TTe suppresses malignant melanoma proliferation by triggering PrPC to aggregate on the cell membrane surface, followed by its degradation. This versatile platform technology opens up new avenues for targeted protein degradation in a wide range of therapeutic applications, potentially advancing the field of drug discovery.








Abstract
Melanoma, a malignant tumor originating from melanocytes, is the most aggressive and deadly form of skin cancer. Previous studies have revealed that the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is frequently overexpressed in melanoma, contributing to tumor progression. This study presents the first proof of concept evidence that nucleic acid aptamers can be used to construct a molecular tethering agent that regulates PrPC protein levels by inducing membrane&#8208;bound PrPC aggregation for antimelanoma therapy. Using a screening strategy combining cell&#8208;SELEX and cell&#8208;internalization SELEX, we obtained ssDNA aptamer, TT&#8208;1e, specifically binding to melanoma cells and tissues. We identified that the binding site of TT&#8208;1e is located at the octapeptide repeat region of glycosylated PrPC. Based on the binding characteristics of TT&#8208;1e, we engineered an aptamer&#8208;based molecular tethering agent TTe&#8208;TTe. We found that TTe&#8208;TTe induces aggregation of cell surface PrPC, promoting its internalization and facilitating its lysosomal degradation. This process resulted in the inhibition of AKT pathway activation. Importantly, in vivo studies confirmed the ability of TTe&#8208;TTe to target melanoma xenografts and suppress tumor growth through this unique mechanism. Our study presents a promising strategy for targeted melanoma therapy and introduces a paradigm&#8208;shifting approach for manipulating protein levels using aptamers as molecular tethering agents.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Nanographenes Through Domino Cyclization Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis enables nanographene fabrication but with limited reactions. Here, bis{2&#8208;(7&#8208;formylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl}diacetylene undergoes domino cyclization via cycloisomerization, cyclodehydrogenation, and formyl cyclization, yielding dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene and peryleno[2,1,12,11&#8208;fghij]pentaphene. STM, STS, and DFT analyses reveal their structures and properties, advancing carbon nanostructure synthesis.








Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis has emerged as a powerful method to synthesize nanographenes that are difficult to obtain through the solution chemistry, but the number of available reactions is still highly limited. In this study, we demonstrate an unprecedented on&#8208;surface domino cyclization of bis{2&#8208;(7&#8208;formylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl}diacetylene, leading to dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene and peryleno[2,1,12,11&#8208;fghij]pentaphene through a sequence of 1) cycloisomerization of diaryldiacetylene moieties, 2) oxidative cyclodehydrogenation, and 3) reductive cyclization of formyl groups.

         <title>The ATM Kinase Inhibitor AZD0156 Is a Potent Inhibitor of Plasmodium Phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;Kinase (PI4K&#946;) and Is an Attractive Candidate for Medicinal Chemistry Optimization Against Malaria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
AZD0156, an ATM kinase inhibitor in clinical development, shows promising multistage antiplasmodial activity by targeting Plasmodium falciparum phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;kinase (PfPI4K&#946;). With an improved specificity profile relative to other PfPI4K&#946; inhibitors and moderate efficacy in a P. berghei disease model, AZD0156 is an attractive candidate for medicinal chemistry optimization against malaria.








Abstract
New compounds targeting human malaria parasites are critical for effective malaria control and elimination. Here, we pursued the imidazoquinolinone AZD0156 (MMV1580483), a human ataxia&#8208;telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase inhibitor that completed Phase I clinical trials as an anticancer agent. We validated its in vitro activity against the two main forms of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite in the human host, viz. the asexual blood (symptomatic) stage and sexual gametocyte (transmission) stage. Resistance selection, cross&#8208;resistance, biochemical, and conditional knockdown studies revealed that AZD0156 inhibits P. falciparum phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;kinase type III beta (PfPI4K&#946;), a clinically&#8208;validated target for the treatment of malaria. Metabolic perturbations, fixed&#8208;ratio isobolograms, killing kinetics and morphological evaluation correlated AZD0156 inhibition with other known PI4K&#946; inhibitors. The compound showed favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties and 81% antimalarial efficacy (4 &#215; 50 mg kg&#8722;1) in a P. berghei mouse malaria infection model. Importantly, a cleaner biochemical profile was measured against human kinases (MAP4K4, MINK1) implicated in embryofoetal developmental toxicity associated with the PfPI4K&#946; inhibitor MMV390048. This improved kinase selectivity profile and structural differentiation from other PI4K&#946; inhibitors, together with its multistage antiplasmodial activity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties, makes AZD0156 an attractive candidate for target&#8208;based drug repositioning against malaria via a medicinal chemistry optimization approach.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells via 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks: Enhanced Efficiency Through Precision Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two donor&#8208;acceptor 3D COFs synthesized via Schiff base reactions were integrated into perovskite solar cells&#8217; SAMs. Their architecture enabled efficient charge separation, stable interfacial anchoring, and optimized energy alignment, enhancing hole transport and perovskite quality and reduced defect density. This achieving PCEs up to 25.20%, demonstrating COFs' potential in advancing PSC efficiency.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a class of porous polymers with tunable 2D or 3D structures, have drawn significant attention for their exceptional versatility across various applications. Recently, the integration of COFs into perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has emerged as a promising strategy to address critical challenges, such as instability, interfacial recombination losses, and lead&#8208;associated environmental risks. Enhanced charge transport channels, passivation of defects, and customizable molecule architectures are some of the special benefits that COFs offer. In this study, we used Schiff base reactions to create two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type COFs with an 8+2 connection motif, which were integrated into PSC self&#8208;assembled (SAM) layers. According to characterizations and theoretical calculations, COFs not only effectively optimize the energy level of the ITO/SAM substrate but also passivate perovskite defects and suppress defect&#8208;assisted recombination in PSC devices. These modifications significantly enhanced carrier transport and extraction, resulting in an increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 22.57% to 25.20% (DP&#8208;BE) and 24.21% (DP&#8208;DBE). This work highlights the potential of COFs as multifunctional modifiers for interfacial engineering in PSCs, offering a promising route to improve device performance and stability.

         <title>Noncovalent Synthesis of Topological Heterostructures Using a Site&#8208;Selective Electrostatic Co&#8208;Assembly Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective electrostatic co&#8208;assembly (SSECA) strategy was developed to fabricate a variety of topological heterostructures (THSs) with unprecedented architectures from two&#8208;component systems of organometallic complexes and block copolymers. The THSs are composed of rigid parts of closely stacked organometallic complexes and flexible segments formed from electrostatic co&#8208;assembly of BCPs and the complexes originally in the SPs. 








Abstract
Heterostructured nanomaterials composed of heterogeneous zones with dramatically different chemical and/or physical properties have attracted significant attention. However, achieving controllable synthesis of heterostructures integrated with segments of different stiffness and morphologies has been highly challenging, limiting their applications. Herein, a site&#8208;selective electrostatic co&#8208;assembly strategy was developed to rationally fabricate topological heterostructures (THSs) containing rigid and flexible segments with different chemical compositions and morphologies. Cationic organometallic complexes have been employed to prepare 1D crystalline supramolecular polymers (SPs), followed by electrostatic co&#8208;assembly with oppositely charged block copolymers (BCPs) of poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(acrylic acid). It has been found that the BCPs could interact and co&#8208;assemble with the complexes in SPs in situ at some specific sites bearing positively charged groups to form nanofiber&#8208;like moieties. The co&#8208;assembled nanofibers are connected to the intact parts of SPs, resulting in THSs composed of nanofibers and intact parts of SPs. The position of the defect sites on SPs and the dimension of SPs could be finely regulated by performing thermal annealing and/or sonication treatments, further enriching the architectures of the co&#8208;assembled THSs. This study unveils new topologies that exhibit enhanced higher&#8208;order structural complexity in the realm of supramolecular nanostructures, enabling the exploration of their properties and applications.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Allylic Substitution of Unprotected Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed radical allylic substitution method that directly functionalizes unprotected allylic alcohols, eliminating the need for prefunctionalization and toxic reagents. Utilizing iron's unique redox and oxophilic properties, this approach offers a step&#8208;economic and sustainable pathway to allylic functionalization. This method expands the synthetic toolbox and demonstrates the versatility of outer&#8208;sphere mechanisms in radical&#8208;based reactions, facilitating the efficient synthesis of diverse molecular architectures.








Abstract
Allylic substitution reactions are essential in organic synthesis, enabling the transformation of allylic reagents into diverse alkenes. Traditional methods, which typically operate through ionic pathways, often require substrate preactivation to address high C&#9472;O bond dissociation energies, leading to challenges in regioselectivity and limited substrate compatibility. Here, we introduce an iron&#8208;catalyzed radical pathway for allylic substitution that directly activates unprotected allylic alcohols, leveraging the redox and oxophilic properties of low&#8208;valent iron to promote selective C&#9472;O bond cleavage and allylic transposition. This radical approach achieves high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, providing access to a broad array of di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes with moderate to excellent yields and exceptional E/Z selectivity. Mechanistic studies confirm that the iron catalyst generates radical intermediates and mediates efficient dehydroxylation, enabling this direct transformation without protective groups or Lewis acid activators. The method's versatility is demonstrated through a broad substrate scope, including complex natural derivatives and functionalized alkyl halides, along with successful gram&#8208;scale synthesis and downstream derivatization. This iron&#8208;catalyzed radical pathway offers a sustainable and efficient alternative to conventional ionic methods, expanding the scope of allylic substitutions and advancing radical&#8208;based methodologies in synthetic chemistry.

     alt="Iron-Catalyzed Radical Allylic Substitution of Unprotected Allylic Alcohols"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report an iron-catalyzed radical allylic substitution method that directly functionalizes unprotected allylic alcohols, eliminating the need for prefunctionalization and toxic reagents. Utilizing iron's unique redox and oxophilic properties, this approach offers a step-economic and sustainable pathway to allylic functionalization. This method expands the synthetic toolbox and demonstrates the versatility of outer-sphere mechanisms in radical-based reactions, facilitating the efficient synthesis of diverse molecular architectures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allylic substitution reactions are essential in organic synthesis, enabling the transformation of allylic reagents into diverse alkenes. Traditional methods, which typically operate through ionic pathways, often require substrate preactivation to address high C&#9472;O bond dissociation energies, leading to challenges in regioselectivity and limited substrate compatibility. Here, we introduce an iron-catalyzed radical pathway for allylic substitution that directly activates unprotected allylic alcohols, leveraging the redox and oxophilic properties of low-valent iron to promote selective C&#9472;O bond cleavage and allylic transposition. This radical approach achieves high regio- and stereoselectivity, providing access to a broad array of &lt;i&gt;di-&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;tri-&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;tetra&lt;/i&gt;-substituted alkenes with moderate to excellent yields and exceptional &lt;i&gt;E/Z&lt;/i&gt; selectivity. Mechanistic studies confirm that the iron catalyst generates radical intermediates and mediates efficient dehydroxylation, enabling this direct transformation without protective groups or Lewis acid activators. The method's versatility is demonstrated through a broad substrate scope, including complex natural derivatives and functionalized alkyl halides, along with successful gram-scale synthesis and downstream derivatization. This iron-catalyzed radical pathway offers a sustainable and efficient alternative to conventional ionic methods, expanding the scope of allylic substitutions and advancing radical-based methodologies in synthetic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Simple Quinoid Building Block for Polymer Semiconductors with Tunable Polarity and High n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple quinoid building block TTD, featuring small steric hindrance and high electron deficiency, was obtained via a one&#8208;step synthesis. Unexpectedly, the TTD&#8208;based polymers showed tunable charge carrier polarity from p&#8208;type to ambipolar and ultimately to n&#8208;type upon thermal annealing, and the n&#8208;doped polymers attained remarkable thermoelectric performance with a power factor of 36.7 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. 








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated polymers with deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level and large electron mobility are highly pursued as n&#8208;type organic thermoelectric materials. Herein, we synthesized a simple structured electron&#8208;deficient quinoid building block, thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione (TTD), via one step from a low&#8208;cost starting material. Based on TTD, polymers PQD and PQTD were successfully developed, featuring remarkably low&#8208;lying LUMO levels (&#8722;3.91&#160;eV for PQD and &#8722;3.73&#160;eV for PQTD), which greatly facilitate n&#8208;doping process. Unexpectedly, it was found that charge carrier polarity of PQD and PQTD can be tuned from p&#8208;type to ambipolar and finally to n&#8208;type in organic field&#8208;effect transistors after thermal treatment, an unprecedented phenomenon in polymer semiconductors. Organic thermoelectric devices based on n&#8208;doped PQD films showed an excellent electrical conductivity up to 19.1 S cm&#8722;1 and a power factor of 36.7 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. To the best of our knowledge, this PF value ranks the highest reported to date for n&#8208;doped quinoid&#8208;based polymers. This work underscores the great potential of structurally simple and readily accessible electron&#8208;deficient quinoid TTD for the development of high&#8208;performing n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors.

         <title>Supramolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Approach for Tunable and Efficient Circularly Polarized Delayed Fluorescence and Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;covalent supramolecular and intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) strategy, employing bis&#8208;chromophoric pyromellitic diimides (PmDIs) and judicious choice of donors, enabled tunable circularly polarized delayed luminescence in the red region with a high quantum yield of &#8764;46% and a significant |glum| value of up to &#8764;3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;2.








Abstract
Achieving efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) in purely organic systems is a vibrant and rapidly evolving field of research. Recently, the growing interest in ambient organic phosphors has offered a promising alternative for achieving CPL with remarkable quantum yields by utilizing triplet states. While supramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions are well&#8208;established to improve |glum| by enhancing magnetic transition dipole components, their application to triplet&#8208;harvesting organic systems remains unexplored. In this context, our current work introduces a supramolecular strategy to achieve highly efficient and tunable circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence by the involvement of intermolecular triplet CT states. Through&#8208;space intermolecular CT interactions between heavy atom&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;chromophoric pyromellitic diimides (PmDIs) (acceptors) and achiral phenyl carbazole derivatives (donors) enable one of the most efficient circularly polarized delayed luminescent systems, characterized by a high quantum yield (&#8764;46%) and a significant |glum| &#8764;3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;2. Additionally, the modularity of this non&#8208;covalent design allows for the tuning of emission from the orange to deep&#8208;red regions by incorporating various donors. The strategy presented here opens new avenues for designing efficient CPL&#8208;active organic phosphors.

A molecular communication system has been developed to monitor Zn2+ ion transport&#8208;mediated chemical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal amplification process.








Abstract
Artificial ion channels have significant potential for various applications, including molecular communication, bio&#8208;sensing, and constructing artificial cells. In this report, we demonstrated the development of a molecular communication system that transports ions across the lipid bilayers via the formation of supramolecular ion channels and harnesses chemical reactions to overcome the challenges of executing signal&#8208;processing functions at the molecular level. The potent ionophore self&#8208;assembles into nanochannels within the lipid bilayers and selectively transports Zn2+ ions. The movement of Zn2+ ions through these supramolecular ion channels enables the in situ generation of a water&#8208;soluble catalytic system with tyrosine. This catalytic system promotes esterase&#8208;like activity, generating fluorescent reporters from non&#8208;fluorescent ester&#8208;based compounds within the intravesicular environment. Furthermore, this process indicates the formation of a three&#8208;input AND logic gate in the fluorescence mode, allowing the monitoring of the chemical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal amplification process akin to biological counterparts. Developing these molecular communication systems to replicate the complexity of natural cellular processes opens up exciting opportunities for designing advanced biomimetic tools and exploring the fundamental principles underlying cellular communication.

         <title>Boosting Initial Coulombic Efficiency in Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;based Cathodes by Tuning Orbital Hybridization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we investigated the potential of Li&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides as promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries, highlighting the critical challenges posed by low initial coulombic efficiency and irreversible oxygen release. We introduce a novel treatment method using Glyoxal, which facilitates the integration of transition metal 3d and oxygen 2p orbital hybridization, aimed at optimizing the electrochemical performance of LRMO. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in ICE, increasing from 85.3% to 102.5%. Additionally, the treated LRMO achieves a high specific capacity of 291.2&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, surpassing untreated samples, and exhibits excellent cycling stability with retention rates of 90.1% after 150 cycles and 76.5% after 250 cycles at 0.5 C. 








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides (LRMO) are promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their high&#8208;capacity and low&#8208;cost merits. However, the low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and irreversible oxygen release of LRMO severely hinder their commercialization processes. Here, we employ glyoxal treatment to modulate the hybridization between transition metal (TM) 3d and oxygen (O) 2p orbitals in LRMO. This approach is found to reduce the Co/Mn t2g&#8208;O 2p hybridization in LRMO while simultaneously activating the Co2+/Co3+ redox below the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that tuning TM 3d&#8208;O 2p orbital hybridization can be a viable approach to improve the ICE of LMRO. Specifically, the ICE of LRMO can be elevated from 85.3% to 102.5%, and a high specific capacity of 291.2&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 can be achieved at 0.1 C. Moreover, the treated LRMO cathodes exhibit significantly enhanced capacity retention.

We introduce a novel treatment method using Glyoxal, which facilitates the integration of transition metal 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; and oxygen 2&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbital hybridization, aimed at optimizing the electrochemical performance of LRMO. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in ICE, increasing from 85.3% to 102.5%. Additionally, the treated LRMO achieves a high specific capacity of 291.2&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1 C, surpassing untreated samples, and exhibits excellent cycling stability with retention rates of 90.1% after 150 cycles and 76.5% after 250 cycles at 0.5 C. 

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li-rich manganese-based oxides (LRMO) are promising cathode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to their high-capacity and low-cost merits. However, the low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and irreversible oxygen release of LRMO severely hinder their commercialization processes. Here, we employ glyoxal treatment to modulate the hybridization between transition metal (TM) 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; and oxygen (O) 2&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbitals in LRMO. This approach is found to reduce the Co/Mn &lt;i&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-O 2&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; hybridization in LRMO while simultaneously activating the Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; redox below the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that tuning TM 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-O 2&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbital hybridization can be a viable approach to improve the ICE of LMRO. Specifically, the ICE of LRMO can be elevated from 85.3% to 102.5%, and a high specific capacity of 291.2&#160;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; can be achieved at 0.1 C. Moreover, the treated LRMO cathodes exhibit significantly enhanced capacity retention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Urea Electrosynthesis via Asymmetric Oxygen Vacancies in Zn&#8208;Doped Fe2O3 Catalysts</title>

The Zn&#8208;doped Fe2O3 catalysts with Zn&#8211;OV&#8211;Fe sites can promote the conversion of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;*CO and the coupling of *NO + *CO and thus improve the urea electrosynthesis. It exhibits an outstanding urea faradaic efficiency of 62.4% with a production rate of 7.48&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. 








Abstract
Urea electrosynthesis from CO2 and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) provides an attractive pathway for storing renewable electricity and substituting traditional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthesis technology. However, the kinetics mismatching between CO2 reduction and NO3&#8722; reduction, as well as the difficulty of C&#9472;N coupling, are major challenges in urea electrosynthesis. Herein, we first calculated the free energy of *CO, *OCNO, and *NOH formation over defect&#8208;rich Fe2O3 catalysts with different metal dopants, which showed that Zn dopant was a promising candidate. Based on the theoretical study, we developed Zn&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich Fe2O3 catalysts (Zn&#8211;Fe2O3/OV) containing asymmetric Zn&#8211;OV&#8211;Fe sites. It exhibited an outstanding urea faradaic efficiency of 62.4% and the remarkable recycling stability. The production rate of urea was as high as 7.48&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1, which is higher than most of the reported works to date. Detailed control experiments and in situ spectroscopy analyses identified *OCNO as a crucial intermediate for C&#9472;N coupling. The Zn&#8211;Fe2O3/OV catalyst with asymmetric Zn&#8211;OV&#8211;Fe sites showed enhanced *CO coverage and promoted *OCNO formation, leading to high efficiency toward urea production.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Generation via Peroxide&#8208;Mediated Electrocatalytic Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advantages of peroxide redox chemistry are explored for green hydrogen production. Peroxide redox electrocatalysts enable efficient and selective peroxide production and oxidation, facilitating on&#8208;site hydrogen generation while achieving a nearly 50% reduction in applied potential compared to conventional water&#8208;splitting methods. An integrated bipolar&#8208;ion gradient system further reduces energy requirements to nearly one&#8208;third of traditional electrolysis.








Abstract
Hydrogen (H2) production through water electrolysis is a promising route for sustainable energy storage. However, conventional water electrolysis faces several challenges, such as large thermodynamic potential gaps and sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics, which lead to high electricity consumption and limitations in H2 storage and transportation. A promising approach to overcoming these hurdles is hybrid water electrolysis, which integrates alternative, thermodynamically favorable reactions at the anode to enhance efficiency. In this study, we explore how peroxide redox electrocatalysis can address critical barriers in sustainable H2 production, storage, and transport. By leveraging a cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient peroxide redox electrocatalyst, we demonstrate various electrolysis configurations that significantly reduce the required cell voltage&#8212;from the standard 1.23&#160;V down to &#8722;0.06&#160;V, highlighting its potential for scalable and economically viable electrolysis methodologies for H2 production.

         <title>Induced Chirality and Vibrational Optical Activity in an Ionic&#8208;Liquid Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality can be induced in an ionic liquid anion. Normally, the enantiomeric conformers are equally populated, and no optical activity is observed. However, if a chiral probe molecule (e.g., propylene oxide) is added, a non&#8208;symmetric redistribution of the conformers occurs, chirally imprinting the ionic liquid.








Abstract
Here, we show that the four conformers of the regularly used ionic liquid anion bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [NTf2]&#8722;$[{\rm NTf}_2]^{-}$ are true enantiomeric pairs by analyzing their calculated vibrational circular dichroism spectra. The significant modes involve those atoms of the anion that form specific hydrogen bond patterns with the chiral probe molecule propylene oxide. Adding this probe molecule to the ionic liquid 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, the experimental and simulated spectra indicate intermolecular interaction between the chiral molecule and the liquid and thus the induction of chirality in the anion. This emergence of chirality in the ionic liquid takes place via the hydrogen bonding between the anion of the ionic liquid and the solute, which results in a redistribution of the symmetric occurrence of conformers to an asymmetric one. Altogether, this study reveals the mechanism of chiral induction from the propylene oxide molecule to the ionic liquid anion, while pointing out the importance of rational over a random choice of the ionic liquid building units.

         <title>Dynamic Exchange Reactions as Self&#8208;Blowing Agents for the Production of Reprocessable Foams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an innovative approach to designing self&#8208;blown foams by leveraging the irreversible and self&#8208;catalyzed transesterification of alkylester which release alcohol gas as blowing agents. The morphology and thermo&#8208;mechanical properties of these foams can be precisely tailored by modifying the precursor structure. Remarkably, they can be reprocessed as rigid resins through reversible self&#8208;catalyzed transesterification reactions.








Abstract
Thermosetting foams are crucial in the polymer industry due to their unique lightweight and durable properties. Recent developments in sustainable chemistry intend to align foam lifecycles toward circular economy principles and reduce their environmental impact. In this study, this issue is addressed thanks to an innovative and straightforward approach, enabling the manufacture of single&#8208;component self&#8208;blowing vitrimer foam. The self&#8208;blowing mechanism originates from the in situ formation and release of the blowing agent via the polycondensation of an alkylester. This alkylester, composed of a benzoxazine matrix terminated with a &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamine, undergoes in a cascade mechanism ring opening polymerization (ROP) and irreversible transesterification exchange, which in turn generates an alcohol gas. The cascade polymerization and alcohol release were optimized and fine&#8208;tuned to develop various foams that have an open&#8208;cell morphology, volume expansion of 223%&#8211;853%, porosity of 67%&#8211;86%, and compression modulus in the range of 3&#8211;38&#160;MPa. The polymerization process results in a dual crosslinked poly(benzoxazine&#8208;co&#8208;ester) network composed of &#946;&#8208;hydroxylamine moieties, alkyl, and &#946;&#8208;aminoester bonds, enabling reversible transesterification dynamic exchanges and mechanical reprocessability, achieving a foam&#8208;to&#8208;resin reprocessing.

The cascade polymerization and alcohol release were optimized and fine-tuned to develop various foams that have an open-cell morphology, volume expansion of 223%&#8211;853%, porosity of 67%&#8211;86%, and compression modulus in the range of 3&#8211;38&#160;MPa. The polymerization process results in a dual crosslinked poly(benzoxazine-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-ester) network composed of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxylamine moieties, alkyl, and &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-aminoester bonds, enabling reversible transesterification dynamic exchanges and mechanical reprocessability, achieving a foam-to-resin reprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dihydrophenazine Derived Pd6L12 Cage: Self&#8208;Assembly, Polyradical Cations, and Lithium Battery Cathode Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we synthesized a dihydrophenazine&#8208;based Pd6L12 coordination cage (Cage 1) with excellent redox activity. It can reversibly transform into its radical cation form (112&#8226;+) via electrochemical or chemical oxidation/reduction. Both forms' structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In situ spectroelectrochemical techniques verified their redox reversibility and electrochromic behavior. Cage 1 was also used as a lithium battery cathode, with its redox behavior studied by in situ 2D EPR.








Abstract
In this study, we present the self&#8208;assembly of a dihydrophenazine&#8208;based Pd6L12&#8208;type coordination cage 1 showing excellent redox activity and demonstrate the use as the cathode for lithium batteries. The structure of cage 1 was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The excellent reversible redox performance of 1 and its electrochromic properties induced by radical species were systematically characterized using in situ UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemistry. Notably, a highly stable radical cationic species 112&#8226;+, containing 12 radical cations, was successfully obtained through the chemical oxidation of 1, and its single&#8208;crystal structure was resolved. The excellent redox properties of 1 enable its application as a cathode material for lithium batteries. The 1|Li cell exhibited good cycling stability, nearly 100% coulombic efficiency, and an initial discharge capacity of 84 mAh g&#8315;&#185; within a voltage range of 2.5&#8211;4.0&#160;V. Furthermore, in situ 2D EPR experiments on lithium batteries visually revealed the excellent cycling stability of the 1&#8208;based cathode material and its reversible two&#8208;step electron transfer process. This study provides important insights into the design, synthesis, and properties of functionalized redox&#8208;active coordination cages, offering a reference for their application in energy storage and functional materials research.

         <title>Whole&#8208;Cell Lysosome SMLM Imaging as Indicators for Functional Diagnostics with a Low&#8208;Phototoxic Spontaneously Blinking Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NIR spontaneously blinking fluorophore, Aze&#8208;HMSiR, optimized for long&#8208;term SMLM imaging of lysosomes is developed. It exhibits superior photostability, pH responsiveness, and minimal phototoxicity. Aze&#8208;HMSiR can reveal key lysosomal characteristics, including distribution, size, and lumen pH, in response to various anticancer agents. Such whole&#8208;cell lysosome SMLM imaging serves as a valuable indicator for lysosomal functional diagnostics.








Abstract
Lysosomal morphology and pH dynamics are key indicators of lysosomal function, making long&#8208;term single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) imaging a promising tool for functional diagnostics. However, phototoxicity often compromises imaging reliability. Here, we develop Aze&#8208;HMSiR, a spontaneously blinking silicon rhodamine probe with near&#8208;infrared excitation, enabling low&#8208;phototoxicity, long&#8208;term (50 min) SMLM imaging of lysosomal morphology and pH dynamics. This probe provides super&#8208;resolution insights into lysosomal distribution, size, and lumen pH, essential for understanding their physiological and pathological roles. Using Aze&#8208;HMSiR, we investigate lysosomal function under acidosis, starvation, and anticancer drug treatments. Among seven tested drugs, periplocoside significantly reduced lysosomal size, while paclitaxel increased pH and altered lysosomal distribution. These findings highlight Aze&#8208;HMSiR as a powerful tool for lysosomal functional diagnostics and drug screening, offering a robust platform for studying lysosomal dynamics in response to physiological and pharmacological perturbations, particularly in cancer therapy.

         <title>Manipulation of Hydrogen Transfer Behaviors by RhCu Alloying Enables an All&#8208;in&#8208;one Sustainable &#8220;Furfural&#8208;Nitrate&#8221; System</title>

         <dc:description>
We report an all&#8208;in&#8208;one electrochemical energy system by coupling the rational conversions from nitrogen&#8208;oxysalts and biomass&#8208;derived&#8208;aldehydes (industrial/agricultural wastes). The poor reaction kinetics are efficaciously optimized by RhCu alloy electrocatalyst with dual&#8208;directional H*&#8208;modulation properties. So, nitrate and furfural can be simultaneously converted into multiple non&#8208;mixed valuable products (NH3, H2, etc.) with electricity output.








Abstract
Nitrate&#160;and furfural are typical wastes mainly from industrialization and agriculturalization progresses, and their clean conversions are still very challenging for a sustainable future. Nevertheless, scant attention has been devoted to the core&#160;issues: the rational integration of two wastes recycling and the targeted manipulation of hydrogen (H*) transfer behaviors to address their sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we report an all&#8208;in&#8208;one electrochemical energy system that is thermodynamically designed by coupling nitrate reduction (NO3RR) and furfural oxidation reactions (FORs) together. Particularly, the poor kinetics for both electrode reactions are efficaciously optimized by the bifunctional electrocatalyst of RhCu alloy nanowires on copper foam (RhCu NW/CF) with highly improved dual&#8208;directional H*&#8208;modulation performances, thus initializing NO3RR for NH3 synthesis at +0.31&#160;V and driving FOR for H2 harvest at an onset potential lower than 0&#160;V. Eventually, such integrated &#8220;Furfural&#8208;Nitrate&#8221; system can simultaneously effectuate the electricity energy supply (10.76&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), wastewater purification, cathodic hydrogen storage (NH3), anodic H2 production, and biomass upgrading. Hence, it provides a promising perspective of &#8220;turning waste into treasure&#8221; in a rational manner, justifying its all&#8208;in&#8208;one property in addressing the global challenge of sustainable energy.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Sulfides Catalyze Rate&#8208;Determining Redox in Fast&#8208;Charging Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals how entropy regulates sulfur utilization and cycling stability in aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries. High&#8208;entropy (HES) catalysts enable optimized Zn&#8211;S redox pathways and structural integrity, achieving high sulfur utilization and stable cycling. In contrast, low&#8208; (LES) and medium&#8208;entropy (MES) catalysts show inefficient reactions with by&#8208;product formation and Mn/Co leaching, degrading performance. Practical validation demonstrates HES&#8208;based pouch cells maintain exceptional stability over 400 cycles at 4 C with merely 0.06% capacity decay per cycle, establishing entropy engineering as a practical design strategy. 








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of the solid&#8211;solid Zn&#8211;S redox process significantly hinders the practical energy density and lifespan of fast&#8208;charging aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries (AZSBs). Conventional low&#8208;entropy catalysts suffer from poor stability, leading to leaching effects and water splitting during cycling. To overcome these limitations, we present a three&#8208;step synthesis of high&#8208;entropy sulfide (HES) nanorod catalysts to accelerate the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the Zn&#8211;S redox process. Operando synchrotron powder diffraction, operando synchrotron infrared reflectance microscopy, and operando Raman spectroscopy characterizations reveal that the HES catalysts improve sulfur utilization by accelerating the RDS conversion of ZnS2 to wurtzite ZnS. Furthermore, near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analyses demonstrate that the HES catalysts effectively suppress the leaching effect of transition metals and water splitting of the aqueous electrolyte, improving cycling stability. In contrast, utilizing medium&#8208; and low&#8208;entropy catalysts results in the formation of by&#8208;products, including S52&#8722;, S32&#8722;, and SO32&#8722; species. Consequently, the pouch cell with the HES catalysts delivers a high cathode energy density of 313&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and high cycling stability over 400 cycles at 4 C with 0.06% capacity decay per cycle. This entropy&#8208;driven catalytic strategy provides an effective approach for developing stable and fast&#8208;charging aqueous metal&#8211;sulfur batteries.

Practical validation demonstrates HES-based pouch cells maintain exceptional stability over 400 cycles at 4 C with merely 0.06% capacity decay per cycle, establishing entropy engineering as a practical design strategy. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sluggish kinetics of the solid&#8211;solid Zn&#8211;S redox process significantly hinders the practical energy density and lifespan of fast-charging aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries (AZSBs). Conventional low-entropy catalysts suffer from poor stability, leading to leaching effects and water splitting during cycling. To overcome these limitations, we present a three-step synthesis of high-entropy sulfide (HES) nanorod catalysts to accelerate the rate-determining step (RDS) in the Zn&#8211;S redox process. Operando synchrotron powder diffraction, operando synchrotron infrared reflectance microscopy, and operando Raman spectroscopy characterizations reveal that the HES catalysts improve sulfur utilization by accelerating the RDS conversion of ZnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to wurtzite ZnS. Furthermore, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analyses demonstrate that the HES catalysts effectively suppress the leaching effect of transition metals and water splitting of the aqueous electrolyte, improving cycling stability. In contrast, utilizing medium- and low-entropy catalysts results in the formation of by-products, including S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; species. Consequently, the pouch cell with the HES catalysts delivers a high cathode energy density of 313&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and high cycling stability over 400 cycles at 4 C with 0.06% capacity decay per cycle. This entropy-driven catalytic strategy provides an effective approach for developing stable and fast-charging aqueous metal&#8211;sulfur batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Spin State Modulation in Spinel Oxides for Enhanced Nonradical Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights a strategy that leverages site&#8208;specific spin state modulation in spinel oxides, which optimizes site&#8208;specific functionalities and enhances the overall nonradical oxidation reaction kinetics by 22&#8208;fold. XAS, magnetism characterization combined with theoretical calculation unveil the establishment of a QSEI that facilitates spin channel for charge transfer and the RDS desorption with a lower&#8208;ICOHP in fine&#8208;tuned spin states.








Abstract
Spinel oxides hold tremendous potential for driving advanced oxidation processes, yet the underlying mechanism for maximizing their activity remains unclear. In this study, we leverage tetrahedral and octahedral site interactions in MnxCo3&#8208;xO4 to modulate the spin states, specifically spin alignment and spin moment, thereby enhancing periodate (PI) activation and catalytic performance in contaminant degradation. Through combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) analyses, we elucidate the role of spin alignment at synergetic tetrahedral and octahedral sites in facilitating quantum spin exchange interactions (QSEI) with an efficient electronic spin channel for charge transfer. Meanwhile, the engineered high spin configuration in CoMn2O4 raises the d&#8208;band center, favoring stable PI* surface complex formation and accelerating the rate&#8208;determining desorption of IO3&#8722; with a lower&#8208;ICOHP value during the catalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin. As a result, the fine&#8208;tuned spin state of CoMn2O4 leads to enhanced overall reaction kinetics, with a 2.5&#8208;fold increase compared to MnCo2O4 and up to 22&#8208;fold increase compared to the octahedrally&#8208;active only catalysts. Such a site&#8208;specific modulation has been found applicable to other spinel oxides, enlightening fine&#8208;tuned electronic structure for maximizing catalytic performance.

         <title>Hierarchically Self&#8208;Assembled Anion&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Driven Gels for Guest Segregation and Electrical Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of gels formed through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of &#8220;aniono&#8221; helicates were developed that can be utilized as filling material in columns and showed the ability to selectively encapsulate and release choline. The host&#8208;guest properties could also be monitored in real time by electrical characterization. This study introduces the concept of flowing a solution containing guests through a host&#8208;containing gel for effective guest separation.








Abstract
The search for macroscopic materials with differentially addressable spaces based on molecular containers has long been driven by their great potential for diverse practical applications pertaining guest selective capture and release. Herein, we report a class of gels (G1&#8208;NH2, G1&#8208;UPy, G2&#8208;NH2, and G2&#8208;UPy) that are formed through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of anion&#8208;coordinated architectures. The well&#8208;defined shapes and sizes of the cavities within anion&#8208;coordinated architectures endow the gels with different internal phases, which is beneficial to differentiate the release profiles of guest molecules (dimethylethanolamine, choline, and propyl trimethylammonium) depending on their binding affinity. This study also introduces the concept of flowing a solution containing guests through a host&#8208;containing gel for effective guest separation. The process of guest binding could be also monitored in real time via electrical characterization. This work may thus provide a useful strategy for selective solid&#8208;phase molecular separation.

         <title>Phenacetin[3]Arenes: Mannich&#8208;Type Macrocyclization, Unique Structure, Versatile Functionalization, and Strong Allosteric Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;step acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation of phenacetin and its analogues with paraformaldehyde provides a facile route to hourglass&#8208;shaped phenacetin[3]arenes with distinct functionalized rims in good yields. These novel macrocyclic arene show excellent binding properties and offer the potential for chirality sensing.








Abstract
This work introduces a novel NAm&#8211;CH&#8322;&#8211;CAr macrocyclization pathway, diverging from the conventional CAr&#8211;CH&#8322;&#8211;CAr linkages prevalent in macrocyclic arenes. This approach involves a one&#8208;pot condensation of &#8208; Phenacetin and its homologs with formaldehyde, yielding phenacetin[3]arenes (Ph[3]s) in yields up to 25.9%. Ph[3] exhibits an unsymmetrical hourglass&#8208;shaped architecture, featuring an upper rim adorned with amide groups and a lower rim comprising an alkoxylbenzene cavity. This unique structure facilitates reversible equilibrium between conformers via benzene ring flipping, which simultaneously reverses the orientation of amide groups, establishing equilibrium between C3 and F conformers. Increasing concentrations of organic ammonium guests lead to a transition from a predominantly 1:1 to 1:2 host&#8211;guest complexation. The estimated binding constants for the 1:1 complexes are in the order of 104&#8211;105&#160;M&#8722;1, the overall binding constants for the 1:2 complexes are greater than 106&#160;M&#8722;2. This stepwise complexation triggers a conformational shift from the C3 to F conformer, demonstrating intriguing allosteric behavior. Furthermore, interactions with chiral guests selectively influence the equilibrium of planar chiral conformers, generating chiroptical responses suitable for chirality sensing applications. The distinct functional groups on the two rims facilitate diverse chemical modifications, including reduction, deprotection, and condensation, providing synthetic flexibility for post&#8208;chemical modifications.

By tuning the rigidity and length of DNA bonds on M&#8208;DNAs, we demonstrate a universal strategy for designing 1D porous crystals with tailored geometries and topologies, enabling advanced catalytic applications.








Abstract
The physicochemical properties of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) porous nanomaterials are fundamentally influenced by their channel geometrical and topological characteristics. However, synthesis of geometrically and topologically diversified 1D porous crystals spanning the mesoporous&#8208;to&#8208;macroporous range remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a universal strategy for constructing 1D open&#8208;channel superlattices through edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge assembly (edge&#8208;bonding) of DNA&#8208;sparsely modified meta&#8208;DNA (M&#8208;DNA). By programming the rigidity and length of sparsely distributed DNA bonds on M&#8208;DNA surfaces, we achieved long&#8208;range ordered assembly of triangular M&#8208;DNA 1D single&#8208;channel superlattice (3.7&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#160;&#181;m) with a macroporous structure. The generality of this approach was further demonstrated by assembling hexagonal M&#8208;DNA into 1D multi&#8208;channel superlattice (3.6&#160;&#177;&#160;1.0&#160;&#181;m) with a mesoporous structure, thereby reducing the pore size from 140 to 29&#160;nm and the porosity from &#8764;94.2 to &#8764;87.5%. Furthermore, an ultrathin gold layer grown on the triangular M&#8208;DNA superlattice exhibited a &#8764;3.3&#8208;fold enhancement in electrocatalytic activity compared to non&#8208;assembled triangular M&#8208;DNA, attributed to the increased surface area and narrower bandgap. This work broadens the design framework for porous crystals assembled via DNA nanotechnology and highlights their potential applications in catalysis, energy conversion, and beyond.

However, synthesis of geometrically and topologically diversified 1D porous crystals spanning the mesoporous-to-macroporous range remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a universal strategy for constructing 1D open-channel superlattices through edge-to-edge assembly (edge-bonding) of DNA-sparsely modified meta-DNA (M-DNA). By programming the rigidity and length of sparsely distributed DNA bonds on M-DNA surfaces, we achieved long-range ordered assembly of triangular M-DNA 1D single-channel superlattice (3.7&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#160;&#181;m) with a macroporous structure. The generality of this approach was further demonstrated by assembling hexagonal M-DNA into 1D multi-channel superlattice (3.6&#160;&#177;&#160;1.0&#160;&#181;m) with a mesoporous structure, thereby reducing the pore size from 140 to 29&#160;nm and the porosity from &#8764;94.2 to &#8764;87.5%. Furthermore, an ultrathin gold layer grown on the triangular M-DNA superlattice exhibited a &#8764;3.3-fold enhancement in electrocatalytic activity compared to non-assembled triangular M-DNA, attributed to the increased surface area and narrower bandgap. This work broadens the design framework for porous crystals assembled via DNA nanotechnology and highlights their potential applications in catalysis, energy conversion, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiple and Alternative Sites Make Tau Protein an Adaptable Sticky Surface for the SH3 Domain of Fyn Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NMR&#8208;based study, combined with computational, calorimetric and in&#8208;cell FRET methods, sheds light on the complex recognition mechanism between the intrinsically disordered protein Tau and the SH3 domain of Fyn kinase, highlighting how the multiple binding sites present in Tau make the protein an adaptable recognition surface that can function even when single consensus motifs are eliminated.








Abstract
The interaction between the microtubule associated protein Tau and the tyrosine kinase Fyn is believed to play a pivotal role in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have identified the SRC Homology 3 (SH3) domain of Fyn as the binding receptor of several proline&#8208;rich motifs in Tau. However, the role of each proline&#8208;rich motif and their interplay in molecular recognition are still unclear. In this work, we investigated the mechanism of Fyn&#8208;SH3 recognition by the multiple PxxP sites inserted within the full&#8208;length Tau protein by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with computational, calorimetric and in&#8208;cell FRET (F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer) methods. Both in vitro and in&#8208;cell experiments revealed no single binding site strictly necessary for the binding. Instead, Fyn&#8208;SH3 contacts full&#8208;length Tau on multiple hot spot regions, located over a distance of 85 residues, through global moderate&#8208;to&#8208;low affinity interactions. Beyond two principal regions containing classical PxxP motifs, we identified a novel non&#8208;canonical binding site at the beginning of the microtubule binding domain. Our study indicates that multiple binding sites in Tau are involved in the interaction, making Tau an adaptable recognition surface that can function when single consensus motifs are deleted.

         <title>High&#8208;Security and High&#8208;Efficiency Information Encryption/Decryption Based on 2D Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskites via Delicate Organic&#8208;Cation Engineering</title>

We develop a unique strategy of information encryption/decryption based on stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescence of 2D hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites via delicate organic&#8208;cation engineering. The facile triple&#8208;key implementation working in multiple switching modes (featuring high contrast and quick response) allows us to achieve high security and readout efficiency, opening a new door to information security based on optical encryption.








Abstract
Optical encryption based on stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescence (SRL) materials has received enormous interest in the field of information security. Metal&#8211;halide perovskites, as a newly emerging SRL material, have shown great potential for confidential information encryption/decryption (InfoED) applications. However, it is rather challenging to ensure high security and achieve high readout efficiency in perovskite SRL&#8208;based InfoED. Herein, we present a unique InfoED strategy using 2D hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites via delicate organic&#8208;cation engineering, benefiting from the high contrast and quick response of their photoluminescence behaviors. Indistinguishably encrypted information can be efficiently decrypted through triple&#8208;key implementation (i.e., ultraviolet&#8208;light irradiation, temperature control, and narrow&#8208;bandpass filtering) that operates in multiple switching modes, enabling us to demonstrate extremely high security by adopting dot&#8208;matrix patterning scenarios that are virtually uncrackable. As a proof of principle, a simple 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 patterning can yield a code dictionary with random variants as high as &#8764;1047, which will take as long as &#8764;1022 years to crack using the hitherto fastest supercomputer, El Capitan. Our perovskite SRL&#8208;based InfoED strategy provides a promising solution for information security based on optical encryption.

         <title>Production of H2O2 via Energy Transfer Photocatalysis by Coupling with Furfuryl Alcohol Conversion over an Amide&#8208;Functionalized Heptazine Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;based photocatalysis can be switched to a novel energy transfer route for efficient and selective 1O2 generation through amide functionalization to modulate the electronic structure of the photocatalyst, thus providing a promising approach for simultaneous synthesis of H2O2 and conversion of a biomass derivative.








Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reduction provides a sustainable approach for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis, but the charge carrier&#8208;based pathway is severely limited by inefficient charge separation and redox decomposition of the produced H2O2. Energy transfer photocatalysis (EnTP) is an alternative charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;free route for H2O2 synthesis. Herein, we propose a strategy of killing two birds with one stone to simultaneously realize the synthesis of H2O2 and conversion of a biomass derivative by coupling EnTP with the Achmatowicz reaction. Results show efficient production of H2O2 at a rate of 14.6&#8201;mmol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1&#160;and an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 44.1% at 420&#8201;nm, coupled with the conversion of biomass&#8208;derived furfuryl alcohol (FFA) into hydroxy&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;3(6H)&#8208;one with a high selectivity of 85.9%. Such a performance was attributed to the efficient EnTP over the amide&#8208;functionalized heptazine framework photocatalyst for singlet oxygen generation, which induces the FFA conversion and concurrently produces H2O2. A systematic study of the photoexcitation process of the catalysts reveals that the amide functionalization significantly improves the intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency, as the structural modification optimizes the electronic structure and thus tunes the composition and distribution of energy bands.

         <title>Antiparallel &#946;&#8208;Sheet as a Key Motif of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Inhibitor Designed via Topological Peptide Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) aggregation requires a peptide&#8208;based approach that accounts for the structural heterogeneity of A&#946;. Here, we employ topological reprogramming via disulfide bonds to stabilize antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheets within the dimeric peptide. This strategy overcomes limitations of linear peptides by creating structured complexes that resist aggregation, offering a novel tactic for tackling AD&#8208;related protein aggregation.








Abstract
Peptide inhibitor design targeting self&#8208;assembly of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) represents a promising strategy for suppressing the pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conventional approaches have primarily mimicked repetitive sequences found in fibrillar structures of A&#946; aggregates. However, since the inherent flexibility of A&#946; structures promotes the structural changes in the early&#8208;stage oligomerization, a structural modulation should be considered in the design of peptide inhibitors. Herein, we introduce topological reprogramming of peptides to control the structural transformation in pathogenic A&#946; 1&#8211;42 (A&#946;42). The eleven&#8208;residue peptide scaffold Pa11 (14HQKLVNFAEDV24) identified through the initial screening was dimerized via a disulfide bond. The dimerization stabilizes A&#946;42 into higher order structures by promoting antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet conformations, thereby significantly suppressing A&#946;42 aggregation. Our approach underscores that modification in peptide connectivity would be a breakthrough for controlling the intrinsic flexibility of A&#946;, surpassing the limitation in conventional, one&#8208;dimensional peptide building block.

The eleven-residue peptide scaffold P&lt;sub&gt;a11&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;HQKLVNFAEDV&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;) identified through the initial screening was dimerized via a disulfide bond. The dimerization stabilizes A&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;42 into higher order structures by promoting antiparallel &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-sheet conformations, thereby significantly suppressing A&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;42 aggregation. Our approach underscores that modification in peptide connectivity would be a breakthrough for controlling the intrinsic flexibility of A&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;, surpassing the limitation in conventional, one-dimensional peptide building block.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revealing the Nature of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Ionic Liquids by Combined Pulse EPR and 19F NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids have been proposed as alternatives to molecular solvents. Here, spin probes and spin&#8208;labelled ILs are studied by pulse electron paramagnetic resonance, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory, revealing the IL interaction sphere. The results challenge previous interpretations of nitroxide&#8208;solvent nanostructuring in ILs.








Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) are a unique class of compounds that have attracted interest for numerous and diverse applications, ranging from solvents for sustainable synthesis to sustainable electrolytes. Understanding their nanostructure and solute&#8208;solvent interactions is a prerequisite to harnessing the full potential of ILs. It has been proposed that ILs solvate non&#8208;polar solutes via their alkyl chains through the formation of nanoscale structures, such as micelles. Here, we determine the non&#8208;covalent interactions responsible for such nanostructuring in ILs. We use pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) NMR, molecular dynamics (MD), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with ILs tailored to probe specific interactions through spin and isotopic labelling. Inter&#8208; and intramolecular cation&#8211;anion interactions are probed by electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and 19F PRE experiments and show that nitroxide solutes associate with the polar domains of the imidazolium cation through weak hydrogen bonding with the imidazolium ring protons, as supported by MD simulations. Thus, this study reveals a less structured nanostructure than a micellar picture might suggest, but with clear IL cation&#8208;solute interactions. Our methodology to reveal nanostructure not only has implications for ILs but is also applicable to other soft matter systems.

         <title>Cytochrome P450 Mediated Cyclohexane Ring Formation in Forazoline Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
FrazP2, a cytochrome P450, catalyzes cyclohexane ring formation in forazoline A, a marine&#8208;derived antifungal from Actinomadura sp. WMMB&#8208;499. Structural and mechanistic studies have uncovered a radical&#8208;mediated cyclization, unlocking opportunities to engineer P450s for the generation of novel antifungal forazoline analogues.








Abstract
Forazoline A, produced by the marine actinomycete Actinomadura sp. WMMB&#8208;499, is a unique PK/NRP hybrid macrolactone with promising antifungal in vivo efficacy through a previously unreported mechanism. Although a PKS/NRPS gene cluster was identified as a candidate for forazoline production, the precise biosynthetic pathway and the functions of the tailoring enzymes remain unclear. In this work, the functions of three cytochrome P450 mono&#8208;oxygenases (FrazP1P2P3) were characterized. Notably, FrazP2 was found to mediate cyclohexane ring formation from an 1,3,6&#8208;triene precursor during forazoline A biosynthesis, as confirmed by genetic and biochemical analysis. To gain structural and mechanistic insight into the activity of FrazP2, the crystal structure of a FrazP2&#8208;substrate complex has been solved at 2.3&#160;&#197; resolution. The molecular dynamics simulations and DFT calculations revealed an unprecedented enzyme&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization reaction by FrazP2. These findings expand our understanding of the catalytic diversity of cytochrome P450s, contributing to the diversification of natural products and enabling the creation of unnatural derivatives with increased antifungal potency.

         <title>Rhodium/Indium Heterobimetallic Alloy as an Effective Catalyst for Reductive C(sp3)&#9472;O Silylation of Ethers with Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we describe the reductive C(sp3)&#9472;O bond silylation of ethers with chlorosilanes and magnesium reductants by cooperative rhodium and indium catalysis. This methodology allows the incorporation of silyl moieties into the C(sp3)&#9472;O bond of various unactivated cyclic and acyclic alkyl ethers using chlorotriorganosilanes. Not only the mixture of rhodium complex with indium reagent but also rhodium nanoparticles supported on indium oxide showed high catalytic activity, indicating a remarkable cooperative effect by the two metals. Notably, in both cases, the generation of rhodium/indium heterobimetallic alloy nanoparticles was revealed by mechanistic studies including XRD, XAS, and TEM imaging.








Abstract
C(sp3)&#9472;O bonds are ubiquitous in natural and synthetic small molecules as well as polymers. The methodology for functionalizing C(sp3)&#9472;O bonds is of great importance for reforming these molecular structures into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks.

         <title>Nucleophilic Covalent Ligands Enable Simultaneous Surface Reconstruction and Passivation of Colloidal InSb Quantum Dots for Stable Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simultaneous surface reconstruction and passivation strategy is designed for indium antimonide (InSb) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) using sulfur&#8208;based nucleophilic covalent ligands. This leads to stable CQD inks and 1450&#160;nm&#8208;operating InSb CQD photodetectors with 28% external quantum efficiency and 300&#160;h operating lifetime.








Abstract
Indium antimonide (InSb) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising candidates for short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors due to their large Bohr exciton radius and tunable bandgap in the 0.6&#8211;1.3&#160;eV range. However, the formation of metal oxides on InSb surfaces during synthesis impedes charge transport, necessitating CQD resurfacing strategies for integration into photodetectors. Previous reports achieved progress in device efficiency by resurfacing these CQDs with acid&#8208;halide sequential treatments, but the device operating stability remains unsatisfactory. Herein, we report a solution&#8208;phase strategy for surface reconstruction and passivation of InSb CQDs using sulfur&#8208;based nucleophilic covalent ligands. We find that short&#8208;chain thiol molecules remove surface metal oxides through nucleophilic attack and enable robust passivation of In and Sb via strong covalent bonds, whereas metal sulfides are less effective at oxide removal and passivation. Consequently, the thiolate&#8208;passivated CQDs exhibit a tenfold decrease in trap state density compared to controls and remain structurally and optically stable for 5 months. We demonstrate InSb CQD SWIR photodetectors that realize a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28% at 1450&#160;nm, with the highest operating stability among reported CQD SWIR photodetectors, retaining 95% of performance following 300&#160;h of biased and illuminated operation.

         <title>Development of an Organoautocatalyzed Double &#963;&#8208;Bond C(sp2)&#8208;N Transamination Metathesis Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organoautocatalyzed transamination metathesis of cyclic tertiary amines is disclosed as a high&#8208;yielding, scalable reaction that proceeds under mild, catalyst&#8208;free conditions. It operates via a multi&#8208;step domino reaction mechanism, where an in situ&#8208;formed pyrrolidinium salt functions as a HBD organoautocatalyst. The reaction opens the door for the efficient synthesis of novel N&#8208;substituted DNDHPs of interest in both life and materials sciences.








Abstract
The transamination reaction, which involves the conversion of one amine to another, traditionally relies on biological enzyme catalysts. Although chemists have recently developed a few transition metal&#8208;catalyzed methods, mimicking these enzymes to interconvert amine groups in acyclic substrates via transamination metathesis of a single C(sp2)&#9472;N bond, transamination of cyclic tertiary amines has remained a challenge in synthetic chemistry. Here, we present the development of organoautocatalyzed transamination metathesis of two C(sp2)&#9472;N bonds in a cyclic substrate that allows for the challenging transformation to take place with up to 95% yield under exceptionally mild reaction conditions at room temperature without external catalysts and/or additives. The reaction mechanism has been studied in detail through time&#8208;resolved 1H&#8208;NMR, 2D NMR, and computational methods. Remarkably, in situ&#8208;formed pyrrolidinium salt acts as a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) organoautocatalyst in this multi&#8208;step domino process. The new organoautocatalyzed methodology gives environmentally friendly, atom&#8208;economical, straightforward, and rapid access to N&#8208;substituted 3,5&#8208;dinitro&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (DNDHPs), thus offering facile entry to privileged bioactive compounds.

         <title>Enantioselective Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Acyclic Esters</title>

         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted esters with aryl bromides is established for the first time by employing P&#8208;chiral monophosphorus ligand 3&#8208;Pent&#8208;BIDIME as a chiral ligand, leading to a series of enantioenriched &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl esters possessing quaternary carbon stereocenters in moderate to good yields and high enantioselectivities. The method features a broad substrate scope, mild conditions, excellent functional group compatibility, and low Pd loadings (as low as 1&#160;mol%). Its synthetic utilities are exemplified by the efficient preparation of a chiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl substituted &#947;&#8208;lactone and the asymmetric synthesis of (R)&#8208;amolanone.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Activation of C&#9472;H Bond in Toluene by Titanium Dioxide&#8208;Supported Subnanometric PtOx Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrocatalytic activation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds in hydrocarbon molecules to produce valuable oxygenates still suffers from the limited generation of reactive species and the weak adsorption of reactants. This study achieved the selective oxidation of toluene using a TiO2 supported subnanometric PtOx cluster (PtOx/TiO2) photoanode via an electrophilic OH*&#8208;mediated pathway. The modification of PtOx cluster can facilitate toluene adsorption and OH* generation, leading to the high efficiency of toluene oxidation.








Abstract
Selective oxidation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds via photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) strategy provides a promising approach to synthesize valuable oxygenates, but the efficiency of this process is still unsatisfactory due to the stable nature of hydrocarbon molecules. Herein, we report the PEC oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde (BA) over a subnanometric PtOx cluster&#8208;loaded TiO2 (PtOx/TiO2) photoanode, achieving BA production rate of 1.75&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8210;2 h&#8210;1 with selectivity of 83.5% in aqueous medium, which is 4.4&#8208;fold higher than that of pristine TiO2. The strategy is also effective for the selective oxidation of toluene derivatives. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we fabricate a self&#8208;powered PEC tandem device with S&#8208;shaped flow channels for the oxidation of toluene, producing BA with a productivity of &#8764;170&#160;&#181;mol under light irradiation. Experimental studies combined with density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the toluene oxidation over PtOx/TiO2 photoanode follow an electrophilic hydroxyl species (OH*)&#8208;mediated pathway, which can suppress the over&#8208;oxidation of BA. Moreover, we reveal that subnanometric PtOx clusters promote toluene adsorption and OH* species generation, leading to the high efficiency of toluene oxidation. This work is expected to broaden the avenue toward the activation of C(sp3)&#9472;H bond under mild conditions in aqueous solution via a sustainable way.

         <title>Modulation of Photoluminescence of BODIHY Dye Using Water&#8208;Soluble Coordination Cages With Different Shapes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorescence of Boron difluoride hydrazone (BODIHY) (G1) dye was effectively controlled through confinement within coordination cages of different shapes. The encapsulation of G1 within a double&#8208;square cage (MC1) resulted in a highly emissive solution, whereas similar confinement within an octahedral cage (MC2) exhibited a weak emission. Moreover, we achieved turn&#8208;on emission of G1 through the displacement of G1 from MC2 to MC1.








Abstract
The confinement of guest molecules within supramolecular hosts can alter their photophysical properties. However, the shapes of the hosts in regulating the guest's emission remains underexplored. Herein, we investigate how the shape of the host alters the emission behavior of boron difluoride hydrazone (BODIHY) (G1) dye encapsulated within two iso&#8208;stoichiometric water&#8208;soluble coordination cages: MC1 (double&#8208;square cage) and MC2 (octahedral cage). Encapsulation of G1 within MC1 results in a highly emissive solution, whereas similar confinement in MC2 leads to a non&#8208;emissive host&#8211;guest solution. A similar trend was observed with different sets of iso&#8208;stoichiometric cages MC3 (double&#8208;square cage) and MC4 (octahedral cage). Using a combination of femtosecond transient absorption and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, we observed that the disparity in fluorescence behavior of BODIHY is attributed to charge transfer interactions between the guest and ligand panels of cages. The shape of the coordination cage dictates the preorganization of the guest within the cavity, thereby suppressing or promoting this charge transfer interactions. Moreover, we demonstrate a turn&#8208;on emission of BODIHY dye due to its preferential binding to a double&#8208;square cage. These findings provide fundamental insights into host&#8208;mediated modulation of the guest's photophysics and offer a blueprint for designing supramolecular systems with tunable emissive behavior.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets for the Assembly of Efficient Membrane Bioreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly method to trap enzymes between covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets instead for the construction of membrane bioreactors. This design boosts mass transfer, shields enzymes from harmful by&#8208;products, and enables rapid substrate conversion (complete in 7.95 s)&#8212;achieving 1018&#215; higher activity than free enzymes. The reactor maintains stability under continuous use and works with diverse enzymes/COFs, offering a versatile platform for high&#8208;performance biocatalysts.








Abstract
Immobilizing fragile enzymes in porous materials holds significant potential for biocatalysis but encounters challenges such as mismatched enzyme size and pore structure of host materials, along with harsh assembly conditions that can denature enzymes. Herein, we present a versatile strategy for constructing membrane bioreactors through water&#8208;mediated, vacuum&#8208;assisted layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets with enzymes. This method effectively addresses pore size limitations, preserves enzyme activity, and promotes convective transport of reactants to active sites, while shielding enzymes from harmful by&#8208;products through rapid transport in continuous membrane catalysis. The optimized bioreactor achieves a 1018&#8208;fold increase in relative activity compared to free enzymes in batch reactions, completing substrate conversion in just 7.95 s, and demonstrating enhanced stability.

         <title>P&#8208;type Cathode Material Design Guided by Material Descriptors for High&#8208;Energy Density Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The material descriptors are first proposed to guide the design and screening of high&#8208;energy density p&#8208;type organic cathode materials. Triphenylamine and synthesized p&#8208;PZA POP proved the rationality of these descriptors. Na||p&#8208;PZA POP batteries exhibit a surprisingly high energy density of 524.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1 and excellent wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance.








Abstract
P&#8208;type organic electrode materials (OEMs) face considerable challenges in constructing high&#8208;energy density sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to their low capacity. To preserve their voltage advantage, developing effective structural design strategies is essential. However, the lack of material descriptors hampers the efficiency of material design and screening. Herein, two material descriptors: the benzene ring/active nitrogen (R/N) ratio and energy density factor (Ef) are established to guide high&#8208;energy density SMB design. As proof of concept, triphenylamine (TPA, 3 R/N ratio and 573.6 Ef value) and a porous organic polymer condensation of triiodotriphenylamine and dihydrophenazine named p&#8208;PZA POP (1.5 R/N ratio and 907.5 Ef value) are chosen. As a result, the p&#8208;PZA POP achieves a high energy density of 524.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1, nearly double that of TPA (273.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1). Remarkably, p&#8208;PZA POP demonstrates excellent wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance from 50&#160;&#176;C (166.2&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A g&#8722;1) to &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C (141.6&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A g&#8722;1). This work establishes a theoretical framework for the rational design and screening of high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type OEMs through predictive material descriptors.

         <title>Bromide as Noninnocent Ligand to Iron Tames Fenton Chemistry for Chemoselective Nondegrading Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report for the first time that the bromide ion, acting as a non&#8208;N&#8208;ligand in iron complexes with the tridentate N&#8208;ligand bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (BMPA), which is traditionally used in Fenton chemistry to degrade organic compounds, tames Fenton chemistry and enables chemo&#8208;selective, nondegrading oxidation reactions. This discovery of the bromide effect bridges the gap between Fenton chemistry and haloperoxidase&#8208;catalyzed halogenation, potentially inspiring further investigation into the &#8220;innocent&#8221; ligands of iron complexes for new reactivity and applications. The overlooked inorganic anion may be exploited in other catalytic systems.








Abstract
It has long been the chemistry dogma that the nitrogen&#8208;based ligand of iron complexes determines the redox reactivity; tetra&#8208; and/or pentadentate nitrogen&#8208;based ligand (N&#8208;ligand: PDP, porphyrin, N4Py) enables chemo&#8208;selective oxidation through high&#8208;valent iron species (FeIV/V&#9552;O), while bi&#8208; and/or tridentate N&#8208;ligand leads to the generation of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) (i.e., hydroxyl radical) via a Fenton chemistry pathway. The effect of inorganic anionic ligands (i.e., halides, pseudohalides, triflate, nitrate, sulfate, etc) of these iron complexes has rarely been examined and overlooked as an &#8220;innocent&#8221; anion. Herein, we report our discovery that bromide (Br&#8722;) is not an innocent ligand to the iron&#8208;BPMA complexes [BMPA: bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine] but a decisive factor for taming the Fenton chemistry (ROS) into a mild [HOBr] oxidant, which allows for chemo&#8208; and regioselective oxidation of furans, indoles, and sulfides without noticeable degradation. In contrast to the conventional Fenton chemistry pathway by many tridentate N&#8208;ligand iron complexes, our [Fe(BMPA)Br3] mimics haloperoxidases to generate HOBr by oxidation of bromide ion with hydrogen peroxide. The discovery of the bromide effect on iron complexes bridges the gap between Fenton chemistry and haloperoxidase&#8208;catalyzed halogenation and might stimulate interest in reinvestigating the &#8220;innocent&#8221; ligand of iron complexes for discovery of new reactivity and new applications. Additionally, the new catalytic system represents a mild and green oxidation method that might be useful in academia and industry.

         <title>Evoking Simultaneous Ferroptosis and Apoptosis by a Dual&#8208;Locked Platinum (IV) Prodrug for Synergistic Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>

A dual&#8208;locked Pt(IV) prodrug combines a TLR7/8 agonist (IMDQ) with a GGT&#8208;responsive moiety. Reduction to Pt(II) triggers GGT&#8208;mediated cleavage of axial ligands, releasing IMDQ to activate immunity. TLR7/8 signaling boosts T&#8208;cell infiltration into tumors and stimulates tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and dendritic cells (DCs). Synergy between platinum chemotherapy and immune activation achieves potent antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
While platinum&#8208;based chemotherapeutics have revolutionized cancer treatment, their clinical potential is limited by off&#8208;target toxicity and restricted antitumor mechanisms. Herein, we introduce a dual&#8208;locked Pt(IV) prodrug designed for tumor&#8208;specific activation, combining platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy with TLR7/8&#8208;mediated immunotherapy. The prodrug features a &#947;&#8208;glutamyl&#8208;caged TLR7/8 agonist as an axial ligand, enabling sequential activation by elevated glutathione (GSH) and &#947;&#8208;glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) in the tumor microenvironment. Reduction of the Pt(IV) core releases cisplatin and depletes intracellular reductants, amplifying reactive oxygen species to trigger synergistic ferroptosis and apoptosis. Concurrently, GGT&#8208;cleaved axial ligand activates tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and dendritic cells, repolarizing immunosuppressive M2&#8208;like macrophages to pro&#8208;inflammatory M1&#8208;like phenotypes while recruiting effector and memory T cells. In murine models, the Pt(IV) prodrug demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy by confining immune activation to malignant tissues, eradicating primary tumors, and establishing durable protective immunity against recurrence. This spatiotemporally controlled dual&#8208;release strategy minimizes systemic toxicity while synergizing chemotherapy and immunotherapy, offering a transformative approach for targeted cancer therapy.

         <title>Synthesis and Modification of Formate Zr&#8208;MOF (ZrFA) Toward Scalable and Cost&#8208;Cutting Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic protocol was developed to scale up ultramicroporous Zr&#8208;MOFs with simple formate, enabling one&#8208;step direct separation of C2H4 from the binary C2H2/C2H4 or ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 gas mixtures with high separation efficiency and cost&#8208;saving preparation.








Abstract
The mass production of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with affordable cost is highly demanding yet limited for commercial applications, e.g., purification of polymer&#8208;grade ethylene (C2H4) via acetylene (C2H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) removal faces the challenge of developing low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale physisorbents with efficiency and recyclability. Herein, we developed a viable synthetic protocol to scale&#8208;up a series of ultramicroporous Zr&#8208;MOFs (ZrFA/ZrFA&#8208;D/ZrFA&#8208;D&#8208;Cu(I)) with the simplest monocarboxylate, formate (FA), through consecutive production by recycling solvent/modulator. Besides a size&#8208;exclusion effect disfavoring C2H4 adsorption, introduction of defective and Cu(I) sites was found to enhance gas affinity and uptake capacity. A comprehensive evaluation of C2H4 separation and economic efficiency has been proposed, suggesting the improvement of C2H2 uptake capacity is effective for the binary C2H2/C2H4 separation, while the separation process of the ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixtures depends on subtle tradeoff of complex factors and limited by challenging CO2/C2H4 separating. Notably, the large&#8208;scale separation has been testified to significantly improve separation efficiency, and the low&#8208;cost preparation benefits high economic efficiency. The distinct C2H2/C2H4/CO2 adsorption mechanism in ZrFA/ZrFA&#8208;D/ZrFA&#8208;D&#8208;Cu(I) has been elucidated by the theoretical calculations. This work may shed a light on the future C2H4 purification technology by pushing MOF&#8208;syntheses toward low&#8208;cost, scale&#8208;up, and recyclable production.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Phase Boundaries Enable Selective Urea Production From Simulated Flue Gas in a Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and NO3&#8315; presents a promising route for sustainable urea production. Here, we show that in situ generated CO2 bubbles within a bi(carbonate) reduction zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer can boost urea selectivity by engendering a high density of triple&#8208;phase boundaries.








Abstract
Renewable energy&#8208;powered co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and NO3&#8722; offers a promising pathway toward sustainable urea production. However, achieving high urea selectivity is challenging due to substantial competing side reactions. Here, we show that engendering a high density of CO2 bubbles on the catalyst surface creates numerous triple&#8208;phase boundaries that are key toward enhancing CO2 versus NO3&#8722; availability for selective urea production. We implemented this strategy using a bipolar membrane in a zero&#8208;gap electrolyzer, which allows for the in situ conversion of (bi)carbonate to CO2 bubbles at the catalyst/electrolyte interface. Notably, we demonstrate that this electrolyzer system can utilize simulated flue gas (20% CO2&#160;+&#160;5% O2) for urea production. With a Cu95Ru5 catalyst, we achieve a urea Faradaic efficiency of 58% at 2&#160;V full&#8208;cell voltage over an extended 30&#8208;h period and a peak production rate of 35.46&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;gcat&#8722;1. Under these conditions, the Faradaic efficiency to hydrogen evolution and nitrate reduction are 14.7% and 21.6%, respectively. Strikingly, these results with simulated flue gas are comparable to previously reported systems that employ pure CO2. Our results introduce a simple yet effective design approach toward developing efficient electrolyzer systems for urea production.

         <title>Activating Surface Oxygen in Ce/Mo&#8208;Doped Ni Oxyhydroxide for Synergistically Enhancing Furfural Oxidation and Hydrogen Evolution at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mo/Ce co&#8208;doped Ni oxyhydroxide was prepared for the electrochemical oxidation of furfural coupled with hydrogen evolution. Mo promotes the adsorption of furfural while Ce promotes the formation of OOH, and the synergistic effect of Ce and Mo leads to an industrial current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at only 1.46&#160;V versus RHE.








Abstract
The integration of biomass&#8208;platform molecule oxidation with water electrolysis is a promising strategy to reduce energy consumption in hydrogen production and obtain high&#8208;value chemicals simultaneously, yet the efficiency of organic oxidation requires further improvement. Herein, we developed a highly efficient Ce, Mo co&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;based (oxy)hydroxide catalyst, where Mo with high spin state promotes the adsorption of furfural (FA), while Ce activates surface lattice oxygen (OL), lowering the energy barrier for OL&#9472;OH coupling to form OOH, the key intermediate for high current densities. The catalyst achieves an industrial&#8208;grade current density of 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a remarkably low potential of 1.46&#160;V versus RHE in furfural oxidation, with exceptional selectivity (99.4%) and Faradaic efficiency (97.7%) for furoic acid. When deployed as anode in an anion&#8208;exchange membrane reactor, the NiMoCe/NF catalyst sustains a current density of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of only 1.85 and 2.15&#160;V, respectively, surpassing most reported continuous flow electrolyzers limited to 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the system exhibits outstanding durability after 200&#160;h of continuous operation. This work provides critical insights into the rational design of catalysts for energy&#8208;efficient biomass valorization coupled with industrial hydrogen production.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of biomass-platform molecule oxidation with water electrolysis is a promising strategy to reduce energy consumption in hydrogen production and obtain high-value chemicals simultaneously, yet the efficiency of organic oxidation requires further improvement. Herein, we developed a highly efficient Ce, Mo co-doped Ni-based (oxy)hydroxide catalyst, where Mo with high spin state promotes the adsorption of furfural (FA), while Ce activates surface lattice oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;), lowering the energy barrier for O&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;OH coupling to form OOH, the key intermediate for high current densities. The catalyst achieves an industrial-grade current density of 1000&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a remarkably low potential of 1.46&#160;V versus RHE in furfural oxidation, with exceptional selectivity (99.4%) and Faradaic efficiency (97.7%) for furoic acid. When deployed as anode in an anion-exchange membrane reactor, the NiMoCe/NF catalyst sustains a current density of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a cell voltage of only 1.85 and 2.15&#160;V, respectively, surpassing most reported continuous flow electrolyzers limited to 200&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the system exhibits outstanding durability after 200&#160;h of continuous operation. This work provides critical insights into the rational design of catalysts for energy-efficient biomass valorization coupled with industrial hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A woven two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic polymer network (CityU&#8208;46) was designed, fabricated, and structurally resolved through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, which revealed a unique, well&#8208;defined two&#8208;over, two&#8208;under interweaving pattern at the molecular level. CityU&#8208;46, serving as an artificial organic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer on the surface of Li metal anodes, demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance in practical lithium metal cells.








Abstract
Macroscopic weaving has been proven to be the most enduring and effective method for manufacturing fabrics to meet the practical needs of humanity for thousands of years. However, the construction of molecular structures with exquisite topologies and specific properties based on molecular weaving is still in its infancy. Herein, we designed and fabricated a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) woven covalent organic polymer (COP) network (named as CityU&#8208;46) driven by the dative N&#8594;B bonds between the 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxa&#8208;borole)benzene (BACT) and 2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (BPT). The complex woven topology of CityU&#8208;46 was determined using a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technique, revealing that it features a well&#8208;defined two&#8208;over and two&#8208;under interweaving pattern at the molecular level. Due to its structural merits, CityU&#8208;46 can be used as an artificial organic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer on the surface of Li metal anodes, significantly improving the stability and long&#8208;term performance of lithium metal cells.

         <title>Nucleophilic Germylation of Stable &#960; Bonds via Ge&#9472;Ge Bond Heterolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermodynamically controlled nucleophilic germylation of stable &#960; bonds was achieved by germyl anion generated in situ via heterolytic cleavage of the Ge&#9472;Ge bond in the presence of KOtBu. This methodology enables unprecedented multiple germylation of alkynes and internally selective germylation of alkenes, affording 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;germylalkanes, 1,1&#8208;digermylalkanes, and 1,1,1&#8208;trigermylalkanes.








Abstract
Organogermanes have recently attracted a great deal of attention as building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive products, drugs, and functional materials. Metallo&#8208;germyls were classically synthesized and employed for nucleophilic germylation to form C&#9472;Ge bonds. However, their syntheses require highly reactive organometal reagents, and the scope of germylations involving metallo&#8208;germyls is limited due to competition with kinetically favored side reactions. Here, we present a regio/stereo&#8208;convergent nucleophilic germylation of stable &#960; bonds by germyl anion generated in situ via heterolytic cleavage of the Ge&#9472;Ge bond of digermane (Ge&#9472;Ge) in the presence of KOtBu. This methodology affords unprecedented reactivity, enabling multiple germylation of alkynes and internally selective germylation of alkenes. These reactions are operationally simple, have broad functional group tolerance, and afford densely functionalized aliphatic organogermanes, such as 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;germylalkanes, 1,1&#8208;digermylalkanes, and 1,1,1&#8208;trigermylalkanes, without any catalyst.

         <title>p&#8211;&#960; Conjugation&#8208;Promoted Electrochemiluminescence of Halogenated Covalent Organic Framework Nanoemitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a series of halogenated COF nanoemitters via a covalent halogenation predesign strategy. The introduction of halogen atoms facilitates p&#8211;&#960; conjugation within COF skeleton, leading to a 49&#8208;fold ECL enhancement compared to nonhalogenated COF. Furthermore, the performance of four partially brominated COFs establishes a positive correlation between the degree of Br doping and ECL intensity.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a kind of promising electrochemiluminescence (ECL) crystalline nanoemitters due to their rapid intrareticular charge transfer and predesigned structures. However, the high polarization of heteroatom&#8208;containing linkages impedes the charge transfer within reticular structures. In this study, we construct a series of halogenated COFs nanoemitters composed of terephthalaldehyde ortho&#8208;substitutions and 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene ligands via a covalent halogenation predesign strategy. The incorporation of covalently bonded halogen atoms promotes a dense electron population in carbon&#8211;carbon antibonding molecular orbitals, thereby facilitating efficient p&#8211;&#960; conjugation within the COF structure. Based on the improved intrareticular charge transfer along carbon skeleton, as evidenced by the Hall effect and terahertz spectroscopy, the brominated COF demonstrates a 49&#8208;fold enhancement in ECL intensity compared to nonhalogenated COF. Furthermore, the performance of four partially brominated COFs establishes a positive correlation between the degree of Br doping and ECL intensity. Beyond the corresponding model compounds, the conjugated frameworks of COFs significantly amplify the halogenation&#8208;induced enhancement effect. This halogenation&#8208;promoted p&#8211;&#960; conjugation in reticular skeleton provides a universal strategy to sensitize crystalline nanoemitters for decoding ECL enhancement mechanism.

         <title>Mechanosensitive Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes for Visualizing Temporal Changes in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanosensitive conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) with integrated twistable bonds enable real&#8208;time imaging of membrane tension in lipid bilayers. Using fluorescence lifetime analysis, COE&#8208;BY probes reveal vesicle rigidity changes during endocytosis, providing insights into membrane mechanics at the subcellular level.








Abstract
Membrane&#8208;intercalating conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) are lipid&#8208;bilayer&#8208;spanning molecules that serve as fluorescent dyes for bioimaging. However, COE emission has thus far only been capable of visualizing dye location and their preferential accumulation in different membrane&#8208;bound intracellular compartments. Herein, we report the first example of environmentally sensitive COEs for visualizing temporal changes in live cells, providing information on the physical properties of intracellular lipid bilayer membranes. The new COE&#8208;BY series is designed around a BODIPY central unit with a membrane&#8208;spanning topology and six cationic pendant groups ensuring solubility in aqueous media. These reporters feature high two&#8208;photon absorption cross section, NIR&#8208;II excitation capabilities under multiphoton excitation, and high dye brightness; all highly desirable photophysical features for bioimaging. The emission lifetime of the probes was sensitive to changes to both the lipid composition of model vesicle systems and membrane tension within cells, induced by either mechanical or osmotic stress. Using two&#8208;photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, it is possible to use the most efficient emitter, namely, COE&#8208;BYPhOC4, to image changes in the mechanical properties of intracellular membranes. We show that these COEs remain stably vesicle&#8208;bound within the endolysosomal pathway over extended periods, allowing for long&#8208;term monitoring of the associated biophysical changes of these vesicles over time.

         <title>Enantioselective Decarboxylative Acylation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids with Carboxylic Acids via Photoredox/Nickel Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective decarboxylative acylation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid derivatives with carboxylic acids has been developed, enabling efficient access to enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;oxygenated ketones. This method exhibits a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, high chemoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling has emerged as a pivotal platform for constructing C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) bonds in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. However, using two structurally dissimilar carboxylic acids as a feedstock to form chiral &#945;&#8208;oxygenated ketones remains a considerable challenge due to side reactions such as decarboxylative reduction and homocoupling. Herein, we report for the first time a photoredox/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective decarboxylative acylation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid derivatives and aliphatic carboxylic acids, enabling efficient access to enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;oxygenated ketones. This method exhibits a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, high chemoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% e.e.). The advantage of this reaction is that it eliminates the need for metal reductants and the use of precious metal photocatalysts and utilizes renewable feedstocks. The use of a coiled&#8208;tube continuous&#8208;flow photoreactor can shorten the illumination time by half and obtain results comparable to those of a batch reaction. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic experiments support a pathway in which photocatalytic decarboxylation generates &#945;&#8208;oxy alkyl radical species, and the Ni(I)&#8211;alkyl intermediate activates the in situ&#8211;formed mixed anhydride followed by reductive elimination to give the product in enantiomerically pure form.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Blind UV Organic Mechanoluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to achieve solar&#8208;blind UV mechanoluminescent (ML) materials through strategically breaking the molecular conjugation and adjusting the packing mode. DPO3C and DPO4C exhibited solar&#8208;blind UV emission with the maxima at ca. 293&#160;nm, with wide&#8208;range color&#8208;tunable ML emissions from 293 to 741&#160;nm via host&#8211;guest doping. This study also paves the way for advancements in bright&#8208;field stress visualization.








Abstract
Organic mechanoluminescent (ML) materials have attracted intensive attention for their potential applications in real&#8208;time stress sensing and structural damage monitoring. To avoid interference from daylight or artificial lighting sources, the ML&#8208;based sensors can be only used in dark&#8208;field scenarios, which becomes the most serious limitation for their development. Herein, we proposed a new strategy that adjusts the ML spectra to the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) region to address this challenge. By strategically breaking the molecular conjugation and adjusting the packing mode, a series of diphenylphosphine oxide derivatives were successfully designed. To our delight, the shortest ML emission, among all reported organic ML materials, with the maxima at ca. 293&#160;nm (in solar&#8208;blind UV region) was achieved. Photophysical studies, single crystal analysis, and theoretical calculations were performed to investigate the solar&#8208;blind UV ML properties. Furthermore, wide&#8208;range color&#8208;tunable ML emissions spanning from 293 to 741&#160;nm were achieved. Under various external stimuli such as stretching, folding, and vehicle impact in daylight, obvious ML signals could be directly recorded, and the quantitative relationship between the mechanical stimuli and the ML intensities was also studied. This work suggests a feasible strategy to realize solar&#8208;blind UV ML materials and makes bright&#8208;field environment ML sensors possible.

         <title>Harnessing Negative Photochromism in Styryl Cyanines for Light&#8208;Modulated Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show how photo switchable styryl cyanines undergo an extremely efficient photochemical ring&#8208;closing reaction upon irradiation. Furthermore, substituents on the ring and the nature of their surroundings can be used to tune their chemistry, kinetics, and photochemical properties. Finally, we demonstrate how these molecules can be used as smart dopants to control proton transport using light in a polymeric matrix.








Abstract
Efficient photoswitches capable of complete conversion to their metastable isomer are not so common, yet highly desirable for applications in smart materials and devices. Here, we report the photochromic behavior of a series of styryl cyanine photoswitches, all demonstrating high switching efficiency, with some achieving full conversion to the metastable form. Despite structural similarities to spiropyran photoswitches, we demonstrate that the photochemistry of styryl cyanines is fundamentally different. Unlike classical photoswitches that rely on double&#8208;bond rotation, these molecules undergo substantial geometric changes via the formation of a spiro carbon. This transformation disrupts conjugation, causing a desirable blue shift in absorbance ideal for creating responsive materials and devices. We further show that the switching kinetics can be finely tuned through electronic effects of various substituents or the choice of surrounding medium. These photoswitches exhibit excellent fatigue resistance and can be easily shifted into the visible region via their acidochromic properties. Taking advantage of their high switching efficiency and affinity for acidic polymers, we finally propose their use as smart dopants to develop light&#8208;responsive materials with tunable proton transport properties under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Beyond Second Coordination Shell: Long&#8208;Range &#960;&#8208;Electrons Delocalization Engineering in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) depend on hierarchical coordination environments, yet higher&#8208;order shells (&gt;2nd) critically influence electronic structures via long&#8208;range charge delocalization. This study pioneers long&#8208;range interaction engineering in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for CO2 electroreduction. By tailoring pyrolysis of NiTPP to preserve Ni&#8208;N4 coordination shell (first and second) while eliminating peripheral &#960;&#8208;delocalization, the catalyst achieves a 29&#8208;fold CO efficiency boost (85.9% at &#8722;1.4&#160;V) and 98.3% selectivity at 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Although long&#8208;range charge delocalization beyond the second coordination shell critically influence the geometric and electronic properties of single&#8208;atom active sites, their systematic modulation to enhance multielectron catalytic processes remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a site&#8208;specific strategy to engineer the nickel tetraphenylporphyrin (NiTPP) precursors by selectively cleaving carbon&#8211;carbon single bonds at the &#946;&#8208;carbon sites. This approach preserves the Ni&#8208;centered first and second coordination shells while systematically removing peripheral &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization in extended coordination environments. The resultant Ni&#8208;N4 catalyst exhibits a 29&#8208;fold enhancement in CO faradaic efficiency at &#8722;1.4&#160;V versus RHE compared to original counterparts. Notably, it maintains 98.3% CO selectivity at industrial&#8208;grade current densities up to 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in flow cell. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the electron&#8208;enriched Ni sites, arising from precisely regulated charge delocalization in higher coordination shells, facilitate stabilization of the critical *COOH intermediate. Our findings establish a paradigm for advanced catalyst design through deliberate engineering of higher coordination shells.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Asymmetric Molecular Engineering Enables Regioregular Selenium&#8208;Substituted Acceptor with High Efficiency and Ultra&#8208;low Energy Loss in Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
The synergistic strategies of the double asymmetric core and symmetric/asymmetric terminal engineering are applied to develop multiple&#8208;asymmetric acceptors. By delicately tuning the number and position of peripheral F and Cl atoms, the regioregular triple&#8208;asymmetric TASe&#8208;2F2Cl&#8208;based binary OSCs yield the first&#8208;class efficiency of 19.32% and ultralow nonradiative recombination energy loss (&#916;E3) among selenium&#8208;substituted acceptors. 








Abstract
Asymmetric molecular engineering is utilized for developing efficient small molecular acceptors (SMAs), whereas adopting multiple asymmetric strategies at the terminals, side chains, and cores of efficient SMAs remains a challenge, and effects on reducing energy loss (Eloss) have been rarely investigation. Herein, four regioregular multiple&#8208;asymmetric SMAs (DASe&#8208;4F, DASe&#8208;4Cl, TASe&#8208;2Cl2F, and TASe&#8208;2F2Cl) are constructed by delicately manipulating the number and position of F and Cl on end groups. Triple&#8208;asymmetric TASe&#8208;2F2Cl not only exhibits a unique and most compact 3D network crystal stacking structure but also possesses excellent crystallinity and electron mobility in neat film. Surprisingly, the PM1:TASe&#8208;2F2Cl&#8208;based binary organic solar cells (OSCs) yield a champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.32%, surpassing the PCE of 18.27%, 17.25%, and 16.30% for DASe&#8208;4F, DASe&#8208;4Cl, and TASe&#8208;2Cl2F&#8208;based devices, which attributed to the optimized blend morphology with proper phase separation and more ordered intermolecular stacking and excellent charge transport. Notably, the champion PCE of 19.32% with ultralow nonradiative recombination energy loss (&#916;E3) of 0.179&#160;eV marks a record&#8208;breaking result for selenium&#8208;containing SMAs in binary OSCs. Our innovative multiple&#8208;asymmetric molecular engineering of precisely modulating the number and position of fluorinated/chlorinated end groups is an effective strategy for obtaining highly&#8208;efficient and minimal &#916;E3 of selenium&#8208;substituted SMAs&#8208;based binary OSCs simultaneously.

         <title>Stereocontrol in Conformationally Stable C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) Atropisomers</title>

         <dc:description>
Building in our expertize in the synthesis of trans&#8208;dihydrobenzofurans via organocatalyzed domino Michael/O&#8208;cyclization between &#946;&#8208;naphthols and nitroalkenes, we developed an efficient strategy to access a new family of atropisomers bearing a conformationally stable C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) bond and two stereogenic centers through simple and highly diastereoselective alkylation of dihydrofurans with structurally diverse electrophiles. This crucial step places the nitro group in a relative cis&#8208;configuration with respect to the aromatic moiety, effectively increasing the barrier to diastereomerization and stabilizing the molecular conformation.








Abstract
We report a two&#8208;step sequence for the enantioselective construction of a rare family of stable C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) atropisomers featuring two additional stereogenic centers. The process begins with an organocatalyzed dihydrobenzofurannulation that establishes and controls the stereochemistry of two carbon centers, followed by a highly diastereoselective functionalization that significantly enhances the barrier to diastereomerization of the C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) bond, effectively locking and stabilizing its configuration.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Desolventization and Lithium&#8208;Rich Sites for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Anodes</title>

A hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework with lithiophilic sites and hydrogen bond interaction with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) can accelerate the desolvation process of lithium ion and guide the rapid and uniform deposition of Li+.








Abstract
Effectively managing Li+ migration behaviors and addressing the issues of side reactions at the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interface is crucial for advancing high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, this work introduces a two&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) enriched with multi&#8208;site H&#8208;bonding and lithiophilic sites for the first time to tailor the electronic structure and solvation chemistry in lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) based electrolyte and stabilize the lithium metal anodes (LMAs) interface. Initially, the abundant lithiophilic sites (C&#9552;O, C&#9552;N) in the HOF coordinate with Li+, acting as key electron donors to optimize the electronic structure while also reducing the desolvation energy barrier when Li+ dissociates from the solvent sheath. Moreover, the multifunctional hydrogen bonding not only acts as the &#8220;appended manipulator&#8221; to anchor &#8208;NH2 to LiTFSI and reduces the adverse reactions at the LMAs interface but also mitigates the mechanical stress during lithium deposition. As evidenced by various in/ex situ characterizations, the HOF&#8208;modified lithium&#8208;metal symmetric batteries exhibit ultra&#8208;long cycling performance (11&#160;000&#160;h) and low voltage fluctuations at 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This unique strategy of hydrogen&#8208;bonded synergistic lithiophilic sites provides a new perspective on the design of artificial interfacial layers for stabilizing lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Thioamides Adjacent to the Ionizable Amine Headgroup in Ionizable Lipids Reduce the pKa of Lipid Nanoparticles and Enhance mRNA Transfection Efficiency in Vitro and in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing an ionizable lipid with a thioamide adjacent to the tertiary amine have a lower pKa than those containing an analogous lipid with a conventional amide, and exhibit significantly improved mRNA transfection efficiency both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently the most clinically advanced mRNA delivery vectors. However, optimizing LNPs for in vivo applications remains largely empirical. The apparent pKa of LNPs is a predictive factor for in vivo performance, with pKa values between 6 and 7 showing the highest efficacy. Despite this critical role of ionizable lipids in LNPs, the relationship between lipid structure and its influence on LNP pKa remains poorly studied. In this study, we report the design and the synthesis of a novel class of ionizable lipids featuring a thioamide moiety, enabling direct comparison between thioamide&#8208;containing (SAM) LNPs and amide&#8208;containing (OAM) LNPs. We find that substituting oxygen with sulfur in the amide group significantly decreases the apparent pKa of LNPs, increasing the likelihood of identifying lipids in combinatorial libraries that yield LNPs with a pKa in the desired 6&#8211;7 range. The reduction in pKa in LNPs containing SAM lipids, compared with OAM lipids, is attributed to the increased hydrophobicity of the thioamide group. Furthermore, by synthesizing multiple libraries of SAM lipids and varying the ionizable head group, alkyl chains, and linker length, we discovered thioamide lipids with distinct tissue tropism, including lipids that mediate splenic targeting by LNPs.

         <title>Regulated Second&#8208;sphere Coordination in Amorphous Metal&#8208;organic Framework for Efficient CO2 Fixation</title>

Second&#8208;sphere coordination regulation strategy is employed by atomically tailoring the metal&#8211;metal coordination of the secondary building unit (SBU), with efforts to trigger more orbital interactions with guest molecules. Amorphous metal&#8208;organic framework (a&#8208;MOF) is chosen to transform rigid trinuclear nodes into flexible dinuclear motifs. Such architecture with clear and unique second&#8208;sphere interaction can open spatial proximity to access the guest molecule and optimize s&#8211;&#960;* overlap by enabling orbital reorientation.








Abstract
The endeavor toward photocatalytic CO2 fixation is largely hampered by the rigid spatial configurations and inadequate orbital overlap between the catalytic site and CO2. Herein, we propose a second&#8208;sphere coordination regulation strategy by atomically tailoring the metal&#8211;metal coordination of the secondary building unit (SBU). Amorphous metal&#8208;organic framework (a&#8208;MOF) is constructed as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to achieve creative control over the second coordination sphere. Such architecture transforms rigid trinuclear nodes into flexible dinuclear motifs. This shift can open spatial proximity to access the guest molecules and optimize s&#8211;&#960;* overlap by enabling orbital reorientation. Both in situ experiments and theoretical calculations verify second&#8208;sphere engineering endows the Lewis base sites with high electron donating capacity and promotes the electron injection into the &#960;* anti&#8208;bonding orbitals of the CO2 molecule effectively. Hence, the a&#8208;MOF displays approximately double the yield in various photocatalytic CO2 reactions compared with its crystalline counterpart. Moreover, its photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;CO2 battery delivers higher discharging voltage and a fourfold increment of discharge capacity at 200&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2. The unique ability to tailor the secondary coordination sphere performs attractive merits governing the small molecule binding affinity, aiming to manipulate the local microenvironment of open metal sites for efficient CO2 fixation.

         <title>Unlocking One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction via Metalloid Boron&#8208;Modified Zn3In2S6 for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst is engineered, featuring In&#8208;B dual&#8208;active sites that establish dual&#8208;channel carrier transfer pathways and substantially prolong photogenerated carrier lifetimes five&#8208;fold. These synergistic effects enable direct one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR for efficient H2O2 production from O2 in pure water, achieving a record apparent quantum yield of 49.8% at 365&#160;nm among inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts.








Abstract
The indirect two&#8208;step two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) dominates photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis but suffers from sluggish kinetics, &#8226;O2&#8722;&#8208;induced catalyst degradation, and spatiotemporal carrier&#8208;intermediate mismatch. Herein, we pioneer a metal&#8208;metalloid dual&#8208;site strategy to unlock the direct one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR pathway, demonstrated through boron&#8208;engineered Zn3In2S6 (B&#8208;ZnInS) photocatalyst with In&#8208;B dual&#8208;active sites. The In&#8208;B dual&#8208;site configuration creates a charge&#8208;balanced electron reservoir by charge complementation, which achieves moderate O2 adsorption via bidentate coordination and dual&#8208;channel electron transfer, preventing excessive O&#9472;O bond activation. Simultaneously, boron doping induces lattice polarization to establish a built&#8208;in electric field, quintupling photogenerated carrier lifetimes versus pristine ZnInS. These synergies redirect the O2 activation pathway from indirect to direct 2e&#8722; ORR process, delivering an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 3121&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2)&#8212;an 11&#8208;fold enhancement over ZnInS. The system achieves an unprecedented apparent quantum yield of 49.8% at 365&#160;nm for H2O2 photosynthesis among inorganic semiconducting photocatalysts, and can continuously produce medical&#8208;grade H2O2 (3&#160;wt%). This work provides insights for designing efficient H2O2 photocatalysts and beyond.

         <title>Dinitrogen Activation with Low&#8208;Valent Strontium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although computationally predicted, N2 activation with an in situ generated low&#8208;valent &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) SrI precursor did not result in a stable complex. First dinitrogen fixation with Sr was achieved using a heterobimetallic approach. This highly reducing product vigorously reacts with Teflon.








Abstract
DFT calculations on &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) complexes with the full series of alkaline&#8208;earth (Ae) metals show that (BDI)AeAe(BDI) complexes of the heavier Ae metals (Ca, Sr, Ba) have long weak Ae&#9472;Ae bonds that are prone to homolytic bond cleavage. However, isolation of (BDI)Sr(&#956;&#8208;N2)Sr(BDI) with a side&#8208;on bridging N22&#8722; dianion should thermodynamically be feasible. Attempts to stabilize such a complex with the super bulky BDI* ligand failed (BDI*&#160;=&#160;HC[(Me)C&#160;=&#160;N&#8208;DIPeP]2, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Et2CH&#8208;phenyl). First, N2 fixation with a Sr complex was enabled by a heterobimetallic approach. Reduction of (DIPePNN)Sr with potassium gave (DIPePNN)2Sr2K2(N2) (6&#8208;Sr); DIPePNN&#160;=&#160;DIPePN&#8208;Si(Me)2CH2CH2Si(Me)2&#8208;NDIPeP. A similar Ca product was also isolated (6&#8208;Ca). Crystal structures reveal a N22&#8722; anion with side&#8208;on bonding to Ae2+ and end&#8208;on coordination to K+. DFT calculations and Atoms&#8208;In&#8208;Molecules analyses show mainly ionic bonding. Both 6&#8208;Ae complexes are synthons for hitherto unknown (BDI*)AeAe(BDI*) (Ae&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr) and react by releasing N2 and two electrons. Although surprisingly stable in benzene, the reduction of I2 and H2 is facile. Fast reaction with Teflon led to formation of crystalline [(DIPePNN)SrKF]2 (7), which is labile and decomposed to KF and (DIPePNN)Sr. Latter reactivity underscores potential use of 6&#8208;Ae complexes as very strong, hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble reducing agents.

         <title>Selective CO Electroreduction to Multicarbon Oxygenates Over Atomically Dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag Sites in Alkaline Membrane Electrode Assembly Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag sites on the catalyst surface promote the *OH cleavage of *COCOH toward *COO, thereby enhancing the selectivity of C2+ oxygenates from CO electroreduction. CO electrolysis over the optimized CuAg catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 71.4% for C2+ oxygenates at a current density of 2.5&#160;A cm&#8722;2 in alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer.








Abstract
Electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) to produce multicarbon (C2+) oxygenates using renewable electricity is a promising carbon utilization pathway. However, the performance of this process suffers from low C2+ oxygenates selectivity and insufficient current density. Here, we employed a Cu&#8211;Ag bimetallic strategy to enhance the selectivity of C2+ oxygenates from CORR in alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer at ampere&#8208;level current densities. The Cu&#8211;Ag catalysts prepared by magnetron sputtering feature atomically dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag sites on the catalyst surface, which are key to promoting the formation of C2+ oxygenates. Increasing Ag content favors C2+ oxygenates formation while inhibiting ethylene production. The optimized Cu2Ag catalyst achieved Faradaic efficiency of 71.4% for C2+ oxygenates at 2.5&#160;A cm&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;Atomically dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag sites on the catalyst surface promote the *OH cleavage of *COCOH toward *COO, thereby enhancing the selectivity of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; oxygenates from CO electroreduction. CO electrolysis over the optimized CuAg catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 71.4% for C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; oxygenates at a current density of 2.5&#160;A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) to produce multicarbon (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) oxygenates using renewable electricity is a promising carbon utilization pathway. However, the performance of this process suffers from low C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; oxygenates selectivity and insufficient current density. Here, we employed a Cu&#8211;Ag bimetallic strategy to enhance the selectivity of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; oxygenates from CORR in alkaline membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer at ampere-level current densities. The Cu&#8211;Ag catalysts prepared by magnetron sputtering feature atomically dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag sites on the catalyst surface, which are key to promoting the formation of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; oxygenates. Increasing Ag content favors C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; oxygenates formation while inhibiting ethylene production. The optimized Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag catalyst achieved Faradaic efficiency of 71.4% for C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; oxygenates at 2.5&#160;A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In situ spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations revealed that atomically dispersed Cu&#8211;Ag sites on the catalyst surface promote the dissociation of *COCOH to *CCO, thus favoring C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; oxygenates formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Valence Tautomerism and Alkaline Properties of Global Aromatic Imine&#8208; and Methine&#8208;Bridged all&#8208;Benzenoid Macrocyclic Superpyrazine and Supertriazine</title>

We prepared two imine macrocycles, SPAZ and STAZ, as analogues of 1,4&#8208;pyrazine and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine, respectively. SPAZ and STAZ exhibit Br&#248;nsted basicity with pKa values of 0.97 and 3.27, respectively. Notably, we elucidate their unprecedented valence tautomerism between &#8220;super&#8208;Kekul&#233;&#8221; benzenoid/quinoidal structures and a &#8220;super&#8208;sextet&#8221; transient structure, facilitated by aza[30]annulene pathways.








Abstract
The comprehensive understanding of the ground&#8208;state electronic structures of all&#8208;benzenoid macrocycles and their charged species, particularly those exhibiting global (anti)aromaticity, remains poorly resolved. Here, we present two imine&#8208; and methine&#8208;bridged all&#8208;benzenoid [6]cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylenes SPAZ (superpyrazine) and STAZ (supertriazine)&#8208;designed as &#960;&#8208;extended analogues of 1,4&#8208;pyrazine and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine, respectively. For the first time, we elucidate their unprecedented valence tautomerism between &#8220;super&#8208;Kekul&#233;&#8221; alternating benzenoid/quinoidal structures and a &#8220;super&#8208;sextet&#8221; transient structure, mediated by a 30&#960; azaannulene conjugated pathway. The aromatic stabilization energy of global aromatic delocalization would partially counterbalance the energy penalty for disrupting three benzenoid sextets. Further protonation studies demonstrate their alkaline characteristics (pKa&#160;=&#160;0.97 for SPAZ; 3.27 for STAZ), with diprotonated SPAZ&#8208;DH and monoprotonated STAZ&#8208;MH adopting planarized geometries that amplify global aromaticity through charge&#8208;induced structural constraints and enhanced &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. Notably, two&#8208;electron reduction generates a dianion SPAZ&#8208;DA exhibiting 32&#960; electron global antiaromaticity with amine N atom embedded aza[30]annulene pathway. These findings establish a framework for decoding electronic structure property relationships in all&#8208;benzenoid macrocycles, offering insights into aromaticity modulated regulations through tautomerism, protonation, and redox switching.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric &#946;&#8208;Selective Hydroamination of Enamides for the Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Diamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Internal enamides were found to undergo enantioselective hydroamination catalyzed by a cationic iridium complex. An amide group effectively directs the catalyst to achieve unconventional &#946;&#8208;regioselectivity with up to 99% ee. This coordination assistance strategy creates an efficient pathway for synthesizing valuable enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;diamine derivatives.








Abstract
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective hydroamination of electron&#8208;rich alkenes has been developed. The coordination assistance of the amide group to the metal center effectively overrides the inherent electronic preference of N&#9472;H addition to an enamide, delivering unconventional &#946;&#8208;selectivity. Phthalimide is utilized as a readily removable amination agent. This methodology enables direct access to enantio&#8208;enriched 1,2&#8208;diamines from readily available materials with 100% atom economy, exclusive regioselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee).

         <title>Design of Intrinsically Stable Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers by Introducing Fused&#8208;Ring Intramolecular Donor&#8211;Acceptor Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we develop a novel SAM molecular design strategy by introducing fused&#8208;ring intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interactions. The designed molecule, JJ32, features a benzo[5,6][1,4]thiazino[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline skeleton, where strong D&#8211;A interactions enhance charge delocalization and downshift the LUMO energy level. This leads to enhanced photostability, redox stability, and intermolecular interactions. Moreover, the improved redox stability benefits the promising polyoxometalate/SAM composite HSL, allowing the JJ32/HPWO&#8208;based OSC to reach 19.85% efficiency with improved stability.








Abstract
Hole&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) incorporating electron&#8208;donating conjugated units as head groups have witnessed remarkable success in helping achieve high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). However, these molecules frequently exhibit a shallow lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level, rendering them prone to photodegradation.&#160;To tackle this problem, we introduce fused&#8208;ring intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interactions into the design of SAM molecules to downshift the LUMO level. The resultant molecule, JJ32, shows both enhanced photostability and intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, the fused&#8208;ring intramolecular D&#8211;A interactions also help stabilize the radical cation state of JJ32 to result in significantly improved redox stability. This enables them to be included in polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based composite hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs), resulting in an impressive efficiency of 19.85% alongside significantly enhanced stability in corresponding OSCs. This study not only validates the concept of using fused&#8208;ring D&#8211;A&#8208;structure SAMs to improve the efficiency and stability of OSCs but also elucidates the relationship between SAM structures and POM doping behaviors to provide an effective strategy in designing intrinsically stable SAM molecules for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Effective Hole Utilization for Atomically Dispersed Low&#8208;Coordination Molybdenum Accelerating Photocatalytic C&#9472;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed low&#8208;coordination Mo on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets has been successfully developed for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols. The isolated Mo sites optimize the driving force of photogenerated holes, which greatly accelerates the electron transfer rate of the alkoxy C&#9472;H bonds, resulting in the formation of high&#8208;concentration alkyl radicals.








Abstract
Photocatalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols offers a promising strategy to produce the corresponding carbonyl compounds and clean fuel H2. However, the sluggish kinetics of the alkoxy C&#9472;H bond cleavage attributes to the inefficient utilization of photogenerated holes greatly restricts the photocatalytic activity. Here we develmically dispersed low&#8208;coordination Mo on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets that can greatly accelerate photocatalytic C&#9472;H activation. An internal quantum efficiency of 45.2% at 400&#160;nm together with 99% benzaldehyde (BAD) selectivity is achieved using benzyl alcohol (BA) as a model substrate. Extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the low&#8208;coordination Mo tunes the local atomic configuration of highest occupied molecular orbital to trap holes produced under photoexcitation within picoseconds. Moreover, the incorporated site&#8208;specific Mo greatly improves the lifetime and diffusion length of photogenerated holes and optimizes the driving force of alkoxy C&#9472;H activation, which are responsible for the excellent performance. This work marks a significant stride to enhance the utilization efficiency of holes for promoting photocatalytic C&#9472;H activation.

     alt="Effective Hole Utilization for Atomically Dispersed Low-Coordination Molybdenum Accelerating Photocatalytic C&#9472;H Activation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically dispersed low-coordination Mo on ultrathin ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets has been successfully developed for acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols. The isolated Mo sites optimize the driving force of photogenerated holes, which greatly accelerates the electron transfer rate of the alkoxy C&#9472;H bonds, resulting in the formation of high-concentration alkyl radicals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols offers a promising strategy to produce the corresponding carbonyl compounds and clean fuel H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, the sluggish kinetics of the alkoxy C&#9472;H bond cleavage attributes to the inefficient utilization of photogenerated holes greatly restricts the photocatalytic activity. Here we develmically dispersed low-coordination Mo on ultrathin ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets that can greatly accelerate photocatalytic C&#9472;H activation. An internal quantum efficiency of 45.2% at 400&#160;nm together with 99% benzaldehyde (BAD) selectivity is achieved using benzyl alcohol (BA) as a model substrate. Extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the low-coordination Mo tunes the local atomic configuration of highest occupied molecular orbital to trap holes produced under photoexcitation within picoseconds. Moreover, the incorporated site-specific Mo greatly improves the lifetime and diffusion length of photogenerated holes and optimizes the driving force of alkoxy C&#9472;H activation, which are responsible for the excellent performance. This work marks a significant stride to enhance the utilization efficiency of holes for promoting photocatalytic C&#9472;H activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strain Energy Induced Rotary Speed Acceleration in a Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy accelerates rotary speed in overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motors by tuning cycloparaphenylene loop size, preserving core structures. Strain energy variations drive hierarchical acceleration up to 389&#8208;fold. This study systematically reveals motor behavior under strain, offering new avenues for engineering light&#8208;driven nanomachines.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven molecular motors based on overcrowded alkenes represent a major type of molecular machines that are able to rotate unidirectionally. The regulation of the rotary speed without altering the core structure of a motor is crucial and remains a major challenge. In the present study, we reported that the rotary speed of molecular motors can be significantly enhanced by harnessing the strain energy of cycloparaphenylene (CPP). A series of molecular motors incorporated in CPP with varying sizes were synthesized, and their photochemical and thermal isomerization behaviors were meticulously examined using UV&#8211;vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The remarkable increase of the acceleration effect of the rotary speed with decreasing macrocycle sizes, up to 389&#8208;fold, can be attributed to the strain energy induced bending in the stator part, which reduces steric hindrance in the &#8220;fjord region&#8221; of the molecule, supported by a detailed computational study employing density functional theory. This work provides systematic insight into the behavior of molecular motors under strain energy, thereby paving the way for the application of motor&#8208;incorporating CPPs as a general strategy to accelerate the rotary speed of molecular motors.

         <title>Tri&#8208;Coordinated Boron Species in Confined Boron Oxide Catalysts for Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confined BOx@SiO2 with highly dispersed BOx species was synthesized by the in situ transformation of BN@SiO2, which showed a remarkable activity of a unique C3H8 conversion uprush increasing from 5.3% at 410&#160;&#176;C to 28.4% at 424.6 &#176;C for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The key for the efficient C3H8 activation was the increased amount of tri&#8208;coordinated B&#9472;OH derived from the dispersion of molten BOx species within spatially confined SiO2.








Abstract
Boron&#8208;based catalysts exhibit great potential for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce olefins. The straightforward synthesis of confined boron&#8208;based catalysts commonly using H3BO3 is intractable because of its abundant hydroxyl groups easily interacting with the supports in a spatially nonselective manner. Herein, we managed to construct a confined BOx@SiO2 catalyst showing an impressive low&#8208;temperature (400 &#176;C) activity. This catalyst was prepared via the encapsulation of BN nanosheets by SiO2 shell and subsequent oxidization steps. The in situ generated boron&#8211;oxygen species were anchored to silica shells via B&#9472;O&#9472;Si and hydrogen bonds. BOx@SiO2 exhibited a unique catalytic behavior of propane conversion uprush, increasing from 5.3% at 410 &#176;C to 28.4% at 424.6 &#176;C for ODHP reaction. That was attributed to the efficient activation of propane triggered by the newly formed tri&#8208;coordinated B&#9472;OH (B[3]a and B[3]b) active sites from the dispersion of molten BOx species in confined SiO2. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that in the confined structure, the bond angles of O&#9472;B&#9472;O and B&#9472;O&#9472;B and system disorder of BOx species increased significantly in molten state, favoring the dispersion of BOx species and formation of B&#9472;OH groups, which drove the uprush of propane conversion.

         <title>Xanthopinacol Boronate: A Robust, Photochemically Assembled and Cleavable Boronic Ester for Orthogonal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xanthopinacol (xpin) boronates are a conceptually new class of masked boronic acids designed to alleviate many of the disadvantages of pinacol esters and other popular adducts. They can be formed directly from xanthone and UV light, undergo orthogonal transformations, and are cleavable under photoredox catalysis or oxidative conditions that recycle xanthone to prevent the re&#8208;esterification and facilitate the isolation of the boronic acid.








Abstract
Organoboronic acids impact numerous fields of application from organic synthesis to drug discovery and materials science. However, their highly polar nature makes them challenging to handle, purify, and characterize. Boronic esters help overcome these issues, and pinacol esters (Bpin) have become the dominant boronic acid surrogate in organic synthesis. Despite its popularity, Bpin is not without drawbacks. Its formation from pinacol is intrinsically reversible in the presence of water or alcohols, which may cause premature release leading to losses during reactions and purification. This reversibility complicates the hydrolytic regeneration of free boronic acids, which often requires additional steps to destroy the pinacol by&#8208;product. Although other boronyl protecting groups exist, their removal requires harsh pH conditions. To address these issues, we developed xanthopinacol boronates (Bxpin), a robust protecting group for boronic acids with excellent orthogonality in various chemical reactions and mild irreversible removal under catalyzed photoredox conditions. Xpin boronates can be obtained directly by irradiation of a mixture of free boronic acid and xanthone with UV light, causing an in situ dimerization of xanthone to the required xanthopinacol. The unique attributes of xpin boronates were further studied by UV&#8211;vis spectrophotometry, X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry, and various stability tests.

         <title>Constructing Ionic Transport Network via Supramolecular Composite Binder in Cathode for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective composite binder strategy is proposed to establish multiple and highly efficient Li+ transport channels within the LiFePO4 cathode, which significantly improves the Li+ transport efficiency and achieves high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries at high cathode active loading.








Abstract
Binders play a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and stability of electrodes. However, conventional polyvinylidene fluoride binder with low ionic conductivity could not meet the ionic transport requirements of the cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, a composite binder (PPCL) derived from the cross&#8208;linking of linear molecules and mechanically interlocked molecules with typical supramolecular channel structure is designed. The supramolecular channel structure is afforded through &#946;&#8722;cyclodextrin rings crosslinked polyethylene oxide chains by hydrogen bond interaction. Through the coordination of supramolecular with linear polymer, the PPCL binder provides multiple and synergistic Li+ transport channels to achieve stable Li+ transport inside the cathode. As a result, the obtained PPCL binder not only maintains exceptional adhesive strength which could achieve robust electrode structural stability but also helps to construct multiple and highly efficient Li+ transport channels. Therefore, with PPCL binder, the LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLBs show an excellent rate capability and long cyclic stability over 1000 cycles at 1 C. Notably, a pouch ASSLB shows excellent cycling stability over 250 cycles at 0.2 C. This work provides guidance on designing high&#8208;loading cathodes for advanced ASSLBs.

The supramolecular channel structure is afforded through &#946;&#8722;cyclodextrin rings crosslinked polyethylene oxide chains by hydrogen bond interaction. Through the coordination of supramolecular with linear polymer, the PPCL binder provides multiple and synergistic Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport channels to achieve stable Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport inside the cathode. As a result, the obtained PPCL binder not only maintains exceptional adhesive strength which could achieve robust electrode structural stability but also helps to construct multiple and highly efficient Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport channels. Therefore, with PPCL binder, the LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-based ASSLBs show an excellent rate capability and long cyclic stability over 1000 cycles at 1 C. Notably, a pouch ASSLB shows excellent cycling stability over 250 cycles at 0.2 C. This work provides guidance on designing high-loading cathodes for advanced ASSLBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Shamrock&#8208;Shaped Giant Molecule Acceptors for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the highly efficient Qx series of small molecules, we have synthesized T&#8208;Qxs, which are shamrock&#8208;shaped giant molecules with high glass transition temperature. The miscibility with the polymer donor PM6 was fine&#8208;tuned by modulation of the central and terminal atoms, thereby altering the molecular distortion angle. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the fully chlorine&#8208;substituted T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl achieve both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and high thermal stability.








Abstract
The discovery of non&#8208;fullerene small molecule acceptor materials has breathed new development into organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it has also introduced the issue of insufficient device stability. Enhancing the glass transition temperature (Tg) of materials by connecting small molecules into giant molecules, thereby improving morphological stability, represents an effective material design strategy to address this issue. In this work, we have synthesized the shamrock&#8208;shaped giant molecule materials T&#8208;Qx based on high efficiency Qx&#8208;series small molecule materials. Through systematically modulating the terminal and the central halogen atoms, precise control of the molecular conformation can be achieved. Notably, the fully chlorine&#8208;substituted giant molecule T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl exhibits the largest torsion angle of approximately 40&#176; and achieves the highest Tg (up to 188 &#176;C) among these new materials. Photovoltaic devices based on these giant molecules demonstrate a low non&#8208;radiative energy loss of approximately 0.21&#160;eV, which results in a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) above 0.93&#160;V. T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl presents the strongest interaction with the polymer donor PM6, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 20%. This remarkable performance is attributed to the large twisting angle that effectively prevents the excessive aggregation of large &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar molecules.

         <title>Intrinsically Luminescent Nematic Liquid Crystals Enabling High&#8208;Brightness Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence via Chiral Coassembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of luminescent nematic liquid crystals (N&#8208;LCs) exhibiting full&#8208;color emission was developed. Through coassembly with chiral dopants, these N&#8208;LCs enabled the fabrication of high&#8208;brightness full&#8208;color and white circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) films with simultaneously enhanced glum (up to 0.75) and photoluminescence quantum yield (up to 71%), representing the best performance to date among all intrinsically luminescent CPL materials.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials with simultaneous high dissymmetry factor (glum) and brightness are pivotal for advanced photonic applications but remain challenging due to inherent trade&#8208;offs betwwen glum value and photoluminescenc quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we report a supramolecular engineering strategy to construct intrinsically luminescent chiral nematic liquid crystal (N*&#8208;LC) films via coassembly of luminescent liquid crystals (LLCs) and chiral dopant. First, five intrinsic LLCs molecules (2PFQ, 2PFBQ, 2PFB, 2PFSe, and 2PFS) were synthesized by combining the biphenyl framework with dioctyl&#8208;functionalized fluorene, achieving exceptional nematic phases and high brightness with PLQY up to 99%. Then, chiral coassembly of the obtained LLCs with chiral dopants (P/M&#8208;THH) followed by rapid thermal quenching yielded Bragg reflection&#8208;free N*&#8208;LC films exhibiting high&#8208;brightness CPL with recorded glum values (up to 0.75) and PLQY (up to 71%). Full&#8208;color tunability and white CPL (CIE: 0.33, 0.33) were realized through precise compositional control. The simultaneous optimization of glum and PLQY enables high&#8208;brightness CPL with advanced anticounterfeiting capabilities, opening new avenues for developing high&#8208;brighness CPL materials for polarized photonic and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Ternary Aldehyde&#8211;Copper&#8211;Iridium Catalysis Enables Stereodivergent Allylation via &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H Functionalization of Primary Amines</title>

         <dc:description>
A direct enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent &#945;&#8208;allylation of unprotected primary amines has been developed using aldehyde/Cu/Ir ternary catalysis. This catalytic system enables the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines bearing vicinal stereocenters in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. Notably, this method establishes a sophisticated asymmetric induction model for asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of unprotected primary amines.








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Chiral primary amines are recognized as one of the most valuable and versatile synthetic intermediates, widely utilized in the construction of diverse amine&#8208;containing natural products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. The direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of unprotected primary amines is the most straightforward method for creating these motifs. However, this transformation remains underdeveloped, particularly in stereodivergent synthesis of primary amines with multiple stereocenters. Herein, we report an aldehyde/copper/iridium ternary catalytic system, which was successfully employed for the direct enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent &#945;&#8208;allylation of primary &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;chromanone without requiring additional protection or activation of the NH2 group. A wide range of &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines bearing vicinal stereocenters were prepared in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (generally&#160;&gt;20:1 dr and&#160;&gt;99% ee). Notably, all four stereoisomers of the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines can be readily prepared by simply switching the configuration combinations of the two chiral metal catalysts. Furthermore, the asymmetric induction model for the &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of primary amines was meticulously elucidated through comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Chloromethylation Modified Pyranonitrile&#8208;Based Conjugated Microporous Polymers for Selective One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A post&#8208;modification strategy employing a chloromethylation reaction was proposed to enhance H2O2 production of covalent microporous polymers (CMPs). The H2O2 production rate of the chloromethylated CMP namely DCM&#8208;TPA&#8208;Cl reached 5.01&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in air, which is 6.7 times greater than that of the unmodified photocatalyst. An exceptional 38.02&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 rate was further achieved in water/benzyl alcohol mixtures, exceeding that of most reported polymer photocatalysts.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production utilizing conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs)&#8208;based photocatalysts represents a crucial green technology for achieving solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. Proper material design is paramount to improve the dispersity and charge transfer of CMPs for enhanced H2O2 production performance. Herein, a post&#8208;modification strategy employing chloromethylation reaction was proposed to enhance H2O2 production. The simple one&#8208;step chloromethylation reaction simultaneously achieved two objectives: One is enhanced hydrophilicity through the hydrolysis of cyanogen groups in the pyranonitrile unit to carboxyl groups, the other&#160;is the improved O2 adsorption and charge transfer by incorporating chloromethyl groups. The two objectives synergistically enhanced the H2O2 production rate of the chloromethylated CMP named DCM&#8208;TPA&#8208;Cl, reaching 5.01&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in air, 6.7&#8208;fold of the unmodified photocatalyst. Moreover, the rate achieved at an O2 atmosphere increased by only 1.8%, highlighting its superior O2 utilization efficiency in air. An exceptional 38.02&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 rate was further achieved in water/benzyl alcohol mixtures, exceeding most reported polymer photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical results corroborated the predominant role of the one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron O2 reduction pathway in the H2O2 generation. This work demonstrates the potential of a post&#8208;modification method to significantly enhance H2O2 production performance directly from water and air.

The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of the chloromethylated CMP namely DCM-TPA-Cl reached 5.01&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in air, which is 6.7 times greater than that of the unmodified photocatalyst. An exceptional 38.02&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; rate was further achieved in water/benzyl alcohol mixtures, exceeding that of most reported polymer photocatalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) production utilizing conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs)-based photocatalysts represents a crucial green technology for achieving solar-to-chemical energy conversion. Proper material design is paramount to improve the dispersity and charge transfer of CMPs for enhanced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production performance. Herein, a post-modification strategy employing chloromethylation reaction was proposed to enhance H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. The simple one-step chloromethylation reaction simultaneously achieved two objectives: One is enhanced hydrophilicity through the hydrolysis of cyanogen groups in the pyranonitrile unit to carboxyl groups, the other&#160;is the improved O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and charge transfer by incorporating chloromethyl groups. The two objectives synergistically enhanced the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of the chloromethylated CMP named DCM-TPA-Cl, reaching 5.01&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in air, 6.7-fold of the unmodified photocatalyst. Moreover, the rate achieved at an O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere increased by only 1.8%, highlighting its superior O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization efficiency in air. An exceptional 38.02&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; rate was further achieved in water/benzyl alcohol mixtures, exceeding most reported polymer photocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical results corroborated the predominant role of the one-step two-electron O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction pathway in the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation. This work demonstrates the potential of a post-modification method to significantly enhance H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production performance directly from water and air.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Equalized Dual Emissions from Copper Complexes via Multichannel Balanced Intersystem Crossing: Toward 100% Quantum Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual emissions containing equalized thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence are achieved by a copper iodide complex QtBCzTTPPCuI, which exhibits &#8764;100% photoluminescence quantum efficiencies and record&#8208;high twofold increased external quantum efficiencies of &#8764;30% among pure&#8208;yellow spin&#8208;coated organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, owing to the contributions of high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered charge transfer excited states to intersystem crossing.








Abstract
Luminescent materials have important applications in biology, medicine, catalysis, energy, information technology, and so on. However, to suppress quenching and improve efficiencies, how to balance singlet and triplet radiations for efficient dual emission composed of equalized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report that based on a rigid skeleton of triphosphine CuI complex, modification with carbazole donors results in high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered charge transfer states, which provide additional channels for accurately optimizing the singlet&#8208;triplet ratios. We achieve equalized dual emissions containing 53% TADF and 47% phosphorescence, &#8764;100% photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;luminescence quantum efficiencies and record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies of &#8764;30% for pure&#8208;yellow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Photophysical and exciton kinetics analyses indicate the incorporation of high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered triplet states into dual&#8208;emissive electroluminescence is based on energy&#8208;level matching with the first triplet states of host matrixes.

         <title>Enantioselective Divergent Cyclization of Amide&#8208;Type 1,6&#8208;Enynes Enabled by H&#8211;[Pd]&#8211;CN Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Three distinctive asymmetric 1,6&#8208;enyne cyclization strategies, namely, hydrocyanative cyclization, cyclization/Heck reaction, and cyclization/Heck/hydrocyanation, have been developed, providing a modular synthetic platform for various chiral &#947;&#8208;lactams bearing a quaternary stereogenic center. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, are also conducted. 








Abstract
Enantioselective cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been extensively developed as it offers an effective way to obtain chiral cyclic compounds. Herein, we report a divergent palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cyclization of N&#8208;allyl&#8208;substituted propiolamides, which allows for the efficient synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;lactams bearing a quaternary stereogenic center. Three distinctive cyclization strategies, namely, hydrocyanative cyclization, cyclization/Heck reaction, and cyclization/Heck/hydrocyanation, were successfully developed. The product can be selected by using different initial substrates under the same catalytic conditions or by fine&#8208;tuning the reaction conditions for the same initial substrate. This catalytic system boasts broad substrate scope and wide functional&#8208;group compatibility, where a diverse range of substituents on the aryl group and amide nitrogen atom were tolerated. The combination of experimental studies and theoretical calculations revealed the fundamental role of the ligand in regioselectivity and the role of H2O in the sequential cyclization/Heck/hydrocyanation reactions. H2O can lower the energy barrier of the reductive elimination step, thus promoting the reaction toward the target product formation.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Ligate and Release Strategy Based on Photoclick Reaction in Tandem with Pd&#8208;Mediated Deallylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A consecutive, controllable, and revertible new&#8208;to&#8208;nature ligation and cleavage strategy has been rationally devised to selectively visualize and manipulate biomolecules of interest. The photoclick cycloaddition between allenyl phenyl ether motifs and 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone analogues installed a terminal allyl handle at the exocyclic site, thereby enabling on&#8208;demand Pd&#8208;mediated deallylation to release phenolic payloads (copyright permission obtained from BioRender).








Abstract
The development of chemoselective tools that can conjugate, modify, and decouple chemical groups from biomacromolecules has enabled the study of biological processes at increasing levels of fidelity. Until recently, these tools can either couple chemical entities to biomacromolecules or decouple them, but not both. A method that can perform these functions in distinct steps on demand would be highly useful. To that end, we devised a new&#8208;to&#8208;nature strategy by bringing together and modifying two biocompatible transformations. In this new strategy, ligation is accomplished via the photoclick reaction between an allenyl motif with 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone which installs an allyl group at the site of conjugation. This allyl group can then be selectively utilized as a handle for phenolic release via Pd&#8208;mediated deallylation. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated its utility in the selective labeling and delabeling of model protein scaffolds and cellular matrix. This multifunctional method paves the way for a controllable &#8220;ligate and release&#8221; strategy that enables on&#8208;demand visualization of biological entities but with an in built release mechanism to restore their original state.

         <title>Turing&#8208;Structured Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Fast and Precise Peptide Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Turing&#8208;structured COF membrane with externally striped and internally cavitated architectures is created via the modulation based on metal&#8208;polyphenol chemistry. The resulting COF membrane exhibits simultaneously enhanced water permeation and molecular sieving properties, demonstrating its great potential in the separation of high&#8208;value pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Turing structures have emerged as promising features for separation membranes, enabling significantly enhanced water permeation due to their ultra&#8208;permeable internal cavities. So far, Turing structures are constrained by the highly cross&#8208;linked and heterogeneous porosities, impeding them from the application of molecular separations requiring loose but regular pore structures. This work reports a covalent organic frameworks (COFs) membrane with nanoscale striped Turing structures for fast and precise molecular separations. Porous and hydrophilic modulation layers based on metal&#8208;polyphenol chemistry are constructed on polymeric substrates, which are capable of enhancing the uptake and controlled release of the activator of amines during synthesis. The appropriately reduced diffusion rate triggers the phenomenon of &#8220;local activation and lateral inhibition&#8221; arising from thermodynamic instability, creating Turing structures with externally striped and internally cavitated architectures. The Turing&#8208;type COF membranes exhibit a water permeance of 45.0 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1, which is approximately 13 times greater than the non&#8208;Turing membranes, and an ultrahigh selectivity of up to 638 for two model peptides. This work demonstrates the feasibility that Turing structures with ultra&#8208;permeable internal cavities can be created in COF membranes and underscores their superiority in molecular separations, including but not limited to high&#8208;value pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Modular Access to Arylethylamines Enabled by Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;Selective Hydroarylation of Allylic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a modular and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroarylation of readily available allylic amines, affording various valuable arylethylamines with exclusive regiocontrol. The use of NHC&#9472;Ni catalyst was crucial to achieve high efficiency and selectivity. In particular, with bulky chiral NHC ligands, enantioenriched arylethylamines were prepared in high efficiency with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.








Abstract
Arylethylamines are prevalent structural skeletons in bioactive molecules and have significant interest within the organic chemistry community. We report here a modular and efficient nickel&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov&#8208;selective hydroarylation of readily available allylic amines, delivering a wide variety of valuable arylethylamines with complete regiocontrol under mild conditions. Key to the success of this protocol is the employment of bulky N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as ligands. Furthermore, the use of chiral NHC ligands enables straightforward access to enantioenriched arylethylamines with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Cu6Sn5 Alloy Electrocatalysts for Formaldehyde Oxidative Dehydrogenation and Bipolar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; alloy was developed as a high&#8208;performance, noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst for the anodic formaldehyde oxidative dehydrogenation (FOD) reaction. When paired with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it enables a formaldehyde&#8208;assisted water electrolyzer, facilitating energy&#8208;efficient bipolar hydrogen production and the generation of value&#8208;added formate.








Abstract
Aldehyde&#8208;assisted water electrolysis offers an attractive pathway for energy&#8208;saving bipolar hydrogen production with combined faradaic efficiency (FE) of 200% while converting formaldehyde into value&#8208;added formate. Herein we report the design and synthesis of noble metal&#8208;free Cu6Sn5 alloy as a highly effective electrocatalyst for formaldehyde electro&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation, demonstrating a geometric current density of 915&#160;&#177;&#160;46&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming many noble metal electrocatalysts reported previously. The formaldehyde&#8208;assisted water electrolyzer delivers 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 0.124&#160;V, and a current density of 486&#160;&#177;&#160;20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 0.6&#160;V without any iR compensation and exhibits nearly 200% faradaic efficiency for bipolar hydrogen production at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 88&#160;h long&#8208;term operation. Density functional theory calculations further confirm the notably lowered barriers for dehydrogenation and Tafel steps on the Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; surface compared to Cu, underscoring its potential as a highly active catalyst.

         <title>Phosphinoisocyanide/Alkyne Cycloaddition: Generation of Azaphospholylidene (NPHC) Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare examples of nitrogen phosphorus heterocyclic carbene (NPHC) complexes of group 6 and 7 metals arise from a facile [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of phosphinoisocyanides (LnM&#8208;CNPR2) with activated alkynes. The NPHC ligands are shown to be comparatively &#960;&#8208;acidic and the group 6 examples undergo facile transfer of the intact carbene to gold(I) centres.








Abstract
Phosphinoisocyanide complexes undergo facile [3&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reactions with activated alkynes to afford the first azaphospholylidene complexes which are rare examples of N,P&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NPHC). In addition to quantifying the donor/acceptor properties of this new class of carbene, their transmetalation reactions are also described.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Triggered Orbital Hybridization in FeMn Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts Toward Sabatier&#8208;Optimized Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;engineered heteronuclear FeMn dual&#8208;atom catalyst on a porous N&#8208;doped carbon matrix is synthesized via a customized trinuclear&#8208;defect trapping strategy. The defect&#8208;mediated coordination strengthens Fe 3dz2 with O 2p orbital hybridization, optimizing adsorption energy toward Sabatier optimality. The catalyst delivers a 0.921&#160;V half&#8208;wave potential for alkaline oxygen reduction and excellent Zn&#8208;air battery performance.








Abstract
Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSAs), leveraging synergistic dual&#8208;site interactions, represent a promising frontier in electrocatalysis. However, the precise synthesis of dual&#8208;atom pairs and fine&#8208;tuning of their electronic structures remain significant challenges. Herein, we construct a defect&#8208;engineered heteronuclear FeMn&#8208;DSA anchored on a porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (FeMnDSA/dNC) through a customized trinuclear&#8208;defect trapping strategy. This defect modulation strategy effectively stabilizes dual atomic pairs while optimizing electronic structures to approach Sabatier's optimality, significantly boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. The FeMnDSA/dNC achieves a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.921&#160;V in alkaline media, with assembled zinc&#8208;air batteries demonstrating 291&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 peak power density and stable charge/discharge cycling for over 500&#160;h. Theoretical calculations reveal that defect&#8208;mediated coordination adjacent to Fe&#8208;Mn diatomic centers triggers charge redistribution, suppressing antibonding orbital populations while strengthening Fe 3dz2 with O 2p orbital hybridization. This modulation weakens O&#9472;O bonding through optimized *OOH adsorption configurations, thereby enhancing ORR kinetics. The present work provides valuable insights into the precise modulation and the underlying mechanisms of DSAs, advancing the design of electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion applications.

         <title>On the Mechanism of Soft Self&#8208;Assembly from Melt: The Ubiquitous Heat Capacity Hump and Spontaneous Melt Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase transition from melt to most complex liquid crystal (LC) phases is weak 1st order but is preceded by a large heat capacity maximum. In addition, a chiral liquid forms through another transition before that to the LC, despite the compounds being achiral. We investigate these poorly understood phenomena experimentally and develop a statistical theory that fits the experiments remarkably well, giving new insights into the mechanism of self&#8208;assembly and pre&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
We investigate two unusual phenomena in self&#8208;assembly of anisotropic molecules from isotropic (Iso) melt: a heat&#8208;capacity (Cp) maximum and spontaneous formation of the recently discovered chiral liquid (Iso*). Based on experiments on new nonchiral monomers, dimers, and polymers, we construct a statistical theory that shows why many complex meso&#8208;structures form in two stages: continuous equilibrium growth of nano&#8208;clusters in melt through strong interactions, causing the Cp&#8208;maximum, followed by establishment of positional long&#8208;range order (LRO) through a weak first&#8208;order transition. We also show why many achiral compounds additionally form an intermediate chiral Iso* liquid through what we find is a second&#8208;order transition. We propose that the first process is equivalent to &#8220;supramolecular polymerization&#8221; in solutions, where the lack of intercluster interaction rules out LRO. Furthermore, we argue that separation into a broad and a sharp transition is universal in condensed matter where strong interactions by themselves cannot lead to LRO, either because the clusters are 1D or due to strong frustration. Clusters must first grow to critical size when, at Tc, the combined weak interactions reach &#8764;kBTc, prompting LRO formation. A situation similar to that in soft self&#8208;assembly is seen in spin ordering in magnetic crystals, but only near 0&#160;K.

&lt;p&gt;Phase transition from melt to most complex liquid crystal (LC) phases is weak 1st order but is preceded by a large heat capacity maximum. In addition, a chiral liquid forms through another transition before that to the LC, despite the compounds being achiral. We investigate these poorly understood phenomena experimentally and develop a statistical theory that fits the experiments remarkably well, giving new insights into the mechanism of self-assembly and pre-assembly.

         <title>Machine Learning Reveals In&#8208;Cavity Versus Surface Activity for Selective C&#9472;H Borylation by Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
A set of 45 general descriptors was developed to capture the diverse structural features of a wide range of MOFs, enabling the study of MOF&#8208;supported nickel (Ni) catalysts for C&#9472;H borylation. This analysis revealed key factors that govern sp3 versus sp2 selectivity, allowing for the rational design of Ni catalysts with up to 97.8% sp3 selectivity and 88.7% sp2 selectivity.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide an expansive and tunable platform for heterogeneous catalysis, yet distinguishing between catalytic reactions occurring within their pores and those on their external surfaces remains a challenge. This study employs interpretable machine learning to elucidate structure&#8208;activity relationships in MOF&#8208;supported nickel (Ni) catalysts for selective sp3 and sp2 C&#9472;H borylation. By analyzing over 470&#160;000 MOF structures, we developed a set of 45 concise and chemically meaningful descriptors that capture key structural variations across MOFs. These descriptors enabled us to identify the critical factors governing sp3 versus sp2 selectivity, revealing distinct activation mechanisms: sp3 C&#9472;H borylation preferentially occurs within MOF cavities via a radical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism, whereas sp2 C&#9472;H borylation is associated with surface or defect sites, favoring a concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD) pathway. Guided by these insights, we designed Ni catalysts that achieve up to 97.8% sp3 selectivity and 88.7% sp2 selectivity. This work provides a systematic framework for rational catalyst design and establishes generalizable principles for controlling activity preference in MOF&#8208;supported catalysis.

         <title>Local Atomic Off&#8208;Centering Mediated Efficient Self&#8208;Trapped Excitonic Emission in Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 nanoplates exhibit reasonably photostable and intense broadband sky&#8208;blue emission, originating from self&#8208;trapped excitons. The self&#8208;trapping of excitons occurs due to strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling, which is created by elastic structural distortion on the atomic scale. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray total scattering studies reveal the local structural distortion to be crafted by off&#8208;centering the copper atom.








Abstract
Cu(I)&#8208;based low&#8208;dimensional metal halides have received significant recognition attributable to their intriguing optoelectronic properties, which instigate the emergence of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) accompanied by intense broadband emissions. However, fundamental crystal structural origin of such STE is still elusive. Herein, we have synthesized Cu(I)&#8208;based mixed halide, Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 nanoplates (NPs) using room temperature ligand&#8208;assisted reprecipitation method, which showed an intense blue emission with broad line&#8208;width, large Stokes shift, long photoluminescence lifetime, high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of &#8764;75%. Temperature&#8208;dependent PL intensity and line&#8208;width analysis unfolded strong exciton&#8208;phonon coupling in NP sample. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis determines the local Cu off&#8208;centering, which provides the required lattice anharmonicity and softness for intense STE in Cs5Cu3Cl6I2 NPs. The existence of such soft lattice structure associated with low&#8208;energy phonons was verified by sound velocity, Raman spectroscopy and low&#8208;temperature heat capacity measurements. The fluorescence microscopy and super&#8208;resolution optical imaging were implemented at single&#8208;particle level which exhibited minimal temporal PL intermittency with reasonable photostability under high&#8208;intensity illumination. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the intense broadband emission of NPs are &#160;accompanied by the local atomic off&#8208;centering&#8208;driven lattice deformation during photo&#8208;excitation process.

Polyether monomers coordinate with aluminum ethoxide nanowires via in situ ultraviolet curing, stabilizing the lone pair electrons of ethereal oxygen atoms and suppressing oxidative degradation. This coordination also forms abundant and tight interfaces as the predominant lithium&#8208;ion conduction pathways, contributing to ordered lithium&#8208;ion fluxes. The composite gel polymer electrolyte facilitates high&#8208;performance Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cell. 








Abstract
Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based composite gel polymer electrolyte is widely used in lithium metal batteries to address dendrite growth and side reactions. However, the low oxidative decomposition potential (&lt;4.0&#160;V) of poly(ethylene oxide) limits the cyclic stability with Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes. What's more, poor interface compatibility between fillers and polymer severely deteriorates lithium&#8208;ion pathways, which cannot achieve lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;load cathode. Herein, polyether monomers coordinate with aluminum ethoxide nanowires via in situ ultraviolet curing, stabilizing the lone pair electrons of ethereal oxygen atoms and suppressing oxidative degradation. This coordination also forms abundant and tight interfaces as the predominant lithium&#8208;ion conduction pathways, contributing to ordered lithium&#8208;ion fluxes and dendrite&#8208;free deposition on the lithium anode. In addition, a robust solid electrolyte interphase containing aluminum&#8208;based species enhances the interfacial stability of lithium anode. Meanwhile, the good compatibility between the electrolyte and the cathode effectively suppresses side reactions and contributes to the structural stabilization of the cycled cathode. The delicate design allows the Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cells to present excellent cycling stability from &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C to 60&#160;&#176;C. Specially, cells with 8.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 cathode cycle stably for over 120 cycles. This molecular structure engineering will greatly promote the practical application of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

An innovative group transfer radical cyclopolymerization (GTRCP) method has been developed for the precise synthesis of functionalized cyclic olefin polymers (COPs) using non&#8208;conjugated diene monomers. Through rational monomer design, various polar groups are incorporated into the COP backbones. The resulting polymers exhibit high molecular weights, low dispersities, controllable chain sequences, and high structural diversity. The polymer can function as a robust interphase layer, enhancing the reversibility of lithium plating/stripping in anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Cyclic olefin polymers (COPs) are of high importance in optical and medical materials. These materials are typically synthesized via ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization of norbornene derivatives, using metallocene catalysts, followed by high&#8208;pressure hydrogenation catalyzed by noble metals. However, the complex synthetic processes, the continuous use of expensive catalysts, and the need to remove metal residues remain substantial barriers in COP production. In contrast, radical cyclopolymerization of dienes, which eliminates the need for metal catalysis and hydrogenation, offers a promising alternative for COP synthesis. Nevertheless, chain transfer reactions hinder the radical polymerization of non&#8208;conjugated dienes. To address these challenges, we present a novel strategy, group transfer radical cyclopolymerization (GTRCP), which effectively suppresses chain transfer and enables radical polymerization of dienes to yield COPs. This approach allows for the production of a broad range of sequence&#8208;regulated COPs with high molecular weights and low dispersity. Density functional theory calculations support the proposed GTRCP mechanism, highlighting its efficiency and selectivity, driven by substantial thermodynamic forces. The resulting COPs demonstrate great potential as the interphase layer materials in anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries, significantly enhancing the cycling performance towards practical energy storage applications.

         <title>Interfacial Water Structure Modulation on Unconventional Phase Non&#8208;Precious Metal Alloy Nanostructures for Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 28, July 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled synthesis of noble metal&#8208;free CuNi alloy nanostructures with unconventional hcp/fcc heterophase has been successfully achieved. Notably, hcp/fcc CuNi nanoalloys demonstrate much superior catalytic performance toward ammonia electrosynthesis from nitrate than the common fcc CuNi counterparts. Mechanism studies reveal that the hcp/fcc CuNi alloys facilitate the formation of K+&#8211;H2O, enhance the interfacial water dissociation, and create high *H coverage, thereby boosting the ammonia synthesis.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) has been recognized as a sustainable route for nitrate removal and value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) synthesis. Regulating the surface active hydrogen (*H) behavior is crucial but remains a formidable challenge, especially in neutral electrolytes, greatly limiting the highly selective NH3 formation. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of heterophase hcp/fcc non&#8208;precious CuNi alloy nanostructures for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis in neutral media. Significantly, hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 exhibits excellent performance with NH3 Faradaic efficiency and yield rate of 98.1% and 57.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1, respectively. In situ studies suggest that the high proportion of interfacial K+ ion hydrated water (K+&#8211;H2O) on hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 creates high *H coverage via boosting interfacial water dissociation, enabling the rapid hydrogenation kinetics for NH3 synthesis. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superior NO3RR performance of hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 originates from both the existence of hcp phase to improve the electroactivity and the high Ni content to guarantee an efficient active hydrogen supply. The strong interaction between Ni and Cu also optimizes the electronic structures of Cu sites to realize fast intermediate conversions with low energy barriers. This work provides a novel strategy to optimize surface *H behavior via tuning interfacial water structure by crystal phase control.

Transfer learning&#8208;driven SERS to elucidate mixtures with unknown composition and ratios.








Abstract
Identifying and quantifying compounds in unknown mixtures represents the ultimate goal of surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy but remains a significant challenge in real&#8208;world applications. Existing machine learning&#8208;driven SERS methods are limited by their reliance on prior knowledge of mixture composition, while time&#8208;consuming experimental testing of all possibilities is not feasible. We integrate the molecular specificity of SERS with an adaptive transfer learning (TL) strategy to sequentially identify and quantify carnitine components in 11 unknown binary, ternary, and quaternary multicarnitine mixtures, achieving 100% identification accuracy and a mean quantitation error of only 3%. All models are trained solely on pure compound spectral data, enabling scalable, qualitative, and quantitative analysis of complex, unseen multiplex spectra&#8212;without requiring costly and time&#8208;consuming training data collection for every possible mixture. This predictive transfer learning&#8208;driven approach marks a transformative leap for practical SERS applications, allowing accurate analysis of complex mixtures without prior knowledge of components or ratios.

         <title>Elucidating Ligand Exchange Dynamics of Hexacyanochromate&#8208;Based Redox Mediators in Aqueous Iron&#8208;Chromium Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand exchange between cyanide and hydroxide in hexacyanochromate negolyte was caused by the disruption of coordination environment of the redox mediator ([Cr(CN)6]4&#8208;/3&#8722;), with a critical factor as an elevated pH during electrochemical cycle. To mitigate this electrolyte co&#8208;modulation strategy is introduced, optimizing the [OH&#8722;]/[CN&#8722;] ratios stabilize the redox mediator, ensuring long&#8208;term electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Aqueous redox flow batteries (AQRFBs) are revolutionizing energy storage by integrating sustainability with cutting&#8208;edge innovation. Among them, Iron&#8208;Chromium RFBs (Fe&#8208;Cr RFBs), which utilize aqueous&#8208;based electrolytes, effectively address critical challenges in renewable energy integration while offering unparalleled safety, low&#8208;cost scalability and environmental compatibility. Potassium hexacyanochromate (K3[Cr(CN)6]) has emerged as a promising negolyte material in Fe&#8208;Cr RFBs due to its favorable electrochemical properties. However, enhancing its long&#8208;term stability and elucidating its structural transformations remain crucial for optimized performance. Investigations into ligand exchange mechanism reveal connections to detrimental side reactions, notably hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hexacyanochromate instability, highlighting pathways for targeted improvement. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations illuminate the effects of ligand exchange dynamics and structural variations on redox stability, providing mechanistic insights into electrolyte behavior. By strategically incorporating sodium hydroxide with sodium cyanide as supporting electrolytes, our study demonstrates significantly improved stability of the redox couple, achieving a stable cycling performance over 250 cycles with an energy density of 13.91&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and energy efficiencies exceeding 76%&#8211;77%. This research provides valuable insights into the degradation pathways of hexacyanochromate&#8208;based negolyte and emphasizes the importance of optimized electrolyte design for advancing sustainable energy storage technologies.

         <title>Orthogonal Multiple Hydrogen Bonds of Nucleobases Enable Precise Tunability of DNA&#8208;Polymer Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple hydrogen bond (MHB) interactions for hydrophobic nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers and hydrophilic DNA chains are highly selective and orthogonal, owing to the heterogeneous backbone structures, distinct repeat unit spacing, and different hydrophilicity. Orthogonal MHBs enable us to tailor DNA nanostructures by exploiting the underexplored hydrophobic domain, amplifying the production of diverse functional DNA nanostructures.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures manifest enhanced stability and chemical diversity for various applications such as sensing, imaging, and immune modulation. However, the functionality of the hydrophobic polymer in the core is often disregarded, leading to limited property tunability of DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures. Herein, we have successfully fabricated tunable DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures by harnessing orthogonal multiple hydrogen bonds (MHBs) within both the core and shell domains. Distinct DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures, consisting of hydrophobic nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers and hydrophilic DNAs, have been rationally designed and successfully constructed. The DNA&#8208;polymer nanostructures undergo the controlled morphological transformation triggered by hydrophobic nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers and surface functionalization by hydrophilic DNA chains. Owing to the heterogeneous backbone structures, distinct repeat unit spacing, and different hydrophilicity, the robust MHB interactions for complementary DNAs and nucleobase&#8208;containing polymers are highly selective and orthogonal. Most significantly, the reported core&#8208;driven morphological transformation and surface functionalization of the shell layer are general to expand the structural and properties tunability of DNA nanostructures with different DNA sequences. This work provides an efficient and novel route to precisely modulating DNA&#8208;polymer core&#8208;shell nanostructures by exploiting the underexplored hydrophobic core through orthogonal MHBs.

         <title>Quantitative Tracking of Apoptotic Caspase&#8208;3 In Vivo for Early Evaluation of Radiation Therapy Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;responsive ratiometric fluorescence probe was developed to accurately quantify caspase&#8208;3 induced by radiotherapy in vivo by emitting a dual signal at 1550&#160;nm as a reference and response signal, respectively. The detection limit for caspase&#8208;3 was determined to be 9.96 U&#160;mL&#8722;1. The established early efficacy evaluation system can effectively predict the therapeutic outcome of cancer radiotherapy and guide the optimization of treatment plans.








Abstract
Traditional responsive fluorescent probes are predominantly restricted to qualitative biomarker detection, incapable of delivering real&#8208;time quantitative analysis or spatial mapping of protease activity in vivo, which is essential for elucidating disease progression. To overcome this, a ratiometric second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent (FL) probe (DCNP@IR&#8208;806) was developed by conjugating caspase&#8208;3&#8208;specific peptide substrates and sensitizer molecules (IR&#8208;806) to lanthanide&#8208;doped down&#8208;conversion nanoparticles (DCNP). DCNP@IR&#8208;806 achieves single&#8208;channel emission at 1550&#160;nm under dual excitation, facilitating self&#8208;calibrated quantification and real&#8208;time monitoring of activated caspase&#8208;3 in vivo. Radiotherapy induces tumor cell apoptosis, thereby activating caspase&#8208;3, which subsequently triggers a ratiometric NIR&#8208;II FL signal change of DCNP@IR&#8208;806. The ratiometric signal demonstrates a linear correlation with caspase&#8208;3 concentration, achieving a detection limit of 9.96 U&#160;mL&#8722;1. Then, an early efficacy assessment system capable of predicting radiotherapy outcomes within 12 h post&#8208;treatment was constructed, markedly expediting evaluation compared to traditional methods that require weeks. This rapid, precise, and user&#8208;friendly assessment facilitates timely optimization of therapeutic regimens to enhance efficacy while minimizing side effects. This platform represents a significant advancement in precision oncology by transitioning from qualitative imaging to in situ quantitative biomarker tracking.

         <title>Switching Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation Toward Ethanol by Tuning Spin States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) photocatalyst with medium&#8208;spin active sites, in which both the unpaired electrons and eg orbital occupancy allow to selectively generate &#8226;CH2OH intermediates at moderate *OH coverage and promote the C&#9472;C coupling of &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;CH2OH, leading to efficient photocatalytic conversion of CH4 to ethanol without the addition of strong oxidizing reagents. 








Abstract
The selective oxidation of methane (CH4) has attractive potentials for mitigating global warming and producing value&#8208;added chemicals, whereas the efficient generation of multicarbon products such as ethanol remains challenging, due to the short lifetimes and high unpaired concentrations of reactive intermediates (like &#8226;OH, &#8226;CH3, &#8226;OCH3, and &#8226;CH2OH). Herein, we developed a medium&#8208;spin Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst with tunable Fe(III) spin states, which can efficiently photo&#8208;oxidize CH4 to ethanol at ambient conditions. The unpaired electrons in d orbitals of Fe sites allow for efficient adsorption of &#8226;OH, and the eg orbital occupancy enables stabilizing different key carbon&#8208;containing intermediates (&#8226;OCH3 versus &#8226;CH2OH). By balancing those two descriptors, the medium&#8208;spin Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst allows to achieve selective generation of &#8226;CH2OH intermediates with a moderate *OH coverage and subsequent coupling of &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;CH2OH to ethanol. With a light intensity of 100 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2 and water as a weak oxidant, the Zn&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(MS) catalyst exhibited a peak photocatalytic CH4&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol yield of 372 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 without the use of photosensitizers or sacrificial reagents, which is &#8764;3 times higher than the previously best reported photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to ethanol under similar conditions. Our study suggests an attractive potential of converting CH4 to multicarbon products by modulating spin states of the catalytic sites.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Delocalized Cu2+ Activates Spin Channels in Spinel Oxides to Selectively Produce 1O2 for Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an electron&#8208;delocalized strategy to unlock FeTd2+&#9472;O&#9472;FeOh3+ spin channel, inducing intermolecular electron transfer of two PMS for selective 1O2 generation. The directed electron transfer behavior not only maintains the catalyst stability, but also immensely reduces the 1O2 generation energy barrier and improves the PMS utilization.








Abstract
Blocked electron transfer in the catalyst during advanced oxidation processes causes sluggish singlet oxygen (1O2) generation efficiency and sacrifices catalyst stability. In this work, we propose an electron&#8208;delocalization strategy that unlocks ATd2+&#9472;O&#9472;BOh3+ electron&#8208;transfer pathways within spinel oxide (Cu0.8Fe2.2O4), inducing the intermolecular electron transfer of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for selective 1O2 generation. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that the electron&#8208;delocalized Cu2+ triggers a high spin&#8208;state of O in FeTd2+&#9472;O&#9472;FeOh3+, thus creating a spin channel for the spontaneous intermolecular electron transfer of PMS from the FeOh3+ adsorption site to the FeTd2+ adsorption site through FeTd2+&#9472;O&#9472;FeOh3+. This process allows for the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of PMS, thereby reducing the energy barriers for the formation of SO4&#8226;&#8722; and SO5&#8226;&#8722; radicals. Subsequently, the interfacial SO4&#8226;&#8722; rapidly oxidizes SO5&#8226;&#8722; into 1O2, enhancing 1O2 generation efficiency without sacrificing catalyst stability. The selectivity of 1O2 in the Cu0.8Fe2.2O4/PMS system reaches 98.4%. Multiple pollutants are removed in the Cu0.8Fe2.2O4/PMS system without interference from coexisting substances. The scale&#8208;up experiment realizes 100% contaminant removal during the continuous operation process (48&#160;h). This work exhibits a novel strategy for selective 1O2 generation to achieve the goal of practical applications.
