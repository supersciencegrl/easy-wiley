         <title>Azadihomocorannulene as a Heptagon&#8208;Embedded Diradicaloid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azadihomocorannulene dication and diradicaloid molecules were synthesized by mechanochemical C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H coupling as a key reaction. Their structures and physiochemical properties were investigated experimentally and theoretically.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic diradical(oid) molecules are attracting significant attention because of their unique electronic and magnetic properties as well as their applications as functional materials. While diradical(oid) molecules bearing five&#8208;membered rings have been extensively investigated, those bearing seven&#8208;membered rings are relatively fewer. Herein, we report the synthesis of azapentabenzodihomocorannulene dication and diradical molecules. The synthesis was achieved through a mechanochemical C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H coupling in the presence of sodium as a key reaction. Electron spin resonance studies revealed that the neutral azapentabenzodihomocorannulene adopts a singlet diradical (diradicaloid) ground state with a small singlet&#8722;triplet energy gap of 2.1&#8197;kcal/mol. The electronic and optical properties were investigated both experimentally and theoretically to elucidate their aromatic character.

         <title>Synthesis of Iron(IV) Alkynylide Complexes and Their Reactivity to Form 1,3&#8208;Diynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;electron oxidation of alkynylferrates(III) enables the synthesis of the corresponding high&#8208;valent Fe(IV) alkynylides. These organoiron complexes have been characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, EPR, NMR, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;Ray absorption (XAS) and emission (XES) spectroscopies and theoretical calculations (DFT and CASSCF). The isolated Fe(IV) alkynylide complexes react at room temperature to form 1,3&#8208;diynes.







Abstract
The isolation of thermally unstable and highly reactive organoiron(IV) complexes is a challenge for synthetic chemists. In particular, the number of examples where the C&#8208;based ligand is not part of the chelating ligand remains scarce. These compounds are of interest because they could pave the way to designing catalytic cycles of bond forming reactions proceeding via organoiron(IV) intermediates. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization, including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, of a family of alkynylferrates(III) and Fe(IV) alkynylide complexes. The alkynylferrates(III) are formed by transmetalation of the Fe(III) precursor [(N3N&#8217;)FeIII] (N3N&#8217;3&#8722; is tris(N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl&#8208;2&#8208;amidoethyl)amine) with lithium alkynylides, and their further one&#8208;electron oxidation enables the synthesis of the corresponding Fe(IV) alkynylides. The electronic structure of this family of organometallic Fe(III) and Fe(IV) complexes has been thoroughly investigated by spectroscopic methods (EPR, NMR, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;Ray absorption (XAS) and emission (XES) spectroscopies) and theoretical calculations. While alkynylferrates(III) are sluggish to engage into C&#8722;C bond forming processes, the Fe(IV) alkynylides react to afford 1,3&#8208;diynes at room temperature. A bimolecular reductive elimination from a bimetallic Fe(IV) intermediate to form the 1,3&#8208;diynes is proposed based on the mechanistic investigations performed.

         <title>Back Cover: Unveiling the Influence of Oxygen on Drug Release Dynamics in Semipermeable Polymersomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semipermeable polymersomes, polymeric vesicles that allow selective molecular passage across their membranes, offer a novel platform for controlled drug delivery by leveraging oxygen&#8208;producing enzymatic reactions. In their study (e202419087), Matteo Tollemeto, Jan van Hest et&#8197;al. show how enzymatically generated oxygen modulates the membrane&#8242;s hydrophobicity, altering drug release kinetics. These polymersomes selectively release hydrophobic drugs while retaining hydrophilic ones, showcasing their potential to fine&#8208;tune drug release for improved therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes.

         <title>Cascade Reaction Enables Heterointerfaces&#8208;Enriched Nanoarrays for Ampere&#8208;Level Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an innovative cascade reaction in a molten salt environment to synthesize heterostructure nanoarrays, enhancing hydrogen production. Using nickel foam, transition metal salts and potassium thiocyanate, it develops catalysts with superior interfaces that significantly improve electrochemical activity and stability under high current densities.







Abstract
Designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts with superior catalytic activity and stability is essential for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Heterostructure nanoarrays are promising candidates, though achieving both high activity and stability simultaneously, especially under high current densities, remains challenging. To this end, we have developed a cascade reaction process that constructs a series of heterostructure nanoarrays with rich heterointerfaces. This process involves treating nickel foam (NF) with molten KSCN and transition metal salts. Initially, NF reacts with KSCN to form Ni9S8 nanoarrays and S2&#8722; ions, which are subsequently captured by transition metal ions to form sulfides that are directly integrated onto the nanoarrays, resulting in abundant heterointerfaces. Both experimental and theoretical results indicate that these rich heterointerfaces significantly enhance the interfacial interaction between Ni9S8 and RuS2 within the nanoarrays (termed RH&#8208;Ni9S8/RuS2), markedly improving both the intrinsic activity and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Impressively, the RH&#8208;Ni9S8/RuS2 demonstrates exceptional HER performance, achieving a low overpotential of just 180&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintaining stability for up to 500&#8197;h under such high&#8208;current&#8208;density conditions. This innovative approach paves the way for the interfacial design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance catalysts for ampere&#8208;level hydrogen production.

         <title>Back Cover: Opening the Hysteresis Loop in Ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2Nanosheets Through Functionalization with TCNQ Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deposition of organic acceptor molecules, 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), on the surface of ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) nanosheets causes an unprecedented 5&#8208;fold increase in the coercivity of the FGT&#8208;TCNQ composite as compared to that of the bare nanosheets. This huge coercivity enhancement has been traced to the electron transfer from FGT to TCNQ that strengthens the interlayer magnetic exchange in FGT, as illustrated by Jos&#233; J. Baldov&#237;, Michael Shatruk et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202412425).

         <title>Organic Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Achieving 4.8&#8197;V LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ionic liquid electrolyte with high donor number additive is introduced, presenting a new concept of organic cathode electrolyte interphase to inhibit the harmful reactions of high voltage LiCoO2. It provides reversible cathodic electrochemistry at ultra&#8208;high voltage, offering new possibilities for addressing the typical challenges faced by high&#8208;voltage cathodes in current energy storage systems.







Abstract
Developing high&#8208;voltage electrolytes to stabilize LiCoO2 (LCO) cycling remains a challenge in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Constructing a high&#8208;quality cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) is essential to mitigate adverse reactions at high voltages. However, conventional inorganic CEIs dominated by LiF have shown limited performance for high&#8208;voltage LCO. Here, we propose an ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) with a high donor number additive, enabling Li//LCO cells to achieve a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.7&#8197;V/4.8&#8197;V and a high&#8208;capacity retention of 86.9&#8201;%/74.2&#8201;% after 100 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. During this process, a groundbreaking phenomenon was discovered: the construction of a stable organic CEI rich in C&#8722;F bonds by the high donor number additive under high voltage. These strong polar C&#8722;F bonds exhibit excellent electrochemical inertness and film&#8208;forming properties, resulting in optimal passivation of the cathode. This organic C&#8722;F bond&#8208;dominated CEI significantly suppresses phase transitions, cobalt dissolution, and gas evolution in LCO at high voltage. Additionally, the 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;class Li//LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 and 4.95&#8197;V&#8208;class Li//LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cells also demonstrate outstanding cycling stability. Even at 60&#8201;&#176;C, the ILE&#8208;constructed organic CEI maintains superior performance. Our findings highlight the potential of organic CEI to enhance high&#8208;voltage cathode stability, paving the way for more efficient lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Developing high-voltage electrolytes to stabilize LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (LCO) cycling remains a challenge in lithium-ion batteries. Constructing a high-quality cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) is essential to mitigate adverse reactions at high voltages. However, conventional inorganic CEIs dominated by LiF have shown limited performance for high-voltage LCO. Here, we propose an ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) with a high donor number additive, enabling Li//LCO cells to achieve a high cut-off voltage of 4.7&#8197;V/4.8&#8197;V and a high-capacity retention of 86.9&#8201;%/74.2&#8201;% after 100 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C.

         <title>On the Stability of Metastable Monomers to Bias the Supramolecular Polymerization of Naphthalendiimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the NDIs 1&#8211;3 endowed with peripheral benzamide units and a variable number of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole rings is reported. Both the benzamide units and the triazole rings can form six&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded pseudocycles that retard their supramolecular polymerization. A detailed experimental and theoretical study display the different non&#8208;covalent supramolecular forces operating in the stabilization of such M* species.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of the naphthalendiimides (NDIs) 1&#8211;3 endowed with peripheral 3,4,5&#8208;trialkoxybenzamide units and a variable number of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole rings. Both the benzamide units and the triazole rings are able to form six&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded pseudocycles that behave as metastable monomeric units. Whilst freshly prepared solutions of 1&#8211;3 afford H&#8208;type aggregates, the presence or lack of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole rings strongly conditions the kinetics and stability of the resulting aggregated species. These structural features result in highly stable metastable monomeric species M* for the symmetric 2 that can be trapped for long periods of time when the sample is subject to a heating/cooling cycle. Contrary to NDI 2, the M* species formed by 1 and 3 evolve to the final supramolecular polymers in shorter times. A detailed experimental and theoretical study display the different non&#8208;covalent supramolecular forces operating in the stabilization of such M* species. In all cases, but especially in those NDIs endowed with the triazoles rings (NDIs 2 and 3), a number of conformers for the metastable monomeric units can be modelled. The high stability of such monomeric species justifies the delay in the formation of the H&#8208;type aggregates.

Abstract
The global clean energy transition and carbon neutrality call for developing high&#8208;performance batteries. Here we report a rechargeable lithium metal &#8208; catalytic hydrogen gas (Li&#8722;H) battery utilizing two of the lightest elements, Li and H. The Li&#8722;H battery operates through redox of H2/H+ on the cathode and Li/Li+ on the anode. The universal properties of the H2 cathode enable the battery to demonstrate attractive electrochemical performance, including high theoretical specific energy up to 2825&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, discharge voltage of 3&#8197;V, round&#8208;trip efficiency of 99.7&#8201;%, reversible areal capacity of 5&#8211;20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, all&#8208;climate characteristics with a wide operational temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C, and high utilization of active materials. A rechargeable anode&#8208;free Li&#8722;H battery is further constructed by plating Li metal from cost&#8208;effective lithium salts under a low catalyst loading of &lt;0.1&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work presents a route to design batteries based on catalytic hydrogen gas cathode for high&#8208;performance energy storage applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly and Biological Properties of Highly Fluorinated Oligonucleotide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and cost&#8208;effective strategy for developing highly fluorinated DNA amphiphiles functionalized with one or more branched, highly fluorinated residues. Fluorination is used as a tool to drive nucleic acid self&#8208;assembly and fine&#8208;tune the interactions of the resulting spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) with proteins, as well as their gene&#8208;silencing properties. This allows the development of fluorinated SNAs as efficient delivery vehicles for therapeutic nucleic acids.







Abstract
Nucleic acids, used as therapeutics to silence disease&#8208;related genes, offer significant advantages over small molecule drugs: they provide high specificity, the ability to target &#8220;undruggable&#8221; molecules, and adaptability to a wide range of disease phenotypes. However, their instability in biological media, as well their rapid clearance from the organism limit their applicability, necessitating the use of nanocarriers to overcome these challenges. Among these strategies, spherical nucleic acids (SNA)&#8212;composed of a densely packed corona of oligonucleotides around a nanoparticle&#8212;have emerged as a powerful tool, in particular when self&#8208;assembled from DNA amphiphiles. This non&#8208;covalent strategy however has caveats, especially when it comes to stability in complex biological media, where these SNAs disassemble in contact to serum proteins. Here, we developed highly fluorinated DNA amphiphiles that readily self&#8208;assemble into SNAs and have tunable stability profiles in biological media. They are made of branched fluorinated moieties with potentially improved biodegradability as compared to their linear counterparts. Depending on the number of fluorophilic interactions, the self&#8208;assembled SNAs can have excellent serum stabilities&#8212;up to days&#8212;and readily deliver nucleic acid therapeutics for gene silencing applications. These systems show great potential as promising candidates for nucleic acid&#8208;based therapies.

         <title>Mimicking the CO2&#8208;Bound State of the [Ni,Fe]&#8208;CO Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through stepwise assembly the tailoring of complexes with NiII&#8208;(&#956;2&#8208;CO2)&#8208;MII entities (M=Fe, Co, Zn), resembling the structural motif found in an intermediate of the carbonmonoxide dehydrogenase, has been achieved. It was revealed that the transition metal ions reduce the reduction potential of the carbonite unit but increase its tendency to undergo C&#8722;O bond cleavage.







Abstract
Complexes, where a doubly reduced CO22&#8722; (carbonite) ligand is spanned between a nickel(II) centre and a transition metal(II) ion (TM=Fe, Co, Zn) have been accessed. In non&#8208;coordinating solvents the carbonite ligand exhibits a flexible coordination behaviour as observed by NMR spectroscopy and supported by DFT calculations. In particular the [Ni&#8208;CO2&#8208;Fe] representative replicates the respective entity in an intermediate formed during CO2&#8208;conversion by the enzyme [Ni,Fe]&#8208;CODH in many ways (structure, spectroscopic properties, reactivity). Our investigations reveal that transition metal ions reduce the reduction potential of the carbonite unit but increase its tendency to undergo C&#8722;O bond cleavage. This may explain the choice of an iron(II) ion instead of a s&#8208; or p&#8208;block&#8208;based Lewis acid as part of the active site.

         <title>Organic Crystal with Anti&#8208;Stokes Photoluminescent Excitation and Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Features</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two thermal activation processes, anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence and delayed fluorescence bolster in crystalized DPQ&#8208;DPAC. The organic crystals demonstrate dual capabilities of hot band absorption with a notable 0.1&#8197;eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift emission and efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence performance. Conformational changes of the crystalized DPQ&#8208;DPAC molecule are identified for such properties.







Abstract
Thermal activation process utilizes environmental thermal energy to help supplement energy for the nonspontaneous energy&#8208;consuming upconversion physical transitions with positive free energy change (&#916;G&gt;0). Reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) and hot band absorption are two kinds of thermal activation transitions. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with rISC have significantly propelled advancements in organic semiconductors. Hot band absorption, enables anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence, offering a promising route for efficient photon upconversion. In this work, we constructed a crystal consisting of a donor&#8208;acceptor type TADF molecule, DPQ&#8208;DPAC, demonstrating dual thermal activation properties of hot band absorption with a notable 0.1&#8197;eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift emission and proficient TADF performance. Only in the crystal TADF efficiency facilitates and the photoluminescence quantum yield elevates to an impressive 90.8&#8201;%. Combining the extended absorption spectrum, these enhancements collectively realize anti&#8208;Stokes photoluminescence in crystal. Experimental and theoretical results on the DPQ&#8208;DPAC crystal indicate optimizations in its conformational and vibrational modes, resulting in enhancements to its properties. This finding provides insight into crafting organic materials with thermally activated functionalities and contributes to fully exploiting the potential of organic materials, further advancing versatile materials applications.

         <title>Coordinative Self&#8208;assembly of &#960;&#8208;Electron Magnetic Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold&#8208;coordinated polymers of &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins were fabricated by on&#8208;surface synthesis and coordination chemistry methods. Each porphyrinoid monomer features antiferromagnetic coupling and no interaction between nearest neighbors within the polymer backbone, behaving as a single magnetic entity.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Electron magnetic compounds on surfaces have emerged as a powerful platform to interrogate spin interactions at the atomic scale, with great potential in spintronics and quantum technologies. A key challenge is organizing these compounds over large length scales, while elucidating their resulting magnetic properties. Herein, we offer a relevant contribution toward this objective, which consists of using on&#8208;surface synthesis coupled with coordination chemistry to promote the self&#8208;assembly of &#960;&#8208;electron magnetic porphyrin species. A porphyrin precursor equipped with carbonitrile moieties in a trans arrangement was prepared by solution synthesis and deposited on Au(111)/mica. Depending on the specific growth protocol, surface&#8208;promoted reactions led to the transformation of the precursor into non&#8208;magnetic Au&#8208;CN coordinated porphyrin monomers, covalent porphyrin dimers, and one&#8208;dimensional porphyrin polymers (based on porphyrin monomers or covalent porphyrin dimers), as revealed by scanning probe microscopy studies combined with theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the scanning tunneling microscopy tip could convert such closed&#8208;shell porphyrin units into open&#8208;shell species by the removal of some peripheral hydrogen atoms. The magnetic features (i.e., singlet or triplet ground state) of the porphyrin units comprising the polymers were investigated for polymers of different lengths. No magnetic exchange coupling between adjacent units was observed, suggesting protection of the magnetic entities.

         <title>Reaction Pathway Regulation for Gaseous and Liquid Products of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction under Adsorbate Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction pathways of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction for gaseous and liquid products were regulated on well&#8208;defined Ag/Cu catalysts with controlled chlorination, influenced by the lateral adsorbate of *OCHO intermediate. The Ag/AgCl can convert CO2 into CO with a high selectivity, while Cl&#8722;Ag/Cu catalyst enables the conversion of CO2 into liquid products including formate and ethanol with a total Faradaic efficiency nearing 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Halide anion adsorption on transition metals can improve the performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), while the specific reaction mechanisms governing selective CO2RR pathways remain unclear. In this study, we reveal for the first time the distinct pathway switching between gaseous (CO) and liquid products (formate and ethanol) on the well&#8208;defined Ag&#8722;Cu nanostructures with controlled chlorination. We show that CO2 conversion to CO on Ag/AgCl can be tuned by adjusting the thickness of AgCl layer, achieving a high selectivity over a broad potential range in a 0.5&#8197;M KHCO3 using flow cell. In contrast, the optimized Cl&#8722;Ag/Cu system enables the conversion of CO2 into liquid products including formate and ethanol with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) nearing 100&#8201;%, delivering high current densities of 136.3 and 20.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.3&#8197;V, respectively. In situ infrared experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the lateral adsorbate of *OCHO intermediate facilitates the thermodynamics of both the CO pathway on Cl&#8722;Ag(111) and the formate pathway on Cl&#8722;Ag/Cu(111) by reducing Gibbs free energy barriers of each potential&#8208;limit step. This work uncovers the role of chlorination in the tuning of C&#8208;bound or O&#8208;bound intermediates during CO2RR on Ag&#8722;Cu catalysts, determining the reaction pathway under lateral adsorbate effects.

         <title>Negative Thermal Expansion Behavior Enabling Good Electrochemical&#8208;Energy&#8208;Storage Performance at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical energy&#8208;storage materials with negative&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (NTE) behavior can enable good low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, which becomes a new and effective strategy to tackle the low&#8208;temperature issue of metal&#8208;ion batteries. When the operation temperature decreases, the lattice parameters of an NTE material increases, leading to its fast ion diffusivity, high electrochemical kinetics, high rate capability, and good cycling stability at low temperatures.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;ion batteries (such as lithium&#8208;ion batteries) are very popular energy&#8208;storage devices nowadays. However, low temperatures cause their poor electrochemical kinetics and performance, significantly limiting their wide applications in cold environments. Here, we propose that electrochemical energy&#8208;storage materials with negative&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (NTE) behavior can enable good low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, which becomes a new strategy to tackle the low&#8208;temperature issues of metal&#8208;ion batteries. LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP) with an a&#8208;direction thermal expansion coefficient of &#8722;1.1&#215;10&#8722;&#8197;K&#8722;1 is used as a model material. As the temperature decreases, the transverse vibration of O atoms not only increases the transverse distances among O atoms connected to Li/Ti atoms, but also widens the Li+&#8208;transport channels and enlarges the Li+&#8208;insertion sites along the [12

1&#8254;

 ${\bar{1}}$



] direction, which are mainly controlled by the lattice parameter a. Consequently, carbon&#8208;coated LTP (C&#8211;LTP) retains good electrochemical performance at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C, including fast Li+ diffusivity (84&#8201;% of that at 25&#8201;&#176;C), large capacity (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), and superior rate capability (83&#8201;% capacity retention at 5&#8197;C vs. 0.5&#8197;C). Moreover, the more open crystal structure of LTP at the lower temperature allows smaller maximum unit&#8208;cell&#8208;volume expansion, resulting in better cycling stability of C&#8211;LTP at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C (96.8&#8201;% capacity retention over 1000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C).

         <title>Structural Bifurcation in the High&#8594;Low&#8208;Spin and Low&#8594;High&#8208;Spin Phase Transitions Explains the Asymmetric Spin&#8208;Crossover in [FeL2][BF4]2 (L=2,6&#8208;Di{pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl}isonicotinonitrile)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The title compound exhibits a cooperative spin&#8208;transition with an unusual asymmetric hysteresis. It crystallizes as a mixture of two high&#8208;spin polymorphs HS1 and HS2, which convert simultaneously to the low&#8208;spin phases LS3 and LS4 on cooling. The HS1 and LS3 fractions increase at the expense of HS2 and LS4 upon repeated scanning, which reflects that HS2 converts to a mixture of LS3 and LS4 on cooling, and LS4 to HS1 and HS2 on rewarming.







Abstract
Polycrystalline [FeL2][BF4]2 (L=2,6&#8208;di(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)isonicotinonitrile) exhibits an abrupt hysteretic spin transition near 240&#8197;K, with a shoulder on the warming branch whose appearance depends on the sample history. The freshly isolated material is a ca 60&#8201;:&#8201;40 mixture of triclinic (HS1) and tetragonal (HS2) high&#8208;spin polymorphs, which are structurally closely related. Both HS1 and HS2 undergo a high&#8594;low&#8208;spin transition on cooling at 230&#177;10&#8197;K. HS1 transforms to a new triclinic low&#8208;spin phase with a doubled unit cell volume (LS3), while HS2 forms a monoclinic low&#8208;spin phase (LS4) with similar unit cell dimensions to HS2. Single crystals of LS3 and LS4 both convert to HS1 on rewarming. The low&#8594;high&#8208;spin transition for LS4 is ca 10&#8197;K higher in temperature than for LS3, explaining the asymmetric thermal hysteresis. Powder diffraction, calorimetry and magnetic data show that multiple cycling about the spin&#8208;transition leads to slow enrichment of the HS1 and LS3 phases at the expense of HS2 and LS4. That is consistent with the HS2/LS4 fraction of the polycrystalline sample undergoing rare, bifurcated HS2&#8594;(LS3+LS4) and LS4&#8594;(HS1+HS2) phase transitions. The rate of enrichment of HS1/LS3 differed between these experiments, implying it is sample and/or measurement&#8208;dependent. Three other salts of this iron(II) complex and the coordination polymer [Ag(&#956;&#8208;L)]BF4 are also briefly described.

         <title>Regulated Li+ Solvation via Competitive Coordination Mechanism of Organic Cations for High Voltage and Fast Charging Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic cation with multiple cationic sites was introduced into electrolyte to attract solvent molecules and anions away from Li+ through electrostatic interactions resulting in enhanced Li+ transport kinetics and desolvation process.







Abstract
Li+ solvation exerted a decisive effect on electrolyte physicochemical properties. Suitable tuning for Li+ solvation enabled batteries to achieve unexpected performance. Here, we introduced inert organic cations to compete with Li+ for combining electrolyte molecules to modulate Li+ coordination in the electrolyte. The relevance between the number of cationic sites in organic cations and the competitive solvation ability was explored. The organic cations with multiple cationic sites attracted solvent molecules and anions away from Li+ to form new solvated shell, improving the Li+ transport kinetics and desolvation process in electrolyte while enhancing electrolyte oxidation tolerance. Moreover, electrostatic shielding provided by organic cations and anion&#8208;derived robust SEI promoted uniform and rapid Li+ deposition on Li electrodes. With the positive effect of organic cations, Li||LiCoO2 (LCO) batteries showed high specific capacity (136.46&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) at high charge/discharge rate (10&#8197;C). Furthermore, Li||LCO batteries exhibited good capacity retention (70&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles) at 4.6&#8197;V charge cut&#8208;off voltage. This work provides fresh insights for the optimization of electrolytes and battery performance.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Silacyclobutanes with Alkenes: Mimicking the Reactivity and Reversing the Selectivity Towards Late Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the first example of Ti&#8208;catalyzed reactions of SCBs with alkenes. Selective activation of the C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond was achieved in the case of benzosilacyclobutenes, a selectivity that has rarely been achieved using other metals. Even for silacyclobutanes with C(sp3)&#8722;Si bonds only, our system also shows complementary selectivity to give distinct products. Structurally varied SCBs and alkenes were reacted in our system to afford diverse silicon&#8208;containing products that are otherwise difficult to obtain.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed ring opening and expansion reactions of silacyclobutanes (SCBs) constitute an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical strategy to construct value&#8208;added silicon&#8208;containing chemicals. Despite extensive studies, the reaction of SCBs with simple alkenes has only one precedent. Moreover, most reported reactions of SCBs use late transition metals (Pd, Ni, Rh) as catalysts. By contrast, there are no reports of using early transition metals. Herein, we report the first example, to our knowledge, of early&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions of SCBs using earth's second abundant titanium as a catalyst. Notably, orthogonal selectivity was observed. Selective activation of the relatively inert C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond was achieved in the case of benzosilacyclobutenes, a selectivity that has rarely been achieved using other metals. Even for silacyclobutanes with C(sp3)&#8722;Si bonds only, our titanium system also shows complementary selectivity towards late transition metals to give distinct products. Thus, structurally varied SCBs and alkenes were reacted in our system to afford structurally diverse silicon&#8208;containing products that are otherwise difficult to obtain using other transition metals.

         <title>Non&#8208;Canonical C16 Homoterpene Biosynthesis Widespread in Actinobacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first biosynthetic pathway to C16 homoterpenes in actinobacteria is reported. A novel methyltransferase family mediates methylation and double bond isomerization to produce a modified C16 precursor. Subsequent conversion by a distinct terpene cyclase family yields unprecedented homoterpenes. The findings enable the development of novel biocatalytic strategies to explore and exploit the biological and pharmaceutical effect of terpene methylations.







Abstract
A novel biosynthetic pathway towards the rare and underexplored non&#8208;canonical family of homoterpenes was discovered in actinobacteria through targeted genome mining and enzymatic in vitro reconstitution. The pathway comprises initial methylation&#8208;induced double bond isomerization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to (2E,7E)&#8208;6&#8208;methyl&#8208;farnesyl diphosphate, catalyzed by a novel family of methyltransferases with unique dual function. The resulting linear C16 double bond isomer of FPP constitutes the specific substrate for a distinct family of type&#8197;I terpene cyclases, catalyzing diverse cyclization reactions. Functional characterization of nine enzyme pairs led to discovery of five unprecedented homoterpene natural products. The enzymological novelty enables the development of novel biocatalytic and genetically programmable synthetic strategies towards methylated terpenoids with potentially unique properties (&#8220;magic methyl effect&#8221;).

         <title>Linker Installation in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Enhanced Quantitative Redox Species Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linker installation has proven to be an effective strategy for introducing diverse functional groups into metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Reductants and oxidants are found in various environments, but their accumulation poses a danger due to their high reactivity, necessitating prompt monitoring instantly, particularly in natural environments and industrial processes. In this study, a series of redox&#8208;active dyes were successfully incorporated into a flexible Zr&#8208;based MOF, PCN&#8208;700, through linker installation strategy. Notably, both the reduction of PCN&#8208;700&#8208;Resazurin towards oxidants and oxidation of PCN&#8208;700&#8208;Amplex Red towards reductants result in the formation of PCN&#8208;700&#8208;Resorufin, which exhibit visible color changes and largely elevated luminescent intensities, giving rise to the quantitative recognition of reductants and oxidants. This work presents a straightforward approach to developing efficient luminescent sensors for the rapid qualitative and quantitative detection of reductants and oxidants, extending the sensing mechanism from common energy transfer to electron transfer and demonstrating the MOF&#8217;s versability as a highly designable sensing material for target analytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Multiscale&#8208;Assembly for Directional and Hierarchical Growth of Highly Oriented Porous Organic Cage Single&#8208;Crystal Microtubes and Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The directional assembly of porous organic molecules into long&#8208;range ordered architectures, featuring controlled hierarchical porosity and oriented pore channels with defined spatial arrangements, is a fundamental challenge in chemistry and materials science. Herein, using porous organic cages as starting units, we present a cooperative multiscale&#8208;assembly strategy enabling the simultaneous alignment of pore channels and directional hierarchical growth in a single step. At the microscopic level, we employed double solvents to manipulate the intermolecular packing of microporous tetrahedral [4+6] imine cages (CC1 and CC3), resulting in pore channel orientation. Concurrently, at the mesoscopic level, convective flow in the double&#8208;solvent system directed the spatial distribution of nuclei species, followed by diffusion limited growth, leading to the directional formation of single&#8208;crystal microtubes. By precisely controlling the direction of convective flow, the nanocages were successfully organized into 2D and 3D single&#8208;crystal microtube arrays while maintaining oriented micropores. This hierarchical porous architecture enhanced mass transfer, as confirmed by adsorption measurements. Interestingly, such 3D hierarchical microtube arrays can be utilized to immobilize Pd clusters and enzymes (lipase or Glucose oxidase) within the micro&#8208; and macropores, respectively, showing a 3.8&#8208; to 4&#8208;fold enhancement in one&#8208;pot tandem reaction activity compared to physical mixtures of individual analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Cleavage and Reassembly of 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyls with Enaminones To Synthesize Highly Functionalized&#160;Naphthols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds and their subsequent reassembly into highly functionalized and useful molecules in an atom&#8208;efficient manner has always been a central focus in the realm of organic synthesis. In this report, we describe the construction of highly functionalized naphthol esters via a tandem reassembly process, driven by Ullmann&#8208;type coupling of enaminones and 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds. Mechanistic investigations suggest the involvement of C(sp&#178;)&#8208;C(sp&#179;) coupling, cyclization, two acyl migrations, aromatization, and additional transformations within this tandem sequence. This methodology offers several notable advantages, such as the use of inexpensive and easily accessible starting materials, the elimination of the need for expensive transition metal catalysis, simple operation in the atmosphere, exceptional compatibility with a wide range of substrates, and ease of conversion into drug scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Program&#8208;Modulated Kinetics of Perovskite&#8208;Film Growth by Molecular "Thruster"&#160;for High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>The rapid reaction between lead iodide (PbI2) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) complicates the fabrication of high&#8208;quality formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) films. Conventional methods, such as using nonvolatile small molecular additives to slow the reaction, often result in buried interfacial voids and molecule diffusion, compromising the devices' operational stability. In this study, we introduced a molecular &#8220;thruster&#8221;&#8212;a hypervalent iodine (III) compound with three carbonyl groups and a C&#8211;&#8211;I&#8314; bond&#8212;that possesses&#160;coordination and dissociation abilities, enabling programed modulation of perovskite&#8208;film growth kinetics. Initially, the three carbonyl groups coordinate with PbI2 to slow the reaction between FAI and PbI2, preventing &#948;&#8208;phase&#160;formation. As temperature rises, the C&#8211;&#8211;I&#8314; bond dissociates, promoting perovskite growth and the dissociated product iodobenzene will promote solvent volatilization, thus avoiding buried interfacial voids. Another product, a carbene compound with eight lone pair electrons sufficiently passivate the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects and anchors at grain boundaries without diffusion. Consequently, the resultant FAPbI3 film displays&#160;high&#8208;quality with enhanced phase purity, compact morphology, and reduced defects. Evidently, 0.062&#8208; and 1.004&#8208;cm2 pero&#8208;SCs achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 26.06% (25.79% certified) and 24.65%, respectively. This approach also&#160;controls perovskite&#8208;film growth on plastic substrates, resulting in flexible pero&#8208;SCs with an impressive PCE of 25.12%.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Constructed Core&#8208;shell Catalyst Enabling Subzero Capacity Unlocking of Cost&#8208;effective and Long&#8208;life Vanadium Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vanadium flow battery (VFB) promises a route for achieving grid&#8208;scale power storage by harnessing renewable energy sources. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of vanadium redox couples and serious hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) still restrict the further development of VFB. Addressing these challenges requires not only effective solutions but also ones that are cost&#8208;efficient and scalable to meet the demands of affordable energy storage. Here, we present an in&#8208;situ constructed Cu@Cu6Sn5 core&#8208;shell catalyst by incorporating metal ions into the electrolyte. The Cu core, encapsulated by the Cu6Sn5 shell, forms an excellent conductive pathway to the graphite felt electrode. Charge transfer between Cu and Sn within Cu6Sn5 shell accelerates the reaction kinetics of V2+/V3+ redox couple and selectively inhibits HER, as confirmed through in&#8208;situ weak measurement imaging method. The Cu@Cu6Sn5 battery achieves a peak power density of 1119.1 mW cm&#8208;2 at 1350 mA cm&#8208;2, operates stably for 1200 cycles without catalyst failure, and is available over a wide&#8208;temperature range. Furthermore, we identify a demand of subzero capacity unlocking. Achieving a 23.4% theoretical capacity unlocking at &#8208;10 &#176;C with a cut&#8208;off voltage up to 1.75 V, bespeaking a crucial breakthrough toward cost&#8208;effective VFB.</dc:description>

Achieving a 23.4% theoretical capacity unlocking at -10 &#176;C with a cut-off voltage up to 1.75 V, bespeaking a crucial breakthrough toward cost-effective VFB.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluoromethyl Triflate and Fluoromethyl Fluorosulfonate: Easily Accessible and Powerful Fluoromethylation Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoromethyl triflate (superfluoromethyl, SFM, FCH2OSO2CF3) and fluoromethyl fluorosulfonate (magic fluoromethyl, MFM, FCH2OSO2F) are two easily synthesized, highly effective and non&#8208;ozone depleting fluoromethylation reagents. They are analogous to the well&#8208;known and widely used methylation re&#173;agents CH3OSO2CF3 and CH3OSO2F. Both SFM and MFM have been fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 17O, 19F, 33S). Their structures have been determined in the solid state on in situ grown crystals by X&#8208;ray diff&#173;raction and in the gas phase by electron diffraction. The fluoromethylation efficiency of SFM and MFM was shown by reaction with chalcogen nucleophiles of differing nucleophilicity. All fluoromethylated products were isolated as pure com&#173;pounds and charac&#173;terized by NMR and vibrational spec&#173;troscopy, as well as in some cases by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering of HO&#8211;Zn&#8211;N2 Active Sites in Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks for Enhanced (Photo)Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, lack of ways to engineer specific and well&#8208;defined active sites in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) limits our fundamental knowledge with respect to the mechanistic details for (photo)electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we introduce the open metal sites into ZIFs through the selective ligand removal (SeLiRe) strategy, comprehensively characterize the altered structural and electronic features, and evaluate their role in HER. In&#8208;situ electrochemical analysis and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal the formation of high&#8208;valence HO&#8722;Zn&#8722;N2 sites through the binding of Zn&#8722;N2 with electrolyte hydroxide. The optimal OMS&#8208;ZIF exhibits a low overpotential of 0.41 V to achieve an ampere&#8208;level 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 with 120&#8208;hour stability. Theoretical simulations indicate that these active sites accelerate the water molecules activation kinetics, consequently enhancing the efficiency of the Volmer step. This work demonstrates a versatile strategy to introduce highly active catalytic sites in ZIFs, providing new insights into the electrocatalytic mechanism in alkaline media.</dc:description>

         <title>New Thermoplastic Elastomers based on Ethylene&#8208;Butadiene&#8208;Rubber (EBR) by Switching from Anionic to Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefin triblock copolymers based on glassy polystyrene (PS), ethylene butadiene rubber (EBR) and highly crystalline polyethylene (PE) segments were prepared for the first time using a switch strategy from anionic polymerization to coordinative chain transfer (co)polymerization (CCT(co)P). PS chains obtained by anionic polymerization were transmetalated with mesitylmagnesium bromide (BrMgMes) to act as macromolecular chain transfer agents (macro&#8208;CTA, PS&#8208;MgMes) in the CCTcoP of ethylene and butadiene using {Me2Si(C13H8)2Nd(BH4)2Li(THF)}2 complex (1). Further chain extension by CCTP using pure ethylene in the monomer feed afforded well&#8208;defined PS&#8208;b&#8208;EBR&#8208;b&#8208;PE triblock copolymers. The structural, rheological and mechanical properties of these materials demonstrate excellent balance between properties and easy processability at moderate temperatures (&gt; 150 &#176;C). We demonstrate that such triblock copolymers behave effectively as low&#8208;viscosity PS&#8208;b&#8208;EBR diblock copolymers above the melting point of PE domains and high performance thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) upon crystallization of PE segments.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical S&#8208;adenosyl methionine enzymes catalyze a diverse repertoire of post&#8208;translational modifications in protein and peptide substrates. Among these, an exceptional and mechanistically obscure example is the installation of &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino acid residues by formal excision of a tyrosine&#8208;derived tyramine unit. The responsible spliceases are key maturases in a widespread family of natural products termed spliceotides that comprise potent protease inhibitors, with the installed &#946;&#8208;residues being crucial for bioactivity. Here, we established the in vitro activity of the model splicease PcpXY to interrogate the mechanism of non&#8208;canonical protein splicing. Identification of shunt and coproducts, deuterium labeling studies, and density functional theory energy calculations of hypothesized intermediates support a mechanism involving hydrogen abstraction at tyrosine C&#945; as the initial site of peptide radical formation and release of 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde as the tyrosine&#8208;derived coproduct. The data illuminate key features of this unprecedented radical&#8208;mediated biotransformation yielding ketoamide pharmacophores that are also present in peptidomimetic therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Partially Interstitial Silicon&#8208;Implanted Ruthenium as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To enhance the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it is crucial, yet challenging, to fundamentally understand and rationally modulate potential catalytic sites. In this study, we confirm that despite calculating a low water dissociation energy barrier and an appropriate H adsorption free energy (&#916;G*H) at Ru&#8208;top sites, metallic Ru exhibits a relatively inferior activity for the alkaline HER. This is primarily because the Ru&#8208;top sites, which are potential H adsorption sites, are recessive catalytic sites, compared with the adjacent Ru&#8208;hollow sites that have a strong &#916;G*H. To promote the transformation of Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites, interstitial Si atoms are implanted into the hollow sites. However, complete interstitial implantation leads to a high water dissociation energy barrier at the RuSi intermetallic surface. Thus, we present a partial interstitial incorporation strategy to form a Ru&#8211;RuSi heterostructure that not only converts the Ru&#8208;top sites from recessive to dominant catalytic sites but also preserves the low water dissociation energy barrier at the Ru surface. Moreover, the spontaneously formed built&#8208;in electric fields bidirectionally optimize the adsorption ability of the Ru sites, thereby greatly reducing the thermodynamic energy barrier and enhancing the alkaline HER.</dc:description>

         <title>Anionic Doping in Layered Transition Metal Chalcogenides for Robust Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are among the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies. However, a slow Li&#8208;S reaction kinetics at the LSB cathode limit their energy and power densities. To address these challenges, this study introduces an anionic&#8208;doped transition metal chalcogenide as an effective catalyst to accelerate the Li&#8208;S reaction. Specifically, a tellurium&#8208;doped, carbon&#8208;supported bismuth selenide with Se vacancies (Te&#8208;Bi2Se3&#8208;x@C) is prepared and tested as a sulfur host in LSB cathodes. X&#8208;ray absorption and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that Te doping induces lattice distortions and modulates the local coordination environment and electronic structure of Bi atoms to promote the catalytic activity toward the conversion of polysulfides. Additionally, the generated Se vacancies alter the electronic structure around atomic defect sites, increase the carrier concentration, and activate unpaired cations to effectively trap polysulfides. As a result, LSBs based on Te&#8208;Bi2Se3&#8208;x@C/S cathodes demonstrate outstanding specific capacities of 1508 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, excellent rate performance with 655 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 at 5C, and near&#8208;integral cycle stability over 1000 cycles. Furthermore, under high sulfur loading of 6.4 mg&#183;cm&#8208;2, a cathode capacity exceeding 8 mAh&#183;cm&#8208;2 is sustained at 0.1C current rate, with 6.4 mAh&#183;cm&#8208;2 retained after 300 cycles under lean electrolyte conditions (6.8 &#956;L&#183;mg&#8208;1).</dc:description>

Furthermore, under high sulfur loading of 6.4 mg&#183;cm-2, a cathode capacity exceeding 8 mAh&#183;cm-2 is sustained at 0.1C current rate, with 6.4 mAh&#183;cm-2 retained after 300 cycles under lean electrolyte conditions (6.8 &#956;L&#183;mg-1).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) have recently garnered significant research interest as versatile precursors for synthesizing potential [n.1.1] bioisosteres and multi&#8208;functionalized cyclobutanes in a straightforward and atom&#8208;economical manner. Here, we report a solvent&#8208;dependent divergent cyclization of BCBs that providecs highly diastereospecific decorated cyclobutanes and oxygen&#8208;containing bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (BCHeps), which serve as bioisosteres of meta&#8208;substituted arenes. This novel strategy employs precision&#8208;oriented control to achieve the desired divergence. Additionally, an unprecedented 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization reaction mode for BCBs was explore, expanding the available methods for efficiently exploring the chemical space of arene bioisosteres and highly functionalized cyclobutanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Self&#8208;assembly from Two&#8208;dimensional Nanosheets to Spiral, Twisted and Branched Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of nanomaterials into hierarchical structure is of great interest to fabricate functional materials. However, programmable design of the assembled structures remains a great challenge. Herein, we reported a programmable self&#8208;assembly strategy to customize the assembled structure. The self&#8208;assembly strategy is designed to orderly transform the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Ca ions assembled F127 nanosheets (Ca&#8208;F127 NSs) into spiral nanosheet structures (S&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs), branched nanosheet structures (B&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs), branched&#8208;spiral nanosheet structures (B&#8208;S&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs), and twisted&#8208;branched structures (T&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NBs). Wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) indicate that these different structures maintain the same orthorhombic phase and Ca&#8208;O octahedral coordination structure. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) in the double&#8208;tilt liquid nitrogen cooling holder identifies the Eshelby twist in the twisted structures, demonstrating the spiral structure are formed by screw dislocation growth. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) proves the oriented epitaxial growth in the B&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs. Furthermore, the formation mechanisms of spiral structure and branched structure can be recombined to form complex hierarchical structures. The epitaxial growth along screw dislocation can lead to the formation of B&#8208;S&#8208;Ca&#8208;F127 NSs, while the twisted epitaxial growth in the screw dislocation can lead to the formation of T&#8208;Ca F127 NBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Starfish&#8208;Inspired Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;ion Conductive Membrane with Balanced Rigidity and Flexibility for Ultrastable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional &#8220;starfish&#8208;type&#8221; solid&#8208;state electrolyte film (PAN/MOFs/ILs) with balanced rigidity and flexibility was developed, demonstrating excellent ionic conductivity (~4.37&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature), a wide electrochemical window (~5.34&#8197;V), uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, and a high transference number (~0.69). Consequently, the LiFePO4/CPEs/Li cell achieved ultrastable cycling performance, retaining 90.1&#8201;% capacity after 2100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C.







Abstract
The performance of solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (SSLMB) is often constrained by the low ionic conductivity, narrow electrochemical window, and insufficient mechanical strength of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes. Inspired by the soft&#8208;outside, rigid&#8208;inside structure of starfish, we designed multifunctional &#8220;starfish&#8208;type&#8221; composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) using electrospinning technology. These CPEs feature a three&#8208;dimensional rigid skeleton network composed of polyacrylonitrile/metal&#8211;organic frameworks/ionic liquids (PAN/MOFs/ILs), creating continuous and efficient Li+ transport channels: MOFs impart rigidity, PEO acts as a cushioning outer layer to enhance interfacial compatibility, and ILs reduce interfacial resistance. The resulting CPEs exhibited excellent ionic conductivity (4.37&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), a wide electrochemical window (5.34&#8197;V), uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, and a high transference number (0.69). Leveraging these synergistic advantages, the Li/CPEs/Li symmetric cell demonstrated outstanding dendrite suppression for over 1300&#8197;hours, and the LiFePO4/CPEs/Li cell retained 90.1&#8201;% capacity after 2100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C, which is the best performance reported for SSLMB with MOF/PEO. The formation of multi&#8208;component solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase and its role in stabilizing lithium metal cycling were systematically elucidated through theoretical simulations and spectroscopic analysis. This nature&#8208;inspired design provides a promising strategy for the development of stable solid&#8208;state electrolytes with extended lifespans.

         <title>Evolution of Interfacial Hydration Structure Induced by Ion Condensation and Correlation Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using 3D&#8208;AFM, the concentration&#8208;dependent evolution of interfacial hydration structure in multivalent ionic solutions is observed, including interlayer thickenning and hydration force increasement. Theory and simulations identify strong ion condensation and correlation effects, driven by multivalence, as the underlying mechanisms. These phenomena exhibit universality across different substrates and multivalent ions, and are crucial for fields including electrochemistry and colloid chemistry.







Abstract
Interfacial hydration structures are crucial in wide&#8208;ranging applications, including battery, colloid, lubrication. Multivalent ions like Mg2+ and La3+ show irreplaceable roles in these applications, which are hypothesized due to their unique interfacial hydration structures. However, this hypothesis lacks experimental supports. Here, we provide the first observation for their interfacial hydration structures with molecular resolution using atomic force microscopy. We observed the evolution of layered hydration structures at La(NO3)3 solution&#8208;mica interfaces. As concentration increases from 25&#8197;mM to 2&#8197;M, the layer number varies from 2 to 1 and back to 2, and the interlayer thickness rises from 0.25&#177;0.05 to 0.34&#177;0.03&#8197;nm, with hydration force increasing from 0.27&#177;0.07 to 1.04&#177;0.24&#8197;nN. Theory and molecular simulation reveal that the cations form inner&#8208;sphere complexes. Multivalence induces concentration&#8208;dependent ion condensation and correlation effects, resulting in compositional and structural evolution within interfacial hydration structures. Additional experiments at seven different solid&#8211;liquid interfaces together with literature comparison confirm the universality of this mechanism for both multivalent and monovalent ions. New factors affecting interfacial hydration structures are revealed, including concentration and solvent dielectric constant. This insight provides guidance for designing interfacial hydration structures to optimize solid&#8211;liquid&#8208;interphase for battery life extension, modulate colloid stability and develop efficient lubricants.

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of IrB1.15 Nanocrystals for Efficient Chlorine and Hydrogen Evolution Reactions in Saline Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermetallic compounds of IrB1.15 have been successfully synthesized by ultrafast Joule heating at 900&#8201;&#176;C for a duration of 12&#8197;seconds, showcasing their robust electrocatalytic performance in acidic saline water media for both chlorine and hydrogen evolution reactions.







Abstract
The production of storable hydrogen fuel through water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources such as solar, marine, geothermal, and wind energy presents a promising pathway toward achieving energy sustainability. Nevertheless, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolysis requires support from ancillary processes which often incur financial and energy costs. Developing electrolysers capable of directly operating with water that contains impurities can circumvent these processes. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient and durable electrolysis of saline water to produce chlorine gas (Cl2) and hydrogen using structurally ordered IrB1.15, synthesized through ultrafast joule heating. IrB1.15 exhibits remarkable performance, achieving overpotentials of 75&#8197;mV for the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and 12&#8197;mV for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at current densities of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, IrB1.15 displays a durability of over 90&#8197;h towards both CER and HER. Density functional theory reveals that IrB1.15 has adsorption energies significantly closer to 0&#8197;eV for Cl and H, compared to IrO2 and Pt/C. Furthermore, in situ Raman investigations reveal that Ir in IrB1.15 serves as the active center for CER, while the introduction of B atoms to Ir lattices mitigates the formation of absorbed hydrogen species on the Ir surface, thereby enhancing the performance of IrB1.15 in HER.

&lt;p&gt;Intermetallic compounds of IrB&lt;sub&gt;1.15&lt;/sub&gt; have been successfully synthesized by ultrafast Joule heating at 900&#8201;&#176;C for a duration of 12&#8197;seconds, showcasing their robust electrocatalytic performance in acidic saline water media for both chlorine and hydrogen evolution reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production of storable hydrogen fuel through water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources such as solar, marine, geothermal, and wind energy presents a promising pathway toward achieving energy sustainability. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art electrolysis requires support from ancillary processes which often incur financial and energy costs. Developing electrolysers capable of directly operating with water that contains impurities can circumvent these processes. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient and durable electrolysis of saline water to produce chlorine gas (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and hydrogen using structurally ordered IrB&lt;sub&gt;1.15&lt;/sub&gt;, synthesized through ultrafast joule heating. IrB&lt;sub&gt;1.15&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits remarkable performance, achieving overpotentials of 75&#8197;mV for the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and 12&#8197;mV for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at current densities of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, IrB&lt;sub&gt;1.15&lt;/sub&gt; displays a durability of over 90&#8197;h towards both CER and HER. Density functional theory reveals that IrB&lt;sub&gt;1.15&lt;/sub&gt; has adsorption energies significantly closer to 0&#8197;eV for Cl and H, compared to IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Pt/C. Furthermore, in situ Raman investigations reveal that Ir in IrB&lt;sub&gt;1.15&lt;/sub&gt; serves as the active center for CER, while the introduction of B atoms to Ir lattices mitigates the formation of absorbed hydrogen species on the Ir surface, thereby enhancing the performance of IrB&lt;sub&gt;1.15&lt;/sub&gt; in HER.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization in a Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

A novel electrocatalytic strategy in composite solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (CPEs) is presented. By tuning the coupling strength between d and p orbitals of inorganic fillers, identified by the newly developed &#955; descriptor through density functional theory calculations and machine learning, the incorporation of titanium single atoms into ZIF&#8208;8 significantly promotes lithium salt dissociation and enhances CPEs&#8217; electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Regulating lithium salt dissociation kinetics by enhancing the interaction between inorganic fillers and lithium salts is vital for enhancing the ionic conductivity in solid&#8208;state composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). However, the influence of fillers&#8217; external electronic environments on lithium salt dissociation dynamics remains unclear. Here, we design single&#8208;atom sites in metal&#8211;organic framework fillers for poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based CPEs, boosting lithium salt dissociation through an electrocatalytic strategy. This strategy enhances lithium&#8208;ion conductivity by tuning the coupling strength between the d and p orbitals of the fillers, as captured by a newly identified descriptor (&#955;) via high&#8208;throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning. The optimal single atom (Ti) sites are incorporated into a ZIF&#8208;8 matrix for PEO&#8208;based CPEs, achieving an ionic conductivity exceeding 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the electrolyte forms a robust solid electrolyte interphase and is compatible with LiCoO2, LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2, and sulfur cathodes. Consequently, the solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery with the electrolyte demonstrates excellent cycling stability, maintaining performance over 5000 cycles at 10&#8197;C with LiFePO4 cathodes and stable operation at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. These findings highlight the transformative potential of engineering d&#8208;p orbital hybridization by incorporating single&#8208;atom sites into inorganic fillers for designing highly ion&#8208;conductive CPEs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide&#8208;Derived Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) Nanoparticles for Tumor&#8208;Targeted and Durable PD&#8208;L1 Degradation in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC nanoparticles (PT&#8208;NPs) are synthesized through peptide self&#8208;assembly, including anti&#8208;PD&#8722;L1 peptide, self&#8208;assembling linker and E3 ligase recruiter. The PT&#8208;NPs utilize multivalent binding for PD&#8722;L1&#8208;targeted endocytosis, effective degrading PD&#8722;L1 receptors in tumor cells via dual degradation mechanisms: direct lysosomal degradation and PROTAC&#8208;mediated degradation, offering a potent approach to cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are a promising technique for the specific and durable degradation of cancer&#8208;related proteins via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system in cancer treatment. However, the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs is restricted due to their hydrophobicity, poor cell permeability and insufficient tumor&#8208;targeting ability. Herein, we develop the self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC nanoparticles (PT&#8208;NPs) for precise and durable programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8722;L1) degradation in targeted tumors. The PT&#8208;NPs with an average size of 211.8&#8197;nm are formed through the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC (CLQKTPKQC&#8208;FF&#8208;ALAPYIP), comprising a PD&#8722;L1&#8208;targeting &#8216;CLQKTPKQC&#8217;, self&#8208;assembling linker &#8216;FF&#8217; and E3 ligase recruiting &#8216;ALAPYIP&#8217;. Particularly, PT&#8208;NPs strongly bind to tumor cell surface PD&#8722;L1 to form PD&#8722;L1/PT&#8208;NPs complex, then internalized through receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and degraded in lysosomes. Second, free PROTACs released from PT&#8208;NPs to the cytoplasm further induce the durable proteolysis of cytoplasmic PD&#8722;L1 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. In colon tumor models, intravenously injected PT&#8208;NPs accumulate significantly at targeted tumor tissues through nanoparticle&#8208;derived passive and active targeting. At the targeted tumor tissues, PT&#8208;NPs promote durable PD&#8722;L1 degradation and ultimately trigger a substantial antitumor immune response. Collectively, this study provides valuable insights into the rational design of self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC nanoparticles to ensure noticeable accuracy and enhanced efficacy in cancer treatment.

         <title>Topological and Morphological Membrane Dynamics in Giant Lipid Vesicles Driven by Monoolein Cubosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monoolein cubosomes induce dynamic membrane transformations in giant lipid vesicles. Fusion of cubosomes into the lipid bilayer induces membrane growth and curvature stress. This drives morphological and topological effects such as tubulation, fission, fusion and intraluminal vesicles formation. This work has implications for applications in drug delivery and synthetic biology.







Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles have important applications as biomedical delivery platforms and broader engineering biology applications in artificial cell technologies. These emerging technologies often require changes in the shape and topology of biological or biomimetic membranes. Here we show that topologically&#8208;active lyotropic liquid crystal nanoparticles (LCNPs) can trigger such transformations in the membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs).

         <title>Divergent Activity Shifts of Tin&#8208;Based Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: pH&#8208;Dependent Behavior of Single&#8208;Atom Versus Polyatomic Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reveal an exciting contrast: the electric field response of the binding strength of *OCHO on Sn&#8722;N4&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn displays opposite behaviors. This response results in a fascinating, opposite pH&#8208;dependent volcano evolution for Sn&#8722;N4&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn. Most importantly, we propose that distinct strategies are necessary for designing catalysts using single&#8208;atom versus polyatomic metal catalysts.







Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based catalysts have been widely studied for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce formic acid, but the intricate influence of the structural sensitivity in single&#8208;atom Sn (e.g., Sn&#8722;N&#8722;C) and polyatomic Sn (e.g., SnOx and SnSx; x=1,2) on their pH&#8208;dependent performance remains enigmatic. Herein, we integrate large&#8208;scale data mining (with &gt;2,300 CO2RR catalysts from available experimental literature during the past decade), ab initio computations, machine learning force field accelerated molecular dynamic simulations, and pH&#8208;field coupled modelling to unravel their pH dependence. We reveal a fascinating contrast: the electric field response of the binding strength of *OCHO on Sn&#8722;N4&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn exhibits opposite behaviors due to their differing dipole moment changes upon *OCHO formation. Such response leads to an intriguing opposite pH&#8208;dependent volcano evolution for Sn&#8722;N4&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn. Subsequent experimental validations of turnover frequency and current density under both neutral and alkaline conditions well aligned with our theoretical predictions. Most importantly, our analysis suggests the necessity of distinct optimization strategies for *OCHO binding energy on different types of Sn&#8208;based catalysts.

This response results in a fascinating, opposite pH-dependent volcano evolution for Sn&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn. Most importantly, we propose that distinct strategies are necessary for designing catalysts using single-atom versus polyatomic metal catalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tin (Sn)-based catalysts have been widely studied for electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) to produce formic acid, but the intricate influence of the structural sensitivity in single-atom Sn (e.g., Sn&#8722;N&#8722;C) and polyatomic Sn (e.g., SnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and SnS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;; &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=1,2) on their pH-dependent performance remains enigmatic. Herein, we integrate large-scale data mining (with &amp;gt;2,300 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR catalysts from available experimental literature during the past decade), ab initio computations, machine learning force field accelerated molecular dynamic simulations, and pH-field coupled modelling to unravel their pH dependence. We reveal a fascinating contrast: the electric field response of the binding strength of *OCHO on Sn&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn exhibits opposite behaviors due to their differing dipole moment changes upon *OCHO formation. Such response leads to an intriguing opposite pH-dependent volcano evolution for Sn&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C and polyatomic Sn. Subsequent experimental validations of turnover frequency and current density under both neutral and alkaline conditions well aligned with our theoretical predictions. Most importantly, our analysis suggests the necessity of distinct optimization strategies for *OCHO binding energy on different types of Sn-based catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Bridging Cyclic Bilatriene Analogue Affords Stable &#960;&#8208;Radicaloid Dyes with Near&#8208;Infrared II Absorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique redox non&#8208;innocent metal&#8208;radicaloid species with an acyclic porphyrinoid structure have been synthesized upon bridging rhodium/iridium&#8208;COD cations at outer nitrogen sites. The resulting complexes exhibit high stability under ambient conditions, redox versatility, and distinct near&#8208;infrared absorption up to 1500&#8197;nm, and are promising candidates for NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;responsive photothermal and photoacoustic imaging contrast agents.







Abstract
Stable neutral metal radicaloid complexes have been synthesized from a modified tetrapyrrolic pigment, bilatriene, with iridium(I) and rhodium(I) cyclooctadiene (COD) synthons. The bilatriene skeleton contains &#945;&#8208;linked conjugated pyrrole units, whereas an N&#8208;confused analogue used in this work possesses &#946;&#8208;linked pyrrole moieties at the terminal, demonstrating a unique metal binding capability. Unprecedentedly, the metal&#8208;COD cations are accommodated at the outer nitrogen sites, which induced the formation of open&#8208;shell metal&#8208;radicaloid species. The resulting compounds are highly stable under ambient conditions and demonstrated facile redox conversion to afford the corresponding cation and anion species. Furthermore, the radicaloid complexes showed a distinct second near&#8208;infrared absorption (NIR&#8208;II) capability extending up to 1500&#8197;nm along with high photostability. These features emphasized that the complexes can be potential NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;responsible photothermal and photoacoustic imaging contrast agents based on the metal&#8208;radicaloid dye platform.

         <title>Induced Charge&#8208;Compensation Effect for Boosting Photocatalytic Water Splitting in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally similar building blocks with different electron affinity were employed as linkers for constructing zinc&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The charge compensation effect of strong electron&#8208;donating thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene unit enables electron delocalization of imine linkage, which facilitates the charge separation and transfer, endowing resultant COF with superior photocatalytic water splitting performance.







Abstract
Imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising for photocatalytic water splitting, but their performance is often constrained by inefficient charge separation due to the high electron localization nature of polar imine bonds. In this study, we have optimized the electron delocalization across the imine linkage within a COF by implementing a charge compensation effect. This effect is achieved when a strong electron&#8208;donating thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene linker is directly attached to the iminic carbon of a zinc&#8208;porphyrinic COF. This modification significantly reduces the electron binding effect within the imine bonds of the COF, facilitating both in&#8208;plane charge separation and out&#8208;plane charge transfer to the catalytic site. Conversely, the use of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing pyrizine linker aggravates the electron localization at the imine linkage in the ZnP&#8722;Pz variant. Consequently, ZnP&#8722;Tt shows a substantially improved photocatalytic water&#8208;splitting activity under visible light irradiation, with a hydrogen evolution of 44288&#177;2280&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 4&#8197;h, which exceeds the ZnP&#8722;Pz counterpart by a factor of 10. These results offer fresh perspectives for the design of imine&#8208;based COFs to overcome their limitations in charge separation efficiency.

         <title>Industry&#8208;Level Electrocatalytic CO2 to CO Enabled by 2D Mesoporous Ni Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D mesoporous Ni single atom catalysts in the N&#8208;doped carbon framework with a high density (~6.0&#8197;wt&#8201;%) and ~100&#8201;% accessibility are synthesized via a bottom&#8208;up interfacial assembly strategy, which deliver a high current density of 446&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with &gt;95&#8201;% CO selectivity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) has captivated widespread attentions, yet achieving the requisite efficiency, selectivity and stability for industrial applications poses a persistent challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of 2D mesoporous Ni single atom catalysts in N&#8208;doped carbon framework via a bottom&#8208;up interfacial assembly strategy. The 2D mesoporous Ni&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst showcases an ultrathin thickness (~6.7&#8197;nm) with well&#8208;distributed 5 to 40&#8197;nm&#8208;width mesopores in plane and a high surface area. As a result, the Ni single atom sites with a high density (~6.0&#8197;wt&#8201;%) are almost completely exposed and can be accessible, and the mass transfer can be greatly promoted even at high current densities. Thus, a high current density of 446&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with &gt;95&#8201;% CO selectivity in a flow cell can be obtained. Concurrently, the catalyst demonstrates an impressive stability, maintaining a 50&#8208;hours continuous electrolysis in the membrane electrode assembly test and achieving an energy efficiency of 42&#8201;%. Finite element analysis reveals that the 2D mesoporous design enhances CO2 diffusion, ensuring efficient adsorption and swift CO desorption at high current densities. Our study paves a way for the fabrication of 2D mesoporous single atom catalysts with nearly 100&#8201;% accessibility and expedited mass transport.

         <title>Identifying N Coordination Types of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Spin&#8208;Modulated Luminol Cathodic Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental and theoretical evidences have been provided that modulating the type of nitrogen coordination in Co single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) can change the d&#8208;orbital spin&#8208;electron configuration of Co atom and selectively regulate the O2 activation capacity, resulting in the production of different reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn affects the subsequent electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behaviour. Based on the correlation between nitrogen coordination type and luminol/dissolved oxygen cathodic ECL behaviour, we propose a strategy based on luminol cathode ECL to rapidly identify the nitrogen coordination type of SACs.







Abstract
The type of coordinated N atoms in the metal&#8208;N coordination structure is of paramount importance to the catalytic property of N&#8208;modified carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for analyzing the coordination environments of SACs. Despite its efficacy, the limited availability of synchrotron light sources and the complexity of data analysis have constrained its broader application in identifying metal&#8208;N coordination types within SACs. In this work, two kind of CoN4 SACs, were prepared by varying the N source. Then their electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behavior in the luminol/dissolved oxygen system during cathodic scanning were investigated. In comparison to CoN4(pyridinic N), for which the spin density displays dz2 orbital characteristics, CoN4(pyrrolic N) exhibits dxz orbital features, which was more conducive to the subsequent cleavage of the O&#8722;O bond in O2&#8901;&#8722; to &#8901;OH, resulting in the generation of more active intermediates *OH and the promotion of cathodic ECL emission. This work demonstrates that the ECL technique provides a novel method for the rapid identification of Co&#8722;N coordination types and the spin nature of the metal center in CoN4 SACs.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Semiconductive AgBiS2 NC Inks toward High&#8208;Efficiency, Low&#8208;Cost and Environmental&#8208;Friendly Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time realize a low&#8208;cost, scalable and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis of semiconductive AgBiS2 NC inks. The solar cells based on these inks realizes efficiency of 9.32&#8201;%, which outperform the highest reported efficiency (9.17&#8201;%) based on the complexed ligand&#8208;exchanged methods.







Abstract
Silver bismuth sulfide nanocrystals (AgBiS2 NCs) embody a pioneering heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free photovoltaic material renowned for its ultrahigh absorption coefficient, offering promising opportunities for advancing the field of ultra&#8208;thin and biocompatible solar cells. Currently, the fabrication of AgBiS2 NC photovoltaic devices relies on hot&#8208;injection synthesis and subsequent tedious ligand exchange, leading to high production cost, complex processes and environmental pollution. Here, we developed a direct&#8208;synthesis (DS) method without ligand&#8208;exchange for AgBiS2 NC semiconductive inks, significantly simplifying the material preparation and device fabrication processes. The synthesis cost of AgBiS2 inks (17.0 $&#8197;g&#8722;1) is over an order of magnitude lower than the traditional method (203.5&#8211;275.2&#8197;$&#8197;g&#8722;1). Through optimizing synthesis and device structure, a champion power conversion efficiency of 9.32&#8201;% was achieved, aligning with the highest reported efficiency (9.17&#8201;%) based on ligand&#8208;exchanged methods. In addition, our DS&#8208;AgBiS2 inks show excellent storage stability for over ten months. More importantly, the life cycle assessment (LCA) indicates drastically reduced energy consumption as well as environmental and human health impact for our strategy. The low&#8208;cost and scalable synthesis approach for AgBiS2 NC semiconductive inks present a &#8220;greener&#8221; pathway for the commercial applications of NC optoelectronics.

         <title>Ultrafast Luminescence Detection with Selective Adsorption of Carbon Disulfide in a Gold(I) Metal&#8722;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phosphorescent metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) exhibited a sensitive detecting ability for toxic carbon disulfide (CS2) with an ultrafast response time of 10&#8197;s at room temperature. Ex&#8197;situ time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence systems developed in this work demonstrated that the manipulation of energetic relaxation at the excited state with CS2 adsorption led to the luminescence response with outstanding visibility.







Abstract
Although a widely used and important industrial chemical, carbon disulfide (CS2) poses a number of hazards due to its volatility and toxicity. As such, the development of multifunctional materials for the selective capture and easy recognition of CS2 is one of the crucial issues. Herein, we demonstrate completely selective CS2 adsorption among trials involving H2O, alcohols, volatile organic compounds (including thiol derivatives), N2, H2, O2, CH4, CO, NO, and CO2. We also showcase its fine detection using remarkable luminescent response in a gold(I)&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) of {ZnII(pz)[AuI(CN)2]2} (pz=pyrazine; 1) with a two&#8208;fold interpenetration network. Ex&#8197;situ single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction for 1 and CS2&#8208;accommodated 1 suggested that the Au&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;Au atoms are not only luminescent centers but also act as interaction sites for CS2 modulating the Au&#8201;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8201;Au contacts. These experiments revealed the specificity of CS2 and how changes in the CS2&#8208;induced structure. Based on the obtained structural transformation, 1 exhibited a sensitive detecting ability for CS2 with an ultrafast response time of less than 10&#8197;s. Moreover, ex&#8197;situ time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence analyses developed in this work implied that CS2 varied the energetic relaxation at the excited states related to the luminescent efficiency of the resultant MOF system.

         <title>Cascading Water Activation and Interfacial Lattice Oxygen over Nanocluster CuOx&#8208;Modified MnO2 for Electrocatalytic Propylene Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel *OOH pathway was proposed over nanocluster CuOx&#8208;modified MnO2 by coupling *OH from water decomposition at oxygen vacancies and interfacial lattice oxygen, resulting in an efficient electrochemical conversion of propylene to propylene glycol with impressive yields and Faraday efficiencies.







Abstract
Direct electrooxidation of propylene using water&#8208;oxidation intermediates represents a promising route for propylene glycol production. Unfortunately, this economic and environmentally friendly process suffers from low yield and poor Faradaic efficiency resulting from the mismatched oxidative capacity of reactive oxygen species and pronounced side reactions. Herein, we developed an earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;based nanocluster CuOx&#8208;modified MnO2 catalyst for the efficient electrooxidation of propylene into propylene glycol, achieving a remarkable production rate of 63.0&#8197;g/m2/h and 95&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency at 1.3&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl. Mechanistic studies revealed that the oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated water activation on CuOx&#8208;MnO2 in synergy with the activated interfacial lattice oxygen drove the propylene oxidation to a novel *OOH pathway rather than the traditional *OH route. Additionally, the interfacial interactions intensified the propylene adsorption and polarization for its activation. This work offers new insights into the mechanism of electrocatalytic propylene oxidation and presents great opportunities for the synthesis of commercial chemicals based on earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts and renewable electricity&#8208;driven route.

         <title>Coulombic Condensation of Liquefied Gas Electrolytes for Li Metal Batteries at Ambient Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimethyl ether (Me2O) gas can be condensed through ion&#8208;dipole interactions with lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide at sufficiently high concentrations, which elevates the boiling of point Me2O, imparting enhanced physical and electrochemical properties for battery applications. The approach of Coulombic condensation by facilitating ion&#8208;dipole interactions with weakly coordinating solvents offers a promising strategy for next&#8208;generation electrolyte design.







Abstract
The concept of employing highly concentrated electrolytes has been widely incorporated into electrolyte design, due to their enhanced Li&#8208;metal passivation and oxidative stability compared to their diluted counterparts. However, issues such as high viscosity and sub&#8208;optimal wettability, compromise their suitability for commercialization. In this study, we present a highly concentrated dimethyl ether&#8208;based electrolyte that appears as a liquid phase at ambient conditions via Li+ &#8208; solvents ion&#8208;dipole interactions (Coulombic condensation). Unlike conventional high salt concentration ether&#8208;based electrolytes, it demonstrates enhanced transport properties and fluidity. The anion&#8208;rich solvation structure also contributes to the formation of a LiF&#8208;rich salt&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase, facilitating stable Li metal cycling for over 1000 cycles at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 condition. When combined with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) electrode, the electrolyte effectively reduces the polysulfide shuttling effect and ensures stable performance across a range of charging currents, up to 6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This research underscores a promising strategy for developing an anion&#8208;rich, high concentration ether electrolyte with decreased viscosity, which supports a Li metal anode with exceptional temperature durability and rapid charging capabilities.

         <title>An Isolable Base&#8208;Stabilized Diazosilenyl Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an original reactivity of base&#8208;stabilized C&#8208;phosphonio&#8208;silyne with N2O allowing the synthesis of a base&#8208;stabilized diazosilenyl cation. This silicon analogue of diazoalkenes exhibits a remarkable stability thanks to ligand coordination. In addition, a particular stabilizing effect of the silicon atom of diazoalkene moiety was predicted by DFT calculations.







Abstract
In contrast to the emerging chemistry of stable diazoalkenes, there are not yet any studies devoted to heavier silicon analogues, diazosilenes. Here, we report the synthesis of a base&#8208;stabilized diazosilenyl cation 2 by the reaction of base&#8208;stabilized C&#8208;phosphonio&#8208;silyne 1 with N2O. This silicon analog of diazoalkenes 2 exhibits a remarkable stability thanks to the coordination of phosphine and phosphine oxide ligands at the cationic silicon center. In addition, DFT calculations predict that, due to a particular stabilizing effect of the electropositive silicon atom, for diazosilenes (R2Si=C=N2), the presence of &#960;&#8208;donor substituents is not essential to prevent N2 dissociation, contrary to carbon analogues. Interestingly, diazosilenyl cation 2 tends to isomerize into (silylene)(phosphonio)diazomethane 7 via a 1,2&#8208;phosphine ligand migration and thus exhibits dual reactivity as a diazoalkene and as a diazo&#8208;substituted silylene.

         <title>Artificial Gold Enzymes Using a Genetically Encoded Thiophenol&#8208;Based Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Binding Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of artificial metalloenzymes containing genetically encoded noble&#8208;metal&#8208;binding sites featuring a non&#8208;canonical thiophenol&#8208;based amino acid, which serves as an excellent soft ligand for binding various noble metals, was developed. The corresponding gold(I) enzyme was characterised, confirming gold binding to the thiophenol, and successfully applied in catalytic hydroamination reactions.







Abstract
Incorporating noble metals in artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) is challenging due to the lack of suitable soft coordinating ligands among natural amino acids. We present a new class of ArMs featuring a genetically encoded noble&#8208;metal&#8208;binding site based on a non&#8208;canonical thiophenol&#8208;based amino acid, 4&#8208;mercaptophenylalanine (pSHF), incorporated in the transcriptional regulator LmrR through stop codon suppression. We demonstrate that pSHF is an excellent ligand for noble metals in their low oxidation states. The corresponding gold(I) enzyme was characterised by mass spectrometry, UV/Vis spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography and successfully catalysed hydroamination reactions of 2&#8208;ethynyl anilines with turnover numbers over 50. Interestingly, two equivalents of gold(I) per protein dimer proved to be required for activity. Up to 98&#8201;% regioselectivity in the hydroamination of an ethynylphenylurea substrate was observed, yielding the corresponding phenyl&#8208;dihydroquinazolinone product, consistent with a &#960;&#8208;activation mechanism by single gold centres. The ArM was optimized by site saturation mutagenesis using an on&#8208;bead screening protocol. This resulted in a single mutant that showed higher activity for one class of substrates. This work brings the power of noble&#8208;metal catalysis into the realm of enzyme engineering and establishes thiophenols as alternative ligands for noble metals, providing new opportunities in coordination chemistry and catalysis.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Specific Control of Mammalian Gene Expression Using DNA Repair Inducible Ribozyme Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch based on site&#8208;specific DNA lesion&#8208;modified plasmids was designed for cell&#8208;specific control of gene expression. This strategy was demonstrated to allow selective control the expression of different proteins for signal reporting and gene editing in cancer cells, providing a compact system for DNA repair monitoring and precision gene therapy.







Abstract
The ability to control gene expression is vital for elucidating gene functions and developing next&#8208;generation therapeutics. Current techniques are challenged by the lack of cell&#8208;specific control designs or immunogenicity risk from foreign proteins. We develop a DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch that enables cell&#8208;specific control of gene expression in cells and in vivo. This strategy designs plasmids with a DNA lesion (8&#8208;oxoG and O6&#8208;MeG) site&#8208;specifically installed within the ribozyme encoding region, generating active hammerhead ribozyme for mRNA degradation due to transcriptional mutagenesis, whereas DNA repair yields a single&#8208;base mismatch in the ribozyme to abrogate its activity. This strategy is demonstrated to allow specific control of gene expression in cancer cells with overexpressed DNA repair enzymes such as MutY DNA glycosylase and O6&#8208;methylguanine&#8208;DNA&#8208;methyltransferases. It also shows the capability of conditionally regulating the expression of different proteins for signal reporting and gene editing, enabling DNA repair monitoring and targeted gene therapy in cancer cells. This strategy is demonstrated using the inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system for in vivo editing of oncogenic Polo&#8208;like kinase 1 in a mouse model, resulting in significant tumor growth suppression. The DNA repair inducible ribozyme switch may provide a compact system for cell&#8208;specific gene expression control toward precise gene therapy.

         <title>Binder&#8208;Mediated Supramolecular Polymerization with Controllable Gel&#8208;to&#8208;Crystal Transformation in Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intricate binder&#8208;mediated MOC&#8208;based supramolecular assembly has been developed with tunable viscoelastic behavior and a controllable spontaneous gel&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation process. Adjusting the ratio of Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en enables precise control over nanostructure length and evolution by influencing both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the assembly.







Abstract
Controlling supramolecular polymerization across various length scales through metal&#8208;organic polyhedra in aqueous media enables functional nanomaterial fabrication beyond traditional &#960;&#8208;chromophoric systems. Herein, we present a straightforward strategy to tune the nano&#8208; and microscopic structural evolution of a co&#8208;assembled system. Ga&#8208;MOC ([Ga8(ImDC)12]12&#8722;, ImDC = imidazoledicarboxylate) is introduced as a discrete unit, while the Ni&#8208;ethylenediamine complex [Ni(en)3]2+ (Ni&#8208;en), served as the binder towards supramolecular polymerization. Comprehensive investigations revealed that adjusting the binder ratio in the bicomponent (Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en) co&#8208;assembly process allows precise control over nanostructure length and evolution by influencing both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the assembly. At higher concentrations, this assembly forms a hydrogel above a critical binder ratio. Furthermore, the binder&#8242;s ratio significantly influences the viscoelastic strength of the hydrogels by modulating the connectivity between the MOCs through hydrogen (H)&#8208;bonding. Intriguingly, the hydrogels gradually transformed into crystals without any external stimuli, with different timescales regulated by the binder ratio. Single crystal structure determination reveals a 3D structure composed of Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en, extended through charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonding (CAHB) interactions, resulting through the transformation from a kinetically controlled gel state to a thermodynamically stable crystal product. This study provides an understanding of binder&#8208;mediated control over nanostructural evolution in co&#8208;assembled MOCs.

         <title>Porous Halogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Assembled through Hetero&#8208;polytopic Ion Pair Templation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetratopic halogen&#8208;bond donor with a discrete cation binding site was designed and synthesised. When crystallised with NaCl, a 3D framework is formed where the charge&#8208;balancing cation is sequestered in the 20&#8208;crown&#8208;6 moiety. The framework is porous to solvent and iodine vapour, and undergoes single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal reactions.







Abstract
Halogen&#8208;bonding (XB) interactions have been extensively studied in the preparation of crystalline frameworks, yet porous 3D framework materials built on XBs remain elusive. The donor&#8208;acceptor interactions are strengthened by use of anionic XB acceptors; however, the requisite charge&#8208;balancing cations typically disrupt the framework and occupy potential void space. In this work, we prepare a tetratopic XB donor bearing a crown ether moiety for sodium cation sequestration. We show that when this ionpair receptor is crystallised with NaCl it gives a 3D framework that is porous to solvent and vapour, and undergoes single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal reactions.

We show that when this ionpair receptor is crystallised with NaCl it gives a 3D framework that is porous to solvent and vapour, and undergoes single-crystal-to-single-crystal reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Skeletal Editing through a Formal Nitrogen Insertion into Indoles to Synthesize Atropisomeric Aminoaryl Quinoxalines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Skeletal editing represents an attractive strategy for adding complexity to a given molecular scaffold in chemical synthesis. Isodesmic reactions provide a complementary skeletal editing approach for the redistribution of chemical bonds in chemical synthesis. However, catalytic enantioselective isodesmic reaction is extremely scarce and enantioselective isodesmic reaction to synthesize atropisomeric compounds is unknown. Herein, we report a facile method to synthesize axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines through Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed dearomatization and sequential chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioselective isodesmic C&#8208;N bond formation and cleavage from indoles and 1,2&#8208;diaminoarenes under mild reaction conditions. In this process, the five&#8208;membered ring of the indole scaffold was broken and a novel quinoxaline skeleton was constructed. This method allows the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable axially chiral aminoaryl quinoxalines in high yields (up to 95%) and generally excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). Notably, this novel type of quinoxaline atropisomers has promising applications in developing axially chiral ligand in asymmetric catalysis. This strategy represents the first example of CPA&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective isodesmic reaction to form axially chiral compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Valent Cobalt&#8208;Difluoride in Oxidative Fluorination of Saturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heme paradigm where Fe=O acts as the C&#8211;H oxidant and Fe&#8211;OH rebounds with the formed carbon&#8208;centered radical guides the design of the prototypical synthetic hydroxylation catalyst. We are exploring methods to evolve beyond the metal&#8208;oxo oxidant and hydroxide rebound, to incorporate a wider array of functional group. We have demonstrated the application of CoII(OTf)2 (10 mol% catalyst; OTf = trimfluoromethanesulfonate) in combination with polydentate N&#8208;donor ligands (e.g. BPMEN = N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) and Selectfluor in the oxidative fluorination of saturated hydrocarbons in high yields. The addition of CsF to the reaction mixture induced near&#8208;quantitative yields of fluorinated saturated hydrocarbons (&gt;90% yield of fluorinated product). For 1&#8208;hydroxy, 1&#8208;acetyl, 1&#8208;carboxy&#8208;, and 1&#8208;acetamido&#8208;adamantane, we demonstrated fluorination at the 3&#8208;position. We propose two mechanisms for the CoII&#8208;catalyzed reaction: either (i) an N&#8208;radical, derived from Selectfluor, acted as the C&#8211;H oxidant followed by radical rebound with CoIII&#8211;F; or (ii) a CoIV&#8211;(F)2 species was the C&#8211;H oxidant followed by radical rebound with CoIII&#8211;F. Our combined spectroscopic, kinetic, and chemical trapping evidence suggested that an N&#8208;radical was not the active oxidant. We concluded that a CoIV&#8211;(F)2 species was the likely active oxidant and CoIII&#8211;F was the likely F&#8208;atom donor to a carbon centered radical producing a C&#8211;F bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemocatalytic Conversion of Dinitrogen to Ammonia Mediated by a Tungsten Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whereas molybdenum dinitrogen complexes have played a major role as catalytic model systems of nitrogenase, corresponding tungsten complexes were in most cases found to be catalytically inactive. Herein, we present a modified pentadentate tetrapodal (pentaPod) phosphine ligand in which two dimethylphosphine groups of the pentaPodMe (P5Me) ligand have been replaced with phospholanes (Pln). The derived molybdenum complex [Mo(N2)P5Pln] generates 22 and the analogous tungsten complex [W(N2)P5Pln] 7 equivalents of NH3 from N2 in the presence of 180 equiv.s of SmI2(thf)2/H2O, rendering the latter the first tungsten complex chemocatalytically converting N2 to NH3. In contrast, the tungsten complex [W(N2)P5Me] generates ammonia from N2 only in a slightly overstoichiometric fashion. The reasons for these reactivity differences are investigated with the help of spectroscopic and electrochemical methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Immolative Polymers Derived from Renewable Resources via Thiol&#8722;Ene Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of polymers from renewable resources is a promising approach to reduce reliance on petrochemicals. In addition, depolymerization is attracting significant attention for the breakdown of polymers at their end&#8208;of&#8208;life or to achieve specific stimuli&#8208;responsive functions. However, the design of polymers incorporating both of these features remains a challenge. Herein, we report a new class of self&#8208;immolative polymers based on lignin&#8208;derived aldehydes via a simple thiol&#8208;ene polymerization. These self&#8208;immolative polymers undergo cascade degradation in response to specific stimuli through alternating 1,6&#8208;elimination and cyclization reactions. The two methoxy substituents on the syringaldehyde monomer accelerated the desired depolymerization reaction, while enhancing stability against undesired backbone hydrolysis. Moreover, diverse responsive end&#8208;caps could be introduced through post&#8208;polymerization functionalization from a single polymer precursor.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hydrosilanes and Lewis bases are known to promote various reductive defunctionalizations, rearrangements, and silylation reactions, facilitated by enigmatic silicon/Lewis base&#8208;derived reactive intermediates. Despite the wide variety of transformations enabled by this reagent combination, no examples of intermolecular C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) forming reactions have been reported. In this work, we&#8217;ve identified 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDSO) and KOtBu as a unique reagent combination capable of generating benzylic nucleophiles in&#8208;situ from styrene derivatives, which can subsequently react with alkyl halides to give a new C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) linkage via formal hydroalkylation. Mechanistic experiments suggest that the reaction proceeds through a key hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step from a hydrosilane reducing agent to styrene, affording a benzylic radical that undergoes reductive radical polar crossover (RRPC) and subsequent SN2 alkylation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) inherit the merit of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems with atomically dispersed mononuclear metal centers on the solid supports. Herein, we developed an Ir&#8208;SAC catalyst via the polymerization of an active homogeneous 2&#8208;picolinylhydrazone ligand&#8208;based iridium (Ir) metal complex. Such catalysts provide great stabilization against migration and agglomeration due to the strong covalent C&#8208;C bond linkage of active complexes and the polymer matrix. This Ir&#8208;SAC catalyst shows excellent selectivity towards glycerol to lactic acid conversion with a remarkable recyclability to offer an unprecedentedly high TON of over 104 million under optimized conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Crystalline Phase/Plane of Polymer Electrolyte for Rapid Lithium Ion Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic&#8208;rich functional groups and flexible segments have long been perceived to be the decisive factors influencing lithium&#8208;ion transfer in polymer electrolytes, while crystallinity is regarded as the great scourge. Actually, the research on the influence of crystalline phase and crystalline plane is still in scarcity. Herein, taking poly(vinylidene fluoride)&#8208;hexafluoropropylene (PVDF&#8208;HFP) as an example, new (111/201) crystal planes (belonged to &#946;&#8208;phase) are regulated by dissolving process and clarified by Synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Density functional theory calculation indicates that the newly exposed (111/201) crystal planes provide higher binding energy with lithium ions and are conducive to provide more ion transport channels.7Li nuclear magnetic resonance of new crystalline planes contained PVDF&#8208;HFP based electrolyte shows lower field and sharper peak intensity, further proves the rapid lithium ion transfer. Therefore, a high ionic conductivity of 6.42&#215;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 and a large lithium&#8208;ion transfer number of 0.7 are achieved. This study offers a new insight into the influence of crystalline phase and crystalline plane on the transfer of lithium ion for polymer electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Low Evaporation Enthalpy Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting at Low Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we introduce a series of ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) with a focus on addressing the challenge of water collection at low relative humidity levels below 25%. These iCOFs are characterized by numerous hydrophilic sites and high water stability, enabling efficient water vapor adsorption even at relatively low humidity levels. Through the use of various hygroscopic salt cations and precise control of ion concentration within the pores, the water state within the iCOFs pores can be effectively managed. Among the iCOFs, TB&#8208;COF&#8208;Li stands out with an impressive adsorption capacity of 0.24 g g&#8208;1 from 0 to 22% RH. Notably, due to its ionic porous structure, TB&#8208;COF&#8208;Li exhibits a significantly lower enthalpy of evaporation, measured at 967.04 J g&#8208;1, compared to bulk water with an enthalpy of 2387.4 J g&#8208;1. Moreover, under simulated conditions of 1.5 solar intensity at 60 &#176;C, the majority of the adsorbed water can be rapidly desorbed without the need for additional energy input. This efficient desorption process contributes to a high water collection rate of 0.092 g g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in the final atmospheric water harvesting device. The development of these iCOFs offers a promising and cost&#8208;effective solution for obtaining fresh water in arid regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Protected Golden Fullerene Au42 with Unprecedented Metal Coordination Number of 15</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A golden fullerene with a composition of [Au42(Ph3P)10(5&#8208;CF3&#8208;Hpa)8] (CF3COO)2 (5&#8208;CF3&#8208;H2pa = 5&#8208;trifluoropyridyl&#8208;2&#8208;amine) (  Au42  ) has been synthesized with pyridylamino and phosphine ligands as the protecting agents. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis reveals that the cluster has a D3h Au4210+ core, which can be depicted as a centered core&#8208;shell structure Au@Au15@Au26. The 41 Au atoms of the Au15@Au26 core&#8208;shell can be derived from placing a gold atom in the center of each polygon of C78 (D3h). Surprisingly, the centered gold atom of this noble cluster has the highest coordination number in metal nanoclusters of 15. Quantum&#8208;chemical studies suggest that the excellent stability of  Au42  results from both the superatomic characteristics of the Au42 kernel and the gold&#8208;ligand interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal Modulation of Exciton Recombination for High&#8208;Temperature Ultra&#8208;Long Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing smart materials with tunable high&#8208;temperature afterglow (HTA) luminescence remains a formidable challenge. This study presents a metal&#8208;free doping system using boric acid as matrix and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as dopants. This composition achieves dynamically tunable afterglow combining a bright blue HTA lasting for over ten seconds even at 150&#176;C and an ultra&#8208;long yellow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence below 110&#176;C. The observed HTA is attributed to the thermally released exciton recombination within the dopant molecules, which shows excellent temperature tolerance compared to traditional triplet related phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence. The planarity of dopants is extensively investigated playing a pivotal role in modulating Dexter electron transfer (ET) for capturing released electrons and thereby affecting the overall performance of tunable HTA. This work provides an efficient and universal doping strategy to engineer tunable HTA through the synergistic action of thermally releasing electrons, Dexter ET and exciton recombination.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Amino Amides by Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydroamination of Internal Alkenes Directed by an Amide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroamination of less activated internal alkenes presents a challenge to synthetic chemists due to their low reactivity and the difficulty in simultaneously controlling regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Here, we report an iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroamination of internal alkenes directed by an amide. The amide group on the alkene effectively directs the catalyst to overcome the low reactivity and control the regioselectivity and the enantiotopic face selection. Phthalimide serves as the amination agent, which could be readily removed to afford a primary amine. This coordination assistance enables hydroamination to occur selectively at the remote position with up to 97% ee, delivering valuable enantio&#8208;enriched &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives that are otherwise challenging to access.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A site&#8208;selective functionalization of a C(sp3)&#8211;H bond was achieved in the presence of an intrinsically more reactive C(sp2)&#8211;H bond by controlling the orientation of a directing group via a photo&#8208;induced E/Z isomerization of an oxime ether. By combining E/Z isomerization and an electron deficient Cp*CF3Ir(III) catalyst, the scope of oxime ethers in C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization was successfully expanded. Based on this strategy, the order of C&#8211;H activation was switchable and successive C(sp3)&#8211;H/C(sp2)&#8211;H and C(sp2)&#8211;H/C(sp3)&#8211;H double functionalizations were accomplished to construct densely functionalized structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical upcycling of thermoplastics towards thermosets based on dynamic dimethylglyoxime&#8208;urethane moiety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Huge&#160;annual consumption of thermoplastics&#160;results in the generation of large amounts of waste after their&#160;service life. Currently, the most popular recycling method based on mechanically melt&#8208;reprocessing deteriorates&#160;the material performance and is economically unattractive, which makes&#160;it unviable to be implemented in large scale. Herein,&#160;we present&#160;a chemical&#160;upcycling&#160;strategy&#160;that can&#160;transform dimethylglyoxime&#8208;urethane based&#160;thermoplastic waste into&#160;thermoset product with superior mechanical properties and higher economic values than the initial one. It is found&#160;that the dimethylglyoxime&#8208;urethane moiety has dynamic nature, endowing the material with open&#8208;loop upcycling&#160;ability. By removing the dimethylglyoxime&#160;segment&#160;via a simple sublimation&#160;process, the material&#160;structure is transformed from linear&#160;molecular&#160;into crosslinked&#160;network. More interestingly, the transformation is reversible, and the regenerated crosslinked network can be transformed back to linear molecule by returning the removed dimethylglyoxime&#160;segment to the material, which means the upcycled product can be recycled again after its service life. Our linear/crosslinked transformation strategy provide a new option for recycling thermoplastic waste.</dc:description>

By removing the dimethylglyoxime&#160;segment&#160;via a simple sublimation&#160;process, the material&#160;structure is transformed from linear&#160;molecular&#160;into crosslinked&#160;network. More interestingly, the transformation is reversible, and the regenerated crosslinked network can be transformed back to linear molecule by returning the removed dimethylglyoxime&#160;segment to the material, which means the upcycled product can be recycled again after its service life. Our linear/crosslinked transformation strategy provide a new option for recycling thermoplastic waste.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Highly Biocompatible Polyoxotungstate with Fenton&#8208;like Reaction Activity for Potent Chemodynamic Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating Fenton chemistry and nanomedicine into cancer therapy has significantly promoted the development of chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Nanoscale polyoxometalates (POMs), with their reversible redox properties, exhibit promising potential in developing outstanding CDT drugs by exploring their Fenton&#8208;like catalytic reactivity in tumor environments. However, such research is still in its infancy. In this work, we report the synthesis of a new crystalline antimonotungstate {Dy2Sb2W7O23(OH)(DMF)2(SbW9O33)2} (1, DMF = N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide) with gram&#8208;scale high yield via a facile "one&#8208;pot" solvothermal reaction. 1 exhibits not only a soluble and water&#8208;stable POM nanocluster, but also excellent catalytic activity for hydroxyl radical&#8208;generating Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Further biomedical studies reveal that 1 can trigger cell apoptosis and promote lipid peroxidation, exhibiting high cytotoxicity and selectivity towards B16&#8208;F10 mouse melanoma cancer cells with an IC50 value of 4.75 &#956;M. Especially, 1 can inhibit melanoma growth in vivo with favorable biosafety, achieving a 5.2&#8208;fold reduction in tumor volume and a weight loss of 76.0% at the dose of 70 &#956;g/kg. This research not only demonstrates the immense potential of antimonotungstates in CDT drug development for the first time but also provides new insights and directions for the development of novel anticancer drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence by Knocking Out Gold Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of the conventional system of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ luminophore and amine&#8208;based coreactants is particularly inefficient on noble metal electrodes. This is due to the formation of a passivating oxide layer on the metal surface inhibiting the electro&#8208;oxidation of amines like tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) coreactant, Herein, we demonstrated the enhancement of ECL emission on gold surface by hydroxyl radicals attack that are chemically generated with Cu&#8208;Fenton reagent. These radicals selectively deactivate the gold active sites and knockout the metal surface asperities that counterintuitively led to an amplification of the ECL emission. Atomic Force Microscopy shows a massive smoothening of the surface. The electrochemical characterization proves that the involved ECL reaction mechanism switches from direct oxidation to catalytic route, where the kinetics of indirect TPrA oxidation is facilitated on deactivated gold surface. Besides, in situ smoothening of a rough electrode in presence of tandem [Ru(bpy)3]2+/TPrA, the ECL enhancement enables Cu2+ sensing with good reliability and limit of detection. Such atomically smoothened and corrosion&#8208;resistant gold surface readily tuned the ECL reactivity and opened new directions on influence of topography and reactivity on ECL mechanisms, thus will be extremely useful for the future development of ECL imaging strategies and highly sensitive ECL sensors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Nature produces ATP, the energy currency, by converting solar energy (photophosphorylation) and chemical energy (substrate&#8208;level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation).

In this work, we established and verified a novel electrodriven phosphorylation method.&#160;Spinach thylakoid membranes (TMs), enriched with ATPases, were isolated and constructed into planar TMs&#160;(pTMs) on a proton exchange membrane (PEM),&#160;effectively imparting the traditional PEM with the biological function of ATP regeneration.&#160;Following the optimization of TMs&#160;concentration and incubation time, the biological PEM&#160;was integrated into a two&#8208;compartment electrochemical cell, where ATP was successfully synthesized by ATPase of pTMs, triggered by the proton gradient potential generated during electrochemical water splitting.&#160;When a constant voltage of 3 V was applied to the electrochemical cells, ATP was&#160;synthesized&#160;at a rate of 3.16 &#956;M min&#8208;1&#956;gChl&#8208;1, approximately&#160;twice the rate of &#916;pH&#8208;driven ATP synthesis.

         <title>Facilitating Rapid OH&#8722;/H2O Transport in Anion Exchange Membranes via Ultra&#8208;Stable Heteroatom&#8208;Free Micropores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transport channels constructed by rigid, twisted heteroatom&#8208;free micropores (HFMs) in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) significantly reduce ionic transport resistance, achieving high self&#8208;diffusion coefficient and OH&#8722;conductivity. The carbon&#8208;carbon bonds within HFMs also provide exceptional stability in 1&#8197;M KOH at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Consequently, HFM&#8208;AEMs based water electrolysis demonstrate exceptional performance, maintaining durability over 3000&#8197;hours.







Abstract
Efficient OH&#8722; conduction in anion exchange membranes (AEMs) is pivotal for the advancement and industrialization of sustainable electrochemical technologies in alkaline environments, including water electrolysis, fuel cells, and CO2 electroreduction. We here designed AEMs with a novel class of rigid heteroatom&#8208;free micropores (HFMs), engineered at the molecular level to facilitate rapid ionic transport in an ultra&#8208;stable manner. By manipulating monomers, our design strategically controls the torsional angles and energy barriers within the polymeric backbones, creating sub&#8208;nanometer ionic channels that precisely regulate porosity. These hydrophilic micropores significantly enhance the mobility of OH&#8722;/H2O, achieving over a 150&#8201;% increase in self&#8208;diffusion coefficient compared to commercial AEMs and elevating OH&#8722; conductivity to a leading 215&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the robust carbon&#8208;carbon bond construction in HFMs offers the stability that is four orders of magnitude higher under severe alkaline conditions compared to existing wisdoms, with a demonstrated operational lifespan of over 4000&#8197;hours. The integration of HFM&#8208;AEMs into water electrolyzers not only supports the use of platinum group metal&#8208;free catalysts but also exhibits exceptional energy efficiency and extended durability, highlighting their substantial potential for wide&#8208;ranging applications in emerging electrochemical technologies.

         <title>In/Outside Catalytic Sites of the Pore Walls in One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influences of the location of catalytic sites inside or outside of the pore walls on the performance were first explored by constructing metal sites on the channels of one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks. The inside catalytic sites showed higher catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Pore channels play a decisive role in mass transport in catalytic systems. However, the influences of the location of catalytic sites inside or outside of the pore walls on the performance were still under&#8208;explored due, because it is difficult to construct sites anchored in or outside of pore walls. Herein, one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks with precisely anchored active sites were used to explore the effects of channels on a typical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis. Electrocatalytic evaluations showed that single Pt sites located inside of the channels exhibited higher kinetic activity compared to those anchored outside. The in situ spectroscopic analysis revealed that local reconstruction of Pt&#8722;Cl breaking and potential&#8208;induced anion transport occurred more effectively inside the channels. The superior anion transportability and kinetic activity of the inside&#8208;channel active sites also facilitated *OH desorption during the ORR process outperforming their outside&#8208;channel counterparts. The results of this study provide strategies for designing active sites in porous catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>A Kinetic Scout Approach Accelerates Targeted Protein Degrader Development</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we implement lysine&#8208;targeted reversible&#8208;covalent chemistry to rationally tune the binding kinetics of targeted protein degraders at the protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest across 25 targets. Our key finding is that target residence time is a major determinant of degrader activity, and the synthesis of a minimal number of kinetic scouting analogues can accelerate degrader development.







Abstract
Bifunctional molecules such as targeted protein degraders induce proximity to promote gain&#8208;of&#8208;function pharmacology. These powerful approaches have gained broad traction across academia and the pharmaceutical industry, leading to an intensive focus on strategies that can accelerate their identification and optimization. We and others have previously used chemical proteomics to map degradable target space, and these datasets have been used to develop and train multiparameter models to extend degradability predictions across the proteome. In this study, we now turn our attention to develop generalizable chemistry strategies to accelerate the development of new bifunctional degraders. We implement lysine&#8208;targeted reversible&#8208;covalent chemistry to rationally tune the binding kinetics at the protein&#8208;of&#8208;interest across a set of 25 targets. We define an unbiased workflow consisting of global proteomics analysis, IP/MS of ternary complexes and the E&#8208;STUB assay, to mechanistically characterize the effects of ligand residence time on targeted protein degradation and formulate hypotheses about the rate&#8208;limiting step of degradation for each target. Our key finding is that target residence time is a major determinant of degrader activity, and this can be rapidly and rationally tuned through the synthesis of a minimal number of analogues to accelerate early degrader discovery and optimization.

         <title>Designing Zwitterionic Bottlebrush Polymers to Enable Long&#8208;Cycling Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterionic bottlebrush&#8208;based ionogel polymer electrolytes are rationally designed to enhance Li+ transport with multifunctional capabilities, including dissociating [Li(anion)n]&#8722;(n&#8722;1) clusters, anchoring anions via cationic groups, and accelerating Li+ migration through anionic groups. The assembled Li metal batteries demonstrate ultralong&#8208;term reversible Li plating/stripping over 6500&#8197;h and unprecedented cycling stability over 2000&#8197;cycles with a superior capacity retention of 93.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Ionogel polymer electrolyte (IPE), incorporating ionic liquid (IL) within a polymer matrix, presents a promising avenue for safe quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, sluggish Li+ kinetics, resulting from the formation of [Li(anion)n]&#8722;(n&#8722;1) clusters and the occupation of Li+ transport sites by organic cations, limit their practical applications. In this study, we have developed zwitterionic bottlebrush polymers&#8208;based IPE with promoted Li+ conduction by employing poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate)&#8208;grafted poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVC&#8208;g&#8208;PSBMA) bottlebrushes as matrices of IL. The grafted zwitterionic side chains greatly facilitate the dissociation of [Li(anion)n]&#8722;(n&#8722;1) clusters to produce more movable Li+. Moreover, the positively charged &#8722;NR4+ groups in zwitterionic side chains effectively restrain anions migration, while the negatively charged &#8722;SO3&#8722; groups immobilize IL cations, preventing them from occupying Li+ hopping sites and reducing the energy barrier for Li+ migration. These synergistic effects contribute to a notable ionic conductivity (7.5&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.62) of PVC&#8208;g&#8208;PSBMA IPE at 25&#8201;&#176;C. As a result, PVC&#8208;g&#8208;PSBMA IPE enables ultralong&#8208;term (over 6500&#8197;h) reversible and stable Li plating/stripping in Li||Li symmetric cells. Remarkably, the assembled Li||LiFePO4 full batteries demonstrate unprecedented cycling stability of more than 2000 cycles with a superior capacity retention of 93.7&#8201;%.

Abstract
Vaccines are one of the greatest human achievements in public health, as they help prevent the spread of diseases, reduce illness and death rates, saving thousands of lives with few side effects. Traditional vaccine development is centered around using live attenuated or inactivated pathogens, which is expensive and has resulted in vaccine&#8208;associated illnesses. Advancements have led to the development of safer subunit vaccines, which contain recombinant proteins isolated from pathogens. Their short half&#8208;life and small size make most subunit vaccines less immunogenic. Here, we introduce a large pore 2D covalent organic framework (COF), PyCOFamide, as a promising solution for an effective subunit platform. Our study demonstrates that simple adsorption of a model antigen, ovalbumin (OVA), onto PyCOFamide (OVA@COF) significantly enhances humoral and cell&#8208;mediated immune response compared to free OVA. OVA@COF exhibited heightened immune cell activation and acts as an antigen reservoir, facilitating antigen&#8208;presenting cell trafficking to the draining lymph nodes, amplifying the humoral immune response. Additionally, the breakdown of the COF releases monomers that adjuvant the activation of immune cells vital to creating strong immunity. This platform offers a potential avenue for safer, more effective subunit vaccines.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Conjugated Macrocycles: Synthesis, Conductivity, and Application in Electrochemical CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of nitrogen&#8208;rich conjugated macrocycles are reported that mimic the structure and function of semiconducting 2D metal&#8211;organic and covalent organic frameworks while providing improved processability and surface tunability. By using electrochemically mediated CO2 capture as an example, it is shown how colloidal phenazine&#8208;based organic macrocycles improve electrical contact and active&#8208;site electrochemical accessibility relative to bulk COF powders.







Abstract
Here we report a series of nitrogen&#8208;rich conjugated macrocycles that mimic the structure and function of semiconducting 2D metal&#8211;organic and covalent organic frameworks while providing greater solution processability and surface tunability. Using a new tetraaminotriphenylene building block that is compatible with both coordination chemistry and dynamic covalent chemistry reactions, we have synthesized two distinct macrocyclic cores containing Ni&#8722;N and phenazine&#8208;based linkages, respectively. The fully conjugated macrocycle cores support strong interlayer stacking and accessible nanochannels. For the metal&#8211;organic macrocycles, good out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport is preserved, with pressed pellet conductivities of 10&#8722;3&#8197;S/cm for the nickel variants. Finally, using electrochemically mediated CO2 capture as an example, we illustrate how colloidal phenazine&#8208;based organic macrocycles improve electrical contact and active site electrochemical accessibility relative to bulk covalent organic framework powders. Together, these results highlight how simple macrocycles can enable new synthetic directions as well as new applications by combining the properties of crystalline porous frameworks, the processability of nanomaterials, and the precision of molecular synthesis.

         <title>Mn Doping at High&#8208;Activity Octahedral Vacancies of &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 for Oxygen Reduction Reaction Electrocatalysis in Metal&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn&#8722;Fe2O3/CNT catalyst was synthesized by doping Mn into the highly active octahedral sites, and displays efficient and stable electrocatalytic performance for ORR and Metal&#8208;air batteries. The strong electron donating capability of octahedral sites and synergistic effect between Mn and Fe optimized reaction energy barriers, and the vacancies in &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 located only at octahedral sites were confirmed by the clarification doping sites of Mn.







Abstract
&#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 with the intrinsic cation vacancies is an ideal substrate for heteroatom doping into the highly active octahedral sites in spinel oxide catalysts. However, it is still a challenge to confirm the vacancy location of &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 through experiments and obtain enhanced catalytic performance by preferential occupation of octahedral sites for heteroatom doping. Here, a Mn&#8208;doped &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 incorporated with carbon nanotubes catalyst was developed to successfully achieve preferential doping into highly active octahedral sites by employing &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 as the precursor. Further, the vacancy in &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 was only located on octahedral sites rather than tetrahedral ones, which was first proved by direct experimental evidence through the clarification doping sites of Mn. Notably, the catalyst shows outstanding activity towards oxygen reduction reaction with the half&#8208;wave potential of 0.82&#8197;V and 0.64&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, respectively, as well as the maximum power density of 179 mWcm&#8722;2 and 403 mWcm&#8722;2 for Mg&#8208;air batteries and Al&#8208;air batteries, respectively. It could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the doping Mn on octahedral sites and the substrate &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 along with the modification of the adsorption/desorption properties for oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates as well as the optimization of the reaction energy barriers.

         <title>A Tetrazine Amplification System for Visual Detection of Trace Analytes via Click&#8208;Release Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrazine amplification system is introduced, utilizing a &#8220;click&#8208;release&#8208;oxidation&#8208;cycle&#8221; (CROC) cascade amplification process. This study presents the construction of the CROC system and its application in visually detecting low concentrations of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and Pd&#8201;2&#8201;+. The system achieves a 10&#8201;5&#8208;fold amplification of the tetrazine signal, enabling detection at concentrations as low as 2&#8197;nM.







Abstract
Achieving visual detection of analytes at ultra&#8208;low concentrations in complex mixtures remains a persistent challenge. While sophisticated techniques offer single&#8208;molecule sensitivity, practical hurdles remain, necessitating tailored signal amplification systems for direct visual detection. In this study, we develop a strategy for the visualized detection of tetrazine through a &#8220;click&#8208;release&#8208;oxidation&#8208;cycle&#8221; (CROC) cascade amplification process. We systematically describe the construction and synthesis of this system, the kinetic process of click release, the kinetics of oxidation to tetrazine and its cascade amplification effect in trace amounts of tetrazine. This system is capable of amplifying the signal of tetrazine at a concentration as low as 2&#8197;nM by 105&#8208;fold, thereby providing a clearly visible purple signal. Finally, as proof of concept, we successfully apply this method to visually detect trace &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal) and Pd2+.

         <title>Transition Metal as Template: Reversing the Synthesis Logic in the Preparation of Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a new approach to the synthesis of PEP (E=B, Al, Si, P) pincer complexes of transition metals wherein the introduction of the phosphine&#8208;containing fragments into the metal coordination sphere precedes the introduction of the main group element linchpin. This &#8220;reverse&#8221; synthesis logic broadens and simplifies access to pincer complexes because it obviates the need to prepare and isolate a propincer precursor molecule containing both the central main group element and the phosphine donors.







Abstract
The conventional synthetic approach to transition metal pincer complexes calls for the preparation of the tridentate pincer (pro)ligand first, with subsequent introduction of the transition metal center as the last step. This work demonstrates that the alternative synthetic logic, where the central main group element is introduced last, can be applicable to a number of PEP pincer complexes (E=B, Al, Si, P) derived from phosphinophenols and phosphinopyrroles. This approach obviates the need to isolate well&#8208;behaved propincer precursors, and instead relies on the formation of phosphine&#8208;metal adducts first, whose nature determines the stoichiometry of the needed main group reagent to complete the synthesis.

         <title>A Highly Active Molybdenum Carbide Catalyst with Dynamic Carbon Flux for Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional understanding suggests that the catalytic mechanism is predominantly governed by surface phenomena. This study reveals that bulk carbon in &#945;&#8208;MoC also participates via exchange with surface carbon. Isotopic analysis shows carbon exchange increases with temperature, maintaining &#945;&#8208;MoC stability and high reactivity.







Abstract
Molybdenum carbide has been reported as an efficient and stable catalyst for reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The conventional understanding of the mechanism suggests domination of the surface phenomena, with only surface or subsurface layers partaking in the catalytic cycle. In this study, we presented a highly active MoC catalyst from carburization process, which showed a mass&#8208;specific reaction rate over 260&#8197;&#956;m

 with dynamic carbon flux in the bulk phase of the catalyst. Through Isotopic Temperature&#8208;Programmed Reaction (ITPR) analysis and Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy (ETEM), we discerned dynamic carbon flow circulating between the &#945;&#8208;MoC bulk phase and the gas phase reactants under the RWGS reaction atmosphere. This circulation, essential to maintaining the structural stability of the metastable &#945;&#8208;MoC and its ultra&#8208;high reactivity, is accompanied by thorough carbon component exchange among the bulk, the surface and the gas&#8208;phase reactants during the reaction process.

         <title>Design of High&#8208;Performance Infrared Nonlinear Optical PAs3S3 with Perfectly Aligned Polar Molecular Cage via a Bipolar&#8208;Axis&#8208;Symmetry Coupling Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduce a bipolar&#8208;axis&#8208;symmetry coupling strategy to enhance the arrangement of polar molecular cages for infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals. By substituting C3v symmetric [B3O6] groups with polar [PAs3S3] cages in the &#946;&#8208;BBO lattice, we synthesized PAs3S3 (PAS), which maintains a consistent polar arrangement crucial for optimal NLO performance. PAS exhibits an impressive second harmonic generation (SHG) approximately eight times that of AgGaS2, with a substantial band gap of 2.75&#8197;eV and robust stability against air and moisture, positioning it as a promising candidate for IR NLO applications.







Abstract
Strong polar molecular cages have recently emerged as novel functional building units for high&#8208;performance infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals. However, these highly polar molecular cages often arrange themselves in a way that cancels out their polarity, leading to a more energetically stable state. As a result, most cage crystal formations tend to crystallize in centrosymmetric space groups, which conflicts with the primary requirement for NLO crystals. Herein, we address the challenge of polar molecular cage arrangement through bipolar&#8208;axis&#8208;symmetry coupling strategy, utilizing classical NLO parent compounds. By substituting the C3v symmetric [B3O6] groups with polar C3v symmetric [PAs3S3] cages within the &#946;&#8208;BBO polar aixs lattice, we successfully synthesized a new compound, PAs3S3 (PAS), which exhibits a consistent arrangement of polar molecular cages &#8212; crucial for maximizing NLO performance. Additionally, due to the non&#8208;covalent interactions among [PAs3S3] polar molecular cages, PAS demonstrates an unexpectedly strong second harmonic generation (SHG) about 8 times that of AgGaS2, along with a significant band gap of 2.75&#8197;eV. Furthermore, PAS exhibits remarkable stability against air and moisture. These findings validate our design strategy and position PAS as a promising candidate for applications in IR NLO crystals.

These findings validate our design strategy and position PAS as a promising candidate for applications in IR NLO crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intramolecular Charge Transfer in Antiaromatic Donor/Acceptor&#8208;Fused s&#8208;Indacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Late&#8208;stage oxidation of unsymmetrical benzofuran/benzothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacene regioisomers to their corresponding sulfones affords rationally designed molecules with varying degrees of donor/acceptor characteristics and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Depending on the fusion orientation of the donors and acceptors, the two most antiaromatic, oxidized isomers exhibit strong evidence of ICT with 30&#8211;40&#8197;nm solvatochromic shifts.







Abstract
Herein we report the synthesis and characterization of four donor/acceptor&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacenes via the late&#8208;stage oxidation of a family of unsymmetrical benzofuran/benzothiophene&#8208;s&#8208;indacene regioisomers. A thorough study of their properties through experimental and computational analysis has revealed the effect of asymmetry on the molecular properties associated with antiaromaticity, as well as a strong correlation between antiaromaticity and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The strength of the charge transfer depends on the fusion orientation of the donor and acceptor motifs relative to the s&#8208;indacene core. The two most antiaromatic oxidized isomers exhibit strong evidence of ICT with 30 and 40&#8197;nm solvatochromic shifts.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;MOF Network Enabling Ultrathin Coating for Post&#8208;Combustion Carbon Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a strategy to create CO2 highways by chemically linking UiO&#8208;66&#8208;MA to form MOF&#8208;polymer networks, enabling sub&#8208;100&#8197;nm thin layer coating with an MOF content of up to 40&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Theses MOFs help maintain high diffusivity selectivity at elevated temperatures, achieving a CO2 permeance of 2793 GPU and a CO2/N2 selectivity of 21.6 at 60&#8201;&#176;C and 83&#8201;% relative humidity with mixed gases.







Abstract
Permeance&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off and high temperature resilience are key challenges in development of membranes for post&#8208;combustion carbon capture. While mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) consisting of polymers and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer the potential to address the challenges, they are limited by the low loading of MOFs in the thin film layer. Herein, we propose an inverse synthesis strategy to form polymer&#8208;MOF networks by copolymerizing monomers with functionalized UiO&#8208;66 nanoparticles. This process yields a finely dispersed, easily processable solution, enabling defect&#8208;free, thin polymer&#8208;MOF coatings with up to 40&#8197;wt&#8201;% MOF loading within the polyethylene oxide&#8208;based polymers on polyacrylonitrile supports. The membrane with 40&#8197;wt&#8201;% MOF demonstrated a 212&#8201;% increment in CO2 permeance at 25&#8201;&#176;C and maintained a selectivity of 20 at 60&#8201;&#176;C, which is attributed to the stable diffusivity selectivity of MOFs at high temperature. Furthermore, the membrane was evaluated with mixed gas and 83&#8201;% relative humidity (RH) at 60&#8201;&#176;C, achieving a CO2 permeance up to 2793 GPU and a CO2/N2 selectivity of 21.6. This work offers insights into the design of practical mixed matrix membranes, which not only paves the way towards energy efficient carbon capture from flue gas, but also provides more possibilities for other applications.

         <title>Monodisperse Chemical Oligophosphorylation of Peptides via Protected Oligophosphorimidazolide Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The more the merrier: Oligophosphorimidazolide reagents enable the concomitant conjugation of multiple phosphate units to phosphopeptides, yielding derivatives with monodisperse phosphate chain lengths (up to hexaphosphate). This simple transformation occurs chemoselectively under mild conditions. This work paves the way for future development of mass spectrometry&#8208;based analytical methods for &#8220;oligophosphoproteomics.&#8221;







Abstract
Protein poly&#8208; and oligophosphorylation are recently discovered post&#8208;translational modifications that remain poorly characterized due to (1) the difficulty of extracting endogenously polyphosphorylated species without degradation and (2) the absence of synthetic and analytical tools to prepare and characterize poly&#8208; and oligophosphorylated species in biochemical contexts. Herein, we report a methodology for the selective oligophosphorylation of peptides with monodisperse phosphate chain lengths (Pn=3&#8211;6). A library of oligophosphorimidazolide (oligoP&#8208;imidazolide) reagents featuring benzyl and o&#8208;nitrophenylethyl protecting groups was synthesized in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields (65&#8211;93&#8201;%). These oligoP&#8208;imidazolide reagents enabled the selective and simultaneous conjugation of multiple phosphate units to phosphoryl nucleophiles, circumventing tedious iterative processes. The generalizability of this approach is illustrated by a substrate scope study that includes several biologically relevant phosphopeptide sequences, culminating in the synthesis of &gt;60 examples of peptide oligophosphates (Pn=2&#8211;6). Moreover, we report the preparation of oligoP&#8208;diimidazolides (Pn=3&#8211;5) and discuss their application in generating unique condensed phosphate&#8208;peptide conjugates. We also demonstrate that human phospho&#8208;ubiquitin (pS65&#8208;Ub) is amenable to functionalization by our reagents. Overall, we envision the methods described here will enable future studies that characterize these newly discovered but poorly understood phosphorylation modes.

         <title>Enhanced Antitumor Immunity of a Globo H&#8208;Based Vaccine Enabled by the Combination Adjuvants of 3D&#8208;MPL and QS&#8208;21</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Globo H, a specific carbohydrate antigen overexpressed on various human malignancies, has attracted considerable interest as an antigenic target for anticancer vaccine development. Despite several Globo H&#8208;based carbohydrate vaccines that have been designed, efficient access to Globo H hexasaccharide antigen and development of powerful adjuvants for enhancing antitumor immunity remain challenging. Herein, we reported a streamlined chemoenzymatic approach to prepare this hexasaccharide antigen, relying on chemical synthesis of Gb5 pentasaccharide by a stereoconvergent [2+3] strategy and subsequent enzymatic &#945;&#8208;fucosylation to easily install &#945;1,2&#8208;fucose residue. Separately, a modular assembly approach to efficiently synthesize 3&#8208;O&#8208;deacyl&#8208;monophosphoryl lipid A (3D&#8208;MPL) was developed by the integration of stereocontrolled glycosylation, regioselective acylation, site&#8208;specific phosphorylation, and facile global deprotection. After efficient construction of Globo H&#8208;CRM197 conjugate, we conducted systematic immunological evaluations of Globo H&#8208;CRM197 formulated with various adjuvants and adjuvant combinations, comprising saponin QS&#8208;21, synthetic 3D&#8208;MPL and &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide derivative S34. The results revealed that Globo H&#8208;CRM197 conjugate adjuvanted with QS&#8208;21 and 3D&#8208;MPL elicited robust IgG2a and IgG3 antibody responses and Th1 cellular immunity in mice. Moreover, antibodies induced by this formulation effectively bound to Globo H&#8208;positive MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells and exhibited superior complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity and antibody&#8208;dependent cellular phagocytosis, holding promise for further development of effective anticancer vaccines.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcium Chemistry as a New Member of Post&#8208;Lithium Battery Family: What Can We Learn from Sodium and Magnesium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Next&#8208;generation battery technologies need to consider their environmental impact throughout the whole cycle life, which has brought new chemistries based on earth&#8208;abundant elements to the spotlight. Rechargeable calcium batteries are such an emerging technology, which shows the potential to provide high cell voltage and high energy density close to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Additionally, the use of Ca2+ as a charge carrier renders significant sustainable values. Although pioneering work on the electrochemistry of Ca has been carried out for more than half a century, demonstration of reversible Ca chemistries in non&#8208;aqueous media was only achieved within the past decade. In this review, we will present recent development of rechargeable calcium batteries, focusing on mainly the similarities but also differences between Ca chemistry and other post&#8208;lithium chemistry. According to the periodic nature of elements, magnesium (an alkaline earth element as Ca) and sodium (a diagonally adjacent element to Ca) have similar chemical properties to Ca in various aspects. We shall elaborate on how the solution chemistry, metal behaviors and transport mechanisms of Ca can be better understood in light of the established principles in the respective Mg/Na systems. We hope the discussion will inspire synergetic development between Ca batteries and other post&#8208;lithium systems.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Next-generation battery technologies need to consider their environmental impact throughout the whole cycle life, which has brought new chemistries based on earth-abundant elements to the spotlight. Rechargeable calcium batteries are such an emerging technology, which shows the potential to provide high cell voltage and high energy density close to lithium-ion batteries. Additionally, the use of Ca2+ as a charge carrier renders significant sustainable values. Although pioneering work on the electrochemistry of Ca has been carried out for more than half a century, demonstration of reversible Ca chemistries in non-aqueous media was only achieved within the past decade. In this review, we will present recent development of rechargeable calcium batteries, focusing on mainly the similarities but also differences between Ca chemistry and other post-lithium chemistry. According to the periodic nature of elements, magnesium (an alkaline earth element as Ca) and sodium (a diagonally adjacent element to Ca) have similar chemical properties to Ca in various aspects. We shall elaborate on how the solution chemistry, metal behaviors and transport mechanisms of Ca can be better understood in light of the established principles in the respective Mg/Na systems.

         <title>Toward Rhenium&#8208;based Circularly Polarized OLEDs Using Tailored Chiral Re(CO)3 Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral rhenium(I) emitters showing circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) are an attractive mainstay for CP organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). However, the efficiency of such &#160;emitters is not ideal, and they have never been explored for circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) applications. Here, we have tailored robust chiral Re(I) complexes with improved CPP properties, and firstly &#160;demonstrated CPEL from rhenium emitters. The designed chiral Re(I) complexes exhibit a yellow CPP with enhanced |glum| factors (up to 2.5&#215;10&#8211;2) and a good quantum efficiency. The pioneering Re(I)&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs (based on the obtained emitters) exhibit yellow CPEL with |gEL| factors of up to 6.2&#215;10&#8211;3 and maximal external quantum efficiency of 13.2%. Furthermore, we have demonstrated for the first time a suppressive effect of a magnetic field on the CPP strength of Re(I) emitters. This work highlights the good potential of chiral Re(I) emitters for CPEL applications, and opens up a new shortcut to CPP&#8208;active Re(I) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Catch&#8208;Release Strategy for the Genomics&#8208;Driven Discovery of Antiproliferative Furan&#8208;Functionalized Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Furan&#8208;functionalized peptides are of significant pharmacological interest due to their pronounced bioactivities and unique potential for orthogonal bioconjugation and derivatization. However, naturally occurring peptides with furyl side chains are exceedingly rare. This study presents a streamlined method to predict and assess the microbial production of peptides incorporating 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) moieties. The approach integrates genome mining and the reversible, chemoselective tagging of furyl residues, utilizing their unique Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity, for mass spectrometry&#8208;guided identification of candidate compounds. By employing the rhizonin Fua synthase as a bioinformatic handle and through heterologous reconstitution of Fua biosynthesis, we identified previously unknown Fua biosynthetic pathways in diverse bacterial phyla, including actinomycetes, cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, and g&#8208;proteobacteria, suggesting that Fua&#8208;containing peptides are remarkably widely distributed. Metabolic profiling by reversible tagging facilitated the detection of native Fua&#8208;containing metabolites. The successful adaptation of this method for solid support enabled the direct enrichment of furyl&#8208;substituted peptides from complex mixtures. This multi&#8208;pronged approach enabled the discovery and characterization of two novel families of Fua cyclopeptides (rubriamides and typhamides) with potent antiproliferative effects against human tumor cells and nematodes. The innovative catch&#8208;and&#8208;release strategy, in conjunction with genome mining, represents a valuable tool for the discovery of new furan&#8208;substituted natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>A Trithia&#8208;Bridged N&#8208;Heterotriangulene: The Hitherto Missing Electron Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The very first representative of trithia&#8208;bridged N&#8208;heterotriangulene, a triphenylamine with sulfur atoms bridging the ortho&#8208;positions, was synthesized by a sequence of regioselective sulfenylation with phthalimidesulfenyl chloride followed by Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic cyclization. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a saddle&#8208;shaped geometry of the polycyclic scaffold. UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used to characterize the optoelectronic properties. The title compound is a particularly strong electron donor forming a perfectly stable radical cation, which was analyzed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The electron donor properties were further highlighted by the formation of crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor complexes with strong cyano&#8208;based acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing s&#8208;p Orbital Overlap between Sodium Polysulfides and Single&#8208;Atom Indium Catalyst for Efficient Sulfur Redox Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P&#8208;block metal carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (C&#8208;SACs) have emerged as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries, due to their high atom utilization and unique electronic structure. However, the ambiguous electronic&#8208;level understanding of Na&#8208;dominant s&#8208;p hybridization between sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) and p&#8208;block C&#8208;SACs limits the precise control of coordination environment tuning and electro&#8208;catalytic activity manipulation. Here, s&#8208;p orbital overlap degree (OOD) between the s orbitals of Na in NaPSs and the p orbitals of p&#8208;block C&#8208;SACs is proposed as a descriptor for sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and sulfur oxidation reaction (SOR). Compared to NG and NG&#8208;supported InN4 (NG&#8208;InN4) SACs, the nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;supported InN5 (NG&#8208;InN5) SACs show the largest s&#8208;p OOD, demonstrating the weakest shuttle effect and the lowest reaction energy barriers in both SRR and SOR. Accordingly, the designed catalysts allow the Na&#8208;S pouch batteries to retain a high capacity of 490.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 2 A g&#8208;1 with a Coulombic efficiency of 96% at a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratio of 4.5 &#956;l. This work offers an s&#8208;p orbital overlap descriptor describing the interaction between NaPSs and p&#8208;orbital&#8208;dominated catalysts for high&#8208;performance RT Na&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Lattice Modulation on Singlet&#8208;Triplet Splitting of Silver Cluster Boosting Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;active silver clusters with near&#8208;unity quantum efficiency is of practical importance in cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic devices, but remains a tremendous challenge due to the difficulty of de novo synthesis and uncertainty of properties. Herein, we demonstrate a lattice modulation on parent TADF&#8208;activate silver cluster, acheving TADF&#8208;driven photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 12% to near&#8208;unity. Systematic experimental and calculated results reveal that the lattice modulation effectively lower the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting (&#916;EST) from 718 to 549 cm&#8208;1, thereby facilitating thermally activated reverse intersystem crossing: T5&#8594;S5, leading to extremely efficient TADF by surpassing both phosphorescence and non&#8208;radiative decay, thus boosting the near&#8208;unity PLQY. Such high PLQY are extremely rare in the TADF&#8208;active silver clusters and even in the whole noble&#8208;metal clusters. This research showcases an unparalleled example of lattice modulation to realize near unity PLQY of TADF&#8208;active silver clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Mass Transfer&#8208;Enhanced Photothermal Membranes with Synergistic Light Utilization for High&#8208;Turbidity Wastewater Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photo&#8208;Fenton process faces significant limitations in treating high&#8208;turbidity, colored wastewater due to light attenuation and impurity interference (blocked mass transfer). To address these issues, we developed a suspended photothermal Fenton membrane by loading a photothermal catalyst on a hydrophobically modified cotton filter paper, enabling precise suspension 1 mm below the water surface. This design achieved 89.49 % light utilization and high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, even in wastewater with extreme chromaticity (10 multiples) and turbidity (703 NTU). The enhanced photothermal conversion accelerated molybdenum co&#8208;catalyzed Fenton reactions and improved peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, maintaining over 90 % phenol removal for 15 days. Mechanistic simulations revealed improved mass transfer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pollutants at the solid&#8208;liquid interface, with PMS diffusion identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step. The membrane resisted fouling from suspended solids and maintained stable operation in soil&#8208;containing solutions for 10 days. This innovative approach offers an efficient solution for degrading pollutants in dark&#8208;colored, high&#8208;turbidity wastewater, overcoming traditional process limitations.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The photo-Fenton process faces significant limitations in treating high-turbidity, colored wastewater due to light attenuation and impurity interference (blocked mass transfer). To address these issues, we developed a suspended photothermal Fenton membrane by loading a photothermal catalyst on a hydrophobically modified cotton filter paper, enabling precise suspension 1 mm below the water surface. This design achieved 89.49 % light utilization and high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, even in wastewater with extreme chromaticity (10 multiples) and turbidity (703 NTU). The enhanced photothermal conversion accelerated molybdenum co-catalyzed Fenton reactions and improved peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, maintaining over 90 % phenol removal for 15 days. Mechanistic simulations revealed improved mass transfer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pollutants at the solid-liquid interface, with PMS diffusion identified as the rate-limiting step. The membrane resisted fouling from suspended solids and maintained stable operation in soil-containing solutions for 10 days. This innovative approach offers an efficient solution for degrading pollutants in dark-colored, high-turbidity wastewater, overcoming traditional process limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Genetic Incorporation of a Thioxanthone&#8208;Containing Amino Acid for the Design of Artificial Photoenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Genetically encodable photosensitizers allows for the design of artificial photoenzymes to expand the scope of abiological reactions. Here, we report the genetic incorporation of a thioxanthone&#8208;containing amino acid into a protein scaffold using an engineered pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA/pyrrolysyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase pair. The designer enzyme was engineered to catalyze a dearomative [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction in high yields (up to &gt; 99% yield) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 98:2 e.r.). This work provides a robust and facile method for photoenzyme design and lays the foundation for the development of photoenzymatic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrahigh Proton Selectivity by Assembled Cationic Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets are becoming increasingly attractive as promising two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials for proton transport due to their ionic functionality and tailor&#8208;made pores. However, most synthetic methods for nanosheets rely on surface&#8208;assisted methods or phase transformation often yielding nanosheets with low aspect ratios. In this study, we present a bottom&#8208;up approach utilizing an oil&#8208;oil&#8208;water triphase system to achieve the large&#8208;scale synthesis of ionic COF nanosheets. The intermediate oil layer in this system modulates the diffusion rate of monomers from the top oil phase into the aqueous phase, enabling in&#8208;plane anisotropic secondary growth from the initial discrete fibrous structure into large and crystalline COF nanosheets. The ionic COF nanosheets exhibit excellent proton permeability while simultaneously excluding other cations by casting into crack&#8208;free membranes, demonstrating efficient HCl extraction from acidic water waste. This strategy for larger&#8208;scale COF nanosheet growth will offer an alternative platform for designing multifunctional COF membranes with applications in sophisticated separation technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Fe2 and Ni Sites for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient, cost&#8208;effective, and robust electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount for the large&#8208;scale commercialization of renewable fuel cells and rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, a new ternary&#8208;atom catalyst that is composed of paired Fe sites and single Ni sites (as Fe2&#8208;N6 and Ni&#8208;N4) coordinated onto hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon microspheres is developed. The as&#8208;synthesized catalyst exhibits remarkable activities toward both the ORR and OER in an alkaline media, with superior performances to those of the control materials that contain only Fe2&#8208;N6 or Ni&#8208;N4 sites. Density functional theory calculations and in situ infrared (IR) spectroscopic studies clearly reveal that the Fe2&#8208;N6 centers are the active sites for both ORR and OER, and their electrocatalytic activities are synergistically enhanced through optimization of their d&#8208;band centers by the Ni&#8208;N4 sites. This ternary&#8208;atom catalyst may be a promising, alternative, sustainable catalyst to commercially used Pt&#8208; and Ru&#8208;based catalysts to drive both ORR and OER in rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries and other related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoupling H2 and O2 Release in Particulate Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting Using a Reversible O2 Binder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>H2 and O2&#160;evolutions occur simultaneously for conventional particulate photocatalytic overall water splitting (PPOWS), leading to a significant backward reaction and the formation of an explosive H2/O2 gas mixture. This is an issue that must be addressed prior to industrialization of PPOWS. Here, a convenient, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable concept is introduced to uncouple hydrogen and oxygen production for PPOWS. Based on this idea, a three&#8208;component photocatalyst, Co(5%)&#8208;HPCN/(rGO/Pt), is constructed, consisting of a photoresponsive chip (HPCN), a H2 evolution cocatalyst (rGO/Pt), and a cobalt complex capable of reversibly binding O2 (Co), to achieve the decoupling&#160;of PPOWS under alternating UV and visible light irradiations. The asynchronous&#160;O2 and H2 evolution strategy have considerable flexibility regarding the photocatalyst structure and light sources suitable for PPOWS.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Electrolytes with High Disordered Solvation Structures for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are playing an increasingly important role in the field of energy storage. However, their practical applications are handicapped by severe dendrite formation and side reactions on zinc anodes. Herein, a low&#8208;concentration high&#8208;entropy (HE) electrolyte strategy is proposed to achieve high reversibility and ultra&#8208;durable zinc metal anode. Specifically, this HE electrolyte features multiple anions participating in coordination and highly disordered solvation shells, which would disrupt intrinsic H&#8208;bond network between water molecules and suppress interfacial side reactions. Moreover, these diversified weakly solvated structures can lower solvation energy of Zn2+ solvation configurations and enhance zinc ion diffusion kinetics,&#160;promoting uniform Zn deposition and electrode interface stability. Consequently, Zn||Zn symmetric cells exhibit over 2,000 hours of cycling stability, and Zn||Cu asymmetric cells achieve high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% over 500 cycles. Furthermore, the Zn||PANI full cell with optimized HE&#8208;50mM electrolyte delivers a high specific capacity of 110.7 mAh g&#8208;1 over 2,000 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8208;1 and a capacity retention of 70.4% at 15 A g&#8208;1 after 10,000 cycles. Remarkably, even at a low temperature of &#8208;20 &#176;C, the Zn||PANI full cells equipped with HE&#8208;50mM electrolyte still demonstrate long&#8208;term cycling stability over 600 cycles with high&#8208;capacity retention of 93.5%.</dc:description>

         <title>Fragment Discovery by X&#8208;ray Crystallographic Screening Targeting the CTP Binding Site of Pseudomonas aeruginosa IspD</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With antimicrobial resistance (AMR) reaching alarming levels, new anti&#8208;infectives with unpreceded mechanisms of action are urgently needed. The 2&#8208;C&#8208;methylerythritol&#8208;D&#8208;erythritol&#8208;4&#8208;phosphate (MEP) pathway represents an attractive source of drug targets due to its essential role in numerous pathogenic Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt), whilst being absent in human cells. Here, we solved the first crystal structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) IspD, the third enzyme in the MEP pathway and present the discovery of a fragment&#8208;based compound class identified through crystallographic screening of PaIspD. The initial fragment occupies the CTP binding cavity within the active site. Confirmation of fragment&#8211;protein interactions was achieved through 1H saturation&#8211;transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (1H&#8208;STD&#8208;NMR). Building upon these findings and insights from the co&#8208;crystal structures, we identified two growth vectors for fragment growing. We synthesized derivatives addressing both growth vectors, which showed improved affinities for PaIspD. Our new fragment class targets PaIspD, displays promising affinity and favorable growth vectors for further optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>Supercritical Ethane Processing of ZIF&#8208;8 Membranes towards Pressure&#8208;Resistant C3H6/C3H8 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZIF&#8208;8 membranes have shown great promise in industrial&#8208;scale C3H6/C3H8 separation. Nonetheless, sustainable preparation of pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes remains a grand challenge. In this study, we pioneered the use of supercritical ethane (scC2H6) as reaction medium for preparing pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. Membrane growth in neutral organic environment was proven to have less disturbance to structure integrity compared with supercritical CO2 (scCO2). Gas permeation results indicated that obtained ZIF&#8208;8 membrane exhibited an ideal C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 172.1 with C3H6 permeance of 5.9&#215;10&#8208;9 mol&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;s&#8722;1&#183;Pa&#8722;1. Of particular note, the membrane maintained stable C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of ~150 with C3H6 flux of ~1.6&#215;10&#8208;3 mol&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;s&#8722;1 at operation pressure of 6 bar, which was significantly different from ZIF&#8208;8 membranes obtained from scCO2 reaction medium. Through combining with advantages of zero pollutant discharge and full ligand recovery, our protocol holds great promise in sustainable preparation of pressure&#8208;resistant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes towards practical application in high&#8208;purity C3H6 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Modular Assembly of Homochiral Ir(III)&#8208;Metallohelices to Reverse Metallodrug Resistance by Inhibiting CDK1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug resistance is a major cause of cancer recurrence and poor prognosis.   The innovative design and synthesis of inhibitors to target drug&#8208;resistance&#8208;specific proteins is highly desirable. However, challenges remain in precisely adjusting their conformation and stereochemistry to adapt the chiral regions of target proteins. Herein, using a stepwise programmable modular assembly approach, we precisely engineered two pairs of homochiral dinuclear Ir(III) metallohelices (&#923;2S4&#8208;Hbpy and &#916;2R4&#8208;Hbpy, &#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpy and &#923;2R4&#8208;Hbpy) functionalized with flexible dithiourea linkages. The resulting homochiral metallohelices exhibited significant chirality&#8208;dependent photocytotoxicities, and the enhanced structural compatibility of&#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpywith the target cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) contributed to its superior photodynamic therapy efficacy, achieving an outstanding photocytotoxicity index (PI) value of 2.3&#215;104. Interestingly, emerging as a critical mediator in the development of oxaliplatin resistance, CDK1 targeting by &#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpyachieved enhanced cellular uptake, anticancer activity, and oncosis&#8208;mediated cell death in oxaliplatin&#8208;resistant HCT8/L cells. Mechanistic investigations, including proteomic profiling and CDK1 gene silencing, confirmed the pivotal role of chirality&#8208;selective CDK1 targeting in reversing metallodrug resistance. This study introduces a promising platform for constructing and customizing flexible metallohelices with precise conformation and stereochemistry to target drug&#8208;resistance&#8208;specific proteins, offering innovative insights into the designability of metallodrugs to overcome drug resistance.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Swing Synthesis of Highly Crystalline Covalent Organic Framework Films for Fast and Precise Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Producing crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) films is intimately related to the elusive nucleation and growth processes, which is desirable for efficient molecular transport. Rational control over these processes and insights into the mechanisms are crucial to improve synthetic methodology and achieve COF films with regular channels. Here, we report the controllable synthesis of COF films via the temperature&#8208;swing strategy and explore their crystallization from monomer assemblies to film formation. A detailed time&#8208;dependent study reveals that COF crystallites preferentially coalesce at low temperature, progressing from assembled nanospheres to continuous films through lateral and vertical interactions. Moreover, appropriately elevating the synthesis temperature promotes crystal growth and eliminate the defects of weakly crystalline regions, contributing to highly crystalline and porous COF film with a surface area of 746 m2 g&#8722;1. The prepared COF composite membrane exhibits a methanol permeance of 97.8 L m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 bar&#8208;1, which is five times higher than the weakly crystalline counterpart. In addition, the molecular sieving test recognize great membrane selectivity to discriminate the antibiotic mixture with a high separation factor of 15.4. This work offers a feasible way for the rational design of the synthesis environment, enabling access to highly crystalline framework materials for targeting molecular separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Coverage of Adsorbed Hydrogen via Hydrogen Spillover Enables Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Phenol to Cyclohexanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of phenol is a sustainable route to produce cyclohexanone, an industrially important feedstock for polymer synthesis. However, attaining high selectivity and faradaic efficiency (FE) of cyclohexanone remain challenging, owning to over&#8208;hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol and competition of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, by employing hydrogen spillover effect, we modulate adsorbed hydrogen species (Hads) coverage on Pt surface via migration to TiO2 in an anatase TiO2&#8208;supported Pt catalyst. In ECH of phenol, a high selectivity (94%) and good FE (63%) of cyclohexanone are obtained, showing more advantageous performance compared with previous reports. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests and electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveal that Hads migrated from Pt to TiO2. We propose that TiO2&#8208;induced hydrogen spillover contributes to low Hads coverage over Pt, which effectively hinders over&#8208;hydrogenation of cyclohexanone and HER. We establish a scaling relationship between the intensity of hydrogen spillover and cyclohexanone selectivity by varying the types of anatase TiO2, and show the universality of the strategy over other reducible metal oxides as the support (rutile TiO2, CeO2 and WO3). This work showcases an effective strategy for tuning hydrogenation selectivity in electro&#8208;catalysis, by taking advantage of thermo&#8208;catalytically well&#8208;documented hydrogen spillover effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Construction and Application of Axially Chiral Spiro&#8208;bisindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiro skeletons have emerged as a privileged class of chiral carriers across various research fields, including asymmetric catalysis and functional materials, due to their remarkable configurational rigidity. However, limited structural diversity of spiro frameworks significantly restricts the expansion of their applications. Here we present a new class of axially chiral spiro&#8208;bisindole frameworks and report their first enantioselective construction via a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular dehydrative cyclization reaction. Unlike the classical SPINOL backbone, incorporation of indole moieties in place of phenol enhances the nucleophilicity of ketone substrates, thereby eliminating the need for a tedious pre&#8208;activation process. By leveraging the retained active sites of indole, the resulting highly enantioenriched spiro&#8208;bisindoles can be rapidly transformed into other valuable structures. More importantly, axially chiral fluorescent molecules with good asymmetry factors and quantum fluorescence efficiency are readily accessed, opening a new avenue for developing chiral fluorescent materials. Control experiments demonstrate the pivotal role of both unmasked N&#8208;H bonds in achieving good efficiency and enantiocontrol.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Metal&#8208;free Anti&#8208;Perovskite with Strong Chiroptical Nonlinearity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nonlinear chiroptical properties of chiral metal halide perovskite has attracted substantial attention in recent years. In order to overcome the inherent limitations of metal halide, such as high costs, potential toxicity, challenges with recycling, especially the limited laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (LDT), we have successfully constructed the first chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite, with the aim of utilizing it in second harmonic generation&#8208;circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD). Moreover, the anti&#8208;perovskite composed entirely of small organic ions typically display a more extensive transparent window , which could contribute a high LDT. Herein two chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskites, R/S&#8208;MCN [(R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)6Cl(NH4Cl6 )] were constructed, and exhibit strong second&#8208;harmonic generation response from 800 to 980 nm. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical coefficient of chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite reaches 0.89 pm/V, which is higher than that of commercial Y&#8208;cut quartz. Most importantly, both R&#8208; and S&#8208;MCN exhibit a large nonlinear optical activity with a high SHG dissymmetry factor (gSHG&#8208;CD) of 0.60 and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold of 71 mJ/cm2 , which is higher than that of most reported chiral perovskites. Our findings indicate that chiral metal&#8208;free anti&#8208;perovskite have the potential to be a valuable addition to the development of next&#8208;generation nonlinear chiroptical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Arenesulfenyl Fluorides and Fluorosulfenylation of Alkenes, Alkynes, and &#945;&#8208;Diazocarbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfenyl fluorides are organic compounds of sulfur in formal oxidation state +2 with the formula R&#8211;S&#8211;F. Although the chloride, bromide, and iodide analogues have been extensively described in the literature, arenesulfenyl fluorides remain essentially unstudied. These structures have been implicated as putative intermediates in established processes to access polyfluorinated sulfur species; however, definitive and direct evidence of their existence has not been obtained, nor has a systematic understanding of their reactivity. Here, we report the synthesis, isolation, and spectroscopic characterization of several arenesulfenyl fluorides, including structural analysis of 2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride and 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzenesulfenyl fluoride by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The functional group undergoes direct, efficient, and highly regioselective anti&#8208;addition to alkenes and alkynes, as well as insertion by carbenes. The resulting &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;fluoro thioether adducts can be readily transformed into useful fluorinated motifs, for example by modification of the sulfur groups (to sulfonamides or sulfonyl fluorides), by sulfur elimination (to generate formal C&#8211;H fluorination products), or by Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination (to form vinyl fluorides). Thus, we establish that sulfenyl fluorides are unexpectedly accessible and stable compounds, which serve as versatile reagents for the production of fluorinated organic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Anomalous Role of Carbon in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonaceous species, including subsurface carbidic carbon and surface carbon, play crucial roles in heterogeneous catalysis. Many reports suggested the importance of subsurface carbon in the selective hydrogenation of alkynes over Pd&#8208;based catalysts. However, the role of surface carbon has been largely overlooked. We demonstrate that subsurface carbon in Pd is not responsible for the selectivity in acetylene hydrogenation. In contrast, the structure of surface carbonaceous species plays a decisive role in hydrogenation selectivity. Electron microscopy and spectroscopy evidence, along with theoretical modelling, reveal that partial graphitization of surface carbonaceous species results in unique spatial confinement of surface reaction intermediates, thus altering the reaction energy landscape in favour of ethylene desorption as opposed to over&#8208;hydrogenation. This mechanism for selectivity control is analogous to enzyme catalysis, where the active centers selectively attract reactants and release products. Similar mechanism might be present in CO/CO2 hydrogenation and alkane dehydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy&#8208;Level Alignment at TiO2@NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 Interface for High&#8208;Performance Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal oxide&#8208;based chemiresistive sensors suffer from high operating temperatures and poor selectivity. The TiO2@(NH2)x&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (x = 0, 1, or 2) heterojunctions enhance sensing performance through energy level modulation. TiO2@NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 detects NO2 at 1 ppb in &lt; 0.3&#8197;min at room temperature, exhibiting high selectivity and stability, thereby underscoring the role of energy band engineering in the advancement of sensor performance.







Abstract
Metal oxide (MO)&#8208;based chemiresistive sensors have great potential in environmental monitoring, security protection, and disease diagnosis. However, the thermally activated sensing mechanism in pristine MOs leads to high working temperature and poor selectivity, which are the main challenges impeding practical applications. Precise modulation of the band structure at the heterojunction interfaces of MOs offers the opportunity to unlock unique electrical and optical properties, enabling us to overcome these challenges. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable structures are promising materials for aligning the energy levels at the heterojunctions of MOs. Herein, we report the energy&#8208;level structural engineering of MO@MOF heterojunctions to optimize chemiresistive sensing performance. The interface was flexibly modulated from a straddling gap to a staggered gap by &#8208;NH2 functionalization of TiO2@(NH2)x&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, varying x from 0 to 1 and 2, respectively. TiO2@(NH2)x&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 combines the advantages of MOs and MOFs to synergistically improve gas&#8208;sensing properties. As a result, TiO2@NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 is the first light&#8208;activated material to detect NO2 at 1 ppb with a response time of &lt; 0.3&#8197;min at room temperature. It also exhibited excellent selectivity and long&#8208;term stability. Our study underscores the potential of energy band engineering in creating high&#8208;performance sensors, offering a strategy to overcome current material limits.

         <title>Unveiling the Structure&#8208;Fluorogenic Property Relationship of Seoul&#8208;Fluor&#8208;Derived Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized fluorogenic Seoul&#8208;Fluor (SF)&#8208;based tetrazine (Tz) probes with differentiated turn&#8208;on fluorescence upon inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO), bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN), and spiro[2.3]hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene (Sph). Through electronic modifications and quantum calculations, we elucidated the relationship between dienophile&#8208;Tz adduct structures and their fluorogenic properties. These probes enabled simultaneous multicolor bioorthogonal imaging of diverse cellular targets using a single probe.







Abstract
Tetrazine (Tz)&#8208;embedded fluorescent probes, known for their fluorogenicity following bioorthogonal inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (iEDDA) reactions, are extensively used in bioimaging. Despite extensive research on fluorogenic Tz probes, there has been limited systematic exploration of their fluorogenic responses with various dienophiles. In this study, we elucidate the structure&#8208;fluorogenic property relationship of bioorthogonal Tz probes. We synthesized a series of Seoul&#8208;Fluor&#8208;Tz (SFTz) probes designed to exhibit differentiated turn&#8208;on fluorescence upon iEDDA reactions with three dienophiles: trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO), bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN), and spiro[2.3]hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene (Sph). Our findings revealed that the fluorogenic properties of the SFTz probes are highly dependent on the structures of Tz&#8208;dienophile adducts. By systematically modifying the electronic properties and employing quantum chemical calculations, we developed a series of SFTz probes with optimal dienophile&#8208;dependent fluorescence. These probes enabled simultaneous dual&#8208;color imaging of different cellular targets using a single probe, providing a robust approach for advanced bioimaging applications that require precise and efficient multicolor labeling strategies.

         <title>Selection of Plastic&#8208;Binding DNA Aptamers for Microplastics Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), a pyrimidine&#8208;rich DNA aptamer was isolated for PVS and PS microplastics, despite their different chemical structures. The high affinity of the aptamer for plastics allowed fluorescence&#8208;based microplastic detection.







Abstract
Plastics are critical materials for modern technological applications, yet environmental contamination by microplastics has become a growing concern. In this study, DNA aptamers were isolated for two of the most abundant plastic materials: polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polystyrene (PS). These aptamers contain approximately 90&#8201;% cytosine and thymine but only 10&#8201;% purine content. Among them, the PVC&#8208;1 aptamer binds to PVC with a six&#8208;fold higher capacity than a random sequenced DNA. Among the tested plastic materials, PVC and PS exhibited the highest specific binding capacity. Using fluorophore&#8208;labeled PVC&#8208;1 aptamer, PS/PVC microplastics as low as 1&#8197;mg were detected, and the aptamer was selective for microplastics over other environmentally relevant materials, such as silica. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the aptamer attempted to maximize contact with the plastic surface for adsorption. This plastic&#8208;binding aptamer is expected to find applications in environmental monitoring and has fundamental implications for surface&#8208;binding aptamers.

         <title>Molecular Trapdoor in HEU Zeolite Enables Inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sr&#8208;exchanged K&#8208;type clinoptilolite (Sr/K&#8208;HEU) zeolite exhibits molecular trapdoor effect and thereby achieves inverse separation of CO2&#8208;C2H2 with benchmark selectivity, which provides new thoughts for gas separation by zeolites and improves current understanding of molecular trapdoor mechanism.







Abstract
The adsorptive separation of molecules with very similar physical properties is always a challenging task. Reported herein is the design and tailoring of zeolite adsorbent for the precise discrimination and separation of CO2&#8208;C2H2 mixture through the pronounced trapdoor effect. Typically, Sr exchanged K&#8208;type clinoptilolite, namely Sr/K&#8208;HEU, is developed as a robust zeolite adsorbent for inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 separation, showing the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dynamic CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 48.0 and sustainable CO2 dynamic uptake of 0.96&#8197;mmol/g at the same time. The perfect recyclability and the intrinsic low&#8208;cost nature of Sr/K&#8208;HEU make it a promising candidate for practical applications. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction determines the precise structure of Sr/K&#8208;HEU and density functional theory calculations reveal the intricate interplay between guest molecules and the gate&#8208;keeping extraframework cations. Briefly, extraframework Sr2+ cations from the ten&#8208;membered rings of HEU zeolites act as the molecular trapdoor, allowing the entry of CO2 molecules while excluding C2H2. This work presents a new example of molecular trapdoor in zeolite and its successful application in the challenging inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 separation, which not only expands the scope of molecular trapdoor concept but also improves current understanding on the nature of molecular trapdoor.

         <title>Regulating Interfacial Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks by Implanting Cu Sites with Perfluorooctane to Accelerate CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to ethanol holds promise to generate value&#8208;added chemicals and harness renewable energy simultaneously, though challenging. The authors presented an interesting CO2RR selectivity switch from ethylene to ethanol by implanting Cu2O catalyst with C8F18 to regulate the hydrogen bonding networks, achieving FEethanol of &#8764;55.2&#8201;% and the ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene ratio of ~5.4.







Abstract
Efficient CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to ethanol holds promise to generate value&#8208;added chemicals and harness renewable energy simultaneously. Yet, it remains an ongoing challenge due to the competition with thermodynamically more preferred ethylene production. Herein, we presented a CO2 reduction predilection switch from ethylene to ethanol (ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene ratio of ~5.4) by inherently implanting Cu sites with perfluorooctane to create interfacial noncovalent interactions. The 1.83&#8201;%F&#8208;Cu2O organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids (OIHs) exhibited an extraordinary ethanol faradaic efficiency (FEethanol) of &#8764;55.2&#8201;%, with an impressive ethanol partial current density of 166&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and excellent robustness over 60&#8197;hours of continuous operation. This exceptional performance ranks our 1.83&#8201;%F&#8208;Cu2O OIHs among the best&#8208;performing ethanol&#8208;oriented CO2RR electrocatalysts. Our findings identified that C8F18 could strengthen the interfacial hydrogen bonding connectivity, which consequently promotes the generation of active hydrogen species and preferentially favors the hydrogenation of *CHCOH to *CHCHOH, thus switching the reaction from ethylene&#8208;preferred to ethanol&#8208;oriented. The presented investigations highlight opportunities for using noncovalent interactions to tune the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction to ethanol, bringing it closer to practical implementation requirements.

         <dc:description>
Here we report reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) analogs that enable metal&#8208; and light&#8208;free decarboxylative functionalization of RAEs under ambient and open&#8208;air conditions. This approach offers simple operation without inert gas protection, metals and light, rapid reaction completion within 5 minutes from the easily preparation of aryliodine (III) dicarboxylates, diverse bond formation (C&#8722;S, C&#8722;Se, C&#8722;SCF3, C&#8722;C and C&#8722;CN bonds), broad substrate scope (&gt;70 examples), and synthetic utility in late&#8208;stage functionalization, making this strategy complement classical decarboxylative strategies.







Abstract
Here we report a metal&#8208; and light&#8208;free decarboxylative functionalization approach enabled by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) analogues. The efficient and operationally simple approach, conducted in 5 minutes from in situ preparation of aryliodine (III) dicarboxylates under open&#8208;air and ambient conditions, enables diverse bond formation and exhibits a broad substrate scope of over 70 examples. Late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules and natural products further demonstrates the synthetic utility of this method. Combined experimental and computational studies elucidate the mechanistic pathway. These transformations streamline the synthesis of sp3 carbon&#8208;enriched compounds, adding a new dimension to classical decarboxylative reactions.

         <title>Fast Seawater Desalination Integrated with Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic desalination device integrates CO2 electroreduction, desalination, and oxygen evolution reaction to deliver outstanding Faradaic efficiency, fast salt removal rate (SRR), and efficiency, which is also applicable in natural seawater desalination.







Abstract
Coupling desalination with electrocatalytic reactions is an emerging approach to simultaneously addressing freshwater scarcity and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the salt removal rate in such processes is slow, and the applicable water sources are often limited to those with high salt concentrations. Herein, we show high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic desalination by coupling with electrochemical CO2 reduction using a carbon catalyst. A ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;derived carbon catalyst embedded with Cu nanoparticles delivers a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.3&#8201;% for CO production at 288&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. The efficient CO2 electroreduction generates high current densities, which drive fast salt ion transfer across ion exchange membranes. The integrated device enables one of the highest salt removal rates of 1043.49&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;min&#8722;1 among various desalination methods. Drinking water can be obtained with an ion removal rate of 99&#8201;% when natural seawater is used as the water source.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on C3N4: Minimizing Single Atom Pt Loading for Maximized Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of metal single atoms (SAs) as co&#8208;catalysts on semiconductors has emerged as a promising technology to enhance their photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. In this study, we describe the deposition of very low amounts of Pt SAs (&lt;0.1 at%) on exfoliated graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) by a direct Pt&#8208;deposition approach from highly dilute chloroplatinic acid precursors. We find that &#8211; using this technique &#8211; a remarkably low loading of highly dispersed Pt SAs (0.03wt%) on C3N4 is sufficient to achieve a drastic decrease in the overall charge transfer resistance and a maximized photocatalytic efficiency. The resulting low&#8208;loaded Pt SAs/C3N4 provides a H2 production rate of 1.66 mmol/h/mg Pt, with a remarkable stability against agglomeration; even during prolonged photocatalytic reactions no sign of light&#8208;induced Pt agglomerations can be observed. We ascribe the high performance and stability to the site&#8208;selective, stable coordination of Pt within the C3N4 structure. Notably the H2 production rate of the low&#8208;loaded Pt SAs surpasses the activity of Pt SAs deposited by other techniques or nanoparticles at comparable or even higher loading &#8212; the optimized Pt SAs decorated C3N4 show &#8776;5.9 times higher rate than Pt NP decorated C3N4.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Oxetanes are valuable motifs in medicinal chemistry applications, with demonstrated potential to serve as bioisosteres for an array of functional groups. Through the visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoredox hydrodecarboxylation of 2&#8208;aryl oxetane 2&#8208;carboxylic acids this work enables access to the products of a [2+2]&#8208;photocycloaddition between alkenes and aryl aldehydes without the challenges associated with a traditional UV&#8208;light&#8208;mediated Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction. Investigation into the hydrodecarboxylation mechanism reveals substrate&#8208;dependent modes of initiation under the conditions reported herein.

         <title>A Scalable Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Powered by Polycatenation Strategy for Efficient Acetylene Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) and ethylene (C2H4) is a significant challenge in the petrochemical industry due to their similar physicochemical properties. Pore space partition (PSP) has shown promise in enhancing gas adsorption capacity and selectivity by reducing pore size and increasing the density of guest binding sites. Herein, we firstly employ the 2D&#8594;3D polycatenation strategy to construct a PSP metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpy, incorporating functional N/O sites to enhance C2H2 purification. The polycatenated framework with optimized pore size and regularity, exhibiting significant improvements over traditional PSP MOFs by resolving the critical contradiction of balancing C2H2 uptake (98.5 cm3 g&#8208;1 at 298 K, 100 kPa) and selectivity of C2H2/CO2 (3.4), C2H2/C2H4 (5.9), and C2H2/CH4 (96.4) in a MOF. Breakthrough experiments confirm high&#8208;purity C2H4 (&gt; 99.9%) and high C2H2 productivity from binary and ternary mixtures. Notably, Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpy exhibits excellent water stability, scalability, and regenerability after 20 cycles for separating C2H2/CO2. Theoretical calculations verify that the strong binding of C2H2 is mainly attributed to the C&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O/N interactions between host Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpy and guest C2H2 molecules. The polycatenation strategy not only improved industrial C2H2 purification efficiency but also enriched the design diversity of customized MOFs for other gas separation applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The Intrinsic Fluorescence of Peptide Self&#8208;Assemblies Across pH Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of solution pH on the structural and optical properties of peptide self&#8208;assemblies remains a critical yet unresolved issue in peptide research. This study investigates the heptapeptide Ac&#8208;IHIHIQI&#8208;NH2 and its intrinsic fluorescence across a range of pH levels, demonstrating that variations in pH lead to significant changes in the morphology of the self&#8208;assembled structures. While the position of the fluorescence emission remains constant&#8212;due to the stability provided by the hydrogen bonding network of the peptide backbone&#8212;the intensity of the fluorescence exhibits a direct correlation with the degree of self&#8208;assembly. This finding underscores a dynamic relationship between structural morphology and optical properties. Notably, the ability of the peptide to self&#8208;assemble under diverse pH conditions is a novel observation that contrasts with previously reported literature. By employing a computationally driven approach, complemented by rigorous experimental validation, this work establishes a new paradigm for studying complex interacting systems such as peptide self&#8208;assembly. Our findings enhance the understanding of how environmental factors influence peptide behavior and pave the way for the design of innovative peptide&#8208;based materials with tunable optical characteristics, with potential applications in bioluminescent probes and diagnostic tools for neurodegenerative diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Evolution of a Hybrid Metallic Alloy Interphase for Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are widely acknowledged as viable future energy storage solutions, particularly for low&#8208;cost stationary applications. However, the interfacial instability of zinc anodes represents a major challenge to the commercial potential of Zn&#8208;ion systems, promoting an array of side reactions including spontaneous corrosion, hydrogen evolution, and dendrite growth that destabilize cell performance, lower Coulombic efficiency (CE) and ultimately lead to early cell failure. While other commercially relevant battery systems benefit from a spontaneously forming solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), no such layer forms in AZIBs. Herein, we have designed and engineered an operando evolved metallic alloy interphase for AZIBs. This interfacial layer is initially deposited in the form of a thin film of Ag and In, but develops in situ to become an intimate mix of an AgxZny alloy and metallic indium. Importantly, this dual&#8208;heterometallic layer acts to synergistically regulate the migration of zinc ions through the alloy interphase and enables the dense, planar deposition Zn, simultaneously overcoming all major drivers of Zn anode degradation. Symmetric and full cells containing this modified metallic zinc anode exhibit stable electrochemical performance, offering high&#8208;capacity retention. Hence, this scalable approach represents a viable route towards the commercial utilization of this energy storage system.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy Transfer (EnT) Catalysis of non&#8208;Symmetrical Borylated Dienes: Origin of Reaction Selectivity in Competing EnT Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy transfer catalysis (EnT) has had a profound impact on contemporary organic synthesis enabling the construction of higher in energy, complex molecules, via efficient access to the triplet excited state. Despite this, intermolecular reactivity, and the unique possibility to access several reaction pathways via a central triplet diradical has rendered control over reaction outcomes, an intractable challenge. Extended chromophores such as non&#8208;symmetrical dienes have the potential to undergo [2+2] cycloaddition, [4+2] cycloaddition or geometric isomerisation, which, in combination with other mechanistic considerations (site&#8208; and regioselectivity), results in chemical reactions that are challenging to regulate. Herein, we utilise boron as a tool to probe reactivity of non&#8208;symmetrical dienes under EnT catalysis, paying particular attention to the impact of boron hybridisation effects on the target reactivity. Through this, a highly site&#8208; and regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition was realised with the employed boron motif effecting reaction efficiency. Subtle modifications to the core scaffold enabled a [4+2] cycloaddition, while a counterintuitive regiodivergence was observed in geometric isomerisation versus [2+2] cycloaddition. The observed reactivity was validated via a mechanistic investigation, determining the origin of regiodivergence and reaction selectivity in competing EnT processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Sub&#8208;nanometer Pt Nanowires with Disordered Shells for Highly Active Elelctrocatalytic Oxidation of Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional materials at atomic&#8208;scale dimensions represents a milestone in nanotechnology, offering the potential to maximize atom utilization while enhancing catalytic performance. However, achieving structural stability and durability at such fine scales requires precise control over material structure and local chemical environment. Here, we introduce dimethylamine (DMA) as a small&#8208;molecule modifier, in contrast to conventional long&#8208;chain surfactants, to interact with surface Pt atoms. This approach facilitates the removal of surface Pt atoms bonded to nitrogen atoms in DMA during solubilization in water, effectively stripping the size of Pt nanowires down to sub&#8208;nanometer.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Controlled synthesis of one-dimensional materials at atomic-scale dimensions represents a milestone in nanotechnology, offering the potential to maximize atom utilization while enhancing catalytic performance. However, achieving structural stability and durability at such fine scales requires precise control over material structure and local chemical environment. Here, we introduce dimethylamine (DMA) as a small-molecule modifier, in contrast to conventional long-chain surfactants, to interact with surface Pt atoms. This approach facilitates the removal of surface Pt atoms bonded to nitrogen atoms in DMA during solubilization in water, effectively stripping the size of Pt nanowires down to sub-nanometer. The resulting Pt subnanometer nanowires (subNWs) feature a monoatomic-layer surface composed of disordered, bonding-unsaturated Pt atoms, and an interior crystalline core as narrow as 0.58 nm in diameter. These unique structural characteristics confer the Pt subNWs with an electrochemically active surface-area of 189 m2&#183;g&#8722;1 during formic acid oxidation. Furthermore, the amorphous-like surface structure lowers the free energy of *OCOH intermediates and inhibits the formation of toxic byproducts CO, demonstrating exceptional electrocatalytic activity of 18.1 A&#183;mg&#8722;1, surpassing all reported Pt-based electrocatalysts. Our work introduces a novel strategy for the controlled construction of nanowire-structures at sub-nanometer scale, effectively bridging the gap between ultrafine structural design and performance stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Oriented and Ordered Co&#8208;Assembly Monolayers for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells with inverted architecture have remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operating stability based on self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) hole transport layer. Homogeneous distribution and covalent binding mode of SAM monolayers are critical to improving interfacial property and reducing interfacial losses, which can be achieved through molecular design and co&#8208;assembly strategy. Here, we propose co&#8208;assembly strategy with SAM by employing a novel 2&#8208;D &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure graphdiyne derivative (PAG) with phosphoric acid groups. Through the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding between PAG and SAM, the enhanced tridentate anchoring and highly ordered molecular orientation perpendicular to the substrate are successfully achieved. The improvement of interfacial characteristics further optimizes the crystalline quality and buried interface properties of perovskite films, allowing us to achieve a remarkable PCE of 26.10% under standard illumination.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Conjugated&#8208;Polymer Electrode Enables Rapid Proton Conduction for Electrosynthesis of Ammonia from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrosynthesis of ammonia (NH3) from nitrate (NO3&#8208;) using renewable energy holds promise as a supplementary alternative to the Haber&#8208;Bosch process for NH3 production. Most research focuses on tuning the catalytic activity of metal catalysts by modification of the catalyst structures. However, the electrode supports which could influence the catalytic activity have not been well&#8208;explored. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for NO3&#8208; reduction to NH3 still exhibit limited energy efficiency at ampere&#8208;level current density. Herein, we report a polyaniline&#8208;based molecular electrode with Cu catalyst for selective and energy&#8208;efficient NO3&#8208; reduction to NH3. In the electrode, the polyaniline promotes protonation of the key intermediate formed during NO3&#8208; reduction at Cu, which circumvents the limitation of the Cu catalyst in the efficiency&#8208;limiting proton transfer step. The molecular electrode produces NH3 at a partial current density of 2.7 A cm&#8208;2 with an energy efficiency of 62%, demonstrating much better electrochemical performance than common Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts and indicating the great potential in molecular engineering of electrode supports&#160;for selective NO3&#8208; reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Complexes Derived from Non&#8208;classical Diboriranes: Side&#8208;on vs. End&#8208;on Carbonylative Ring Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report first &#960;&#8208;complexes derived from non&#8208;classical diboriranes (three&#8208;membered aromatic B2C rings) and their carbonylative ring expansion to four&#8208; and five&#8208;membered cyclic ligands. The H&#8208;bridged diborirane (R=2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl; R&#8217;=H) initially reacts with Fe2(CO)9 to an allylic &#960;&#8208;complex, which further reacts under side&#8208;on addition of CO to the B&#8722;B moiety to an &#951;5&#8208;coordinated five&#8208;membered B2C2O ring. For R&#8217;=SnMe3, CO is added end&#8208;on to the B&#8722;B bond.







Abstract
Unlike cyclopropanes, the analogous B2C species (diboriranes) tend to adopt non&#8208;classical H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromatic structures with bridging moieties R between the boron atoms. The coordination of the thus generated cyclic 2e&#8722; &#960;&#8208;system to transition metals is completely unexplored. We here report that complexation of non&#8208;classical diboriranes cyclo&#8208;&#956;&#8208;RB2Dur2CPh (R=H, SnMe3; Dur=2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl) to Fe(CO)3 fragments allows for the carbonylative ring expansion of the B2C ring to either four&#8208; or five&#8208;membered rings depending on the nature of the BRB 3&#8208;center&#8208;2&#8208;electron bond (3c2e): The H&#8208;bridged diborirane (R=H) initially reacts with Fe2(CO)9 to the allylic &#960;&#8208;complex with an agostic BH/Fe interaction. Subsequent formal hydroboration of CO from excess Fe2(CO)9 results in the side&#8208;on ring expansion under formation of a five&#8208;membered B2C2O ring, coordinated to the Fe(CO)3 moiety. In contrast, in case of the stannyl&#8208;bridged diborirane (R=SnMe3) under the same conditions, CO is added end&#8208;on to the B&#8722;B bond with the carbon terminus formally inserting into the B2Sn 3c2e&#8208;bond. The two carbonylative ring expansion products can also be described as nido and closo clusters, respectively, according to the Wade&#8208;Mingos rules.

         <title>Tunable Isometric Donor&#8208;Acceptor Wurster&#8208;Type Covalent Organic Framework Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline polymeric materials featuring wide&#8208;ranging structural control and modularity. The synthesis of a series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor Wurster building blocks enabled the formation of isostructural, photoactive COFs with distinct optical features in thin films. These COFs were further applied for photoelectrochemical water splitting.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer remarkable versatility, combining ordered structures, high porosity, and tailorable functionalities in nanoscale reaction spaces. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of isostructural, photoactive Wurster&#8208;type COFs achieved by manipulating the chemical and electronic nature of the Wurster aromatic amine building blocks. A series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) Wurster building block molecules was synthesized by incorporating heteroaromatic acceptors with varying strengths between triphenylamine donor groups. These tailored building blocks were integrated into a 2D COF scaffold, resulting in highly crystalline structures and similar morphologies across all COFs. Remarkably, this structural uniformity was also achieved in the synthesis of homogeneous and oriented thin films. Steady&#8208;state photoluminescence revealed a tunable red&#8208;shift in film emission exceeding 100&#8197;nm, demonstrating effective manipulation of their optical properties. Furthermore, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting studies exhibited a doubled current density (8.1&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.2&#8197;VRHE) for the COF with the strongest acceptor unit. These findings highlight the potential of Wurster D&#8208;A&#8208;D COFs in photoelectrochemical water splitting devices and pave the way for further exploration of chemical functionality&#8208;reactivity&#8208;property relationships in this promising class of photoactive materials.

         <title>From Ions to Crystals: A Comprehensive View of the Non&#8208;Classical Nucleation of Calcium Sulfate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium sulfate is a mineral of considerable relevance for various industrial and geochemical processes. In the present work, the formation of calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum) crystals from aqueous solutions has been elucidated in detail through application of a complementary suite of advanced characterization techniques. The results show how crystalline order emerges from intrinsically disordered precursors and highlights the complexity of mineral nucleation.







Abstract
The early stages of mineralization continue to be in the focus of intensive research due to their inherent importance for natural and engineered environments. While numerous observations have been reported for single steps in the pathways of various crystallizing phases in previous studies, the complexity of the underlying processes and their elusive character have left central questions unanswered in most cases. In the present work, we provide a detailed view on the nucleation of calcium sulfate mineralization&#8212;an abundant mineral with broad use in construction industry&#8212;in aqueous systems at ambient conditions. As experimental basis, a co&#8208;titration procedure with potentiometric, turbidimetric and conductometric detection was developed, allowing solution speciation and the formation of crystallization precursors to be monitored quantitatively as the level of nominal (super)saturation gradually increases. The nature and spatiotemporal evolution of these precursors was further elucidated by time&#8208;resolved small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiments, complemented by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM) as a direct imaging technique. The results reveal how ions associate into nanometric primary species, which subsequently aggregate and develop anisotropic order by intrinsic structural reorganization. Our observations challenge the common understanding of fundamental notions such as the nucleation barrier or the meaning of supersaturation, with broad implications for mineralization phenomena in general and the formation of calcium sulfate in geochemical settings and industrial applications in particular.

         <title>Unlocking of Hidden Mesopores for Enzyme Encapsulation by Dynamic Linkers in Stable Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>

Introducing dynamic boroxine linkers into mesoporous PCN&#8208;333 creates defects that expand pore sizes, enabling the encapsulation of enzymes larger than the inherent pore size of MOFs. This strategy allows the immobilization of glycoenzymes in MOFs for synthesizing complex oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, demonstrating high activity and enhanced enzyme stability.







Abstract
Mesoporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising supports for the immobilization of enzymes, yet their applications are often limited by small pore apertures that constrain the size of encapsulated enzymes to below 5&#8197;nm. In this study, we introduced labile linkers (4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;boroxintriyl)&#8208;tribenzoate, TBTB) with dynamic boroxine bonds into mesoporous PCN&#8208;333, resulting in PCN&#8208;333&#8208;TBTB with enhanced enzyme loading and protection capabilities. The selective breaking of B&#8722;O bonds creates defects in PCN&#8208;333, which effectively expands both window and cavity sizes, thereby unlocking hidden mesopores for enzyme encapsulation. Consequently, this strategy not only increases the adsorption kinetics of small enzymes (&lt;5&#8197;nm) such as cytochrome c (Cyt C) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), but also enables the immobilization of various large&#8208;sized enzymes (&gt;5&#8197;nm), such as glycoenzymes. The glycoenzymes@PCN&#8208;333&#8208;TBTB platform was successfully applied to synthesize thirteen complex oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, demonstrating high activity and enhanced enzyme stability. The dynamic linker&#8208;mediated enzyme encapsulation strategy enables the immobilization of enzymes exceeding the inherent pore size of MOFs, thus broadening the scope of enzymatic catalytic reactions achievable with MOF materials.

         <title>Pyrrolizwilline, a Unique Bacterial Alkaloid Assembled by a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase and non&#8208;Enzymatic Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of pyrrolizwilline produced by XhpA&#8208;G was elucidated in Xenorhabdus hominickii using a promoter exchange approach together with heterologous expression of xhpA&#8208;G in E. coli. We also report the structural characterization of XhpG, the key enzyme in the conversion of the intermediate pyrrolizixenamide to pyrrolizwilline.







Abstract
Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a structurally diverse group of heterocyclic specialized metabolites characterized by a core structure comprising a hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrolizine. PAs are synthesized through two main pathways. In plants, assembly occurs via a homospermidine synthase, and in bacteria, through combined action of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase and a Baeyer&#8211;Villiger monooxygenase. While the toxic properties of plant&#8208;derived PAs and their prevalence in animal and human foods have been extensively studied, the biological roles and biosynthesis of more complex bacterial PAs are not well understood. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a bacterial biosynthetic gene cluster from Xenorhabdus hominickii, xhpA&#8208;G, which is responsible for producing the PA pseudo&#8208;dimer pyrrolizwilline. Analysis of X. hominickii promoter exchange mutants together with heterologous expression of xhpA&#8208;G in E. coli, revealed a set of pathway intermediates, two of which were chemically synthesized, as well as multiple derivatives. This information was leveraged to propose a detailed biosynthetic pathway to pyrrolizwilline. Furthermore, we have characterized the hydrolase XhpG, the key enzyme in the conversion of the pathway intermediate pyrrolizixenamide to pyrrolizwilline, using X&#8208;ray crystallography and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS).

         <title>Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by a Fullerene&#8208;Based Hole Transport Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fullerene&#8208;based hole transport material (FHTM) has been designed and synthesized, exhibiting high hole mobility through intramolecular electron transfer. Incorporating FHTM at the NiOx/perovskite interface optimizes the energy level alignment and improves the quality of the perovskite layer. This integration results in an inverted perovskite solar cell with a champion efficiency of 25.58&#8201;% (certified:25.04&#8201;%) and enhanced stability.







Abstract
Designing an efficient modification molecule to mitigate non&#8208;radiative recombination at the NiOx/perovskite interface and improve perovskite quality represents a challenging yet crucial endeavor for achieving high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we synthesized a novel fullerene&#8208;based hole transport molecule, designated as FHTM, by integrating C60 with 12 carbazole&#8208;based moieties, and applied it as a modification molecule at the NiOx/perovskite interface. The in situ self&#8208;doping effect, triggered by electron transfer between carbazole&#8208;based moiety and C60 within the FHTM molecule, along with the extended &#960; conjugated moiety of carbazole groups, significantly enhances FHTM's hole mobility. Coupled with optimized energy level alignment and enhanced interface interactions, the FHTM significantly enhances hole extraction and transport in corresponding devices. Additionally, the introduced FHTM efficiently promotes homogeneous nucleation of perovskite, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite films. These combined improvements led to the FHTM&#8208;based PSCs yielding a champion efficiency of 25.58&#8201;% (Certified: 25.04&#8201;%), notably surpassing that of the control device (20.91&#8201;%). Furthermore, the unencapsulated device maintained 93&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. This study highlights the potential of functionalized fullerenes as hole transport materials, opening up new avenues for their application in the field of PSCs.

The potential oscillations of the graphite electrode correlate with the appearance and disappearance of a solid phase identified as stage&#8208;1 GIC. The observed phenomenon can be considered as a new type of oscillating reaction.







Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis of graphene oxide (GO) is known to occur with potential oscillations, but the structural changes underlying these oscillations have remained unclear. In&#8197;situ time&#8208;resolved synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrates that the electrochemical synthesis of GO in aqueous H2SO4 can be described as an oscillating reaction. The transformation from graphite to GO proceeds through periodic structural oscillations that correlate with potential cycles. Stage&#8208;1 graphite intercalation compound (GIC) is found only at the peak of the potential cycle, but not at the bottom of the cycle. Stage&#8208;1 GIC is formed in the first half&#8208;cycle from stage&#8208;2 GIC and then transforms into &#8220;pristine graphite oxide&#8221; (PGO) on the lower side of the potential cycle, after which the cycle restarts with the formation of a new portion of stage&#8208;1 GIC. Water&#8208;washing results in the transformation of PGO into water&#8208;swollen GO with d(001) ~11&#8197;&#197;. These periodic structural changes can be considered a new type of oscillating reaction. The presented results provide broad insights into the oscillating structural changes occurring during the anodic graphite oxidation in aqueous H2SO4 and allow to update of the mechanism of GO electrochemical formation.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Discovery of a Potent Inhibitor of the Ferric Citrate Binding Protein FecB in Vibrio Bacteria</title>

Iron acquisition is a crucial factor for bacterial growth, and its transport process could be a promising target for antibacterial drugs. A potent molecular inhibitor of the ferric citrate binding protein FecB has been discovered. The findings provide new insight into the modulation of ferric ion acquisition pathways and their application to pathogen growth suppression.







Abstract
Infections caused by Gram&#8208;negative bacteria present a significant risk to human health worldwide. Novel strategies are needed to deal with the challenge caused by drug&#8208;resistant bacteria. Here, we report a new approach to combat infections by targeting iron&#8208;binding proteins to suppress bacterial growth. We investigated the function of the conserved periplasmic binding protein FecB from Vibrio alginolyticus. FecB was known to play a crucial role in the bacterial growth and to relate with biofilm formation. We then solved the crystal structures and elucidated the binding mechanism of FecB with ferric ion chelated by citrate. The results indicated that FecB binds weakly to one citrate molecule and strongly to the Fe3+&#8208;(citrate)2 complex. Based on these results, a structure&#8208;based virtual screening approach was conducted against FecB to identify small molecules that block ferric citrate uptake. Further evaluations in vivo and in vitro demonstrated that salvianolic acid C significantly suppressed bacterial growth, indicating that targeting bacterial nutrient absorption is a promising strategy for identifying potential antibacterial drugs.

         <title>Extending Shelf&#8208;Life of Two&#8208;Step Method Precursor Solutions through Targeted Regulation for Highly Efficient and Reproducible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
The commercialization of PVSCs is hindered by poor reproducibility due to the chemical instability of the solution&#8208;processed materials. We first observe that the aging phenomenon is more pronounced in the precursor solution of the two&#8208;step sequential method compared to that in the one&#8208;step method due to the difference in the used solvents. Here, an effective targeted strategy for precursor stabilization by introducing benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dithiol (BDT) and decamethylferrocene (FcMe10) additives into the organic amine salt solution and the PbI2 precursor solution, thus extending the shelf&#8208;life of the two&#8208;step precursor solutions.







Abstract
Precursor solution aging process can cause significant influence on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Notably, we first observe that the aging phenomenon is more severe in the precursor of two&#8208;step sequential method compared to that in one&#8208;step method due to that the protic solvent isopropanol facilitates amine&#8208;cation side reaction and iodide ions oxidation. Herein, we report a novel approach for selectively stabilizing both organic amine salt and lead iodide (PbI2) precursor solutions in two&#8208;step method. The introduction of benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dithiol into organic amine salt solution can mitigate amine&#8208;cation side reactions due to the formation of an acidic and reducing environment. Simultaneously, decamethylferrocene (FcMe10/FcMe+10) pair can act as a redox shuttle in PbI2 solution to concurrently oxidize Pb0 and reduce I2 in cyclic manner. Consequently, the PVSCs device fabricated from ameliorative precursor solutions demonstrates superior power conversion efficiency of 25.31&#8201;%, retaining 95&#8201;% of its efficiency after 21&#8197;days of solution aging. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintain 85&#8201;% of primitive efficiency for 1500&#8197;h at maximum power point tracking under continuous illumination. This work establishes a fundamental guidance and scientific direction for the stabilization of two&#8208;step perovskite precursor solutions.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Dynamic Carburization of Mo Oxide with Unprecedented High CO Formation Rate in Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ carburization of the Mo&#8208;based catalyst at 500&#8201;&#176;C is achieved in RWGS reaction. The surface O/Mo atomic ratio plays significant role in carburization, i.e., lower surface O/Mo atomic ratio is beneficial to carburization. In situ carburization induced by reaction product of CO strongly promotes the RWGS activity showing CO formation rate of 7544.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcatal&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
In situ construction of active structure under reaction conditions is highly desired but still remains challenging in many important catalytic processes. Herein, we observe structural evolution of molybdenum oxide (MoOx) into highly active molybdenum carbide (MoCx) during reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Surface oxygen atoms in various Mo&#8208;based catalysts are removed in H2&#8208;containing atmospheres and then carbon atoms can accumulate on surface to form MoCx phase with the RWGS reaction going on, both of which are enhanced by the presence of intercalated H species or Pt&#8208;dopants in MoOx. The structural evolution from MoOx to MoCx is accompanied by enhanced CO2 conversion, which is positively correlated with the surface C/Mo ratio but negatively with the surface O/Mo ratio. As a result, an unprecedented CO formation rate of 7544.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcatal&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 600&#8201;&#176;C has been achieved over in situ carbonized H&#8208;intercalated MoO3 catalyst, which is even higher than those from noble metal catalysts. During 100&#8197;h stability test only a minimal deactivation rate of 2.3&#8201;% is observed.

This innovative, metal&#8208;free catalytic approach leads to highly alternating poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acids) (PLGAs), both in linear and star&#8208;shaped forms. The synthesized PLGAs exhibit high regioselectivity, consistent alternating structure, recyclability, and atactic microstructure, making them suitable for drug delivery applications.







Abstract
A bifunctional thiourea&#8208;amine&#8208;based organocatalyst (Takemoto's catalyst), employing a metal&#8208;free approach, is presented for the regioselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of optically active (D and L) methyl glycolide (MG). In this study, a chiral version of Takemoto's catalyst efficiently promotes the ROP of MG at room temperature, yielding poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acids) (PLGAs) with predicted molecular weights and narrow polydispersity indices (PDI&#8804;1.2). These PLGAs exhibit highly alternating structures without transesterification, as confirmed by 1H NMR, SEC, and MALDI&#8208;TOF analyses. Additionally, various macromolecular architectures, including linear and star&#8208;shaped PLGAs, were successfully synthesized using the corresponding multi&#8208;functional alcohol initiators while maintaining the same alternating structures and regioselectivity with PLGA obtained from benzyl alcohol as initiator. Computational studies were conducted to elucidate the mechanism of alternating PLGA formation, revealing two key transition states (TSs): TS&#8208;1, which implicates the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group of the initiator or propagating chain on the carbonyl carbon of MG, and TS&#8208;2, which involves the subsequent ring&#8208;opening of the cyclic ester. The results indicate that ring&#8208;opening occurs at both the glycolyl and lactyl sites, with a preference for the glycolyl site, as supported by experimental results. The resulting atactic PLGAs are amorphous, rendering them suitable for drug delivery applications.

         <title>Anticancer Tetranuclear Cu(I) Complex Catalyzes a Click Reaction to Synthesize a Chemotherapeutic Agent in situ to Achieve Targeted Dual&#8208;Agent Combination Therapy for Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tetranuclear Cu(I) complex (Cu4) was developed based on apoferritin, which not only inhibited tumor growth through cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;induced immunity, but also possessed significant CuAAC reaction to synthesize a chemotherapeutic resveratrol analogue in situ for achieving targeted dual&#8208;drug combination therapy for cancer.







Abstract
To develop next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based drugs and dual&#8208;drug combination therapy for cancer, we proposed to develop a copper (Cu) complex that exerts anticancer function by integrating chemotherapy, immunotherapy and catalyzes a click reaction for the in situ synthesis of a chemotherapeutic agent, thereby achieving targeted dual&#8208;agent combination therapy. We designed and synthesized a tetranuclear Cu(I) complex (Cu4) with remarkable cytotoxicity and notable catalytic ability for the in situ synthesis of a chemotherapeutic agent via Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne 1,3&#8208;cycloaddition (CuAAC). We also constructed an apoferritin (AFt)&#8208;Cu4 nanoparticles (NPs) delivery system. Aft&#8208;Cu4 NPs not only showed an enhanced performance of tumor growth inhibition, but also improved the targeting ability and reduced the systemic toxicity of Cu4 in vivo. Importantly, the anticancer effect was enhanced by combining the Aft&#8208;Cu4 NPs with the resveratrol analogue obtained from the CuAAC reaction in situ. Finally, we revealed the anticancer mechanism of the Cu4/Aft&#8208;Cu4 NPs, which involves both cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;induced systemic immune response.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Disialyllacto&#8208;N&#8208;Tetraose (DSLNT) and Related Human Milk Oligosaccharides Reveals Broad Siglec Recognition of the Atypical Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc Motif</title>

         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the efficiency and substrate promiscuity of human ST6GalNAc enzymes along with a panel of enzyme modules, a library of human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) containing an atypical Neu5Aca2&#8208;6GlcNAc linkage including disialyllacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose (DSLNT) was synthesized for the first time. Glycan microarray assays revealed broad yet distinct recognition by Siglecs of the atypical Neu5Aca2&#8208;6GlcNAc motif.







Abstract
Sialic acids (Sias) are ubiquitously expressed on all types of glycans, typically as terminating residues. They usually link to galactose, N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine, or other Sia residues, forming ligands of many glycan&#8208;binding proteins. An atypical linkage to the C6 of N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) has been identified in human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs, e.g., DSLNT) and tumor&#8208;associated glycoconjugates. Herein, describe the systematic synthesis of these HMOs in an enzymatic modular manner. The synthetic strategy relies on a novel activity of ST6GalNAc6 for efficient construction of the Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc linkage, and another 12 specific enzyme modules for sequential HMO assembly. The structures enabled comprehensive exploration of their structure&#8208;function relationships using glycan microarrays, revealing broad yet distinct recognition by Siglecs of the atypical Neu5Ac&#945;2&#8208;6GlcNAc motif. The work provides tools and new insight for the functional study and potential applications of Siglecs and HMOs.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Switching of Spin&#8208;Crossover Complexes on Cu(111) Evidenced by Spin&#8208;Flip Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;state switching of a spin&#8208;crossover complex on Cu(111) induced by injection of tunneling electrons. The spin&#8208;state is readout from the low&#8208;voltage differential&#8208;conductance spectrum: the high&#8208;spin state exhibits magnetic excitation steps evolving with the application of a magnetic field while no spectroscopic feature is observed in the low&#8208;spin state.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover compounds can be switched between two stable states with different magnetic moments, conformations, electronic, and optical properties, which opens appealing perspectives for technological applications including miniaturization down to the scale of single molecules. Although control of the spin states is crucial their direct identification is challenging in single&#8208;molecule experiments. Here we investigate the spin&#8208;crossover complex [Fe(HB(1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)3)2] on a Cu(111) surface with scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations. Spin crossover of single molecules in dense islands is achieved via electron injection. Spin&#8208;flip excitations are resolved in scanning tunneling spectra in a magnetic field enabling the direct identification of the molecular spin state, and revealing the existence of magnetic anisotropy in the HS molecules.

         <title>Eliminating Hydrogen Fluoride through Piperidine&#8208;Doped Separators for Stable Li Metal Batteries with Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated molecular sieve@piperidine&#8208;decorated polyethylene separator is proposed for eliminating the H2O&#8208;derived HF directly by an acid&#8208;base mechanism rather than the elimination of H2O. This successfully enables LMBs with a LiF&#8208;rich SEI and stable cathode structure during cycling in an electrolyte with high H2O content.







Abstract
Hydrofluoric acid (HF)&#8208;induced electrode and interfacial structure degeneration poses a significant challenge for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). To address this issue, we propose a separator strategy that involves decorating a regular polyethylene (PE) separator with molecular sieves (TW) impregnated with piperidine (PI). The porous structure of the TW serves as a reaction chamber for PI and HF. As a result, the HF content in the controlled electrolyte with 500&#8197;ppm H2O (ELE&#8208;500) is notably reduced when using TW@PI&#8208;PE separators, thereby shielding nickel&#8208;rich cathodes from HF etching. Simultaneously, due to the hydrolysis of Li salts, and the inertness of PI towards H2O, a uniform lithium fluoride (LiF)&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase can form on the Li metal anode, further mitigating dendrite formation. The lifespan of the symmetric Li cell using the TW@PI&#8208;PE separator is doubled in ELE&#8208;500, exhibiting stable 500&#8208;hour cycles at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, with the effective limitation of transition metal (TM) dissolution, the 4.6&#8208;V LMBs employing a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode maintain an 81&#8201;% capacity retention over 100&#8197;cycles, even in ELE&#8208;1000. The innovative TW@PI system presented here offers a fresh perspective for future research aimed at eliminating HF in LMBs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrofluoric acid (HF)-induced electrode and interfacial structure degeneration poses a significant challenge for high-voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). To address this issue, we propose a separator strategy that involves decorating a regular polyethylene (PE) separator with molecular sieves (TW) impregnated with piperidine (PI). The porous structure of the TW serves as a reaction chamber for PI and HF. As a result, the HF content in the controlled electrolyte with 500&#8197;ppm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (ELE-500) is notably reduced when using TW@PI-PE separators, thereby shielding nickel-rich cathodes from HF etching. Simultaneously, due to the hydrolysis of Li salts, and the inertness of PI towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, a uniform lithium fluoride (LiF)-rich solid electrolyte interphase can form on the Li metal anode, further mitigating dendrite formation. The lifespan of the symmetric Li cell using the TW@PI-PE separator is doubled in ELE-500, exhibiting stable 500-hour cycles at 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, with the effective limitation of transition metal (TM) dissolution, the 4.6-V LMBs employing a LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode maintain an 81&#8201;% capacity retention over 100&#8197;cycles, even in ELE-1000. The innovative TW@PI system presented here offers a fresh perspective for future research aimed at eliminating HF in LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Drug Discovery and Screening Tool Development for Tauopathies by Focusing on Pathogenic Tau Repeat 3 Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To identify the core region driving tauopathy, tau repeats within the microtubule&#8208;binding domain were synthesized and assessed for pathogenic traits. Repeat 3 initiated amyloid formation, cytotoxicity, and cognitive decline, with oligomeric aggregates showing pronounced neurotoxicity. This pathological form was utilized in a screening platform, leading to the discovery of tolcapone as a potent anti&#8208;tau agent. (SPPS=solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis)







Abstract
Comprehending early amyloidogenesis is essential for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. In tauopathies like Alzheimer's disease (AD), the abnormal accumulation of tau protein is initiated by pathological tau seeds. Mounting evidence implies that the microtubule binding domain, consisting of three to four repeats, plays a pivotal role in this process, yet the exact region driving the formation of pathogenic species needs to be further scrutinized. Here, we chemically synthesized individual tau repeats to identify those exhibiting pathogenic prion&#8208;like characteristics. Notably, repeat 3 (R3) displayed a remarkable propensity to polymerize, form toxic filaments, and induce cognitive impairment, even in the absence of an aggregation&#8208;promoting inducer, highlighting its physiological relevance. Additionally, oligomeric R3 was identified as a particularly pathological form, prompting the establishment of a screening platform. Through screening, tolcapone was found to possess therapeutic efficacy against pathological tau aggregates in PS19 transgenic mice. This screening platform provides a valuable avenue for identifying compounds that selectively interact with peptides implicated in the progression of tauopathies.

Extracting and obtaining lithium metal anodes from sea water for assembly of Li metal batteries by using single&#8208;channel Li ion&#8208;sieve membrane. The membrane effectively blocks water and interfering ions, allowing only Li ions to be transported.







Abstract
Sea water is abundant in lithium reserves, and extracting lithium metal from it holds the potential to not only mitigate the shortage of lithium in light of the fast&#8208;growing electric vehicle industry, but also serve as an anode electrode to provide electricity. The task, however, is challenging due to the harsh reactions and low lithium concentration in sea water. Here, we present a single&#8208;channel strategy based on a flexible and scalable lithium ion&#8208;sieve membrane for efficient lithium extraction. Our composite membrane exhibits high separation factor &#946;Li/Na of more than 2.87&#215;107 with an ionic conductivity of 6.2&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Lithium metal was electrolytically extracted from sea water through a hybrid&#8208;electrolyte system, which yielded a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.04&#8201;% and a low energy consumption of 17.4&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgLi&#8722;1 at an optimized extracting current of 200&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The extracted lithium metal can be directly integrated into a lithium&#8208;sulfur battery, delivering an energy output of 395&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. To demonstrate its industrial viability, we also fabricate a pouch cell with Li metal anode extracted by an amplified extraction prototype. This study has the potential to dispel concerns of lithium depletion and facilitate the sustainable development of lithium&#8208;based energy storage systems.

         <title>Reversible Multi&#8208;Complexation of CO2 to Alkaline Earth Metal Ion&#8208;Pair at 400&#8201;ppm and 298&#8201;K</title>

Breaking upper limit of CO2&#8208;uptake at low&#8208;pressure using porous materials is challenging due to the lack of multiple adsorption mechanisms. This study presents a novel concept of reversible multi&#8208;complexation of CO2 to alkaline earth metal ion&#8208;pairs in ferrierite&#8208;type zeolite with the formation of unprecedented CO2&#8208;complexes even at 400&#8197;ppm and 298&#8197;K. The findings in the present study offer a new direction for efficient CO2 adsorbents.







Abstract
The efficient capture of low&#8208;pressure CO2 remains a significant challenge due to the lack of established multi&#8208;complexation of CO2 to active sites in microporous materials. In this study, we introduce a novel concept of reversible multi&#8208;complexation of CO2 to alkaline earth metal (AEM) ion pairs, utilizing a host site in ferrierite&#8208;type zeolite (FER). This unique site constrains two AEM ions in proximity, thereby enhancing and isotopically spreading their electrostatic potentials within the zeolite cavity. This electrostatic potential&#8208;engineered micropore can trap up to four CO2 molecules, forming M2+&#8722;(CO2)n&#8722;M2+ (n=0&#8211;4, M=Ca, Sr, Ba) complexes, where each CO2 molecule is stabilized by interactions between terminal oxygen (Ot) in CO2 and the AEM ions. Notably, the Ba2+ pair site exhibits higher thermodynamic stability for multiple adsorptions due to the optimal binding mode of Ba2+&#8722;Ot&#8722;Ba2+. Through high&#8208;accuracy energy calculations, we have established the relationship among structure, CO2 uptake, and operating temperature/pressure, demonstrating that the Ba2+ pair site can capture four CO2 molecules even at concentrations as low as 400&#8197;ppm and at 298&#8197;K. Three of the four molecules of CO2 trapped were removable at room temperature and under vacuum. The findings in the present study provide a new direction for developing efficient CO2 adsorbents.

         <title>Simultaneous Inhibition of Vanadium Dissolution and Zinc Dendrites by Mineral&#8208;Derived Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>

Kaolin is demonstrated as an effective material to prepare Zn&#8208;based solid electrolyte (KL&#8208;Zn), which simultaneously eliminates the interfacial side reactions of zinc anode and inhibits the vanadium dissolution of NH4V4O10 cathode, endowing high reversible capacity and superior cyclic stability for Zn//NH4V4O10 batteries.







Abstract
Designing solid electrolyte is deemed as an effective approach to suppress the side reaction of zinc anode and active material dissolution of cathodes in liquid electrolytes for zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, kaolin is comprehensively investigated as raw material to prepare solid electrolyte (KL&#8722;Zn) for ZMBs. As demonstrated, KL&#8722;Zn electrolyte is an excellent electronic insulator and zinc ionic conductor, which presents wide voltage window of 2.73&#8197;V, high ionic conductivity of 5.08&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, and high Zn2+ transference number of 0.79. For the Zn//Zn cells, superior cyclic stability lasting for 2200&#8197;h can be achieved at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. For the Zn//NH4V4O10 batteries, stable capacity of 245.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 can be maintained at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles along with high retention ratio of 81&#8201;%, manifesting KL&#8722;Zn electrolyte contributes to stabilize the crystal structure of NH4V4O10 cathode. These satisfying performances can be attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing, zinc (de)solvation&#8208;free mechanism and fast diffusion kinetics of KL&#8722;Zn electrolyte, availably guaranteeing uniform zinc deposition for zinc anode and reversible zinc (de)intercalation for NH4V4O10 cathode. Additionally, this work also verifies the application possibility of KL&#8722;Zn electrolyte for Zn//MnO2 batteries and Zn//I2 batteries, suggesting the universality of mineral&#8208;based solid electrolyte.

&lt;p&gt;Kaolin is demonstrated as an effective material to prepare Zn-based solid electrolyte (KL-Zn), which simultaneously eliminates the interfacial side reactions of zinc anode and inhibits the vanadium dissolution of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; cathode, endowing high reversible capacity and superior cyclic stability for Zn//NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing solid electrolyte is deemed as an effective approach to suppress the side reaction of zinc anode and active material dissolution of cathodes in liquid electrolytes for zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, kaolin is comprehensively investigated as raw material to prepare solid electrolyte (KL&#8722;Zn) for ZMBs. As demonstrated, KL&#8722;Zn electrolyte is an excellent electronic insulator and zinc ionic conductor, which presents wide voltage window of 2.73&#8197;V, high ionic conductivity of 5.08&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and high Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number of 0.79. For the Zn//Zn cells, superior cyclic stability lasting for 2200&#8197;h can be achieved at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. For the Zn//NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; batteries, stable capacity of 245.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; can be maintained at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 200&#8197;cycles along with high retention ratio of 81&#8201;%, manifesting KL&#8722;Zn electrolyte contributes to stabilize the crystal structure of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; cathode. These satisfying performances can be attributed to the enlarged interlayer spacing, zinc (de)solvation-free mechanism and fast diffusion kinetics of KL&#8722;Zn electrolyte, availably guaranteeing uniform zinc deposition for zinc anode and reversible zinc (de)intercalation for NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; cathode. Additionally, this work also verifies the application possibility of KL&#8722;Zn electrolyte for Zn//MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries and Zn//I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries, suggesting the universality of mineral-based solid electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 achieved months&#8208;long autotrophic growth and acetate production through CO2 fixation coupled to sulfur oxidation, driven by biogenic CdS nanoparticles under light.







Abstract
Members of the genus Shewanella are known for their versatile electron accepting routes, which allow them to couple decomposition of organic matter to reduction of various terminal electron acceptors for heterotrophic growth in diverse environments. Here, we report autotrophic growth of Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 with photoelectrons provided by illuminated biogenic CdS nanoparticles. This hybrid system enables photosynthetic oscillatory acetate production from CO2 for over five months, far exceeding other inorganic&#8208;biological hybrid system that can only sustain for hours or days. Biochemical, electrochemical and transcriptomic analyses reveal that the efficient electron uptake of S. oneidensis MR&#8208;1 from illuminated CdS nanoparticles supplies sufficient energy to stimulate the previously overlooked reductive glycine pathway for CO2 fixation. The continuous solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion is achieved by photon induced electric recycling in sulfur species. Overall, our findings demonstrate that this mineral&#8208;assisted photosynthesis, as a widely existing and unique model of light energy conversion, could support the sustained photoautotrophic growth of non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms in nutrient&#8208;lean environments and mediate the reversal of coupled carbon and sulfur cycling, consequently resulting in previously unknown environmental effects. In addition, the hybrid system provides a sustainable and flexible platform to develop a variety of solar products for carbon neutrality.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Induced &#8216;Click Reaction&#8217; Involving Coordination and Covalent Assembly of Hybrid Borates for the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>

A facile synthetic method is developed to synthesize a large family of pyrazole molecule&#8208;protected borates containing cyclic eight&#8208;membered B4O4&#8208;ring as corns, in a rapid and precise manner under mild conditions. The obtained borates proved to be good electrocatalytic catalysts for CO2 reduction reaction towards HCOOH and C2H4.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of hybrid borates by the organic ligand modification method are urgent and undeveloped areas of research. It is difficult to directly integrate organoboronic acids within inorganic borate chemistry by adopting the traditional preparation approaches. This work reports a facile synthetic method to synthesize a large family of pyrazole molecule&#8208;protected borates in a rapid and precise manner under mild conditions. A unique cyclic eight&#8208;membered B4O4&#8208;ring has been identified as the cluster core for all these hybrid borates with two different conformations (boat and crown). This strategy can be applied to a system of pyrazolyl molecules to generate such hybrid borates in two independent routes from organoboronic or inorganic boric acids. Furtherly, the mechanism of &#8216;click reaction&#8217; between boric acid and pyrazole induced by copper ions has been proposed based on the synthetic conditions and the structure of intermediate. Due to the bimetallic Cu sites and the functional surfaces, these materials can be used as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction and efficiently enhance the selectivity of HCOOH and C2H4. Our strategy can be regarded as a typical template technique for organic molecule&#8208;protected borates.

         <title>Operando Stable Palladium Hydride Nanoclusters Anchored on Tungsten Carbides Mediate Reverse Hydrogen Spillover for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reverse hydrogen spillover was mediated over operando stable Pd hydrides on tungsten carbides systems, which endows efficient and durable hydrogen evolution in proton exchange membrane electrolysis with ultralow Pd loading of 0.022&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis holds great promise for green hydrogen production, but suffering from high loading of platinum&#8208;group metals (PGM) for large&#8208;scale deployment. Anchoring PGM&#8208;based materials on supports can not only improve the atomic utilization of active sites but also enhance the intrinsic activity. However, in practical PEM electrolysis, it is still challenging to mediate hydrogen adsorption/desorption pathways with high coverage of hydrogen intermediates over catalyst surface. Here, operando generated stable palladium (Pd) hydride nanoclusters anchored on tungsten carbide (WCx) supports were constructed for hydrogen evolution in PEM electrolysis. Under PEM operando conditions, hydrogen intercalation induces formation of Pd hydrides (PdHx) featuring weakened hydrogen binding energy (HBE), thus triggering reverse hydrogen spillover from WCx (strong HBE) supports to PdHx sites, which have been evidenced by operando characterizations, electrochemical results and theoretical studies. This PdHx&#8208;WCx material can be directly utilized as cathode electrocatalysts in PEM electrolysis with ultralow Pd loading of 0.022&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, delivering the current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the cell voltage of ~1.66&#8197;V and continuously running for 200&#8197;hours without obvious degradation. This innovative strategy via tuning the operando characteristics to mediate reverse hydrogen spillover provide new insights for designing high&#8208;performance supported PGM&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Exchange of CO2 with CO as Reactant Switches Selectivity in Photoreduction on Co&#8722;ZrO2 from C1&#8211;3 Paraffin to Small Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pathways from CO2 to paraffin while from CO to C2H4 and C3H6 using Co&#8722;ZrO2 photocatalyst were switched. CO2 at the O vacancy on ZrO2 transformed into COH and hopped onto Co0 to be paraffin while CO and H competed on Co0 leading to preferable coupling of CH2 to olefins.







Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into C2,3 hydrocarbons completes a C&#8208;neutral cycle. The reaction pathways of photocatalytic generation of C2,3 paraffin and C2H4 from CO2 are mostly unclear. Herein, a Co0&#8722;ZrO2 photocatalyst converted CO2 into C1&#8211;3 paraffin, while selectively converting CO into C2H4 and C3H6 (6.0&#177;0.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, 70&#8197;mol&#8201;%) only under UV/Visible light. The photocatalytic cycle was conducted under 13CO and H2, with subsequent evacuation and flushing with CO. This iterative process led to an increase in the population of C2H4 and C3H6 up to 61&#8211;87&#8197;mol&#8201;%, attributed to the accumulation of CH2 species at the interface between Co0 nanoparticles and the ZrO2 surface. CO2 adsorbed onto the O vacancies of the ZrO2 surface, with resulting COH species undergoing hydrogenation on the Co0 surface to yield C1&#8211;3 paraffin using either H2 or H2O (g, l) as the reductant. In contrast, CO adsorbed on the Co0 surface, converted to HCOH species, and then split into CH and OH species at the Co and O vacancy sites on ZrO2, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Pathways from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to paraffin while from CO to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; using Co&#8722;ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalyst were switched. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at the O vacancy on ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transformed into COH and hopped onto Co&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to be paraffin while CO and H competed on Co&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; leading to preferable coupling of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to olefins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into C&lt;sub&gt;2,3&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons completes a C-neutral cycle. The reaction pathways of photocatalytic generation of C&lt;sub&gt;2,3&lt;/sub&gt; paraffin and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are mostly unclear. Herein, a Co&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalyst converted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into C&lt;sub&gt;1&#8211;3&lt;/sub&gt; paraffin, while selectively converting CO into C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (6.0&#177;0.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 70&#8197;mol&#8201;%) only under UV/Visible light. The photocatalytic cycle was conducted under &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with subsequent evacuation and flushing with CO. This iterative process led to an increase in the population of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; up to 61&#8211;87&#8197;mol&#8201;%, attributed to the accumulation of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species at the interface between Co&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; nanoparticles and the ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorbed onto the O vacancies of the ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface, with resulting COH species undergoing hydrogenation on the Co&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; surface to yield C&lt;sub&gt;1&#8211;3&lt;/sub&gt; paraffin using either H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (g, l) as the reductant. In contrast, CO adsorbed on the Co&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; surface, converted to HCOH species, and then split into CH and OH species at the Co and O vacancy sites on ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. This comprehensive study elucidates intricate photocatalytic pathways governing the transformation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into paraffin and CO to olefins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Growth Kinetics of Graphene on Cu(111) Foils from Methane, Ethyne, Ethylene, and Ethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We obtained the activation enthalpies of graphene island growth on Cu(111) foils using H2 and: CH4, and C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6, respectively. The rate determining step (RDS) for CH4 is its gas phase decomposition to H and CH3. The RDS for C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 is dehydrogenation on the Cu(111) surface yielding adsorbed C2H1, C2H3, and C2H5, respectively.







Abstract
Chemical vapor deposition of carbon precursors on Cu&#8208;based substrates at temperatures exceeding 1000&#8201;&#176;C is currently a typical route for the scalable synthesis of large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) films. Using molecules with higher activities than CH4 may afford lower growth temperatures that might yield fold&#8208; and wrinkle&#8208;free graphene. The kinetics of growth of graphene using hydrocarbons other than CH4 are of interest to the scientific and industrial communities. We measured the growth rates of graphene islands on Cu(111) foils by using C2H2, C2H4, C2H6 and CH4, respectively (each mixed with H2). From such kinetics data we obtain the activation enthalpy (&#916;H&#8800;) of graphene growth as shown in parentheses (C2H2 (0.93&#177;0.09&#8197;eV); C2H4 (2.05&#177;0.19&#8197;eV); C2H6 (2.50&#177;0.11&#8197;eV); CH4 (4.59&#177;0.26&#8197;eV)); C2Hy (y=2, 4, 6) show similar growth behavior but CH4 is different. Computational fluid dynamics and density functional theory simulations suggest that C2Hy differs from CH4 due to different values of adsorption energy and the lifetime of relevant carbon precursors on the Cu(111) surface. Combining experimental and simulation results, we find that the rate determining step (RDS) is the dissociation of the first C&#8722;H bond of CH4 molecules in the gas phase, while the RDS using C2Hy is the first dehydrogenation of adsorbed C2Hy that happens with assistance of H atoms adsorbed on the Cu(111) surface. By using C2H2 as the carbon precursor, high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal adlayer&#8208;free SLG films are achieved on Cu(111) foils at 900&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Modulating Spin of Atomic Manganese Center for High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report atomically dispersed manganese (Mn) embedded on nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped graphene for ORR in alkaline electrolyte, realizing a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.883&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with negligible activity degradation after 40,000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles. Introducing sulfur (S) changes the spin state of single Mn atom from high&#8208;spin to low&#8208;spin, optimizing the oxygen intermediates adsorption.







Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) are promising non&#8208;precious catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Unfortunately, the ORR SACs usually suffer from unsatisfactory activity and in particular poor stability. Herein, we report atomically dispersed manganese (Mn) embedded on nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped graphene as an efficient and robust electrocatalyst for ORR in alkaline electrolyte, realizing a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.883&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with negligible activity degradation after 40,000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. Introducing sulfur (S) to form Mn&#8722;S coordination changes the spin state of single Mn atom from high&#8208;spin to low&#8208;spin, verified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and magnetic susceptibility measurements as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which effectively optimizes the oxygen intermediates adsorption over the single Mn atomic sites and thus greatly improves the ORR activity.

         <title>Controllable Multi&#8208;Exciton Zero&#8208;Dimensional Antimony&#8208;Based Metal Halides for White&#8208;light Emission and &#946;&#8208;Ray Detection</title>

The [SbCl5]2&#8722; luminescent center structure is formed by self&#8208;assembly of SbCl3, methylamine hydrochloride, and 18&#8208;crown ether&#8208;6. This asymmetric structure can control the emission of singlet&#8208;triplet hybrid excitons by wavelength at room temperature. Under ultraviolet irradiation at 310&#8197;nm, it shows strong emission at 470&#8197;nm, white light emission under 340&#8197;nm irradiation, and strong emission at 570&#8197;nm under 370&#8197;nm irradiation.







Abstract
Self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission, typified by antimony (Sb), with broadband characteristics, represents the next generation of materials for solid&#8208;state lighting and radiation detection. However, little is known about the multiexciton behavior of the Sb emission center. Here, we proposed a general approach for designing antimony&#8208;centered multi&#8208;exciton emitting materials through self&#8208;assembly. Benefitting from controllable multiexciton behavior, dual&#8208;band white light emission spanning the entire visible spectrum was achieved. Relying on the reduction of an effective atomic number brought by self&#8208;assembly, excellent scintillation response to &#946;&#8208;rays was attained. This study offers unprecedented insight into hybrid single/triple STE emission and unveils new avenues for single&#8208;emitter white&#8208;light emission, as well as radiographic testing using low&#8208;risk &#946;&#8208;rays as sources.

         <title>Steering the Selectivity of CORR from Acetate to Ethanol via Tailoring the Thermodynamic Activity of Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal approach was developed to tune the selectivity of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in CORR from acetate to ethanol by tailoring the thermodynamic activity of water. The faradaic efficiencies of ethanol and alcohol can reach 42.5&#8201;% and 55.1&#8201;% at 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The ability to control the selectivity of CORR opens up new possibilities for synthesizing a wider range of valuable chemical products from CO2.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon monoxide (CO) into oxygenated C2+ products at high rates and selectivity offers a promising approach for the two&#8208;step conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, a major drawback of the CO electrochemical reduction in alkaline electrolyte is the preference for the acetate pathway over the more valuable ethanol pathway. Recent research has shed light on the significant impact of thermodynamic water activity on the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction pathways, but less is understood for the electrochemical reduction of CO. In this study, we investigated how the water activity at the electrified interface can be enhanced to adjust the selectivity between acetate and ethanol. We employed an ionomer modifier to lower the local concentration of alkali ions (via Donnan exclusion), successfully enhancing ethanol production while suppressing acetate formation. We observed a remarkable improvement in the Faradaic efficiency of ethanol and alcohol (i.&#8201;e. ethanol, propanol etc), which reached 42.5&#8201;% and 55.1&#8201;%, respectively, at a current density of 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The partial current densities of ethanol and alcohol reached 698 and 942&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, we achieved a 3.7&#8208;fold increase in the ethanol/acetate ratio, providing clear evidence of our successful modulation of product selectivity.

         <title>Stable Dendrite&#8208;Free Room Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Enabled by a Novel Sodium Thiotellurate Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel sodium thiotellurate (Na2TeS3) interfaces are constructed both on the cathode and anode for Na&#8722;S batteries to simultaneously address the Na dendritic growth and polysulfide shuttling. Benefiting from this rational design, an anode&#8208;free cell fabricated with the Na2S/Na2Te@C cathode delivers an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 634&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C under practically necessary conditions, which could pave a new path to design high&#8208;performance cathodes for anode&#8208;free RT Na&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
The practical application of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries is severely hindered by inhomogeneous sodium deposition and notorious sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) shuttling. Herein, novel sodium thiotellurate (Na2TeS3) interfaces are constructed both on the cathode and anode for Na&#8722;S batteries to simultaneously address the Na dendritic growth and polysulfides shuttling. On the cathode side, a heterostructural sodium sulfide/sodium telluride embedded in a carbon matrix (Na2S/Na2Te@C) is rationally designed through a facile carbothermal reaction, where the Na2TeS3 interface will be in situ chemically obtained. Such an interface provides abundant electron/ion diffusion channels and ensures rich catalytic surfaces toward Na&#8722;S redox, which could significantly improve the utilization of active material and alleviate polysulfides shuttling in the cathode. On the anode side, the inevitable formation of soluble polytellurosulfides species will migrate on Na anode surface, finally constructing a compact and smooth solid&#8208;electrolyte Na2TeS3 interphase (SEI) layer. Such electrochemical formed Na2TeS3 interface can significantly enhance ionic transport and stabilize Na deposition, thus realizing dendrite&#8208;free Na&#8208;metal plating/stripping. Benefitting from these advantages, an anode&#8208;free cell fabricated with the Na2S/Na2Te@C cathode exhibits an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 634&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, which could pave a new path to design high&#8208;performance cathodes for anode&#8208;free RT Na&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Anilines Formation via Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Reaction of Ynones with Allylic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented and efficient approach for the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted anilines was reported. With a simple Mo&#8208;catalyst, a wide range of 2,4&#8208;di and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted anilines, some of which were otherwise challenging to access, were efficiently prepared in generally good yields from readily accessible ynones and allylic amines. This process was robust, modular and ready for the syntheses of various valuable multi&#8208;substituted anilines.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;substituted anilines are widely found in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry and material science. The quest for robust and efficient methods to construct a diverse array of these compounds using readily accessible starting materials under simple reaction conditions is of utmost importance. Here, we report an unprecedented and efficient approach for the synthesis of 2,4&#8208;di and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted anilines. With a simple molybdenum(VI) catalyst, a wide range of 2,4&#8208;di and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted anilines were efficiently prepared in generally good to excellent yields from readily accessible ynones and allylic amines. The synthetic potential of this methodology was further underscored by its applications in several synthetic transformations, gram&#8208;scale reactions, and derivatization of bioactive molecules. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested that this aniline formation might involve a cascade of aza&#8208;Michael addition, [1,6]&#8208;proton shift, cyclization, dehydration, 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization, and aromatization. This novel strategy provided a robust, simple, and modular approach for the syntheses of various valuable di&#8208; or trisubstituted anilines, some of which were otherwise challenging to access.

         <title>Supramolecular Control of Helicene Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emitters in Molecular Solids and Bright Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic molecular chiroptical properties (electronic circular dichroism and circular polarized luminescence) of helicences are perfectly transferred from solution to the crystal state and to water&#8208;soluble nanoparticles by encapsulating the chiral emitter in supramolecular small&#8208;molecule, ionic isolation lattices (SMILES). Furthermore, CPL brightness is enhanced by combination with a rhodamine antenna system.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from chiral molecules is attracting much attention due to its potential use in optical materials. However, formulation of CPL emitters as molecular solids typically deteriorates photophysical properties in the aggregated state leading to quenching and unpredictable changes in CPL behavior impeding materials development. To circumvent these shortcomings, a supramolecular approach can be used to isolate cationic dyes in a lattice of cyanostar&#8208;anion complexes that suppress aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and which we hypothesize can preserve the synthetically&#8208;crafted chiroptical properties. Herein, we verify that supramolecular assembly of small&#8208;molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES) allows translation of molecular ECD and CPL properties to solids. A series of cationic helicenes that display increasing chiroptical response is investigated. Crystal structures of three different packing motifs all show spatial isolation of dyes by the anion complexes. We observe the photophysical and chiroptical properties of all helicenes are seamlessly translated to water soluble nanoparticles by the SMILES method. Also, a DMQA helicene is used as FRET acceptor in SMILES nanoparticles of intensely absorbing rhodamine antennae to generate an 18&#8208;fold boost in CPL brightness. These features offer promise for reliably accessing bright materials with programmable CPL properties.

         <title>Vacancy Effect on the Luminescent and Water Responsive Properties of Vacancy&#8208;Ordered Double Perovskite Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inversely relationships between vacancy volume in vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite derivatives with their luminescent quantum yield and water stability have been established for the first time based on a series of [N(alkyl)4]2Sb&#9633;Cl5&#9633;&#8242;&#8208;type vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskite derivatives.







Abstract
Vacancy&#8208;ordered perovskites and derivatives represent an important subclass of hybrid metal halides with promise in applications including light emitting devices and photovoltaics. Understanding the vacancy&#8208;property relationship is crucial for designing related task&#8208;specific materials, yet research in this field remains sporadic. For the first time, we use the Connolly surface to quantitatively calculate the volume of vacancy (V&#9633;, &#9633;=vacancy) in vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite derivatives (VDPDs). A relationship between void fraction and the structure, photoluminescent properties and humidity stability was established based on zero&#8208;dimensional (0&#8208;D) [N(alkyl)4]2Sb&#9633;Cl5&#9633;&#8242;&#8208;type VDPDs. Compared with the more commonly studied A2M(IV)X6&#9633;&#8208;type double perovskite (A=cation, M=metal ion, X=halide), [N(alkyl)4]2Sb&#9633;Cl5&#9633;&#8242; features double vacancy sites. Our results demonstrate an inverse relationship between the photoluminescent quantum yield and V&#9633; in 0&#8208;D VDPDs. Additionally, structural transformation from A2SbCl5 to A3Sb2Cl9 was first reported, during which the novel &#8216;gate&#8208;opening&#8217; gas adsorption phenomenon was observed in VDPDs for the first time, as evidenced by &#8216;S&#8217;&#8208;shaped sorption isotherms for water vapor, indicating a cation&#8208;controlled water&#8208;vapor response behavior. A mixed&#8208;cation strategy was developed to modulate the humidity stability of VDPDs. Characterized by controllable water&#8208;responsive behavior and unique &#8216;on&#8208;off&#8208;on&#8217; luminescent switching, A2M(III)&#9633;X5&#9633;&#8242;&#8208;type materials show great promise for multi&#8208;level information anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Potassium Decahydrido&#8208;Monocarba&#8208;closo&#8208;Decaborate Imidazole Complex Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Potassium Metal Batteries</title>

A newly synthesized complex, KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2, with the dihydrogen bond structural features, exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, four orders of magnitude greater than that of KCB9H10 and the highest ionic conductivity reported to date for hydridoborate&#8208;based K+ conductors. This work offers a promising strategy for synthesizing solid K&#8208;ion conductors with enhanced conductivity.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries have caught increasing interest owing to their abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and high energy/power density. However, their development is generally constrained by the lack of suitable solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Herein, we report a new complex KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2, synthesized by grinding and heating the mixture of potassium decahydrido&#8208;monocarba&#8208;closo&#8208;decaborate (KCB9H10) and imidazole (C3H4N2) under mild conditions, to achieve the K&#8208;ion superionic solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The crystal structure was revealed as an orthorhombic lattice with the space group of Pna21 by FOX software. The diffusion properties for K+ in the crystal structure were calculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI&#8208;NEB) method. KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2 exhibited a high ionic conductivity of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, four orders of magnitude higher than that of KCB9H10. This ionic conductivity is also the highest value of hydridoborate&#8208;based K+ conductors reported. Moreover, KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2 demonstrated a K+ transference number of 0.96, an electrochemical stability window of 1.2 to 3.2&#8197;V vs. K/K+, and good stability against the K metal coated by a layer of potassium imidazolate (KIm). These great performances make KCB9H10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2C3H4N2 a promising K&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state electrolyte.

         <title>One&#8208;Stone&#8208;For&#8208;Three&#8208;Birds Strategy Using a Fullerene Modifier for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>

A novel fullerene derivative (denoted as C60&#8208;TMA) is synthesized and employed to modify the interface between perovskite and C60. C60&#8208;TMA can passivate the surface defects to suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination, form a cascade energy level to facilitate electron extraction, and induce secondary growth of perovskite, contributing to a champion PCE of 24.89&#8201;% for inverted PSCs with significantly improved thermal stability.







Abstract
The electron extraction from perovskite/C60 interface plays a crucial role in influencing the photovoltaic performance of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we develop a one&#8208;stone&#8208;for&#8208;three&#8208;birds strategy via employing a novel fullerene derivative bearing triple methyl acrylate groups (denoted as C60&#8208;TMA) as a multifunctional interfacial layer to optimize electron extraction at the perovskite/C60 interface. It is found that the C60&#8208;TMA not only passivates surface defects of perovskite via coordination interactions between C=O groups and Pb2+ cations but also bridge electron transfer between perovskite and C60. Moreover, it effectively induces the secondary grain growth of the perovskite film through strong bonding effect, and this phenomenon has never been observed in prior art reports on fullerene related studies. The combination of the above three upgrades enables improved perovskite film quality with increased grain size and enhanced crystallinity. With these advantages, C60&#8208;TMA treated PSC devices exhibit a much higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.89&#8201;% than the control devices (23.66&#8201;%). Besides, C60&#8208;TMA benefits improved thermal stability of PSC devices, retaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after aging at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1200&#8197;h, primarily due to the reinforced interfacial interactions and improved perovskite film quality.

         <title>Chaperone&#8208;Derived Copper(I)&#8208;Binding Peptide Nanofibers Disrupt Copper Homeostasis in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a chaperone&#8208;derived Cu+&#8208;binding peptide featuring the conserved MTCGGC Cu+ binding motif, which self&#8208;assembles into nanofibers within cancer cells. These nanofibers have multiple MTCGGC Cu+&#8208;binding motifs on their surfaces, allowing for efficient capture of intracellular Cu+ ions. This process disrupts the Cu+ homeostasis network of cancer cells. Our study offers a novel therapeutic intervention targeting metal ion homeostasis in cancer.







Abstract
Copper (Cu) is a transition metal that plays crucial roles in cellular metabolism. Cu+ homeostasis is upregulated in many cancers and contributes to tumorigenesis. However, therapeutic strategies to target Cu+ homeostasis in cancer cells are rarely explored because small molecule Cu+ chelators have poor binding affinity in comparison to the intracellular Cu+ chaperones, enzymes, or ligands. To address this challenge, we introduce a Cu+ chaperone&#8208;inspired supramolecular approach to disrupt Cu+ homeostasis in cancer cells that induces programmed cell death. The Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR peptide self&#8208;assembles into nanofibers inside cancer cells with high binding affinity and selectivity for Cu+ due to the presence of the unique MTCGGC motif, which is conserved in intracellular Cu+ chaperones. Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR exhibits cytotoxicity towards triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231), impairs the activity of Cu+ dependent co&#8208;chaperone super oxide dismutase1 (SOD1), and induces oxidative stress. In contrast, Nap&#8208;FFMTCGGCR has minimal impact on normal HEK 293T cells. Control peptides show that the self&#8208;assembly and Cu+ binding must work in synergy to successfully disrupt Cu+ homeostasis. We show that assembly&#8208;enhanced affinity for metal ions opens new therapeutic strategies to address disease&#8208;relevant metal ion homeostasis.

         <title>Bioactive Ion&#8208;Confined Ultracapacitive Memristors with Neuromorphic Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pronounced physisorption of bioactive cations with a hydrophobic alkyl chain by porous carbons with a negative zeta potential results in confined cations, which triggers anion enrichment and depletion under electric polarization and enables rapid differential ionic memresistance behavior for cations with strong and weak interactions with porous carbons.







Abstract
The field of bioinspired iontronics, bridging electronic devices and ionic systems, has multiple biological applications. Carbon&#8208;based ultracapacitive devices hold promise for controlling bioactive ions via electric double layers due to their high&#8208;surface&#8208;area and biocompatible porous carbon electrodes. However, the interplay between complex bioactive ions and porous carbons remains unclear due to the variety of structures of bioactive ions present in biological systems. Herein, we investigate the adsorption behavior of a series of bioactive ammonium&#8208;based cations with varying alkyl chain lengths in nanoporous carbons. We find that strong physisorption results from the synergistic hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic attraction between porous carbons (with a negative zeta potential) and bioactive cations. Bioactive cations with varying alkyl chain lengths can be irreversibly physically adsorbed and confined within nanoporous carbons resulting in anion enrichment and depletion during electric polarization. This situation, in turn, results in a characteristic memristive behavior in all&#8208;carbon capacitive ionic memristor devices. Our findings highlight the relationship between the resistance state of the memristor and ion adsorption mechanisms in all&#8208;carbon capacitive devices, which hold potential for future transmitter delivery, biointerfacing, and neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolved Protein Imaging Using Bifunctional Light&#8208;Up Aptamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusions of protein&#8208;binding aptamers to the fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamer RhoBAST enabled visualization of GFP&#8208;tagged or endogenous proteins in both fixed and live mammalian cells. The fast exchange of the fluorogen yields intermittent fluorescence required for super&#8208;resolved imaging by RhoBAST&#8208;PAINT, a single&#8208;molecule localization technique.







Abstract
Efficient labeling methods for protein visualization with minimal tag size and appropriate photophysical properties are required for single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), providing insights into the organization and interactions of biomolecules in cells at the molecular level. Among the fluorescent light&#8208;up aptamers (FLAPs) originally developed for RNA imaging, RhoBAST stands out due to its remarkable brightness, photostability, fluorogenicity, and rapid exchange kinetics, enabling super&#8208;resolved imaging with high localization precision. Here, we expand the applicability of RhoBAST to protein imaging by fusing it to protein&#8208;binding aptamers. The versatility of such bifunctional aptamers is demonstrated by employing a variety of protein&#8208;binding aptamers and different FLAPs. Moreover, fusing RhoBAST with the GFP&#8208;binding aptamer AP3 facilitates high&#8208; and super&#8208;resolution imaging of GFP&#8208;tagged proteins, which is particularly valuable in view of the widespread availability of plasmids and stable cell lines expressing proteins fused to GFP. The bifunctional aptamers compare favorably with standard antibody&#8208;based immunofluorescence protocols, as they are 7&#8208;fold smaller than antibody conjugates and exhibit higher bleaching&#8208;resistance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in super&#8208;resolution microscopy in secondary mammalian cell lines and primary neurons by RhoBAST&#8208;PAINT, an SMLM protein imaging technique that leverages the transient binding of the fluorogenic rhodamine dye SpyRho to RhoBAST.

         <title>Phenyl Radical Activates Molecular Hydrogen Through Protium and Deuterium Tunneling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activating the strong H2 bond is typically reserved for transition metals, and only a few main group systems can tackle this challenge. Here, we explore a phenyl radical mediated pathway utilizing the photolysis of iodobenzene. The phenyl radical leverages the high C&#8722;H bond energy of the forming benzene to drive H2 activation. Low&#8208;temperature experiments and dual level instanton computations reveal hydrogen tunneling as a critical factor.







Abstract
Activating dihydrogen, H2, is a challenging endeavor typically achieved using transition metal centers. Pure main&#8208;group compounds capable of this are rare and have emerged in recent decades. These systems rely on synergistic donor&#8208;acceptor interactions with H2&#8217;s antibonding &#963;* and bonding &#963; orbital. An alternative (hydrocarbon) radical&#8208;mediated activation is problematic because the H&#8722;H bond is stronger (104.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) than most C&#8722;H bonds. Here, we explore using the phenyl radical to tackle this, forming benzene with a C&#8722;H bond energy (112.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) that provides a thermodynamic driving force. We mainly observe a benzene&#8208;HI complex upon photolysis of iodobenzene in an H2&#8208;doped neon matrix at 4.4&#8197;K despite a barrier of 7.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, while phenyl radical forms in case of the heavier D2 isotopologue. When D2 molecules are allowed to diffuse, mono&#8208;deuterated benzene accumulates within hours. Computations using path integral&#8208;based instanton theory highlight that primarily the transferred hydrogen atom is moving during the reaction which greatly increases the tunneling probability. In excellent agreement with the experimental results, we predict significant tunneling rate constants for both isotopologues, H2 and D2, featuring a strong kinetic isotope effect of up to four orders of magnitude at the lowest temperatures.

         <title>Engineering a Cu&#8208;Pd Paddle&#8208;Wheel Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Selective CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of atomically precise Cu&#8722;Pd dimers within the nodes of a Cu&#8208;MOF was confirmed through detailed XAS experiments. DFT calculations suggest that the Pd atom in the Cu&#8722;Pd dimer modulates the binding energy of the key *COOH intermediate on the neighboring Cu site, leading to enhanced selectivity for electrocatalytic CO production during CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Optimizing the binding energy between the intermediate and the active site is a key factor for tuning catalytic product selectivity and activity in the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Copper active sites are known to reduce CO2 to hydrocarbons and oxygenates, but suffer from poor product selectivity due to the moderate binding energies of several of the reaction intermediates. Here, we report an ion exchange strategy to construct Cu&#8722;Pd paddle wheel dimers within Cu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Cu3&#8208;xPdx(BTC)2] (BTC=benzentricarboxylate), without altering the overall MOF structural properties. Compared to the pristine Cu MOF ([Cu3(BTC)2], HKUST&#8208;1), the Cu&#8722;Pd MOF shifts CO2 electroreduction products from diverse chemical species to selective CO generation. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis of the catalyst oxidation state and local geometry, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that the incorporation of Pd within the Cu&#8722;Pd paddle wheel node structure of the MOF promotes adsorption of the key intermediate COOH* at the Cu site. This permits CO&#8208;selective catalytic mechanisms and thus advances our understanding of the interplay between structure and activity toward electrochemical CO2 reduction using molecular catalysts.

         <title>Cyclic Acetals as Expanding Monomers to Reduce Shrinkage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals distance of a thiol and ene is depicted. After the thiol&#8208;ene reaction a thioether bond is formed resulting in a shorter interatomic distance. This shrinkage leads to stress in the polymer which can be reduced by radical&#8208;mediated redox&#8208;rearrangements catalyzed by thiols. A compact cyclic acetal extent to a longer linear ester. This volumetric expansion is counteracting the shrinkage resulting from the thiol&#8208;ene reaction.







Abstract
Polarity&#8208;reversal catalysts (PRCs) for hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer reactions have been known in radical chemistry for more than 60&#8197;years but are rarely described and utilized in the field of photopolymerization up to now. Herein, we present the use of thiols in a unique dual function as thiol&#8208;ene click reagents and as polarity&#8208;reversal catalyst (PRC) for the radical&#8208;mediated redox rearrangements of benzylidene acetals. During the rearrangement reaction, cyclic benzylidene acetals are transformed into benzoate esters leading to a significant volumetric expansion to reduce thermoset shrinkage. We were able to show that this expansion on a molecular level reduces shrinkage and polymerization stress but does not significantly affect the (thermo&#8722;)mechanical properties of the cross&#8208;linked networks. One of the key advantages of this process lies in its simplicity. No additives like sensitizers or combinations of different initiators (radical and cationic) are needed. Furthermore, the same light source can be used for both the polymerization reaction and expansion through rearrangement. Additionally, the applied photoinitiator enables spatial and temporal control of the polymerization; thus, the developed system can be an excellent platform for additive manufacturing processes.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infinite&#8208;Chain Polymers with Ge=Ge Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers with Ge=Ge double bonds in the &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugational path are obtained via heavier acyclic diene metathesis of bis(digermene)s. High solubility and interchain dispersion interactions allow for near&#8208;infinite chains and deposition as thin films with ordered lamellar bundles. With the absorption in the visible range corresponding to small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps, this new class of conjugated materials is promising for various applications.







Abstract
Despite considerable interest in heteroatom&#8208;containing conjugated polymers, there are only few examples with heavier p&#8208;block elements in the conjugation path. The recently reported heavier acyclic diene metathesis (HADMET) allowed for the synthesis of a polymer containing Ge=Ge double bonds&#8212;albeit insoluble and with limited degree of polymerization. By incorporation of long alkyl chains, we now obtained soluble representatives, which exhibit degrees of polymerization near infinity according to diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). UV/Vis and NMR data confirm the presence of &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugation across the silylene&#8208;phenylene linkers between the Ge=Ge double bonds. Favorable intermolecular dispersion interactions lead to ladder&#8208;like cylindrical assemblies as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and DLS. AFM and TEM images of deposited thin films reveal lamellar ordering of extended polymer bundles.

         <title>Controllable Graphene/MoS2 Heterointerfaces by Perpendicular Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The van der Waals interfaces of graphene/MoS2 heterostructures are tuned through controlled functionalization of the bottom graphene layer. Adjusting the size of the functional groups enables nm&#8208;scale modification of interlayer distances. Both the size and electronic properties of the functional groups are key to regulating charge transport, with size being particularly decisive.







Abstract
Surface chemistry and interface interactions profoundly influence the properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials and heterostructures. Therefore, developing methods to precisely control surfaces and interfaces is crucial for harnessing the properties and functions of 2D materials and heterostructures. Here, we developed a facile approach to tuning the interface distance and properties of graphene/MoS2 heterostructures (G/MoS2) by varying the functional groups attached to the surface of graphene bottom layer. We systematically investigated how different functionalized graphene bottom layers affect the interlayer distance, coupling between the interlayers, and optical properties of resulting G/MoS2 heterostructures. Our findings indicate that both the size and electron&#8208;withdrawing/donating properties of functional groups are pivotal in regulating charge transport properties, with size playing a particularly decisive role. Our approach demonstrates an efficient and flexible pathway to regulate the interlayer spacing and charge transport, highlighting the potential of engineering interface chemistry in optimizing properties of van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Solid&#8208;State Fluorescent Photoswitches for High&#8208;Level Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and cis&#8208;trans isomerization, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven solid&#8208;state fluorescent photoswitch has been developed. It was obtained by incorporating a bulky naphthalimide group into a salicylaldimine. The photoswitch shows triple fluorescence switching, showing potential application in high&#8208;level information encryption.







Abstract
Developing visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven fluorescent photoswitches in the solid state remains an enormous challenge in smart materials. Such photoswitches are obtained from salicylaldimines through excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and subsequent cis&#8208;trans isomerization strategies. By incorporating a bulky naphthalimide fluorophore into a Schiff base, three photoswitches achieve dual&#8208;mode changes (both in color and fluorescence) in the solid state. In particular, the optimal one generates triple fluorescence changing from green, to yellow and finally to orange upon visible&#8208;light irradiation. This switching process is fully reversible and can be repeated at least 10&#8197;times without obvious attenuation, suggesting its good photo&#8208;fatigue resistance. Mechanism studies reveal that the naphthalimide group not only enables the tuning of multicolor with an additional emission, but also induces a folded structure, reducing molecular stacking and facilitating ESIPT and cis&#8208;trans isomerization. As such, photopatterning, ternary encoding and transient information recording and erasing are successfully developed. The present study provides a reliable strategy for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven fluorescent photoswitches, showing implications for advanced information encryption materials.

The present study provides a reliable strategy for visible-light-driven fluorescent photoswitches, showing implications for advanced information encryption materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Nitroreductase&#8208;Activatable Metabolic Reporter for Covalent Labeling of Pathological Hypoxic Cells in Tumorigenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under pathophysiological hypoxic environments, the caged non&#8208;metabolizable precursor pNB&#8208;ManNAz exhibited responsiveness to cellular NTR, culminating in structural self&#8208;immolation and the resultant ManNAz could be incorporated onto the cell surface glycoproteins, thereby facilitating fluorescence labeling via bioorthogonal chemistry. This NTR&#8208;responsive metabolic reporter demonstrated broad applicability for specific hypoxia labeling in diverse cell lines, particularly in the monitoring of orthotopic tumorigenesis and targeted tumor phototherapy in zebrafish models.







Abstract
Aberrant hypoxic stress will initiate a cascade of pathological consequence observed prominently in tumorigenesis. Understanding of hypoxia's role in tumorigenesis is highly essential for developing effective therapeutics, which necessitates reliable tools to specifically distinguish hypoxic tumor cells (or tissues) and correlate their dynamics with the status of disease in complex living settings for precise theranostics. So far, disparate hypoxia&#8208;responsive probe molecules and prodrugs were designed via chemical or enzymatic reactions, yet their capability in real&#8208;time reporting pathogenesis development is often compromised due to unrestricted diffusion and less selectivity towards the environmental responsiveness. Herein we present an oxygen&#8208;insensitive nitroreductase (NTR)&#8208;activatable glycan metabolic reporter (pNB&#8208;ManNAz) capable of covalently labeling hypoxic tumor cells and tissues. Under pathophysiological hypoxic environments, the caged non&#8208;metabolizable precursor pNB&#8208;ManNAz exhibited unique responsiveness to cellular NTR, culminating in structural self&#8208;immolation and the resultant ManNAz could incorporate onto cell surface glycoproteins, thereby facilitating fluorescence labeling via bioorthogonal chemistry. This NTR&#8208;responsive metabolic reporter demonstrated broad applicability for multicellular hypoxia labeling, particularly in the dynamic monitoring of orthotopic tumorigenesis and targeted tumor phototherapy in vivo. We anticipate that this approach holds promise for investigating hypoxia&#8208;related pathological progression, offering valuable insights for accurate diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction: Atom&#8208;Economical Synthesis of Axially Chiral Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction has been realized via vinyl cation pathway, enabling the atom&#8208;economical synthesis of axially chiral phenyl and indolyl carbazoles. This protocol continues the first example of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective DDA reaction. Notably, the constructed axially chiral carbazoles are applicable to asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
The dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (DDA) reaction is a powerful method for the construction of aromatic compounds. However, the enantioselective DDA reaction has been rarely developed, probably due to the competitive thermal reaction. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective DDA reaction through vinyl cation pathway. The reaction leads to the atom&#8208;economical synthesis of axially chiral phenyl and indolyl carbazoles in generally excellent yields with good to excellent atroposelectivities. This methodology represents the first example of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective DDA reaction. Notably, new chiral ligand and organocatalyst derived from the constructed axially chiral carbazole are demonstrated to be useful in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Structural Rearrangement Towards a White&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Adamantane&#8208;Type Cluster Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of an ethylene bridge into a quaternary adamantane&#8208;type cluster core {Si(CH2)n(C2H4)mSn3S3} (n/m=3/0 or 2/1) causes distinct distortions, which the molecules escape by an unprecedented dimerization of the cluster cores. This structural change affects the (extreme) nonlinear optical properties of such white&#8208;light emitting materials, as shown by a combined experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical study.







Abstract
Group 14/16 adamantane&#8208;type hybrid clusters of the type [(RT)4E6] (T=group 14 element, E=group 16 element, R=organic group) have been reported to emit white&#8208;light when irradiated in an amorphous state with a continuous&#8208;wave (CW) infrared laser diode. This effect is enhanced if the cluster core is varied from a binary to a more complex composition. To further explore this phenomenon, we synthesized clusters with a multinary R/R&#8217;&#8208;T/T&#8217;&#8208;E/E&#8217; composition, including isolobal replacement of E with CH2, in [(2&#8208;NpSi){CH2Sn(S)Ph}3] (1, Np=naphthyl). When expanding one of the CH2 moieties to a C2H4 group, thus generating a R/R&#8217;&#8208;T/T&#8217;&#8208;E/E&#8217;/E&#8217;&#8217; cluster composition, we unexpectedly observed a dimerization of the initially formed, yet non&#8208;isolable adamantane&#8208;like cluster [(2&#8208;NpSi){CH2Sn(S)Ph}2{C2H4Sn(S)Ph}] (2) to [(2&#8208;NpSi){CH2Sn(S)Ph}2{C2H4Sn(S)Ph}]2 (3), exhibiting a heretofore unprecedented cluster architecture. Both monomeric 1 and dimeric 3, show white&#8208;light emission as thin films. The nonlinear optical response of the compounds was also modelled with DFT methods.

         <title>Construction of Highly Porous and Robust Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for High&#8208;Capacity Clean Energy Gas Storage</title>

We herein proposed and demonstrated a strategy of constructing the double&#8208;walled framework to target a highly porous and robust HOF material (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a), exhibiting one of the highest gravimetric and volumetric surface areas for extraordinary high&#8208;pressure methane and hydrogen storage capacities.







Abstract
Development of highly porous and robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) for high&#8208;pressure methane and hydrogen storage remains a grand challenge due to the fragile nature of hydrogen bonds. Herein, we report a strategy of constructing the double&#8208;walled framework to target highly porous and robust HOF (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a) for extraordinary CH4 and H2 storage. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a features a minimized twofold interpenetration with double&#8208;walled structure, in which multiple supramolecular interactions are existed between the interpenetrated walls. This structural configuration can notably enhance the framework robustness while maintaining its high porosity, affording one of the highest gravimetric and volumetric surface areas of 3102&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 1976&#8197;m2&#8201;cm&#8722;3 among the reported HOFs so far. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a thus exhibits an extremely high volumetric H2 uptake of 43.6&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 77&#8197;K/100&#8197;bar and working capacity of 41.3&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 under combined swing conditions (77&#8197;K/100&#8197;bar&#8594;160&#8197;K/5&#8197;bar), and also impressive methane storage performance with a 5&#8211;100&#8197;bar working capacity of 187 (or 159) cm3 (STP) cm&#8722;3 at 270&#8197;K (or 296&#8197;K), outperforming most of the reported porous organic materials. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies on CH4&#8208;loaded ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a reveal that abundant supramolecular binding sites combined with ultrahigh porosities account for its high CH4 storage capacities. Combined with high stability, super&#8208;hydrophobicity, and easy recovery, ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;5a is placed among the most promising materials for H2 and CH4 storage applications.

ZJU-HOF-5a thus exhibits an extremely high volumetric H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake of 43.6&#8197;g&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 77&#8197;K/100&#8197;bar and working capacity of 41.3&#8197;g&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under combined swing conditions (77&#8197;K/100&#8197;bar&#8594;160&#8197;K/5&#8197;bar), and also impressive methane storage performance with a 5&#8211;100&#8197;bar working capacity of 187 (or 159) cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (STP) cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 270&#8197;K (or 296&#8197;K), outperforming most of the reported porous organic materials. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies on CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-loaded ZJU-HOF-5a reveal that abundant supramolecular binding sites combined with ultrahigh porosities account for its high CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; storage capacities. Combined with high stability, super-hydrophobicity, and easy recovery, ZJU-HOF-5a is placed among the most promising materials for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; storage applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Driven Dynamic Behavior of Nanoconfined Water in Hydrophilic MXene Sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the detailed proton&#8208;driven dynamic behaviors of nanoconfined water between hydrophilic MXene sheets using molecular dynamics simulation based on the active learning potential trained by deep neural network algorithms. These findings have illuminated several novel phenomena including the MXene oxidation rate regulated by protons, the formation of a hexagonal ice phase exhibiting unconventional bonding patterns at room temperature, and a significant reduction in water diffusivity.







Abstract
Liquid water under nanoscale confinement has attracted intensive attention due to its pivotal role in understanding various phenomena across many scientific fields. MXenes serve an ideal paradigm for investigating the dynamic behaviors of nanoconfined water in a hydrophilic environment. Combining deep neural networks and an active learning scheme, here we elucidate the proton&#8208;driven dynamics of water molecules confined between V2CTx sheets using molecular dynamics simulation. Firstly, we have found that the Eigen and Zundel cations can inhibit water&#8208;induced oxidation by adjusting the orientation of water molecules, thus proposing a general antioxidant strategy. Besides, we also identified a hexagonal ice phase with abnormal bonding rules at room temperature, rather than only at ultralow temperatures as other studies reported, and further captured the proton&#8208;induced water phase transition. This highlighted the importance of protons in the maintaining stable crystal phase and phase transition of water. Furthermore, we discussed the conversions of different water structures and water diffusivity with changing proton concentrations in detail. The results provide useful guidance in practical applications of MXenes including developing antioxidant strategies, identifying novel 2D water phases and optimizing energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Multifunctional Interface Layer Constructed by Trace Zwitterions for Highly Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trace zwitterionic additive endows the Zn||Zn cells with a cycling life of more than 10000&#8197;hours. And the Zn||I2 full cell exhibits 95&#8201;% capacity retention after 30000&#8197;cycles. Remarkably, the Zn||I2 pouch cells (95&#8197;mAh) deliver a high&#8208;capacity retention of 99&#8201;% after 750&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
The inhomogeneous plating/stripping of Zn anode, attributed to dendrite growth and parasitic reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface, severely restricts its cycling life&#8208;span. Here, trace zwitterions (trifluoroacetate pyridine, TFAPD) are introduced into the aqueous electrolyte to construct a multifunctional interface that enhances the reversibility of Zn anode. The TFA&#8722; anions with strong specific adsorption adhere onto the Zn surface to reconstruct the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), preventing the hydrogen evolution and corrosion side reactions caused by free H2O. The Py+ cations accumulate on the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) of Zn anode with the force of electric field during Zn2+ plating, forming a shielding layer to uniformize the deposition of Zn2+. Besides, the adsorbed TFA&#8722; and Py+ promote the desolvation process of Zn2+ resulting in fast reaction kinetics. Thus, the Zn||Zn cells present an outstanding cycling performance of more than 10000&#8197;hours. And even at 85&#8201;% utilization rate of Zn, it can stably cycle for over 200&#8197;hours at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Zn||I2 full cell exhibits a capacity retention of over 95&#8201;% even after 30000&#8197;cycles. Remarkably, the Zn||I2 pouch cells (95&#8197;mAh) deliver a high&#8208;capacity retention of 99&#8201;% after 750&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Initiated Difunctionalization of [1.1.1]Propellane via Photoinduced Polarity Match Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, XB adducts are formed between BzI&#8208;tethered amines and amines via the halogen bonding. After photofragmentation, the &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals are generated and subsequently undergo radical addition to [1.1.1]propellane, yielding BCP radicals that participate in polarity&#8208;matched additions, culminating in the difunctionalization of bicyclopentane. The versatility of this approach is underscored by a series of valuable transformations.







Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP), recognized as a bioisostere for para&#8208;disubstituted benzene, has gained widespread interest in drug development due to its ability to enhance the physicochemical properties of pharmaceuticals. In this work, we introduce a photoinduced, halogen bonding&#8208;initiated, metal&#8208;free strategy for synthesizing various BCP derivatives. This method involves the generation of nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals via halogen&#8208;bonding adducts. These undergo selective radical addition to [1.1.1]propellane, yielding electrophilic BCP radicals that subsequently participate in polarity&#8208;matched additions, culminating in the difunctionalization of bicyclopentane. The versatility and practicality of this metal&#8208;free approach are underscored by its broad substrate scope, which includes late&#8208;stage functionalization and a series of valuable transformations, all conducted under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>The Asymmetrical Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se Bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 Boosting Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalytic Performance for Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated Fe&#8208;based selenium oxide catalyst Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC was fabricated for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). The Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC@NC could obviously enhance catalytic performance of ORR and OER because it can modify coordination environment surrounding Fe atoms and accordingly realize an optimization of the adsorption energy of oxygen intermediates. Furthermore, the Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC&#8208;based ZABs exhibit superior peak power density and specific capacity in comparison to Pt/C+RuO2&#8208;based ZABs.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have the advantages of high energy density and rich zinc raw materials. It is a low&#8208;cost, green and sustainable energy storage device. At present, one of the key technologies that hinder the large&#8208;scale application of ZABs is the design and fabrication oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) bifunctional catalysts with excellent performance, especially the non&#8208;platinum&#8208;based catalysts. Here N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated Fe&#8208;based selenium oxide catalyst Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC with high performance has been fabricated by a one&#8208;step pyrolysis and then the electrochemical oxidization. The experimental results confirmed that the existence of Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 crystal phase of Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC, and the Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds could obviously enhance ORR and OER catalytic performance of Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC. Density functional theoretical calculations (DFT) confirmed that the Fe2O(SeO3)2 in Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC had a higher d&#8208;band center of Fe atom and a lower p&#8208;orbital coupling degree with its own lattice O atom than Fe2O3, which leads to Fe site of Fe2O(SeO3)2 being more likely to adsorb external oxygen intermediates. The Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 results in the modification of coordination environment of Fe atoms and optimizes the adsorption energy of Fe site for oxygen intermediates. Compared with Fe2O3/Fe3C@NC, the Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC showed the obvious enhancements of ORR/OER catalytic activities with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#8197;V for ORR in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte and a low overpotential of 345&#8197;mV for OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. The peak power density and specific capacity of Fe2O(SeO3)2/Fe3C@NC&#8208;based ZABs are higher than those of Pt/C+RuO2&#8208;ZABs. The above results demonstrate that the asymmetrical Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe2O(SeO3)2 plays a key role in improving the bifunctional catalytic activities of ORR/OER for ZABs.

&lt;p&gt;The N-doped carbon-coated Fe-based selenium oxide catalyst Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C@NC was fabricated for zinc-air batteries (ZABs). The Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C@NC@NC could obviously enhance catalytic performance of ORR and OER because it can modify coordination environment surrounding Fe atoms and accordingly realize an optimization of the adsorption energy of oxygen intermediates. Furthermore, the Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C@NC-based ZABs exhibit superior peak power density and specific capacity in comparison to Pt/C+RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based ZABs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have the advantages of high energy density and rich zinc raw materials. It is a low-cost, green and sustainable energy storage device. At present, one of the key technologies that hinder the large-scale application of ZABs is the design and fabrication oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) bifunctional catalysts with excellent performance, especially the non-platinum-based catalysts. Here N-doped carbon-coated Fe-based selenium oxide catalyst Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C@NC with high performance has been fabricated by a one-step pyrolysis and then the electrochemical oxidization. The experimental results confirmed that the existence of Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crystal phase of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C@NC, and the Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds could obviously enhance ORR and OER catalytic performance of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C@NC. Density functional theoretical calculations (DFT) confirmed that the Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C@NC had a higher &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center of Fe atom and a lower &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-orbital coupling degree with its own lattice O atom than Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which leads to Fe site of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; being more likely to adsorb external oxygen intermediates. The Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; results in the modification of coordination environment of Fe atoms and optimizes the adsorption energy of Fe site for oxygen intermediates. Compared with Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C@NC, the Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C@NC showed the obvious enhancements of ORR/OER catalytic activities with a half-wave potential of 0.91&#8197;V for ORR in 0.1&#8197;M KOH electrolyte and a low overpotential of 345&#8197;mV for OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. The peak power density and specific capacity of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C@NC-based ZABs are higher than those of Pt/C+RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ZABs. The above results demonstrate that the asymmetrical Fe&#8722;O&#8722;Se bonds in Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plays a key role in improving the bifunctional catalytic activities of ORR/OER for ZABs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Quasi&#8208;Single Ion Conductors by a &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Polymer to Stabilize Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin polymer is used to construct a quasi&#8208;single ion conductor for coating the Zn anodes, and thereby inhibited the corrosion of Zn anode, prevented the side reaction, elevated the Zn ion transference number, suppressed the formation of space charge regions and stabilized the plating/striping of Zn ions.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising for the next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the Zn anode remains facing challenges. Here, we report a cyclodextrin polymer (P&#8208;CD) to construct quasi&#8208;single ion conductor for coating and protecting Zn anodes. The P&#8208;CD coating layer inhibited the corrosion of Zn anode and prevented the side reaction of metal anodes. More important is that the cyclodextrin units enabled the trapping of anions through host&#8211;guest interactions and hydrogen bonds, forming a quasi&#8208;single ion conductor that elevated the Zn ion transference number (from 0.31 to 0.68), suppressed the formation of space charge regions and hence stabilized the plating/striping of Zn ions. As a result, the Zn//Zn symmetric cells coated with P&#8208;CD achieved a 70.6&#8197;times improvement in cycle life at high current densities of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Importantly, the Zn//K1.1V3O8 (KVO) full&#8208;cells with high mass loading of cathode materials and low N/P ratio of 1.46 reached the capacity retention of 94.5&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1; while the cell without coating failed only after 230&#8197;cycles. These results provide novel perspective into the control of solid&#8208;electrolyte interfaces for stabilizing Zn anode and offer a practical strategy to improve AZIBs.

         <title>Visualizing Triplet Energy Transfer in Organic Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescent Host&#8208;Guest Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel NIR phosphors are constructed using a n&#8208;&#960;&#8208;n molecular design strategy. Their phosphorescence can be readily modulated by altering the conjugated core structures. When incorporated into a 4&#8208;bromobenzophenone host, these materials exhibit efficient NIR phosphorescence ranging from 655&#8211;710&#8197;nm. Analysis of the exciton transition process reveals that the enhanced phosphorescence of the guest originates from the triplet energy transfer of abundant triplet excitons generated independently by the host material.







Abstract
Limited by the energy gap law, purely organic materials with efficient near&#8208;infrared room temperature phosphorescence are rare and difficult to achieve. Additionally, the exciton transition process among different emitting species in host&#8211;guest phosphorescent materials remains elusive, presenting a significant academic challenge. Herein, using a modular nonbonding orbital&#8208;&#960; bridge&#8208;nonbonding orbital (n&#8208;&#960;&#8208;n) molecular design strategy, we develop a series of heavy atom&#8208;free phosphors. Systematic modification of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated cores enables the construction of a library with tunable near&#8208;infrared phosphorescence from 655 to 710&#8197;nm. These phosphors exhibit excellent performance under ambient conditions when dispersed into a 4&#8208;bromobenzophenone host matrix, achieving an extended lifetime of 11.25&#8197;ms and a maximum phosphorescence efficiency of 4.2&#8201;%. Notably, by eliminating the interference from host phosphorescence, the exciton transition process in hybrid materials can be visualized under various excitation conditions. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that the improved phosphorescent performance of the guest originates from the triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer of abundant triplet excitons generated independently by the host, rather than from enhanced intersystem crossing efficiency between the guest singlet state and the host triplet state. The findings provide in&#8208;depth insights into constructing novel near&#8208;infrared phosphors and exploring emission mechanisms of host&#8211;guest materials.

         <title>Revealing the Dynamic Evolution of Electrolyte Configuration on the Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface by Visualizing (De) Solvation Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the charging process of lithium cobalt oxide cathode, Li+ undergoes solvation, and Li+&#8208;complexes aggregate in the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, forming a concentrated interface. As the voltage increases, the intensified interfacial electric field exerts greater electro&#8208;repulsion on Li+, forming a diluted interface.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering is crucial for improving cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) to enhance the performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, especially at high charging cut&#8208;off voltages. However, typical electrolyte modification strategies always focus on the solvation structure in the bulk region, but consistently neglect the dynamic evolution of electrolyte solvation configuration at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which directly influences the CEI construction. Herein, we reveal an anti&#8208;synergy effect between Li+&#8208;solvation and interfacial electric field by visualizing the dynamic evolution of electrolyte solvation configuration at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which determines the concentration of interfacial solvated&#8208;Li+. The Li+ solvation in the charging process facilitates the construction of a concentrated (Li+&#8208;solvent/anion&#8208;rich) interface and anion&#8208;derived CEI, while the repulsive force derived from interfacial electric field induces the formation of a diluted (solvent&#8208;rich) interface and solvent&#8208;derived CEI. Modifying the electrochemical protocols and electrolyte formulation, we regulate the &#8220;inflection voltage&#8221; arising from the anti&#8208;synergy effect and prolong the lifetime of the concentrated interface, which further improves the functionality of CEI architecture.

         <title>Nickel Catalyzed Carbonylative Cross Coupling for Direct Access to Isotopically Labeled Alkyl Aryl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of an effective nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross coupling of redox&#8208;activated alkyl carboxylic acids and aryl boronic acids is presented. A wide variety of alkyl aryl ketones is obtained in good yields, and the chemistry is easily applicable to stable and radiocarbon isotope labeling. The mechanism of the transformation has been investigated applying experimental and DFT methods.







Abstract
Here we present an effective nickel&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling for direct access to alkyl aryl ketones from readily accessible redox&#8208;activated tetrachlorophthalimide esters and aryl boronic acids. The methodology, which is run employing only 2.5&#8197;equivalents of CO and simple Ni(II) salts as the metal source, exhibits a broad substrate scope under mild conditions. Furthermore, this carbonylation chemistry provides an easy switch between isotopologues for stable (13CO) and radioactive (14CO) isotope labeling, allowing its adaptation to the late&#8208;stage isotope labeling of pharmaceutically relevant compounds. Based on DFT calculations as well as experimental evidence, a catalytic cycle is proposed involving a carbon&#8208;centered radical formed via nickel(I)&#8208;induced outer&#8208;sphere decarboxylative fragmentation of the redox&#8208;active ester.

         <title>Expansion of Structure Property in Cascade Nazarov Cyclization and Cycloexpansion Reaction to Diverse Angular Tricycles and Total Synthesis of Nominal Madreporanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade Nazarov cyclization/dicycloexpansions reaction for the efficient synthesis angularly fused M/5/N tricyclic skeletons (M=5, 6; N=4&#8211;9, 13) has been explored. In this novel transformation, the priority of ring expansion could be predicted by the rational design of the ring size and substituents. Employing the reaction as a key step, we finished total synthesis of nominal madreporanone for the first time.







Abstract
A cascade Nazarov cyclization/dicycloexpansions reaction was developed for the precise synthesis of the angularly fused M/5/N (M=5, 6; N=4&#8211;9, 13) tricyclic skeletons. The prioritized expansion of the first ring played a critical role in the transformations, due to the release of ring strain, and the nature of the substituents present on the substrate is another influencing factor. This pioneering cascade reaction features broad substrates scope (33&#8197;examples), short reaction time, exceptional yields (up to 95&#8201;%), and remarkable regioselectivities (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1). Exploiting the synthetic application of this cascade reaction, we successfully executed a succinct total synthesis of nominal madreporanone for the first time.

         <title>Nanoporous Heterojunction Photocatalysts with Engineered Interfacial Sites for Efficient Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoporous and chemically bonded S&#8208;Scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is synthesized by hybridization of two semiconducting MOFs, which exhibits excellent performance of photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction with an NH3 production rate of 2.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, an apparent quantum yield value of 16.2&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.28&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (PNRR) offers a promising strategy for sustainable production of ammonia (NH3). However, the reported photocatalysts suffer from low efficiency with great room to improve regarding the charge carrier utilization and active site engineering. Herein, a porous and chemically bonded heterojunction photocatalyst is developed for efficient PNRR to NH3 production via hybridization of two semiconducting metal&#8212;organic frameworks (MOFs), MIL&#8208;125&#8722;NH2 (MIL=Material Institute Lavoisier) and Co&#8208;HHTP (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytripehenylene). Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate the formation of Ti&#8722;O&#8722;Co chemical bonds at the interface, which not only serve as atomic pathway for S&#8208;scheme charge transfer, but also provide electron&#8208;deficient Co centers for improving N2 chemisorption/activation capability and restricting competitive hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the nanoporous structure allows the transportation of reactants to the interfacial active sites at heterojunction, enabling the efficient utilization of charge carriers. Consequently, the rationally designed MOF&#8208;based heterojunction exhibits remarkable PNRR performance with an NH3 production rate of 2.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, an apparent quantum yield (AQY) value of 16.2&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of 0.28&#8201;%, superior to most reported PNRR photocatalysts. Our work provides new insights into the design principles of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Synchronously Improved Multiple Afterglow and Phosphorescence Efficiencies in 0D Hybrid Zinc Halides With Ultrahigh Anti&#8208;Water Stabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New 0D hybrid Zn halide family with high water&#8208;resistance and simultaneous integration of cyan STE emission and ultralong green afterglow was firstly synthesized by skillfully manipulating metal halides and organic phosphors as independent optical centers. Through regulating heavy atom effect to control the intersystem crossing rate and spin&#8208;orbit coupling, the dormant emitting units were significantly activated resulting in unprecedented high emission efficiency for both STE and afterglow emissions in 0D hybrid metal halides, which was applied for color&#8208;time&#8208;dual&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption&#8208;decryption.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides have been emerged as room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, but synchronous optimization of multiple phosphorescence performance in one structural platform remains less resolved, and stable RTP activity in aqueous medium is also unrealized due to serious instability toward water and oxygen. Herein, we demonstrated a photophysical tuning strategy in a new 0D hybrid zinc halide family of (BTPP)2ZnX4 (BTPP=benzyltriphenylphosphonium, X=Cl and Br). Infrequently, the delicate combination of organic and inorganic species enables this family to display multiple ultralong green afterglow and efficient self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) associated cyan phosphorescence. Compared with inert luminescence of [BTPP]+ cation, incorporation of anionic [ZnX4]2&#8722; effectively enhance the spin&#8208;orbit coupling effect, which significantly boosts the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 30.66&#8201;% and 54.62&#8201;% for afterglow and phosphorescence, respectively. Synchronously, the corresponding luminescence lifetime extend to 143.94&#8197;ms and 0.308&#8197;&#956;s surpassing the indiscernible phosphorescence of [BTPP]X salt. More importantly, this halide family presents robust RTP emission with nearly unattenuated PLQY in water and harsh condition (acid and basic aqueous solution) over half a year. The highly efficient integrated afterglow and STE phosphorescence as well as ultrahigh aqueous state RTP realize multiple anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications in wide chemical environments.

         <title>Homochiral Covalent Organic Frameworks with Superhelical Nanostructures Enable Efficient Chirality&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homochiral superhelical COF nanofibers were synthesized by manipulating the lengths of alkyl chains in enantiopure BINOL&#8208;based organic linkers. The resulting 3D chiral COFs formed right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed superhelix fibers with macroscopic chirality. These nanofibers exhibit significantly enhanced enantiodiscrimination in carbohydrate binding and a remarkable chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect.







Abstract
Despite significant advancements in fabricating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse morphologies, creating COFs with superhelical nanostructures remains challenging. We report here the controlled synthesis of homochiral superhelical COF nanofibers by manipulating pendent alkyl chain lengths in organic linkers. This approach yields homochiral 3D COFs 13&#8208;OR with a 10&#8208;fold interpenetrated diamondoid structure (R=H, Me, Et, nPr, nBu) from enantiopure 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL)&#8208;based tetraaldehydes and tetraamine. COF&#8208;13&#8208;OEt exhibits macroscopic chirality as right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed superhelical fibers, whereas others adopt spherical or non&#8208;helical morphologies. Time&#8208;tracking shows a self&#8208;assembly process from non&#8208;helical strands to single&#8208;stranded helical fibers and intertwined superhelices. Ethoxyl substituents, being of optimal size, balance solvophobic effects and intermolecular interactions, driving the formation of superhelical nanostructures, with handedness determined by BINOL chirality. The superhelical nature of these materials is evident in their chiral recognition and spin&#8208;filter properties, showing significantly improved enantiodiscrimination in carbohydrate binding (up to six times higher enantioselectivity) and a remarkable chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect with a 48&#8211;51&#8201;% spin polarization ratio, a feature absent in non&#8208;helical analogs.

         <title>Operando Spectroelectrochemistry Unravels the Mechanism of CO2 Electrocatalytic Reduction by an Fe Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive experimental investigation of the mechanistic aspects of the selective electroreduction of CO2 to CO by an iron porphyrin using IR and UV/Visible absorption spectroelectrochemistry provides operando insights at molecular scale. In addition to the main catalytic cycle involving FeI species as resting state, a secondary pathway involving the protonation of the porphyrin ligand into a phlorin ligand at the Fe0 level was identified.







Abstract
Iron porphyrins are molecular catalysts recognized for their ability to electrochemically and photochemically reduce carbon dioxide (CO2). The main reduction product is carbon monoxide (CO). CO holds significant industrial importance as it serves as a precursor for various valuable chemical products containing either a single carbon atom (C1), like methanol or methane, or multiple carbon atoms (Cn), such as ethanol or ethylene. Despite the long&#8208;established efficiency of these catalysts, optimizing their catalytic activity and stability and comprehending the intricate reaction mechanisms remain a significant challenge. This article presents a comprehensive investigation of the mechanistic aspects of the selective electroreduction of CO2 to CO using an iron porphyrin substituted with four trimethylammonium groups in the para position [(pTMA)FeIII&#8722;Cl]4+. By employing infrared and UV/Visible spectroelectrochemistry, changes in the electronic structure and coordination environment of the iron center can be observed in real&#8208;time as the electrochemical potential is adjusted, offering new insights into the reaction mechanisms. Catalytic species were identified, and evidence of a secondary reaction pathway was uncovered, potentially prompting a re&#8208;evaluation of the nature of the catalytically active species.

         <title>Cyclic Sulfoximines as Methyl and Perdeuteromethyl Transfer Agents and Their Applications in Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under photoredox catalysis, novel heterocyclic sulfoximines serve as methyl and perdeuteromethyl radical sources. The reagents are bench&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use. Various radical acceptors can be applied leading to products in good yields. Up&#8208;scaling has been achieved by using a photoflow reactor. Physicochemical studies suggest a photoredox process.







Abstract
Benzo[1,3,2]dithiazole&#8208;1,1,3&#8208;trioxides are bench&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use reagents. In photoredox catalysis, they generate methyl and perdeuteromethyl radicals which can add to a variety of radical acceptors, including olefins, acrylamides, quinoxalinones, isocyanides, enol silanes, and N&#8208;Ts acrylamide. As byproduct, a salt is formed which can be regenerated to the original methylating agent. Flow chemistry provides an option for reaction scale&#8208;up further underscoring the synthetic usefulness of these methylation reagents. Mechanistic investigations suggest a single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) pathway induced by photoredox catalysis.

         <title>Mild and Scalable Conditions for the Solvothermal Synthesis of Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fifteen imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks were synthesized in hours in the same mixture of n&#8208;butanol, water and acetic acid while stirring. The method is convenient, green, tolerates a wide variety of monomers, and can produce over ten grams of covalent organic framework in one batch.







Abstract
A convenient method was developed that allows for the synthesis of highly crystalline and porous imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in hours. The use of an apolar solvent in combination with a precise amount of water and acetic acid was crucial to obtain materials of optimal quality. Fifteen different COFs could be produced under the same reaction conditions, using a green solvent mixture of n&#8208;butanol, acetic acid and water at 70&#8201;&#176;C for 16&#8197;hours with stirring. The crystallinity of the COFs produced in this manner is similar or better than that obtained by traditional solvothermal synthesis. The method could be easily scaled to synthesize over ten grams of COF in one batch. Optical microscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and in situ Raman spectroscopy gave insight in the role of the solvent on the aggregation of COF nanosheets and the resulting crystallinity, porosity and robustness of the material.

         <title>In Situ Generation of 1&#8208;Acetylpyrene as a Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalyst for the Thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unexpected discovery of the photosensitization properties of 1&#8208;acetylpyrene for the thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi reaction enabled the limitations of this hetero&#8208;cycloaddition reaction to be tackled in terms of substrate scope and efficiency. The synthesis of a wide range of thietanes from intrinsically unstable thiocarbonyls was made possible by the use of pyrenacyl sulfides as a source of both the thiocarbonyl substrate and the photocatalyst.







Abstract
The thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction represents a straightforward approach to build thietane cores. Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report herein a visible&#8208;light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls though a Norrish type&#8197;II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction with various non&#8208;volatile electron&#8208;rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocarbonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1&#8208;acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia&#8208;Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet&#8208;triplet Dexter energy transfer based mechanism is proposed.

Unfortunately, the significant instability of thiocarbonyls, particularly thioketones and thioaldehydes, has hitherto rendered this photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition underexploited. To address this limitation, we report herein a visible-light photochemical domino reaction including: the in situ generation of thiocarbonyls though a Norrish type&#8197;II fragmentation of pyrenacyl sulfides, and the aforementioned thia-Patern&#242;-B&#252;chi reaction with various non-volatile electron-rich alkenes. The highly efficient synthesis of a wide range of unprecedented thietanes from intrinsically highly unstable thiocarbonyls, such as thioaldehydes and aliphatic thioketones, was made possible by the multitasking capability of pyrenacyl sulfides as a source of thiocarbonyl substrates and as precursors of 1-acetylpyrene, which acts as the photocatalyst for the thia-Patern&#242;-B&#252;chi reaction. The photosensitizer properties of the latter have been experimentally established and a triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer based mechanism is proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boron Cluster Anions Dissolve En Masse in Lipids Causing Membrane Expansion and Thinning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superchaotropic dodecaborate cluster anions adsorb efficiently on lipid mono&#8208; and bilayers, affecting the physical properties of the membrane more strongly than conventional chaotropic anions. Cluster immersion in the bilayer leads to a reorganization of the lipid chains, affording hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic membranes with expanded surface area per lipid as well as thinner membranes with increased fluidity.







Abstract
Boron clusters are applied in medicinal chemistry because of their high stability in biological environments and intrinsic ability to capture neutrons. However, their intermolecular interactions with lipid membranes, which are critical for their cellular delivery and biocompatibility, have not been comprehensively investigated. In this study, we combine different experimental methods &#8211; Langmuir monolayer isotherms at the air&#8211;water interface, calorimetry (DSC, ITC), and scattering techniques (DLS, SAXS) &#8211; with MD simulations to evaluate the impact of closo&#8208;dodecaborate clusters on model membranes of different lipid composition. The cluster anions interact strongly with zwitterionic membranes (POPC and DPPC) via the chaotropic effect and cause pronounced expansions of lipid monolayers. The resulting lipid membranes contain up to 33&#8197;mol&#8201;% and up to 52 weight&#8201;% of boron cluster anions even at low aqueous cluster concentrations (1&#8197;mM). They show high (&#956;M) affinity to the hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic interface, affecting the structuring of the lipid chains, and therefore triggering a sequence of characteristic effects: (i) an expansion of the surface area per lipid, (ii) an increase in membrane fluidity, and (iii) a reduction of bilayer thickness. These results aid the design of boron cluster derivatives as auxiliaries in drug design as well as transmembrane carriers and help rationalize potential toxicity effects.

         <title>Aza&#8208;Diarylethenes Undergoing Both Photochemically and Thermally Reversible Electrocyclic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aza&#8208;diarylethenes with benzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide as a part of the hexatriene structure undergo bidirectional thermal isomerization in addition to bidirectional photochemical isomerization due to a small energy difference between the open&#8208; and the closed&#8208;ring isomers. Kinetic analysis and theoretical calculations revealed the detailed mechanisms of the photochemical and thermal reactions. Using these unique properties, both light&#8208;writing/light&#8208;erasing and heat&#8208;writing/light&#8208;erasing systems were demonstrated.







Abstract
Exploring novel molecular photoswitches plays a crucial role in the field of photo&#8208;functional materials chemistry. In this study, we synthesized aza&#8208;diarylethenes with benzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide as a part of the hexatriene structure and investigated their photochromic properties. Unlike previously reported aza&#8208;diarylethenes, which exhibit fast thermally reversible photochromism, the compounds synthesized here exhibited pseudo&#8208;photochemically reversible photochromism. Due to their thermal stability, we successfully isolated the colored isomer. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed for the first time that the colored isomer adopts a closed&#8208;ring structure with a bond between carbon and nitrogen atoms. Remarkably, these aza&#8208;diarylethenes exhibited not only photochemical ring&#8208;closing and ring&#8208;opening reactions but also thermal ring&#8208;closing and ring&#8208;opening reactions, driven by a thermal equilibrium between the open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers. This behavior, unprecedented for common diarylethenes, was elucidated through kinetic analysis, revealing an energy&#8208;level diagram for the thermal equilibrium between these isomers. Furthermore, 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy revealed that both photochemically and thermally generated closed&#8208;ring isomers adopt the same molecular structure, which was well explained based on the reaction mechanism of photochemical and thermal ring&#8208;closing reactions. These findings not only advance the field of aza&#8208;diarylethenes but also inspire future research in the development of new photoswitches.

Thiosilvatins are a class of biologically active dithiodiketopiperazine natural products. In their Research Article (e202412397), Daniel Strand and co&#8208;workers describe a first, collective, synthesis of thiosilvatins, introducing methods and tactics to overcome stereochemical issues in dithiodiketopiperazine synthesis. The artwork depicts thiosilvatins emerging from and escaping an abyss of inaccessibility and structural ambiguity.

Dynamic boroxine linkers were incorporated into the mesoporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) PCN&#8208;333, which creates defects and expands pore sizes, enabling the encapsulation of enzymes larger than the intrinsic MOF pores. As reported by Xing Zhang, Shuai Yuan et&#8197;al in their Research Article (e202409951), this strategy facilitates the immobilization of glycoenzymes for synthesizing complex oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, demonstrating both high activity and enhanced enzyme stability.

         <title>A Smart Design of Non&#8208;Noble Catalysts for Sustainable Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper highlights a smart sustainable Ni@TiOx catalyst, Ni encapsulated in TiOx, for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), as reported by Gong and co&#8208;workers. The catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in PDH, achieving 94&#8201;% propylene selectivity and high stability. This design offers a cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional noble metal&#8208;based catalysts, with potential for broader industrial applications.







Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an important process for propylene synthesis, relies on expensive noble metals or highly toxic oxides as catalysts. In a recent publication, Gong and co&#8208;workers report a breakthrough discovery for PDH by introducing a sustainable catalyst composed of titanium oxide overlayers encapsulating nickel nanoparticles, termed Ni@TiOx. This innovative catalyst showcases exceptional performance in PDH, exhibiting high propylene selectivity and stability under industrially relevant conditions. The study elucidates the role of defective TiOx overlayers and the electronic promotional effect of subsurface Ni in enhancing catalytic activity, translating a traditional model catalyst system into a sustainable industrial catalyst for low&#8208;carbon energy and the chemical industry.

         <title>Carbonylation Reactions at Carbon&#8208;Centered Radicals with an Adjacent Heteroatom</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview describes the most recent advances in carbonylative transformations involving heteroatom adjacent carbon radicals, specifically including the heteroatoms oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), silicon (Si), sulfur (S), boron (B), fluorine (F), and chlorine (Cl). The reaction mechanisms are also described in detail.







Abstract
Heteroatoms are essential to living organisms and present in almost all molecules with medicinal usage. The catalytic functionalization at the carbon&#8208;centered radical with an adjacent heteroatom provides an effective way to value added moiety while retaining the unique physicochemical and pharmacological properties of heteroatoms, which can promote the development of pharmaceutical and fine chemical production. Carbonylative transformation was discovered nearly a century ago which is an efficient method for the synthesis of carbonyl&#8208;containing molecules with potent applications in both industry and academia. Despite numerous advances in new reaction development, carbonylative transformation involving adjacent heteroatom carbon radical remain a subject that deserves to be discussed. In this minireview, we systematically summarized and discussed the recent advances in carbonylative transformations involving carbon&#8208;centered radicals with an adjacent heteroatom, including oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), silicon (Si), sulfur (S), boron (B), fluorine (F), and chlorine (Cl). The related reaction mechanism was also discussed.

         <dc:description>
Sunlight has long been the primary energy source for our planet. This minireview highlights its importance and investigates the potential revolutionary impact of photocatalysis on Earth. It examines fundamental processes, including the formation of prebiotic molecules and the oxygen evolution reaction via water oxidation. Additionally, the review assesses various carbon and nitrogen&#8208;based complexes photocatalysts and their roles in driving chemical reactions. It further provides insights into possible evolutionary pathways for Earth, emphasizing the pivotal influence of carbon and nitrogen&#8208;based photocatalysts in the development of Earth.







Abstract
Sunlight has long served as primary energy source on our planet, shaping the behavior of living organisms. Extensive research has been dedicated to unraveling the evolutionary pathways involved. When the formation of Earth atmosphere, it primarily consisted of small gas molecules, which are considered crucial for the emergence of life. Recent demonstrations have shown that these molecules can also be transformed into semiconductors, with the potential to harness solar energy and catalyze chemical reactions as photocatalysts. Building upon this research, this minireview focuses on the potential revolutionary impact of photocatalysis on Earth. Initially, it examines key reactions, such as the formation of prebiotic molecules and the oxygen evolution reaction via water oxidation. Additionally, various C&#8722;N complexes in photocatalysts are explored, showcasing their roles in catalyzing chemical reactions. The conclusion and outlook provide a potential pathway for the evolution of Earth, shedding light on the significance of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts in development of Earth.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II AIEgens for Infectious Diseases Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>

Phototheranostics of infectious diseases by utilizing NIR&#8208;II AIEgens has been developed at a tremendous pace. This Minireview summarizes recent efforts in this area in terms of molecular design strategy and bioapplications, and discusses current challenges and promising prospects.







Abstract
Pathogenic infectious diseases have persistently posed significant threats to public health. Phototheranostics, which combines the functions of diagnostic imaging and therapy, presents an extremely promising solution to block the spread of pathogens as well as the outbreak of epidemics owing to its merits of a wide&#8208;spectrum of activity, high controllability, non&#8208;invasiveness, and difficult to acquire resistance. Among multifarious phototheranostic agents, second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) are notable by virtue of their deep penetration depth, excellent biocompatibility, balanced radiative and nonradiative decay and aggregation&#8208;enhanced theranostic performance, making them an ideal option for combating pathogens. This minireview provides a systematical summary of the latest advancements in NIR&#8208;II AIEgens with emphasis on the molecular design and nanoplatform formulation to fulfill high&#8208;efficiency in treating bacterial and viral pathogens, classified by disease models. Then, the current challenges, potential opportunities, and future research directions are presented to facilitate the further progress of this emerging field.

         <title>Recent Advances of Organic Cocrystals in Emerging Cutting&#8208;Edge Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines the recent advances of organic cocrystals in emerging cutting&#8208;edge properties and applications during the nearest five years including PTC, RTP, TADF, CPL, OSSLs, NIR sensing, photocatalysis, batteries, and stimuli responses, along with the structure&#8211;property relationship, limitations, prospects and some inspirations for future investigations.







Abstract
Organic cocrystals, representing one type of new functional materials, have gathered significant interest in various engineering areas. Owing to their diverse stacking modes, rich intermolecular interactions and abundant functional components, the physicochemical properties of organic cocrystals can be tailored to meet different requirements and exhibit novel characteristics. The past few years have witnessed the rapid development of organic cocrystals in both fundamental characteristics and various applications. Beyond the typical properties like ambipolarity, emission tuning ability, ferroelectricity, etc. that are previously well demonstrated, many novel, impressive and cutting&#8208;edge properties and applications of cocrystals are also emerged and advanced recently. Especially during the nearest five years, photothermal conversion, room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, thermally activated delay fluorescence, circularly polarized luminescence, organic solid&#8208;state lasers, near&#8208;infrared sensing, photocatalysis, batteries, and stimuli responses have been reported. In this review, these new properties are carefully summarized. Besides, some neoteric architecture and methodologies, such as host&#8211;guest structures and machine learning&#8208;based screening, are introduced. Finally, the potential future developments and expectations for organic cocrystals are discussed for further investigations on multiple functions and applications.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Boroxine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boroxine&#8208;based COFs including 3D COF&#8208;102 with high porosity, are now accessible by simple, efficient, and rapid mechanochemical synthesis, in a process amenable to in situ monitoring and multi&#8208;gram scale&#8208;up.







Abstract
We report a rapid, room&#8208;temperature mechanochemical synthesis of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;dimensional boroxine covalent organic frameworks (COFs), enabled by using trimethylboroxine as a dehydrating additive to overcome the hydrolytic sensitivity of boroxine&#8208;based COFs. The resulting COFs display high porosity and crystallinity, with COF&#8208;102 being the first example of a mechanochemically prepared 3D COF, exhibiting a surface area of ca. 2,500&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Mechanochemistry enabled a&gt;20&#8208;fold reduction in solvent use and ~100&#8208;fold reduction in reaction time compared with solvothermal methods, providing target COFs quantitatively with no additional work&#8208;up besides vacuum drying. Real&#8208;time Raman spectroscopy permitted the first quantitative kinetic analysis of COF mechanosynthesis, while transferring the reaction design to Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM) enabled synthesis of multi&#8208;gram amounts of the target COFs (tested up to 10&#8197;g).

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Aided Discovery of Low&#8208;Pt High Entropy Intermetallic Compounds for Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning strategy utilizing crystal graph convolutional neural networks is proposed for the rational design of low&#8208;Pt high entropy intermetallic compounds (PtM3 type, where M=transition metal) for the oxygen reduction reaction. The developed Pt(FeCoNiCu)3/C catalyst, featuring small nanoparticle size, exhibits exceptional mass and specific activity, along with significantly enhanced electrochemical stability.







Abstract
Advancing the design of cathode catalysts to significantly maximize platinum utilization and augment the longevity has emerged as a formidable challenge in the field of fuel cells. Herein, we rationally design a high entropy intermetallic compound (HEIC, Pt(FeCoNiCu)3) for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by an efficient machine learning stategy, where crystal graph convolutional neural networks are employed to expedite the multicomponent design. Based on a dataset generated from first&#8208;principles calculations, the model can achieve a high prediction accuracy with mean absolute errors of 0.003 for surface strain and 0.011&#8197;eV atom&#8722;1 for formation energy. In addition, we identify two chemical features (atomic size difference and mixing enthalpy) as new descriptors to explore advanced ORR catalysts. The carbon supported Pt(FeCoNiCu)3 catalyst with small particle size is successfully synthesized by a freeze&#8208;drying&#8208;annealing technology, and exhibits ultrahigh mass activity (4.09&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) and specific activity (7.92&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, The catalyst also shows significantly enhanced electrochemical stability which can be ascribed to the sluggish diffussion effect in the HEIC structure. Beyond offering a promising low&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts for fuel cell cathode, this work offers a new paradigm to rationally design advanced catalysts for energy storage and conversion devices.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Permeable Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotides for Exploration of Cellular Protein ADP&#8208;Ribosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a synthesis of cell&#8208;permeable NADs bearing fluorescent (TAMRA) or affinity (desthiobiotin) tag and their utility for ADP&#8208;ribosylation studies in living cells. Cell&#8208;permeability was achieved by modification with cholesterol or polyarginine. The probes were accepted by all tested PARP enzymes. The optimized desthiobiotin&#8208;labelled NAD+ was used for affinity enrichment and identification of proteins ADP&#8208;ribosylated upon oxidative stress.







Abstract
Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) greatly enhance the functional diversity of proteins, surpassing the number of gene&#8208;encoded variations. One intriguing PTM is ADP&#8208;ribosylation, which utilizes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as a substrate and is essential in cell signaling pathways regulating cellular responses. Here, we report the first cell&#8208;permeable NAD+ analogs and demonstrate their utility for investigating cellular ADP&#8208;ribosylation. Using a desthiobiotin&#8208;labelled analog for affinity enrichment of proteins that are ADP&#8208;ribosylated in living cells under oxidative stress, we identified protein targets associated with host&#8208;virus interactions, DNA damage and repair, protein biosynthesis, and ribosome biogenesis. Most of these targets have been noted in various literature sources, highlighting the potential of our probes for cellular ADP&#8208;ribosylome studies.

         <title>Selective Hydroboration of C&#8722;C Single Bonds without Transition&#8208;Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a general system for the hydroboration of C&#8722;C single bonds without transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Our strategy surpasses the transition&#8208;metal systems regarding chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities, substrate scopes, or yields. Mechanistic studies, DFT, and IBO calculations revealed a hydroborane&#8208;promoted C&#8722;C bond cleavage and a hydride shift reaction pathway. The key role of the carbonyl group and the nitrogen atom of the amide was disclosed.







Abstract
Selective hydroboration of C&#8722;C single bonds presents a fundamental challenge in the chemical industry. Previously, only catalytic systems utilizing precious metals Ir and Rh, in conjunction with N&#8208; and P&#8208; ligands, could achieve this, ensuring bond cleavage and selectivity. In sharp contrast, we discovered an unprecedented and general transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free system for the hydroboration of C&#8722;C single bonds. This methodology is transition&#8208;metal and ligand&#8208;free and surpasses the transition&#8208;metal systems regarding chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities, substrate versatility, or yields. In addition, our system tolerates various functional groups such as Ar&#8722;X (X=halides), heterocyclic rings, ketones, esters, amides, nitro, nitriles, and C=C double bonds, which are typically susceptible to hydroboration in the presence of transition metals. As a result, a diverse range of &#947;&#8208;boronated amines with varied structures and functions has been readily obtained. Experimental mechanistic studies, density functional theory (DFT), and intrinsic bond orbital (IBO) calculations unveiled a hydroborane&#8208;promoted C&#8722;C bond cleavage and hydride&#8208;shift reaction pathway. The carbonyl group of the amide suppresses dehydrogenation between the free N&#8722;H and hydroborane. The lone pair on the nitrogen of the amide facilitates the cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds in cyclopropanes.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Batteries Operating Stably under &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>

Lithium&#8208;based chemistries enables ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide redox couple with high concentration of 0.8&#8197;M to access a broad range of physicochemical and electrochemical properties at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C that represents the lowest operating temperature for ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide catholyte reported so far.







Abstract
Alkaline ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide&#8208;based flow batteries are well suited for energy storage because of their features of high electrochemical activity, good kinetics and low material cost. However, they suffer from low energy density and poor temperature adaptability. The ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide catholyte exhibits low solubility (~0.4&#8197;M at 25&#8201;&#176;C) in NaOH&#8208; or KOH&#8208;based supporting electrolyte and can easily form precipitates below room temperature. Here we report a lithium&#8208;based supporting electrolyte that significantly enhances the solubility of ferrocyanide. The use of LiOH intensifies the ion&#8208;dipole interaction between water molecules and solutes and cripples polarization among ferrocyanide ions. Thus, we have achieved a ferrocyanide&#8208;based catholyte of 1.7&#8197;M at 25&#8201;&#176;C and of 0.8&#8197;M at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C. A zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery based on the lithium&#8208;based supporting electrolyte demonstrates a steady charge energy of ~72&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1catholyte at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and maintains stable for ~4200&#8197;cycles (~4200&#8197;hours). Furthermore, it remains stable for ~800&#8197;cycles (~800&#8197;hours) at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C.

Di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetraacetoxysilanes reacted with silanols or silanediols under base&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free conditions to selectively generate acetoxy&#8208;containing di&#8208; and trisiloxanes. Cyclotetrasiloxanes and bicyclic pentasiloxanes with precisely constructed structures were obtained from successive one&#8208;pot reactions of a tetraacetoxysilane with various silanediols. The acetoxy&#8208;containing oligosiloxanes can serve as efficient surface&#8208;treatment agents and as new building blocks for heat&#8208;resistant materials.







Abstract
A highly selective cross&#8208;coupling reaction between Si&#8722;OAc (AcO=acetoxy) and Si&#8722;OH compounds that generates unsymmetrical and symmetrical oligosiloxanes concurrent with the release of acetic acid has been developed. The high selectivity arises from the reactivity difference that depends on the varying number of acetoxy groups present, thus facilitating a clean one&#8208;pot synthesis of oligosiloxanes. For instance, the reactions of di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, or tetraacetoxysilanes with silanols furnish acetoxy&#8208;containing di&#8208; and trisiloxanes in high yield. Two equivalents of tetraacetoxysilane can react with various silanediols to form 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexaacetoxytrisiloxanes, which subsequently react with a second molecule of a silanediol to selectively afford 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetraacetoxycyclotetrasiloxanes. The cyclotetrasiloxanes further react with a third molecule of silanediol to provide unprecedented bicyclic pentasiloxanes with acetoxy groups at the bridgehead silicon atoms. Applications of the acetoxy&#8208;containing products as efficient surface&#8208;treatment agents and new building blocks for highly heat&#8208;resistant materials are demonstrated.

         <title>The Trifluorooxygenate Anion [OF3]&#8722;: Spectroscopic Evidence for a Binary, Hypervalent Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic evidence is presented for the binary, hypervalent [OF3]&#8722;, formed in the reaction of OF2 with laser ablated MF (M=Li&#8722;Cs) under matrix&#8208;isolation conditions. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations show that the bonding in [OF3]&#8722; is similar to that in [F3]&#8722;.







Abstract
Experimental evidence for hypervalent compounds of second&#8208;row elements is still scarce in literature. Here, we present the first report of the long&#8208;sought binary, hypervalent trifluorooxygenate anion [OF3]&#8722;. It was isolated in solid Ne matrices under cryogenic conditions after reacting oxygen difluoride with free fluoride ions from laser ablation of alkali metal fluorides MF (M=Li&#8722;Cs). VSEPR theory and calculations at the CCSD(T) level predict a C2v&#8208;symmetric T&#8208;shape structure with one short and two long O&#8722;F bond lengths in [OF3]&#8722;. This is confirmed experimentally by FTIR spectroscopy in combination with isotopic labeling. Analysis of the natural local molecular orbitals shows the presence of one 2c&#8211;2e and one 3c&#8211;4e bond each. Natural resonance theory indicates the importance of the stability of [OF2]&#8901;&#8722; for the stability of [OF3]&#8722;. Although free [OF2]&#8901;&#8722; was not detected, the species MOF2 (M=Na&#8722;Cs) could be observed in the same experiments, which are best described as contact ion pairs of M+[OF2]&#8901;&#8722;.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Ketoamides by Sulfonium Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of chiral sulfinimines to keteniminium ions generated through electrophilic amide activation enables a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic sulfonium rearrangement to yield enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketoamides in a single step. The transformation proceeds with high enantio&#8208; and chemoselectivity as well as functional group tolerance, and&#8212;in contrast to imide&#8208;based chiral auxiliary approaches&#8212;directly delivers stereochemically stable amide products.







Abstract
The synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls remains a contemporary challenge in synthesis due to their tendency to undergo racemization via keto&#8208;enol tautomerization. Herein, we report a method to access enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketoamides by a chiral sulfinimine&#8208;mediated [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic sulfonium rearrangement. The transformation displays good chirality transfer, as well as excellent chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance. Diastereoselective reduction of the ketone moiety, also achievable in one&#8208;pot fashion, affords enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;hydroxyamides.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Activation at Chromium(I): An 11&#8208;Electron Complex Cleaving Dialkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A T&#8208;shaped 11&#8208;electron chromium(I) complex was stabilized by a (PNP) ligand and fully characterized. An sp&#8208;sp carbon&#8208;carbon bond scission in dialkynes was found to occur at the vacant in&#8208;plane coordination site through the formation of a dinuclear dimer.







Abstract
An 11&#8208;electron T&#8208;shaped chromium(I) complex was obtained by reduction of a PNP&#8208;supported chromium(II) iodide complex. Its d5 high&#8208;spin electronic structure was characterized employing paramagnetic NMR, EPR, UV/Vis and magnetic measurements (SQUID). The complex readily reacts with conjugated dialkynes to cleave the internal C&#8722;C bond, forming the respective acetylide complexes. Varying the alkyne substituents enabled the isolation and characterization of dinuclear dialkynedichromium intermediates which thermally convert to the products.

         <title>Are Hydroxyl Radicals Spontaneously Generated in Unactivated Water Droplets?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous reactions of water in either highly charged nanodrops formed by electrospray ionization, or less highly charged microdroplets formed by a vibrating mesh screen nebulizer were investigated. No evidence for ionized water dimer, nor oxidation products of the radical scavengers caffeine or melatonin was observed over a wide range of droplet size, net charge, and lifetime, indicating that water is stable at the surface of unactivated water droplets.







Abstract
Spontaneous ionization/breakup of water at the surface of aqueous droplets has been reported with evidence ranging from formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, indicated by ions at m/z 36 attributed to OH&#8901;&#8208;H3O+ or (H2O&#8208;OH2)+&#8901; as well as oxidation products of radical scavengers in mass spectra of water droplets formed by pneumatic nebulization. Here, aqueous droplets are formed both by nanoelectrospray, which produces highly charged nanodrops with initial diameters ~100&#8197;nm, and a vibrating mesh nebulizer, which produces 2&#8211;20&#8197;&#956;m droplets that are initially less highly charged. The lifetimes of these droplets range from 10s of &#956;s to 560&#8197;ms and the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratios span ~100&#8208;fold range. No ions at m/z 36 are detected with pure water, nor are significant oxidation products for the two radical scavengers that were previously reported to be formed in high abundance. These and other results indicate that prior conclusions about spontaneous hydroxyl radical formation in unactivated water droplets are not supported by the evidence and that water appears to be stable at droplet surfaces over a wide range of droplet size, charge and lifetime.

No ions at &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; 36 are detected with pure water, nor are significant oxidation products for the two radical scavengers that were previously reported to be formed in high abundance. These and other results indicate that prior conclusions about spontaneous hydroxyl radical formation in unactivated water droplets are not supported by the evidence and that water appears to be stable at droplet surfaces over a wide range of droplet size, charge and lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Automated Electrochemical Flow Platform to Accelerate Library Synthesis and Reaction Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated electrochemical flow platform for operator&#8208;free data generation is presented, leveraging slug&#8208;based reaction mixtures for low material consumption. This platform was employed in the context of library synthesis of 44 medicinal chemistry&#8208;relevant compounds. The platform was also used to optimize one previously unsuccessful target via DoE, leading to a 6&#8208;fold yield increment.







Abstract
Automated batch and flow setups are well&#8208;established for high throughput experimentation in both thermal chemistry and photochemistry. However, the development of automated electrochemical platforms is hindered by cell miniaturization challenges in batch and difficulties in designing effective single&#8208;pass flow systems. In order to address these issues, we have designed and implemented a new, slug&#8208;based automated electrochemical flow platform. This platform was successfully demonstrated for electrochemical C&#8722;N cross&#8208;couplings of E3 ligase binders with diverse amines (44 examples), which were subsequently transferred to a continuous&#8208;flow mode for confirmation and isolation, showing its applicability for medicinal chemistry purposes. To further validate the versatility of the platform, Design of Experiments (DoE) optimization was performed for an unsuccessful library target. This optimization process, fully automated by the platform, resulted in a remarkable 6&#8208;fold increase in reaction yield.

         <title>Collective Asymmetric Synthesis of Thiosilvatins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 51, December 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of the epidithiodiketopiperazine (&#8722;)&#8208;dithiosilvatin is reported along with a collective approach to ten related thiosilvatins. The described methods offer a practical blueprint for exploring the dithiotiketopiperazine pharmacophore with absolute and relative stereocontrol.







Abstract
Thiosilvatins are a family of biologically active sulfenylated diketopiperazine natural products. The first members were reported over 40&#8197;years ago, but total synthesis of a thiosilvatin has remained elusive. Here, we describe the first, collective, synthesis of the parent epidithiodiketopiperazine (&#8722;)&#8208;dithiosilvatin and ten related thiosilvatins. Several of the targets are structurally revised. A catalytic asymmetric sulfenylation of triketopiperazines efficiently controls absolute configuration at the thioaminal units. Further synthetic highlights include a diastereoconvergent installation of the requisite cis&#8208;orientation of the sulfur atoms and a tandem epidisulfide formation/O&#8208;prenylation under mild Mitsunobu conditions. The described methods for late&#8208;stage diversification of sensitive bis(methylthio)diketopiperazines offer a blueprint for systematically exploring this interesting 3D&#8208;pharmacophore in stereochemically pure form.
