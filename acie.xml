         <title>Simultaneous Activation of Bicyclobutanes and Indolyl Alcohols with HFIP: Access to Indole&#8208;Fused Bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concept of strain release to unleash unique reactivity that drives a wide range of synthetically valuable transformations has long intrigued chemists. Among the various strained systems, highly reactive bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) have recently emerged as versatile building blocks for constructing bicyclic scaffolds. Despite the existence of various activation pathways for BCBs, the use of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropan&#8208;2&#8208;ol (HFIP) to activate BCBs has not been realized so far. Herein, we report the first HFIP&#8208;promoted (3+3) annulation of BCBs with indolyl alcohols through the simultaneous activation of both partners, facilitating the metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free synthesis of indole&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes. Mechanistic studies reveal the role of HFIP in activating both components, and the reaction proceeds by an initial (3+2) annulation followed by a ring expansion/aromatization cascade.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly efficient and durable anode catalyst layer constructed with deformable hollow IrOx nanospheres in low&#8208;iridium PEM water electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reducing iridium packing density (gIr cm&#8722;3 electrode) represents a critical pathway to lower geometric Ir loading in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs), yet conventional approaches often cause performance issues of anode catalyst layer due to decreased structural stability and limited electron/mass transport efficiency. Here we present deformable hollow IrOx nanospheres (dh&#8208;IrOx) as a structural&#8208;engineered catalyst architecture that achieves an ultralow Ir packing density (20% of conventional IrO2&#160;electrodes) while maintaining high catalytic activity and durability at reduced Ir loadings. Scalable synthesis of dh&#8208;IrOx via a hard&#8208;template method&#8212;featuring precise SiO2 nanosphere templating and conformal Ir(OH)3 coating&#8212;enables batch production of tens of grams. Through cavity dimension and shell thickness optimization, dh&#8208;IrOx demonstrates excellent mechanical resilience to necessary electrode fabrication stresses, including high&#8208;shear agitation (10,000 rpm), ultrasonic processing (&gt; 20 kHz), and hot&#8208;pressing (130 &#176;C, 10 MPa). In anode catalyst layer the quasi&#8208;ordered close packing of dh&#8208;IrOx nanospheres simultaneously maximizes electrochemically active surface area, suppresses particle migration and agglomeration, and establishes percolated electron highways and rapid mass transport channels. The architectured anode delivers high PEMWE performance, while demonstrating excellent operational durability with &lt;1.5% voltage loss over 3,000 hours, surpassing the stability of IrO2 nanoparticle&#8208;based systems by a factor of at least 20.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Crystalline Covalent Organic Framework with Rich Redox Active Sites as Cathode Material for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been regarded as promising cathode materials for lithium batteries. However, they generally show low practical capacity. Here we report the design, preparation, and battery application of a highly crystalline two&#8208;dimensional truxenone&#8208;based COF (TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) with rich redox active sites, realizing a high practical capacity. In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the lithiation reaction proceeds successively on C=O and C=N groups of TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF. One ring of TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF can theoretically store 27 Li+ ions through two stages. Consequently, the highly crystalline TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF displays a high discharge capacity of 435 mAh g&#8211;1 when used as cathode material for lithium batteries. This work provides a facile approach to achieve COF electrode materials with high practical capacity for lithium batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;&#928;&#8208;Acceptor Self&#8208;adaptive Conjugated Perylene Derivative with Low Solubility, High Capacity, and Swift Ion Transport Kinetics for High performance Organic Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic perylene has been heralded as a promising candidate due to abundant structural diversity and tunability. However, its practical application is severely plagued by facile solubility, scarce redox&#8208;active sites, and andante kinetics behaviors. Herein, the perylene derivative (DPL), i.e. (1,6,7,12&#8208;tetrakis (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenoxy) perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride) conjugates with polyoxime ester (PO), and is further nested with N, P grafted hollow matrix with anchored Cu single atoms (Cu&#8208;NPC). Such Cu&#8208;NPC@DPL@PO with helically twisted donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) conjugate bridged by Cu atoms was evaluated for K+ storage. Based on extended &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugated structure, intensified interactions between PO and DPL, the minimal solubility of DPL is approached. Together with the core&#8208;shell solvation structure and compact cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) synergistically improves its long lifespan. The abundant stabled radical nitroxides, isocyano groups, and sp&#8208;C sites, contribute greatly to the capacity elevation. The twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A self&#8208;adaptive coordination conjugate (TSCC) significantly elevates the distortion towards for the easier tendency to flipping and vibrating and thus expedited kinetics behaviors. Consequently, Cu&#8208;NPC@DPL@PO reconciles the trade&#8208;off between fast&#8208;charging and long cycle stability involved 8&#8208;electron participation. This work exemplifies the importance of advanced design of the molecular scale engineering including modulated redox&#8208;active sites and high stability towards for fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;lifespan cell devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Observation of Cyclo&#8208;Pentazolate Anion Decomposition in a Tailored Molecular Trap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cyclo&#8208;pentazolate anion (cyclo&#8208;N5&#713;) has garnered significant attention as an all&#8208;nitrogen, five&#8208;membered&#8208;ring ion with a high&#8208;energy state and unique aromaticity. Typically, the free cyclo&#8208;N5&#713; anion is a highly unstable species, and its stabilization relies on strong interactions, such as a hydrogen bonding network or metal coordination. However, these interactions often compromise the independence of the anion, thus diminishing its aromaticity. Here, we present a molecular trap designed to encapsulate and isolate cyclo&#8208;N5&#713; through collective weak interactions. This approach utilizes a pre&#8208;positioned ion to subsequently displace the cyclo&#8208;N5&#713; anion into the cage cavity, addressing the challenge posed by the absence of strong&#8208;interaction&#8208;driven binding. This setup preserves the aromaticity of the anion to a significant extent, as predicted by computational studies. More importantly, the decomposition of free cyclo&#8208;N5&#713; within the microenvironment was directly recorded for the first time using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although research on the activation of C&#8208;H bonds in alkanes has been ongoing for decades, there are still few strategies that are both highly selective and suitable for industrial production. Here, we report a highly selective method for chlorination of terminal C&#8208;H bonds in alkanes by combining electrochemistry and organocatalysis. The specific cavity size of organic molecular catalysts ensures high regioselectivity, while the use of inexpensive and easily reusable graphite felt electrodes, simple electrochemical device and mild conditions enables the reaction to maintain good efficiency even when scaled up to kilogram level production.</dc:description>

         <title>A Structurally Simple Polymer Donor Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Minimal Energy Losses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy loss (Eloss) between optical energy gap (Eg) and open&#8208;circuit voltage (eVoc) sets efficiency upper limits for organic solar cells (OSCs). Nevertheless, further breaking the limit of Eloss in OSCs is challenging, especially via structurally simple materials in binary OSCs. Herein, a structurally simple non&#8208;halogenated polymer donor, namely PBDCT, is developed for realizing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs with record&#8208;breaking Eloss. The critical building block 3,4&#8208;dicyanothiophene with high electron affinity results in a deep&#8208;lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which effectively reduced radiative and nonradiative recombination energy losses in OSCs. Meanwhile, the finely tuned alkyl chains offer high crystallinity and low energetic disorder for the polymer, which enable efficient exciton dissociation at low energy loss. Moreover, bi&#8208;continuous crystalline fibrillary network structure is formed in the blend consisting of PBDCT due to the optimal aggregation property of the polymer, which is conducive to exciton diffusion and charge transport. Consequently, the OSC with a record&#8208;breaking low Eloss of 0.476 eV has been achieved, which thereby resulted in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.84%, the highest value achieved by non&#8208;halogenated polymer donors in binary OSCs to date. This work demonstrates the prospect in breaking the limit of Eloss and realizing efficiency breakthroughs in OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Localized Gel Electrolyte for Practical Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incompatible electrode/electrolyte interface often leads to dendrite growth, parasitic reactions and corrosion, posing significant challenges to the application of Zn anodes. Herein, we introduce a biomimetic antifreeze protein localized gel electrolyte (ALGE) with multifunctional capabilities to address these issues by combining electrolyte modification with interface optimization. ALGE modifies the Zn2+ solvation structure and the hydrogen&#8208;bond network adjacent to zinc anode, effectively suppressing hydrogen evolution. Additionally, ALGE promotes (002)Zn crystal plane&#8208;dominated deposition by protein&#8208;zinc surface interactions, enabling a long&#8208;range dendrite&#8208;free deposition. The absence of by&#8208;products and inhibited corrosion further highlights the practical potential of ALGE. Symmetric cells with ALGE&#8208;modified zinc demonstrate an impressive lifespan of 610h under a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a capacity of 10 mAh/cm2. The pouch cell integrating a manganese dioxide cathode and ALGE&#8208;modified Zn anode retains 85% of its capacity after 200 cycles at 1 A/g. This localized gel electrolyte strategy offers a practical and scalable approach to stabilizing Zn anodes for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Amphipathic Antimicrobial Peptides Illuminate a Reciprocal Relationship between Self&#8208;assembly and Cytolytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amphipathic character, encoded within polar sequence patterns of antimicrobial peptides, is a critical structural feature that influences membrane disruptive behavior. Similarly, polar sequence patterns induce self&#8208;assembly of amphipathic peptides, which results in the formation of ordered supramolecular structures. The relationship between self&#8208;assembly and membrane activity remains an open question of relevance for the development of effective antimicrobial peptides. Here, we report the structural investigation of a class of lytic peptides that self&#8208;assemble into filamentous nanomaterials. CryoEM analysis was employed to determine the structure of one of the filaments, which revealed that the peptides self&#8208;assembled into a bilayer nanotube in which the interaction between layers of amphipathic &#945;&#8208;helices was mediated through hydrophobic interactions. The relative stability of the filament peptide assemblies depended on the influence of sequence modifications on the helical conformation. Antimicrobial assays indicated that cytolytic activity was associated with dynamic disassociation of the filamentous assemblies under the assay conditions. In contrast, structural modifications of the peptides that stabilized the filaments abrogated lytic activity. These results illuminate a reciprocal relationship between self&#8208;assembly and antimicrobial activity in this class of amphipathic peptides and that reversible assembly was critical for observation of biological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Near&#8208;IR Phosphorescence Harvested by Intramolecular Through&#8208;Space Sensitization in Composite Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We studied a family of coordination compounds with short intramolecular spatial separation between an organic chromophore and a metal centre. The specific geometry was realized by means of anthracene&#8208;functionalized tertiary aryl phosphanes. Their silver and gold complexes (1, 2) operate as conventional fluorophores, with photophysical behavior defined by anthracene&#8208;localized allowed transitions. In contrast, bichromophoric species, containing phenyl bipyridine&#8208; (3, 5, 6, 8) or terpyridine&#8208; (4, 7) derived platinum(II) fragments, demonstrate fast intersystem crossing to the triplet state associated with the pincer metal component. Corroborated by theoretical results, we successfully demonstrated that the short intramolecular distance between the platinum constituent and the adjacent anthracene facilitates subsequent through&#8208;space triplet (T2, pincer fragment)&#8594;triplet (T1, anthracene) energy transfer. This process occurs at a rate of ~1011 s&#8211;1, surpassing the rates of T2&#8594;S0 relaxation. This prevents visible phosphorescence from the platinum(II) motifs but enables near&#8208;IR organic phosphorescence in the solid state, including dyes with very inefficient intersystem&#8208;crossing (ISC). Thus, the composite molecules 3&#8211;8 illustrate a feasible approach to the tunable sensitization of organic dyes and the design of low&#8208;energy triplet emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Disentangling Radiative and Non&#8208;Radiative Deactivation Pathways in CuI &#8208;Based TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temperature dependence of individual non&#8208;radiative decay rates of the lowest singlet and triplet states has been determined in a series of Cu(I) thermally activated delayed fluorescence compounds. Such temperature dependence is usually neglected, which is shown here to lead to significant errors in the determination of the singlet&#8208;triplet splittings.








Abstract
The analysis of thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters traditionally neglects the temperature dependence of the non&#8208;radiative singlet and triplet decay rates, which, for systems with quantum yields significantly departing from unity, unavoidably leads to inaccurate determination of the relevant photophysical parameters. Here we address this issue by performing a detailed photophysical study in three solid&#8208;state CuI complexes with the general formula [Cu(dmp)(PPh3)X] (X = Cl, Br, I). Decomposition of the measured temperature&#8208;dependent lifetimes &#964;(T) into their radiative and non&#8208;radiative contributions demonstrates a significant temperature dependence of the non&#8208;radiative rates, which leads to large deviations of the singlet&#8208;triplet gaps &#916;EST from those determined in the traditional way. Our detailed analysis further confirms that non&#8208;radiative parameters follow the energy gap law and that zero field splitting effects, which are unrecognizable in the bare &#964;(T) data, are governed by the heavy atom effect. Our analysis is supported by measurements of the decay of the prompt fluorescence which is dominated by kISC in the studied compounds.

&lt;p&gt;The temperature dependence of individual non-radiative decay rates of the lowest singlet and triplet states has been determined in a series of Cu(I) thermally activated delayed fluorescence compounds. Such temperature dependence is usually neglected, which is shown here to lead to significant errors in the determination of the singlet-triplet splittings.

         <title>Engineering Solvent&#8208;Coordinated Heterometallic&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Wide&#8208;Range Tuning of Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence toward Time&#8208;Resolved Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination solvent and second metal ion costrategy is firstly proposed to synthesize seven robust heterometallic&#8211;organic frameworks (HMOFs, ZnAe&#8208;sol) with ultralong room temperature phosphorescence. Theoretical calculations confirm this strategy can effectively regulate the excited state lifetime of ZnAe&#8208;sol. Based on the diverse afterglow times, the ZnAe&#8208;sol have been used for information encryption and anticounterfeit.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proven promising ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials for anticounterfeit due to their unique optical properties. However, it remains a major challenge to achieve the desired phosphorescent properties due to the limited regulatory methods and indistinct mechanism. Herein, the coordination solvent and second metal ion costrategy is firstly proposed to prepare seven robust heterometallic&#8211;organic frameworks (HMOFs) with two configurations, ZnMg/Ca&#8208;sol [sol&#160;=&#160;H2O, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMA), and formyldiethylamine (DEF)] and ZnSr/Ba&#8208;H2O, exhibiting different ultralong RTP. The tunable phosphorescence lifetimes within 14.5&#8211;195.4&#160;ms are achieved gradually by altering the type of alkaline earth metals, coordination solvent, and hydrogen&#8208;bonding in the HMOFs. Significantly, the theoretical calculations reveal that the promotion of spin&#8211;orbit coupling by heavy metals and the rigid constraint on the skeleton by solvent result in excellent balance between high phosphorescence quantum yield (&#1060;P) and long lifetime, especially for ZnSr&#8208;H2O (6.8%, 195.4&#160;ms). Depending on the wide&#8208;range tuning of ultralong RTP and great stability, the HMOFs are successfully applied in spatial&#8208;time resolved anticounterfeiting and multilevel information encryption. This work may provide a new approach to designing target phosphorescent materials while resolving the contradiction between high &#1060;P and long lifetime.

         <title>Yb3+&#8208;Induced Bright Ligand Up&#8208;Conversion Luminescence in 1D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Doping Yb3&#8314; ions into Ln coordination polymers (Ln&#8208;CPs) with the formula [Y2(FCA)6]n (FCA = 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid) has led to the preparation of 1D chain Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2&#8208;2xYb2x(FCA)6]n. Up&#8208;conversion luminescence (UCL) of the ligand is visibly observed in [Y0.6Yb1.4(FCA)6]n, with an absolute up&#8208;conversion quantum yield (UCQY) of 0.003&#160;%.








Abstract
Ln3+&#8208;induced ligand up&#8208;conversion luminescence (UCL) in coordination polymers (CPs) effectively overcomes the inherent limitations of conventional organic UCL mechanisms. However, current research on UCL in Ln&#8208;CPs has predominantly focused on the UCL of Ln3&#8314; ions themselves, while investigations into Ln3&#8314;&#8208;induced ligand UCL is overlooked in Ln&#8208;CPs. Herein, by doping Yb3&#8314; into the Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2(FCA)6]n 1) (FCA&#160;=&#160;9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid), Yb3+&#8208;doped 1D chain Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2&#8208;2xYb2x(FCA)6]n (x&#160;=&#160;0.2, 2) x&#160;=&#160;0.5, 3) x&#160;=&#160;0.7, 4) x&#160;=&#160;0.9, 5) x&#160;=&#160;1, 6) are prepared. Investigation of the UCL of FCA in these CPs reveals that Ln3&#8314;&#8208;induced ligand UCL are achieved for the first time. Notably, 4 not only displays bright UCL under both 10 and 15&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 excitation power of 980&#160;nm laser but also achieves an absolute UCQY of 0.003&#160;%, opening new avenues for the development of Ln&#8208;CPs as UCL materials.

         <title>Tailoring the Surface Curvature of the Supporting Carbon to Tune the d&#8208;Band Center of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Zinc&#8208;Urea&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The strain&#8208;induced change in the charge redistribution and binding strength of *O2&#8722;, *OOH and *OH of Fe SA/NhcC contributes to the enhanced catalytic ORR/UOR activity. Due to a lower equilibrium potential for the UOR and the superior catalytic activity of Fe SA/NhcC, the zinc&#8208;urea&#8208;air battery delivers a low charge voltage, high energy efficiency and long lifespan compared to conventional Zn&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
The catalytic activities of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are associated with the varying atomic interactions through its characteristic coordination geometry. Yet, modulation of the surface curvature of carbon acting as a supporting body has not been investigated. Herein, we report the superior catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and enhanced performance for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) of single Fe atoms anchored on a highly curved N&#8208;doped carbon dodecahedron with concave morphology (Fe SA/NhcC). Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopy disclose that the curvature of the carbon support helps to shorten the bond length of Fe&#8722;N, spatially redistributing the charges around the Fe and thereby lowering the d&#8208;band center toward optimal adsorption for oxygenated species. The Fe SA/NhcC catalyst displays an ultrahigh half&#8208;wave potential of 0.926&#8197;V for ORR and a small potential difference of 0.686&#8197;V for bifunctional ORR/UOR. A rechargeable Zn&#8208;urea&#8208;air battery with the Fe SA/NhcC cathode displays robust discharge durability, excellent cycling lifespan and higher energy efficiency compared to conventional Zn&#8208;air batteries. This work provides new insight into promoting the catalytic activity of SACs through varying the surface curvature of the supporting carbon, tailoring geometric configuration and electronic states of SACs.

Single NHC molecules carrying a thiophene (NHCiPr&#8722;T) and a bromo (NHCiPr&#8722;Br) substituent are investigated by STM on the Au(111) surface. Both derivatives adsorb flat on the surface and are bound to a gold adatom via the carbene. NHCiPr&#8722;T is anchored to Au(111) via the sulfur atom, thus allowing unidirectional rotation by voltage pulses with the STM tip. In comparison, NHCiPr&#8722;Br shows lateral displacement by voltage pulses.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes are highly effective ligands for anchoring functional organic molecules to metal surfaces and nanoparticles, facilitating the formation of self&#8208;assembled monolayers. However, their adsorption on surface is difficult to predict and control, and there is an ongoing debate on the geometry of NHC derivatives on gold surfaces and on the role of gold adatoms. We present two single molecules based on a benzimidazole NHC, one equipped with a thiophene substituent, and the other ending with a Br atom. By low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy we show that both molecules adsorb planar on Au(111) and are chiral on the surface. Our results indicate that in both cases a complex between NHC and a gold adatom is formed. Upon voltage pulses with the STM tip, both complexes move excited by inelastic tunneling electrons. For the derivative with thiophene, we observe a stepwise 60&#176; unidirectional rotation around the S atom. The direction of rotation is determined by both the chirality and the position of the applied pulse. On the contrary, the NHC derivative without thiophene moves laterally on the surface. Adsorption, binding to gold atoms, and motion are discussed with the support of density functional theory calculations and image simulations.

         <title>Selective Masking of Active Sites in Zinc Metal via Galvanic Replacement Reaction for Highly Reversible Ah&#8208;Level Zinc&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin, hydrophobic copper phosphate (CP) membrane passivates Zn anodes via galvanic replacement, selectively masking active Zn sites to curtail corrosion and dendrite growth. Achieving &gt;11000 cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a 1.2&#8209;Ah Zn||I2 pouch cell, this approach promises high&#8209;energy, long&#8209;life aqueous Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Zinc metal anodes suffer from severe dendrite formation and corrosion due to active Zn sites. Here, an ultrathin, hydrophobic copper phosphate (CP) membrane is introduced that selectively masks active Zn sites with electrochemically inactive copper through a galvanic replacement reaction (Zn0 + Cu2+&#160;=&#160;Cu0 + Zn2+). Copper is deliberately chosen for its higher redox potential (Cu2+/Cu0; +0.34&#160;V vs SHE), which effectively inhibits both the corrosion reaction (H+/H2; 0&#160;V vs SHE) and dendrite formation (Zn2+/Zn0; &#8722;0.76&#160;V vs SHE). In this way, the CP layer masks protrusions and grain boundaries on the zinc anode surface with inactive copper, blocking corrosion and dendritic growth, while its hydrophobic top layer reduces water activity at the interface. Benefiting from the deactivated anode surface, the resulting CP/Zn anode demonstrates exceptional stability, sustaining over 11,000 plating/stripping cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.98&#160;%. Moreover, a CP/Zn||I2 full cell with an N/P ratio of 1.85 achieves an energy density of 187&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1electrodes, while a 1.2&#8208;Ah pouch cell validates its practical feasibility. This work highlights the importance of designing suitable surface chemistry to protect the Zn metal anode and indicates promising applications in other metal anodes.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Coupled NIR Organic Hybrid Solar Cells Achieving an 84.2% Fill Factor and a 25.2% Efficiency: A Comprehensive Mechanistic Exploration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we eliminate the need for p&#8208;type polymers and achieve a remarkably higher FF (exceeding 84%), thanks to the excellent compatibility between our new NIR dye and PCBM, which enables ultrafast charge separation for the first time.








Abstract
The integration of organic dyes in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to utilize near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photons remains a challenge. In this study, a selenium&#8208;incorporated ortho&#8208;benzodipyrrole&#8208;based NIR dye CB&#8208;2Se was developed. CB&#8208;2Se, featuring a lower bandgap of 1.35&#160;eV, was blended with PCBM to form a bulk&#8208;heterojunction layer in PSCs for electron extraction and transport. Compared to Y6&#8208;16 acceptor, the removal of the Tz unit in CB&#8208;2Se suppresses self&#8208;aggregation, improving its compatibility with PCBM. A CB&#8208;2Se:PCBM&#8208;incorporated PSC achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.18% with a VOC of 1.164&#160;V, a JSC of 25.71&#160;mA/cm2, a Fill Factor of 84.15%, outperforming that of the PCBM&#8208;only reference device (24.35%) and the PCBM:Y6&#8208;16&#8208;based device (24.49%). The PCBM:CB&#8208;2Se layer enhanced the long&#8208;term stability of PSCs, retaining 88% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h under ambient air and thermal conditions. The photophysical interactions between NIR dyes and PSCs have been comprehensively investigated by using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Ultrafast exciton separation into free charges occurs within 200 femtoseconds at the interfaces between PCBM and CB&#8208;2Se. For the first time, a transfer of holes from CB&#8208;2Se back to the perovskite was detected, providing valuable insights into the charge dynamics of PSCs utilizing NIR dyes.

         <title>Assembly of Functionalized Organic Fragments via Reductive Activation and (Cross)&#8208;Coupling of C2H4, CO, CO2 and/or H2 Using a Magnesium&#8208;Dinitrogen Complex</title>

         <dc:description>
A dimagnesium/dipotassium complex of N2 acts as a &#8220;masked&#8221; source of a dimagnesium(I) diradical in formal reductive coupling and cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving various combinations of the simple gaseous small molecules, C2H4, CO, CO2, and H2. A range of more complex &#8220;value&#8208;added&#8221; organic fragments have been accessed from these processes.








Abstract
Reactions of 1,2&#8208;dimagnesioethane compound [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;C2H4)] (TCHPNON = 4,5&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene), formed by the two&#8208;electron reduction of ethene with a dimagnesium/dipotassium complex of reduced N2, viz. [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)], with CO and CO2 have been explored. In the case of the reaction with CO, cross&#8208;coupling of the reduced ethene fragment with two molecules of CO gave a heterobimetallic complex of the parent cyclobutenediolate dianion, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O2C4H4)], which when exposed to THF gave adduct [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O2C4H4)(THF)]. Treating [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;C2H4)] with CO2 led to the insertion of CO2 into both Mg&#9472;C bonds and all Mg&#9472;N bonds, yielding a magnesium succinate complex, [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C4H4)], in which the diamide ligands have been converted to xanthene bridged dicarbamates. The reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] with CO2, proceeded via reductive coupling of the heterocumulene to give the oxalate dianion, in addition to the insertion of CO2 into all Mg&#9472;N bonds of the magnesium&#8208;dinitrogen complex, forming dimeric [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C2)]2. When treated with THF this yields monomeric [{K(THF)(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg(THF)}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C2)]. Related chemistry results from the reaction of a dianionic magnesium(I) compound with CO2. In contrast, C&#9472;C bond formation was not observed in the reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] with a CO2 analog, i.e., the carbodiimide CyNCNCy (Cy = cyclohexyl). Instead, H abstraction by a proposed radical intermediate gave polymeric formamidinate complex [K(TCHPNON)Mg{(CyN)2CH}]&#8734;. Reaction of CO2 with the magnesium hydride complex [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(&#956;&#8208;H)}2] gave the unusual trimeric magnesium formate complex [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;CO2)Mg}(&#956;&#8208;O2CH)]3 in which CO2 has inserted into only one Mg&#9472;N bond of each TCHPNON ligand. This study highlights the capacity of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] to act as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in reductive coupling or cross&#8208;coupling of the simple gaseous reagents, C2H4, CO, CO2 and H2, to give value&#8208;added organic fragments.

Treating [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)] with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; led to the insertion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into both Mg&#9472;C bonds and all Mg&#9472;N bonds, yielding a magnesium succinate complex, [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)], in which the diamide ligands have been converted to xanthene bridged dicarbamates. The reaction of [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, proceeded via reductive coupling of the heterocumulene to give the oxalate dianion, in addition to the insertion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into all Mg&#9472;N bonds of the magnesium-dinitrogen complex, forming dimeric [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. When treated with THF this yields monomeric [{K(THF)(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)Mg(THF)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]. Related chemistry results from the reaction of a dianionic magnesium(I) compound with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In contrast, C&#9472;C bond formation was not observed in the reaction of [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] with a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; analog, i.e., the carbodiimide CyNCNCy (Cy = cyclohexyl). Instead, H abstraction by a proposed radical intermediate gave polymeric formamidinate complex [K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg{(CyN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH}]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt;. Reaction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the magnesium hydride complex [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg(&#956;-H)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] gave the unusual trimeric magnesium formate complex [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Mg}(&#956;-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH)]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in which CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has inserted into only one Mg&#9472;N bond of each &lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON ligand. This study highlights the capacity of [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] to act as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in reductive coupling or cross-coupling of the simple gaseous reagents, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to give value-added organic fragments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) for Next Generation Anion Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) AEM with pendant piperidinium structures are effectively designed and synthesized, laying the foundation for the development of next&#8208;generation AEMs for applications in highly stable AEM&#8208;WEs.








Abstract
Terawatt&#8208;scale hydrogen production using anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs) requires the development of facilely prepared, alkali&#8208;stable, and high&#8208;performance anion exchange membranes (AEMs). State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polyarylpiperidinium AEMs fail to match the alkaline stability of piperidinium due to conformational deformation caused by the stiff cardo structure. Herein, polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) AEM with pendant structure is constructed by utilizing 4&#8208;formylpiperidine as a functional monomer. The inclusion of an aldehyde group in the synthesis enhances polymerization reactivity, reduces the amount of superacid required, and ensures that the piperidinium is suspended from the ether&#8208;free polymer backbone. The accelerated aging analysis demonstrates that the pendant structure of piperidinium effectively suppresses the Hofmann elimination, resulting in PAMP AEM with exceptional alkali stability, surpassing that of the commercial PiperION&#8208;A40. Most importantly, when assembled with non&#8208;noble metal OER/HER catalysts, the related AEM&#8208;WE achieves a remarkably high transient current density of 7.35 A cm&#8722;2 (@2&#160;V, 80&#160;&#176;C, 1&#160;m KOH). Moreover, the AEM&#8208;WE can operate stably at industrial current density over 1500&#160;h (&#8776;1.70&#160;V at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Concurrent Folding and Fluorescent Functionalization of Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles via Heterogeneous Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneous photochemistry achieves single&#8208;chain polymer folding alongside concurrent fluorescent functionalization. Amphiphilic heterograft random copolymers pre&#8208;fold into hetero&#8208;aggregates, creating distinct domains that enable two concurrent photochemical processes: intrachain crosslinking via photodimerization in aggregated domains, and fluorescent functionalization via photocyclization to form a green fluorophore in dispersed regions.








Abstract
The controlled folding of synthetic polymers, mimicking the complex behaviors of biomacromolecules, offers the potential to create sophisticated nanostructures with diverse functionalities. Of great significance is the integration of functionalization directly with chain folding, especially through the incorporation of artificial elements not found in nature, which allows unprecedented flexibility in materials design. However, this approach faces significant synthetic challenges, owing to the intricate integration of multiple chemical processes within a single chain. Here, a heterogeneous photochemistry strategy is presented to achieve single&#8208;chain polymer folding alongside concurrent fluorescent functionalization, inspired by the stepwise folding mechanism of green fluorescent protein. This method involves pre&#8208;folding amphiphilic heterograft random copolymers in water, which facilitates heterogeneous aggregation into distinct domains within single&#8208;particle nanostructures, including closely aggregated and molecularly dispersed regions. By employing spatial organization&#8208;dependent photochemical reactivity of cyanostilbene moieties, two concurrent processes are enabled: intrachain crosslinking via photodimerization in aggregated domains and fluorescent functionalization via photocyclization to form a green fluorophore in dispersed regions. Additionally, the incorporation of fluorescent dyes via intrachain excitation energy transfer allows for the modulation of emission properties, extending from green to red, and even including white light, making them promising candidates for bioimaging and related applications.

         <dc:description>
We report that an air&#8208;stable &#8220;naked nickel&#8221;, Ni(4&#8208;CF3stb)3, can efficiently catalyze heteroaryl&#8211;heteroaryl Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling (SMC) reactions in the absence of exogenous ligands. This protocol permits the construction of &gt;15 different heterobiaryls containing multiple Lewis basic heteroatoms from a broad set of 6&#8208;membered heteroaryl bromides with 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered heterocyclic B&#8208;nucleophiles. 








Abstract
In this article, we report that the air&#8208;stable &#8220;naked nickel&#8221;, [Ni(4&#8208;CF3stb)3], is a competent catalyst in the catalytic Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction (SMC) between heteroaryl bromides and heteroaromatic boron&#8208;based nucleophiles. The catalytic system is characterized by its ability to avoid decomposition or deactivation in the presence of multiple Lewis basic sites. The protocol permits the formation of C&#8210;C bonds between two heteroaryl moieties in the absence of complex exogenous ligands, thus minimizing screening procedures and simplifying reaction setups. This method accommodates combinations of distinct 6&#8208;membered heteroaryl bromides and 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered heterocyclic B&#8208;based nucleophiles.

         <title>Uniform Ion Flow Effect of Dynamic Electrostatic Shielding Layer for Facilitating Homogeneous Nucleation and Deposition on Aluminum Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study optimizes the Al anode/electrolyte interface by incorporating anionic surfactants (sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate) to achieve stable Al anode. The alkyl chains preferentially adsorb on Al surface, forming dense adsorption layer that mitigates corrosion from the electrolyte. Additionally, &#9472;SO3 and phenyl rings provide electrostatic shielding layer with moderately electronegative that regulates ion migration. The uniform ion flow effect facilitates the uniform nucleation and deposition of Al, suppressing dendritic growth and tip effects, thereby enhancing the cycling stability and lifespan of the rechargeable aluminum battery.








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) present considerable potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, particularly within power stations. Nonetheless, their operational lifespan and commercialization are hindered by issues like Al anode dendrite formation and electrolyte corrosion. To address the aforementioned issues, a stabilizer has been proposed to enhance the electrolyte/anode interface. Experimental and computational simulation results indicate that the surface tension of the SDBS alkyl chain facilitates its preferential adsorption onto the electrode surface, thereby establishing a protective layer that mitigates the corrosion of the chloroaluminate ionic liquid (ILs). Additionally, the suitable electronegativity of the phenyl&#8208;SO3 group generates an electrostatic shielding effect that not only dynamically regulates ion flow but also equilibrates the nucleation and deposition velocity, ultimately promoting the stable planar Al deposition. Consequently, the SDBS&#8208;modified Al//Al symmetric battery demonstrates stable cycling for 500 and 1000&#160;h under high current density (5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and large area capacity (5&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2), respectively. The Al//flake graphite full battery achieves reversible capacity of 90.01&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, significantly improving capacity retention. This study also further explores the effect of additive functional groups and ions on Al anodes, offering insights for the rational design of RABs electrolytes.

Additionally, the suitable electronegativity of the phenyl-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group generates an electrostatic shielding effect that not only dynamically regulates ion flow but also equilibrates the nucleation and deposition velocity, ultimately promoting the stable planar Al deposition. Consequently, the SDBS-modified Al//Al symmetric battery demonstrates stable cycling for 500 and 1000&#160;h under high current density (5&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and large area capacity (5&#160;mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively. The Al//flake graphite full battery achieves reversible capacity of 90.01&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000 cycles at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, significantly improving capacity retention. This study also further explores the effect of additive functional groups and ions on Al anodes, offering insights for the rational design of RABs electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combining Two Mechanistically Distinct Reactions from a Single Iron Complex: A Tandem Approach to Thermally Stable and Recyclable Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;based catalytic system can act as an efficient and selective tandem catalyst for the production of poly(silylether)s, followed by the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lactide, providing direct access to novel thermally stable copolymers. The study emphasizes the potential for chemical recycling, making these materials environmentally friendly and suitable for various applications.








Abstract
A shift from petrochemical feedstocks to renewable resources has the potential to address some of the environmental concerns associated with petrochemical extraction, thereby making the production of plastics a sustainable process. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of selective techniques for the conversion of abundant renewable feedstocks into environmentally friendly polymers. We present a one&#8208;pot iron&#8208;based catalytic system, which is active, efficient, and selective under mild conditions for producing of renewable copolymers. We demonstrate that this system can function as a tandem catalyst for the production of poly(silylether)s (PSEs), followed by the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lactide. This effective approach provides direct access to novel thermally stable copolymers. Furthermore, we detail the quantitative chemical recycling of such copolymers, underscoring their potential as new environmentally friendly materials.

         <title>La3ZrGa5O14: Band&#8208;Inversion Strategy in Topology&#8208;Protected Octahedron for Large Nonlinear Response and Wide Bandgap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy involving electron band inversion to enhance the SHG response of LGS while preserving its advantageous wide bandgap. The highly symmetrical ZrO6 structure in the LGZr framework effectively mitigates the bandgap reduction typically associated with cation energy level splitting. This distinctive electronic structure of the Zr4+ facilitates a promising pathway to enhance the SHG response without compromising its essential bandgap characteristics. LGZr crystal exhibits an impressive bandgap of 5.16&#160;eV, a high LDT, a large SHG response, and an extended infrared absorption edge. Our innovative band&#8208;inversion approach not only elucidates the underlying mechanisms but also paves the way for designing new IR NLO crystals.








Abstract
The contradictory relationship between band gaps and the second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response constitutes a formidable challenge in the rational design of infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals. In oxide&#8208;based crystals, the incorporation of strongly distorted octahedra containing d&#176; cations as central elements are a common approach to enhance SHG responses, while inadvertently leading to a significant decrease in band gaps due to the unfavorable energy level splitting. In this study, an innovative &#8220;4d/5s electron band&#8208;inversion&#8221; strategy is introduced to enhance SHG response while preserving a wide band gap within the octahedron&#8208;symmetry&#8208;protected langasite structure. A novel high&#8208;performance IR NLO crystal, La3ZrGa5O14 (LGZr) is successfully synthesized, where the unoccupied 4d orbitals of the Zr4+ cation underwent a transition from the valence band to the bottom of the conduction band, and the ZrO6 octahedra exhibited minimal distortion. Consequently, LGZr exhibited the largest SHG response observed to date (reaching up to 2.4 &#215; La3Nb0.5Ga5.5O14) and the broadest band gap (5.16&#160;eV) within the langasite family. Furthermore, LGZr is revealed with a remarkable laser damage threshold (1.66&#160;GW/&#8764;cm2) and broad IR transmission capabilities (&#8764;7.8&#160;&#181;m) and supported the growth of centimeter&#8208;sized single crystal. The &#8220;band&#8208;inversion strategy&#8221; offers significant advantages to realize high&#8208;performance IR NLO crystals.

         <title>Highly Stereoselective 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;Xylosylation Enabled by Reagent Modulation, Remote Participation, and Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Synergistic Effects</title>

         <dc:description>
The highly stereoselective 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation has been achieved via synergistic combinations of reagent modulation, remote participation, and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects. A variety of &#945;&#8208;xylosides motifs have been effectively prepared by this 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation protocol, including hemicellulose xyloglucan, xyloglucosyl trisaccharide motif from mammalian cells, core M3 matriglycan motif, and even &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;xylosides up to 12&#8208;mer.








Abstract
Stereoselective constructions of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic bonds are long&#8208;standing challenges in chemical synthesis. In particular, achieving highly stereoselective 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation remains a difficult task in carbohydrates chemistry. Here, we report that highly stereoselective 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation could be achieved via synergistic combinations of reagent modulation, remote participation, and electron&#8208;withdrawing effects. A variety of &#945;&#8208;xylosides motifs have been effectively prepared by this 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation protocol, including hemicellulose xyloglucan, xyloglucosyl trisaccharide motif from mammalian cells, core M3 matriglycan motif, and even &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;xylosides up to 12&#8208;mer. Furthermore, DFT calculations provided the origins of this stereoselective and synergistic 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;xylosylation through SN1 and SN2 pathways.

         <title>Atropisomerism in Triarylboranes: Lewis Base Assisted Rotation at C&#8722;B Stereogenic Axis in Asymmetrical Boron Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From decades to minutes: regulation of the rotation speed at the C&#8722;B chirality axis by peri&#8208;substituents and Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions in unprecedented triarylboranes with a C&#8722;B stereogenic axis enabled to reach atropostable and enantiopure triarylboranes.







Abstract
The synthesis, properties and structural requirements for atropisomerism at the C&#8722;B bond in boron Lewis acids such as triarylboranes have been understudied so far. We report the first series of atropisomeric triarylboranes constituted of a naphthyl rotor and a dihydro&#8208;9&#8208;bora&#8208;anthracenyl stator subunits, connected by a C&#8722;B stereogenic axis. Through systematic crystallographic, kinetic, photophysical and quantum chemical studies, the mechanisms, rates and barriers of diastereomerization and enantiomerization were determined. The orthogonal arrangement between the naphthyl and the dihydro&#8208;9&#8208;bora&#8208;anthracenyl scaffold moiety hamper the rotation of these two moieties around their Csp2&#8722;B bonds, enabling chiral resolution leading to enantiopure triarylboranes of high configurational stability. Furthermore, we fully elucidated a Lewis&#8208;base assisted pathway controlling the rotation speed at the C&#8722;B stereogenic axis, enabling the atropisomerical behavior of these triarylboranes be controlled by a Lewis base.

A commercially available heterogeneous Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst supports efficient aerobic oxidation of hydroquinone to benzoquinone, outperforming homogeneous molecular cobalt and iron cocatalysts that have been used to support redox cascades. This Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/benzoquinone cocatalyst system supports the highly efficient oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes with 0.05&#8197;mol&#8201;% of a homogeneous Ir catalyst in organic solvent.







Abstract
Benzoquinone (BQ) is commonly used as a cocatalyst in multi&#8208;component catalyst systems for aerobic oxidation of organic molecules. Such methods often proceed by a redox cascade in which a secondary catalyst supports aerobic oxidation of hydroquinone (HQ) to BQ. The present study shows that a commercially available non&#8208;precious metal heterogeneous catalyst, PAJ&#8208;Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C, is much more efficient than established homogeneous catalysts for aerobic oxidation of HQ to BQ, and this improved reactivity is crucial to support aerobic oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes with the homogeneous iridium catalyst, [Ir(trop2DAD]OTf (trop2DAD=N,N&#8208;bis(5&#8208;H&#8208;dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptene&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene). The combination of this heterogeneous/homogeneous catalyst system operates with Ir catalyst loadings as low as 0.05&#8197;mol&#8201;% and turnover frequencies &#8805;350&#8197;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Front Cover: Control of Interlocking Mode in Pd4L8 Cage Catenanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dimerization of a lantern&#8208;shaped Pd2L4 coordination cage yields two Pd4L8 catenanes with distinct topologies: a &#8220;classic&#8221; quadruply interlocked D4&#8208;symmetric structure and a newly discovered triply linked motif with C2h symmetry. The latter is stabilized by extensive non&#8208;covalent interligand contacts, opening a strategy to control the degree of mechanical interlocking, tuned by temperature and anion exchange, as reported by Guido H. Clever et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202423810).

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Machine Learning in Co&#8208;crystal Prediction by a Novel Approach Integrating Molecular Thermodynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;crystal engineering is of interest for many applications in pharmaceutical, chemistry and material fields, but rational design of co&#8208;crystals is still challenging. Although artificial intelligence has brought major changes in the decision&#8208;making process for materials design, yet limitations in generalization and mechanistic understanding remain. Herein, we sought to improve prediction of co&#8208;crystal by combining mechanistic thermodynamic modeling with machine learning. We constructed a brand&#8208;new co&#8208;crystal database, integrating drug, coformer and reaction solvent information. By incorporating various thermodynamic models, the predictive performance was significantly enhanced. Benefiting from the complementarity of thermodynamic mechanisms and structural descriptors, the model coupling three thermodynamic models achieved optimal predictive performance. The model was rigorously validated against five benchmark models using challenging independent test sets, showcasing superior performance in both coformer and reaction solvent predicting with accuracy over 90%. Further, we employed SHAP analysis for model interpretation, suggesting that thermodynamic mechanisms are prominent in model's decision&#8208;making. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies on ketoconazole validated the model's efficacy in identifying coformers/solvents, demonstrating its potential in practical application. Overall, our work enhanced the understanding of co&#8208;crystallization, and shed light on the strategy that integrates mechanistic insights with data&#8208;driven models to accelerate the creation of new co&#8208;crystals, as well as various functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Immune Responses through Modulation of Innate Cell Microenvironments in Lymph Nodes with Virus&#8208;Mimetic Vaccines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanovaccines hold significant&#160;promise for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. However, the efficacy of many nanovaccines is often limited&#160;by inadequate stimulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses.&#160;Herein, we explore a rational vaccine strategy aimed at modulating innate cell microenvironments within lymph nodes (LNs) to&#160;enhance&#160;the generation of effective immune responses. Inspired by the structure and natural infection&#160;process&#160;of viruses, we developed a versatile&#160;antigen and adjuvant co&#8208;delivery platform, termed virus&#8208;mimetic vaccines&#160;(VMVs). Specifically, polyarginine&#8208;tagged antigens were&#160;noncovalently assembled&#160;onto nucleic acid nanogels containing&#160;cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotide via a salt&#8208;bridge zipper&#160;mechanism,&#160;which can activate&#160;Toll&#8208;like receptor 9. Upon intramuscular immunization,&#160;VMVs effectively drained into the LNs, recruiting and activating multiple innate cells, including CD8+&#160;dendritic cells&#160;(DCs),&#160;CD103+&#160;DCs,&#160;macrophages, plasmacytoid&#160;DCs, and neutrophils. This activation modulates the innate cell microenvironments and relocates antigen&#8208;presenting cells within LNs, optimizing adaptive immune responses. VMVs induced&#160;a robust antigen&#8208;specific immune response, characterized by high levels of neutralizing antibodies, augmented memory T cell activity, and enhanced development of germinal center B cells. Together, our findings&#160;demonstrate that dynamic modulation of innate cell microenvironments by VMVs&#160;leads to optimized generation of both humoral and cellular&#160;immunity against infectious diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Non&#8208;Radiative Decay of Boron Difluoride&#160;Formazanate Dendrimers for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of small molecular dyes excitable in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000~1700 nm) is crucial for deep&#8208;tissue penetration and maximum permissible exposure in cancer photothermal theranostics. Herein, we employed a dendrimer engineering strategy to develop the boron difluoride formazanate (BDF) dye BDF&#8208;8OMe for photoacoustic imaging&#8208;mediated NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy. BDF&#8208;8OMe, characterized by an increased molecular branching degree and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, exhibited broad absorbance peaked at 905 nm, with the absorption tail extending to 1300 nm. Additionally, reorganization energy calculation, molecular dynamics simulation, and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the multiple identical dendritic units of BDF&#8208;8OMe significantly enhanced the molecular motions, enabling the nanoparticles (NPs) to rapidly release 94.4% of the excited state energy through non&#8208;radiative decay at a rate of 11.7 ps. Under 1064 nm photoirradiation, BDF&#8208;8OMe NPs achieved a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 62.5%, facilitating NIR&#8208;II photothermal theranostics. This work highlights the potential of the dendrimer&#8208;building strategy in developing NIR&#8208;II excitable small molecular dyes for efficient photothermal theranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>A Site&#8208;Specific Photo&#8208;Crosslinking Proteomics Approach Provides Insights into Non&#8208;Canonical Pyroptotic Caspase&#8208;4 Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inflammatory caspases (1/4/5) are key effectors in the process of pyroptosis by cleaving and activating the pore&#8208;forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD). Unlike other caspases whose substrates have been well characterized, the substrates for caspase&#8208;4, which mediate non&#8208;canonical pyroptosis, remain poorly understood. Here, we combined non&#8208;canonical amino acids, photo&#8208;crosslinking, and proteomics to profile caspase&#8208;4 substrates, enabling the capture of transient protein interactions with activated caspase&#8208;4. A set of new substrates were identified by photo&#8208;crosslinking mass spectrometry, revealing the signaling pathway and biological process affected by pyroptosis. Notably, we found that AKT1 is cleaved at D108, which removes its autoinhibition and membrane localization domain, resulting in the release of activated AKT1. Our results also showed the precursor of caspase&#8208;5/12 could be cleaved by caspase&#8208;4 to form the p20/p10 active conformation, uncovering a previously unrecognized pyroptotic caspase cascade. Overall, this study presents an approach for identifying caspase&#8208;4 substrates and offers further understanding of non&#8208;canonical pyroptosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Indirect Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydrofunctionalization of Terminal Alkenes via an Alkenyl Thianthrenium Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of terminal, unactivated olefins is an evergreen synthetic challenge in organic chemistry. Several direct and indirect anti&#8208;Markovnikov methods have been developed, ranging from the classical hydroboration/oxidation protocol to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoredox catalytic, transition metal complex&#8208;catalyzed and enzymatic procedures. Despite the ever&#8208;expanding suite of synthetic capabilities, these methods still have limited generality in their substrate scope, especially with nucleophiles. Here, we show that terminal, unactivated olefins can be transformed into anti&#8208;Markovnikov products via an alkenyl thianthrenium intermediate that undergoes sequential hydride and nucleophile addition. This method's strategic advantage lies in its ability to utilize a diverse array of oxidatively sensitive nucleophiles as reaction partners. This is accomplished through a mechanistically distinct, two&#8208;stage dication pool anti&#8208;Markovnikov approach, where a separate oxidative olefin activation by thianthrenation is followed by the selective generation of a reactive alkyl thianthrenium salt.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing Kinetic Features of a Macrocyclization Reaction using Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Augmented Data</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We developed a method to reveal the kinetic features of macrocyclization using machine&#8208;learning&#8208;augmented data. Thirty&#8208;six experimental yield datasets were expanded to two hundred datasets through machine learning, enabling kinetic analyses of concentration&#8208;dependent yields. This augmented data allowed the chemistry underlying the predictive black box to be elucidated, providing quantitative insights such as rate constants and effective molarity through least&#8208;squares fitting of differential rate equations. These quantitative measures offered physicochemical explanations for the optimal conditions identified by the machine learning. Additionally, linear relationships between effective molarity and strain energy were found, highlighting key aspects of oligomeric macrocyclization via nickel&#8208;mediated coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Electrochemical Upgrading of Biomass and CO&#8322;&#160;Utilization Using Fe/Ni&#8208;Derived Carbon Nanotubes Derived from CO&#8322;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fossil fuel consumption has caused petroleum shortages and increased carbon emissions, thus, utilizing renewable resources in biorefineries for biomass&#8208;derived chemical synthesis is promising. Among them, 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is a key alternative to terephthalic acid (PTA) for sustainable polyester production. In this work, we demonstrate an efficient approach for the simultaneous production of FDCA while utilizing CO&#8322;&#160;via an electrochemical approach. Complete electrooxidation of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) at the anode yields FDCA, while CO&#8322;&#160;reduction at the cathode produces valuable compounds such as carbon monoxide (CO). This concurrent HMF electrooxidation and CO&#8322;electroreduction strategy enables high&#8208;value chemical production at mild conditions. In addition, we developed efficient&#160;single&#160;catalysts, FeNi metals supported on CO&#8322;&#8208;derived multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes deposited on nickel foam (FeNiCNTs/NF)&#160;as both the anode and the cathode for HMF oxidation and CO2&#160;reduction, respectively. Remarkably, faradaic efficiencies reached 99.60% for FDCA (FEFDCA) at the anode and 96.25% for CO (FECO) at the cathode. This study highlights the effective use of synthesized non&#8208;noble metals supported on CO&#8322;&#8208;derived CNTs for integrated biorefinery and CO&#8322;&#160;utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Spiro&#8208;Driven Ferroelectric Coordination Polymer Exhibiting Distinct Phase Transitions under Thermal and Pressure Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controllable strategies for the design of molecular ferroelectrics have been actively pursued in recent years due to their promising applications in modern electronic devices. In this work, we present a spiro&#8208;driven approach for the design of a new class of molecular ferroelectrics. Using 2&#8208;morpholinoethanol (MEO) as a bidentate chelating ligand and the SCN&#8722; anion as a bridging co&#8208;ligand, we obtained a neutral chain&#8208;like ferroelectric coordination polymer, [Cd(MEO)(SCN)2]. Interestingly, it undergoes both a thermal&#8208;induced phase transition, driven by ring&#8208;conformational flipping of the spiro&#8208;like [Cd(MEO)] fragment, and a pressure&#8208;induced transition, triggered by significant deformation of the spring&#8208;like [Cd(SCN)2]&#8734; helical chain. Unlike most previously reported ferroelectric coordination polymers, which often rely on organic cationic guests, this work introduces a new avenue for designing neutral ferroelectric coordination polymers. Overall, the spiro&#8208;driven strategy provides valuable insights and a novel structural motif for the development of advanced molecular ferroelectrics.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of short peptides activates specific ER&#8208;phagy and induces pyroptosis for enhanced tumor immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing specific endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;autophagy (ER&#8208;phagy) inducers is highly desirable for discovering new ER&#8208;phagy receptors, elucidating the detailed ER&#8208;phagy mechanism and potential cancer immunotherapy. However, most of the current ER&#8208;phagy&#8208;inducing methods cause non&#8208;selective autophagy of other organelles. In this work, we report the design and synthesis of simple and stable short peptides (D&#8208;FFxFFs) that could specifically trigger ER&#8208;phagy, which further induces pyroptosis and activates immune response against tumor cells. D&#8208;FFxFFs locate preferentially in ER and readily self&#8208;assemble to form nanosized misfolded protein mimics, which lead to distinct upregulation of dedicated ER&#8208;phagy receptors with no obvious autophagy of other organelles. Significant unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated via IRE1&#8208;JNK and PERK&#8208;ATF4 pathways. Interestingly, the persistent ER&#8208;phagy triggers ER Ca2+ release and a surge in mitochondrial Ca2+ levels, resulting in GSDMD&#8208;mediated pyroptosis other than apoptosis. The ER&#8208;phagy induce pyroptosis actives distinct antitumor immune response without evolving acquired drug resistance. This work not only pro&#8208;vides powerful tool for investigating the mechanism and function of ER&#8208;phagy, but also offers an appealing strategy for anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Modulation in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Derived Regenerable Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging as promising pre&#8208;catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis. However, the coordination chemistry of MOF ligands in reconstructed species remains poorly understood, particularly regarding how ligand modulation influences the electronic configurations of catalytic sites. In this study, we present the synthesis of an &#945;&#8208;FeOOH coated Ni&#8208;catecholate MOF composite (FeOOH@Ni&#8208;CAT), which transforms into a ligand&#8208;coordinated &#947;&#8208;NiFeOOH active species during OER. Notably, this active species can revert to its stable &#945;&#8208;phase counterpart, exhibiting an &#8220;easy&#8208;to&#8208;regenerate&#8221; characteristic. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the ligand significantly enhances the adsorption energies of oxygenic intermediates involved in the OER, while also modulating electronic structures by strengthening bonding states and promoting electron delocalization between active sites and intermediates. As a result, the FeOOH@Ni&#8208;CAT pre&#8208;catalyst exhibits exceptional OER performance, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 180 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and impressive durability over 384 hours (16 days), leveraging the regenerable property. This work advances the understanding of high&#8208;performance MOF&#8208;based pre&#8208;catalysts by elucidating the fundamental mechanisms of structural reconstruction during OER and highlighting the role of ligand modulation in improving OER activity.</dc:description>

In this study, we present the synthesis of an &#945;-FeOOH coated Ni-catecholate MOF composite (FeOOH@Ni-CAT), which transforms into a ligand-coordinated &#947;-NiFeOOH active species during OER.

         <title>From Polymers to Rings and Back Again: Chemical Recycling of Polyesters to Macrolactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic anhydride and epoxide ring&#8208;opening copolymerization is a versatile and controlled route to make polyesters, gaining attention in different application sectors but so far the chemical recycling of these polyesters to cyclic monomers is under&#8208;explored. Here, the catalytic chemical recycling of aliphatic polyesters to selectively form 16&#8208; and 18&#8208;membered lactones is presented. The recycling reactions are catalysed using commercial tin octoate and conducted in the polymer melt (230 &#176;C) resulting in high conversions to the macro&#8208;lactones (&gt;90%). The recycled macro&#8208;lactones undergo catalysed ring&#8208;opening polymerizations to produce polyesters with equivalent properties to the virgin materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Binding Strength and Acidity of Benzene&#8208;Derivative Ligands Enables Efficient and Hysteresis&#8208;Free Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Passivating defects at the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite/C60 interface without impeding interfacial charge transport can effectively enhance the efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs). Herein, we study the impact of benzene&#8208;derivative ligands with elaborately modulated binding strength and acidity on wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites for high&#8208;performance perovskite/silicon TSCs. Specifically, the acidity/alkalinity and binding strength are preliminary tuned using different functional groups of &#8208;PO&#8323;H&#8322;, &#8208;COOH, and &#8208;NH&#8322;, and further finely adjusted by altering the chain lengths between the benzene ring and the functional groups. The results show that strong binding is indispensable for effectively suppressing voltage loss. However, the commonly used benzylphosphonic acid (BPPA) for firm surface binding exhibits too strong acidity that can etch the perovskite surface, resulting in halide&#8208;vacancy defects and pronounced hysteresis. Increasing the side chain length of BPPA to (2&#8208;phenylethyl)phosphonic acid not only enables a suitable acid dissociation constant (pKa) to avoid acid&#8208;induced etching but also achieves robust anchoring to the perovskite surface with a parallel adsorption orientation, which reduces the charge transport barrier at the interface. These properties enable strong&#8208;adsorption surface termination (SAST) of the perovskite surface while preventing acid&#8208;induced etching. As a result, the SAST strategy achieves a remarkable efficiency of 32.13% (certified 31.72%) for hysteresis&#8208;free perovskite/silicon TSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Realization of Tunable Ferroelectricity in Perovskite Crystals for Multidirectional Self&#8208;Driven Photodetection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide perovskite ferroelectrics endowed with a distinctive spontaneous polarization effect have been regarded as prospective electroactive materials and are prevalently utilized in solar cells, photoelectric detection, and other domains. Among them, multipolar&#8208;axis ferroelectrics featuring multiple equivalent polarization directions are particularly desirable for diverse areas of applications. Nevertheless, the design and regulation of multipolar axis perovskite ferroelectrics remains a significant challenge. Here, guided by the strategy of layer regulation, we successfully designed and regulated a series of 2D homologous perovskites OA2Csn&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 (OA = n&#8208;octylammonium, n = 1&#8208;3). Notably, OA2Csn&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 exhibits layer&#8208;dependent ferroelectricity: OA2PbBr4 exhibits non&#8208;ferroelectricity, OA2CsPb2Br7 displays uniaxial ferroelectricity, while OA2Cs2Pb3Br10 with multiaxial ferroelectricity. Moreover, the devices fabricated based on OA2Cs2Pb3Br10 achieve high&#8208;performance self&#8208;driven photodetection in multiple directions. This precise layer&#8208;regulation strategy offers an efficient approach to obtaining and regulating multipolar&#8208;axis perovskite ferroelectrics, presenting the potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Assembly of Single&#8208;Crystal 2D Porphyrin&#8208;Based Organic Polymers via Dative B&#8208;N Bonds and Halogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rigorous synthetic methodologies have significantly impeded the progress in developing single&#8208;crystal extended organic polymers. Notably, the existence of macroscopic single&#8208;crystalline &#160;two&#8208;dimensional (2D)&#160;&#160;porphyrin&#8208;based organic polymers has never been documented in the literature until now. In this study, we present a groundbreaking example of single&#8208;crystal 2D porphyrin&#8208;based organic polymers that are compatible with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD) for precise structural elucidation. Their formation is fundamentally dependent on the synergistic assembly facilitated by dative B&#8208;N bonds and halogen bonds. These crystals exhibit remarkable stability in both air and aqueous environments. Notably, the formation of the B&#8208;N Lewis pairs within these crystals significantly enhances the separation of photogenerated carriers, and their single crystals demonstrate exceptional photocatalytic activity for the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen, without the requirement for sacrificial agents. This pioneering discovery establishes a new approach for crystalline control within the realm of organic polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Gold Clusters Based on Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Driven Intercluster Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) metal clusters hold significant potential in high&#8208;security encryption and sensing applications, yet the exploration of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven CPL&#8208;active metal clusters remains limited. Here, we report the synthesis of an enantiomeric pair of rhomboid Au4 clusters utilizing chiral R/S&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;5&#8208;methyloxazole&#8208;2&#8208;thione (R/S&#8208;HMMT) ligands. Two enantiomeric pairs of self&#8208;assembled metal clusters R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue and R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red were obtained, by constructing distinct intercluster hydrogen bonds through the use of different crystalline solvents. In R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue, 1,4&#8208;dioxane guest molecules were observed to form a hydrogen&#8208;bond network with the hydroxyl groups of the cluster surface ligands. In contrast, a different hydrogen&#8208;bond network involving the hydroxyl groups of the surface ligands was identified in R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red, resulting in a distinct stacking pattern. The unique intercluster couplings mediated by hydrogen bonds result in R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue exhibiting a blue CPL emission at 466 nm, while R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red shows a dual CPL emission at 446 and 727 nm. Theoretical calculations reveal that hydrogen&#8208;bond driven intercluster couplings in R&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red are significantly stronger than in R&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue. Additionally, both solid R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;blue and R/S&#8208;Au4(HMMT)4&#8208;red undergo reversible CPL transformations in response to organic vapors, temperature, or mechanical stimuli, due to the destruction and reconstruction of hydrogen&#8208;bond networks. These characteristics make them promising materials for information encryption applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Exploration of Chemical Space of MOF&#8208;5 Analogues for Enhanced C2H6/C2H4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorptive separation using C2H6&#8208;selective adsorbents can produce high&#8208;purity C2H4 directly, making it an energy&#8208;efficient separation method with the potential to replace cryogenic distillation. While many C2H6&#8208;selective MOFs have been reported, developing MOFs with both large C2H6 adsorption capacity and high C2H6/C2H4 selectivity remains challenging. Herein, we present a machine learning&#8208;assisted molecular simulation strategy to explore the C2H6/C2H4 separation capability of pcu&#8208;MOFs isoreticular to MOF&#8208;5. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm showed high accuracy in predicting the C2H6/C2H4 selectivity and C2H6 uptake, where Henry coefficient ratio (S0) and Henry coefficient of C2H6 (K(C2H6)) were identified as key factors. We further synthesized the top&#8208;performing MOF termed A&#8208;66 and experimentally verified its large C2H6 adsorption capacity and excellent C2H6/C2H4 separation performance. This work provides a valuable strategy for exploring the chemical space of MOF&#8208;5 analogues and identifying promising candidates for the efficient purification of C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 mixtures.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>While existing literature has primarily focused on carbene&#8208;stabilized amino&#8208; and arylborylenes of the form [(carbene)BR] (R = substituent), herein we report the generation and metallomimetic reactivity of the first carbene&#8208;stabilized alkylborylene [(CAACMe)BCy] (CAACMe = 1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, Cy = cyclohexyl. Furthermore, the transition metal&#8208;like decarbonylation reactions of a borylene complex, [(CAACMe)BCy(CO)], derived from borylene [(CAACMe)BCy] and CO, are described. Additional findings described include (i) the identification of the coordination stages of the ligand to boron towards forming complexes [(CAACMe)BCyL] in the reduction route from starting material [(CAACMe)BCyBr2] and in the photolysis route from carbonyl complex [(CAACMe)BCy(CO], and (ii) insights from quantum&#8208;chemical computations regarding the molecular and electronic structure of the borylene at various stages.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Keteniminyl anions hold significant promise for advancing ketenimine chemistry, yet their isolation has remained elusive until now. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in ligand exchange reactions at carbon, we report the successful synthesis of isolable alkali metal keteniminyl anions through substitution of the phosphine ligand in metalated ylides or the N2 ligand in a diazomethanides with isocyanides. The exchange reactions were found to proceed more rapidly with aryl isocyanides than with the more electron&#8208;rich alkyl&#8208;substituted derivatives and were also more efficient when starting from the diazo compounds. The resulting keteniminyl anions exhibit bent geometries, which can be attributed to a donor&#8208;acceptor interaction with the isocyanide, giving rise to a carbone&#8208;like structure. Electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents on the nitrogen enhance backbonding, thus leading to larger bending angles and a more pronounced ynamide character as also evidenced by a red&#8208;shifted of the ketenimine stretch in the IR spectrum. The keteniminyl anions react efficiently with unsaturated compounds to form a diverse array of heterocycles, highlighting their potential as versatile building blocks in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Hydrogen Vacancies on Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination in Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen vacancies in hybrid perovskites have a dramatic influence on the non&#8208;radiative recombination. It can exhibit multiple metastable configurations, resulting in variations in carrier capture coefficient by over 10 orders of magnitude. By uncovering the negligible role of hydrogen vacancies on the non&#8208;radiative recombination losses, this work shifts the focus toward more significant defects, for instance, iodine interstitial, thereby paving the way for optimizing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) efficiency to meet the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.








Abstract
Hydrogen vacancies (VH) were considered major non&#8208;radiative recombination centers in hybrid perovskites. By employing a multiscale approach that combines first&#8208;principles calculations and molecular dynamics (MDs) simulations, our findings indicated that the VH impact was overestimated due to the previous metastable VH configurations. The organic molecules with VH located on either the nitrogen or carbon atom act as the ligands that form energetically stable dimers with Pb2+ cations. These dimers lower VH energy by 0.35&#8211;0.97&#160;eV in MAPbI3 and by 0.88&#8211;1.01&#160;eV in FAPbI3, compared to non&#8208;bonding configurations. These dimers significantly boosted potential energy barriers of hole capture, resulting in a dramatic reduction in carrier capture coefficients by over 10 orders of magnitude. Consequently, the total capture coefficients (Ctotal) for the dominant VH in MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 are on the order of 10&#8722;17 and 10&#8722;31 cm&#8722;3s&#8722;1, respectively. By uncovering the negligible impact of VH on non&#8208;radiative recombination, this work shifts the focus toward more significant defects, for instance, iodine interstitial (with a capture coefficient on the order of 10&#8722;8 cm&#8722;3s&#8722;1), thereby paving the way for optimizing perovskite solar cells efficiency to meet the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.

         <title>Thermally Conductive Naphthalene Epoxy Resin by Tailoring Flexible Chain Length and Liquid Crystal Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epoxy resin with high thermal conductivity (&#955;) are widely used in electronic packaging, bonding, and coating. However, those with high intrinsic &#955;, typically synthesized using biphenyl or aromatic rings extended by ester linkages as the mesogenic unit, often exhibit high liquid crystal transition temperatures and poor processability. In this study, a series of naphthalene&#8208;based liquid crystal epoxy monomers (LCE) were synthesized, using naphthalene as the mesogenic unit and modifying the flexible chain length on both sides. The resulting LCE were cured within their liquid crystal phase to form naphthalene liquid crystal epoxy resin (LCER). The results show that the network order, radius of gyration, and low&#8208;frequency vibrational density of states all initially increase and then decrease with increasing flexible chain length. For LCER2, with a three&#8208;carbon flexible chain, these parameters reach their maximum values, facilitating phonon diffusion and enhancing &#955;. The liquid crystal transition temperature, &#955;, heat resistance index, and storage modulus of LCER2 were 67~78oC, 0.40 W/(m&#183;K), 158.8oC and 2059 MPa, respectively, approximately 2.2 times higher than that of E&#8208;51 resin (0.18 W/(m&#183;K)). This work offers insights into designing epoxy resins with low liquid crystal transition temperature, high intrinsic &#955;, and excellent mechanical properties for thermal management.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid, Precise, and Robust Supramolecular Polymerization from Functional Oligomeric&#8208;Charged Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular design of oligomeric&#8208;charged poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) amphiphiles enables their crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly with unprecedented rapid growth kinetics and precise size control. This robust supramolecular polymerization allows access to hierarchical hairy structures with dense, uniform micellar brushes via a &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; approach initiated from the surface of two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets.








Abstract
Nature inspires the design of artificial systems with remarkable rapidity, precision, and functionality, yet achieving these attributes simultaneously remains a challenge. Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) methods have enabled the formation of low&#8208;dispersity block copolymer nanofibers with crystalline cores, but these processes typically involve moderate or slow growth kinetics to ensure well&#8208;controlled and ordered epitaxial crystallization. Here, we report studies on the living CDSA of oligomeric&#8208;charged poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) amphiphiles, demonstrating an unprecedented combination of rapidity and precision. We show that self&#8208;seeding can produce nanofibers with controllable lengths up to &#8764;700&#160;nm within &#8764;15&#160;min (including 5&#160;min of disassembly and 10&#160;min of re&#8208;growth), while seeded growth can generate nanofibers up to &gt; 2000&#160;nm in length within &#8764;20&#8211;40&#160;min, depending on the unimer&#8208;to&#8208;seed mass ratios. Notably, this robust supramolecular polymerization can be initiated from the surfaces of two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets, resulting in hierarchical hairy structures grafted with dense, uniform micellar brushes.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Force Spectroscopy Uncovers Root Zone&#8208; and Bacteria&#8208;Specific Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate at the single&#8208;cell level the reversible primary attachment between plant growth&#8208;promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and plant roots. Bacterial affinities are both species&#8208; and region&#8208;specific along the root, with flagella playing a key role in mediating these interactions. The physicochemical properties of the root surface and the bacterial envelope significantly influence how these PGPR attach.








Abstract
Understanding root&#8211;bacteria interactions with plant growth&#8208;promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is key to developing effective biofertilizers for sustainable agriculture. We performed single&#8208;cell force spectroscopy using the atomic force microscope (AFM) to study the primary attachment of two PGPR, Bacillus velezensis and Pseudomonas defensor, to different regions of Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Force measurements with individual cells uncovered distinct attachment strategies by each strain, involving binding via micrometer&#8208;long polymers from both bacteria and root surfaces. Flagella differentially affected the binding interactions of each PGPR; their removal altered binding characteristics differently for each strain, highlighting the importance of flagella in early root colonization. Using silica beads to mimic the negatively charged bacteria, we demonstrated the influence of electrostatic forces on root&#8211;bacteria interactions. We also examined interactions with abiotic surfaces of varying surface energies, revealing the roles of hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces in initial binding. Our measurements show that differences in the physicochemical properties of bacteria and roots are responsible for variations in primary attachment strategies between PGPR strains and root regions. Parallel fluorescence measurements corroborated our AFM single&#8208;cell analysis. Overall, our results provide a nanoscale view of bacterial attachment to roots, offering key insights into how beneficial bacteria colonize roots, crucial for enhancing biofertilizer effectiveness.

         <title>A Promising Deep Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Crystal Activated by the Ordered Structure Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising deep&#8208;ultraviolet&#160;nonlinear optical crystal, Cs2KY(B3O6)2 with ordered design of the largest &#960;&#8208;conjugated B3O6 functional groups, has been successfully synthesized through utilizing the similar topological group substitution strategy. It exhibits excellent performance, i.e., the strongest second&#8208;harmonic generation response among the KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like deep&#8208;ultraviolet borates, the best crystal growth habit along the c axis, short absorption edge, and sufficient birefringence.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (DUV NLO) crystals play a vitally important role in many scientific and technological fields, yet their rational design remains an ongoing challenge. Here, through utilizing the ordered structure design, a new KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like DUV transparent NLO crystal Cs2KY(B3O6)2 has been successfully designed and synthesized, in which we first use the largest &#960;&#8208;conjugated B3O6 functional groups to substitute the BO3 to maximize the second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response and utilize the K/YO6 connecting groups to replace two BeO3F groups to optimize the layer connections. Eventually, Cs2KY(B3O6)2 exhibits not only the largest SHG responses in KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like DUV borates but also the best growth rate along c axis (the strong layer&#8208;habit along c axis has been being the greatest obstacle to prohibit the practical application of KBe2BO3F2 and its derivative). Clearly, the substitution from BO3 triangles to similar topological B3O6 groups and from (BeO3F)2 groups to similar topological K/YO6 octahedra can better modulate the functional properties of materials in the larger scale. That results in the superior comprehensive properties of Cs2KY(B3O6)2 and makes it a promising DUV NLO crystal. Therefore, the ordered structure design provides some new insights for assembling the functional and connecting groups to rationally design materials with high&#8208;performance.

         <title>A Compact&#8208;Solvation Electrolyte Under Low Concentration for High&#8208;Energy Density and Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic liquid&#8208;driven compacting strategy was proposed to form FSI&#8722;&#8208;rich solvation structures with high&#8208;ionic conductivity and low&#8208;desolvation energy at a low concentration of 0.8 M, which enhanced K&#8208;storage thermodynamics and kinetics by promoting the formation of a robust KF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and accelerated K+ transport kinetics, enabling the PB||CSE||graphite full cell to operate for 1450 cycles at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 88%.








Abstract
The development of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) faces significant challenges due to the lack of suitable electrolytes to achieve satisfactory energy density and long&#8208;term stability. This work reports an innovative compact&#8208;solvation electrolyte (CSE) strategy leveraging ionic liquid&#8208;induced manipulation of solvation structures under low concentration for high&#8208;performance PIBs. The CSE, formulated with a low&#8208;salt concentration of 0.8&#160;M, simultaneously exhibits compact solvation structures with abundant F&#8208;rich anions, high&#8208;ionic conductivity, and low&#8208;desolvation energy. These features lead to enhanced K&#8208;storage thermodynamics and kinetics through the formation of a robust KF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) as well as accelerated K+ transport kinetics. Consequently, the graphite electrode in CSE delivers a high&#8208;reversible capacity of 252&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% after 300 cycles at 50&#160;mA&#160;g. Furthermore, the designed CSE enables the Prussian blue||graphite full cell to operate for over 1450 cycles at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1, maintaining an impressive capacity retention of 88%. This work represents a significant advance in the development of safe and compatible electrolytes for advanced PIBs.

         <title>pH&#8208;Dependent Switching Between Nonlinear&#8208;Optical&#8208;Active Nitrate&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The physical mechanisms of both crystal nucleation and growth and phase transitions have been clarified based on polymorphs &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;(C2H5N4)(NO3), among which &#945;&#8208;phase polymorph exhibits excellent UV NLO properties including a strong SHG response, wide bandgap, and moderate birefringence.








Abstract
Tailored syntheses of non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals, particularly those of metastable NCS polymorphs, remain extremely challenging due to the complex interactions of their constituent primitives. In this work, we report the first successful synthesis of a set of three nitrate supramolecular polymorphs (C2H5N4)(NO3) (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;phases) by a pH&#8208;modulation secondary&#8208;bond strategy, via the assembly of two types of &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar primitives. Solutions of different pH result in differing orientation of secondary bonds between [C2H5N4] and [NO3] primitives. Secondary bonds dominate the packing of primitives in crystal lattices; varying these secondary bonds can afford NCS or centrosymmetric nitrate supramolecular polymorphs, with 2D &#945;&#8208;phase irreversibly transformed to 2D &#946;&#8208;phase in a solution of appropriate pH. These two polymorphs display distinctly different SHG responses and birefringences, ascribed to variation in stacking of 2D hydrogen&#8208;bond layers resulting from the differing environmental pH. Supramolecular crystal structures comparison and theoretical studies confirm the crucial role played by secondary&#8208;bond interactions between adjacent primitives in the rare nitrate supramolecular polymorphs. This work paves the way in elucidating the supramolecular polymorph transition&#8208;mechanisms and correlating the polymorph structures and their NLO properties, and thereby discloses a new paradigm for development of high&#8208;performance NCS materials with tailored optical properties.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selectively Accelerating the Generation of &#946;&#8208;Linked Residue Isoaspartate in Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoaspartate (isoAsp), a &#946;&#8208;linked residue, widely exists in proteins. A method that allows the site&#8208;selective and rapid generation of isoAsp residues in proteins has been developed. This method leverages the genetic incorporation of a side&#8208;chain&#8208;esterified Asp derivative that undergoes a facile intramolecular reaction to form the key intermediate, aspartyl succinimide (Suc); subsequent hydrolysis of Suc gives rise to the major product isoAsp.








Abstract
Isoaspartate (isoAsp) is a &#946;&#8208;linked residue in proteins spontaneously generated through Asn deamidation or Asp dehydration and significantly affects protein properties. However, the sluggish and site&#8208;nonselective generation of isoAsp residues in proteins severely impedes in&#8208;depth biological investigations as well as the exploitation of its unique &#946;&#8208;linkage features. Herein, we introduce a method that allows site&#8208;selective and rapid generation of isoAsp residues in proteins. This method leverages the genetic incorporation of a side&#8208;chain&#8208;esterified Asp derivative (BnD), which undergoes facile intramolecular arrangement to form the key intermediate, aspartyl succinimide (Suc); subsequent hydrolysis of Suc gives rise to isoAsp as the major product. On native sites of proteins, including Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and calmodulin, we demonstrate that BnD&#8208;mediated isoAsp formation is faster than Asn deamidation generally by three orders of magnitude.

         <title>Balancing Hydrogen Evolution and Hydrogenation Reaction via Facet Engineering for Efficient Conversion of Nitrate to Ammonia in Actual Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a critical insight into the hydrogenation mechanism, implying that facet engineering can balance hydrogen evolution and hydrogenation reaction. The Co3O4(100) facet with abundant oxygen vacancies can not only boost water dissociation to generate active hydrogen but also effectively utilize these intermediates for nitrate reduction, thereby shifting the reaction pathway from hydrogen evolution to hydrogenation reaction.








Abstract
Due to the competitive relationship between nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the conventional approach to improve Faradaic efficiency is to select a catalyst without HER activity. Nevertheless, such a strategy not only limits the application of HER catalysts in NO3&#8722;RR, but also causes insufficient hydrogen source, thereby sacrificing ammonia yield rate. We believe that HER catalysts should not be excluded from hydrogenation reduction. Herein, taking traditional water electrolysis material Co3O4 as model system, we reveal that the oxygen vacancies on crystal facet can greatly promote water dissociation and capture HER intermediate for NO3&#8722;RR, successfully shifting the reaction pathway from hydrogen evolution to nitrate hydrogenation. Beyond material development, we construct a hybrid reactor and achieve an ammonia recovery rate of 1216.8&#160;g&#8208;N&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;d&#8722;1 in nuclear industry wastewater with ultra&#8208;high nitrate concentration. This study breaks through the limitation of HER catalyst in NO3&#8722;RR, which provides a significant insight into the catalyst designing and hydrogenation mechanism.

         <title>Controlled Anodic Decomposition Pathway of Supramolecular Lithium Borate for Rationally Tuned Interphase Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular lithium borate which features a polydentate structure is reported here. The reversible supramolecular chelating/de&#8208;chelating of Li&#8314; enables the sequentially controlled cleavage pathway of B&#9472;O and C&#9472;O bonds. Therefore, a homogeneous and robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, rich in lithium boron&#8211;oxygen clusters and LiF is rationally fabricated. The precise control over interfacial chemistry significantly enhances interfacial protection, thereby improving battery cycling stability.








Abstract
The rational tailoring and molecular&#8208;level engineering of stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphases (CEIs) is paramount to advancing the performance of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy, layered nickel&#8208;rich oxide&#8208;based lithium metal batteries. However, developing well&#8208;tailored electrolyte additives with rationally controlled interfacial chemistry remains highly challenging. Here, two lithium borates: lithium (2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)trifluoroborate (C&#8208;LiMCFB) and lithium (15&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,5,8,11,14&#8208;pentaoxahexadecan)trifluoroborate (L&#8208;LiMCFB), incorporating cyclic 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5) and linear pentaethylene glycol monomethyl ether (PEGME) as respective host groups tethered to the boron center are designed and synthesized. In C&#8208;LiMCFB, the supramolecular polydentate chelation/de&#8208;chelation of the 15C5 with Li+ can sequentially deactivate/activate the anodic decomposition of the C&#9472;O bonds, therefore leading to the controlled cleavage pathway of B&#9472;O and C&#9472;O bonds. The controlled interfacial chemistry leads to the formation of a uniform CEI layer, rich in lithium boron&#8211;oxygen clusters interwoven with LiF, on the NCM811 surface. This novel CEI configuration demonstrates an exceptional balance of mechanical robustness, adhesiveness, and toughness, providing highly desirable protection for the NCM811 cathode. The discovery of these novel supramolecular boron&#8208;based lithium salts not only unlocks supramolecular chemistry for rational electrolyte tuning but also provides a deeper understanding of the CEI formation mechanism in high&#8208;energy lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Enabling Aryl Chloride&#8208;Mediated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first general palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) catalysis with aryl chlorides is achieved by employing a secondary&#8208;amide&#8208;substituted NBE and XPhos ligand, resulting in diverse ortho/ipso difunctionalizations of arenes.








Abstract
While the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis has become increasingly useful for arene functionalization, its substrate scope has been mainly restricted to reactive aryl iodides and bromides. Despite being a more available and attractive feedstock, common aryl chlorides have not been used as substrates for the Pd/NBE catalysis. Herein, we report the first general Pd/NBE&#8208;catalyzed vicinal difunctionalization of aryl chlorides. Enabled by the combination of secondary&#8208;amide&#8208;substituted NBEs and XPhos ligand, diverse aryl chlorides can now undergo successful ortho alkylation, amination, and acylation with different ipso terminations, including olefination, hydrogenation, and alkynylation. To show the utility of this method, late&#8208;stage derivatizations of complex bioactive compounds and sequential functionalizations of polyhaloarenes have been achieved.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Pillar[5]Arenes Through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Azide&#8211;Alkyne Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel strategy is presented for synthesizing inherently chiral pillar[5]arenes through an iterative CuAAC reaction. By increasing the steric hindrance on both sides of the macrocyclic molecule, a wide range of pillar[5]arenes are efficiently prepared in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities.








Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes have been extensively investigated as carrier materials for applications in host&#8208;guest chemistry, nanoscience, information science, materials science, and other domains. Despite its success, the enantioselective synthesis of pillar[n]arenes is challenging and has not yet been achieved. Herein, a novel asymmetric extended side&#8208;arm strategy is presented for synthesizing chiral pillar[5]arenes through an iterative copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction. An increase in the steric hindrance on both sides of the macrocyclic molecule efficiently produced a wide range of pillar[5]arenes in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, this principle enables iterative copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition to enantioselectively functionalized pillar[5]arenes with different triazoles using a one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Tandem Assembly and Etching Chemistry towards Mesoporous Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Sodium Storage Over 50,000 Cycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range ion transport in microporous channels severely limits the application of two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) in energy storage. We establish a bi&#8208;functional modulator manipulated tandem assembly and etching chemistry to incorporate perpendicularly aligned mesopores into the microporous cMOFs, which offers two orders of magnitude shorter micropore channels, enabling a remarkable rate cyclability over 50,000 cycles at 50&#8197;C.







Abstract
Despite two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) being attractive due to their intrinsic electrical conductivity and redox activity for energy applications, alleviating the constrained mass transfer within long&#8208;range micropore channels remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a tandem assembly and etching chemistry, to incorporate perpendicularly aligned mesopores into the micropores of cMOFs, via a bi&#8208;functional modulator. Synchrotron spectral and morphological analyses demonstrate that the elaborate ammonia modulator first coordinates with Zn2+ forming defects during the initial self&#8208;assembly of cMOF oligomers, which then initiates mesoporous cMOFs via in situ etching. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical simulations further reveal that such a unique perpendicular mesoporous structure shorts the micropore channels by two orders of magnitude and relaxes the inherent ion stacking within micropores, leading to five times faster Na+ transport and a remarkable rate capability at 250&#8197;C and sodium storage lifespan over 50,000 cycles. Our protocol opens up a new avenue for introducing mesopores into microporous cMOFs for advanced energy applications and beyond.

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Driven Cooperative Photocatalytic Coupling of Biomass Valorization and Hydrogen Peroxide Production Using Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel singlet oxygen&#8208;promote photocatalysis on COF&#8208;N0&#8208;3 couples biomass valorization with H2O2 production, diverging from traditional H2O2 photocatalysis, which relies on photoexcited electrons and holes. Herein, singlet oxygen consumes most electron&#8211;hole pairs, facilitating an Achmatowicz rearrangement with furfuryl alcohol. This yields high&#8208;value pyranones and H2O2, surpassing traditional products by 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude in market value.








Abstract
Traditional H2O2 photocatalysis primarily depends on photoexcited electrons and holes to drive oxygen reduction and water oxidation, respectively. However, singlet oxygen (1O2), often underappreciated, plays a pivotal role in H2O2 production. Meanwhile, photocatalytic biomass conversion has attracted attention, yet studies combining H2O2 synthesis with biomass valorization remain rare and typically yield low&#8208;value products. Herein, a strategy of photocatalytic valorization of furfuryl alcohol (FFA) coupled with the efficient co&#8208;production of H2O2 is reported, enabled by covalent organic frameworks (COFs) induced, 1O2&#8208;participated Achmatowicz rearrangement. This study introduces polyimide&#8208;based COF&#8208;N0&#8208;3 with tailored nitrogen content, representing an unprecedently efficient platform for 1O2 production. Remarkably, reducing the nitrogen content of the COF enhances 1O2 production, significantly boosting the H2O2 generation rate. In FFA, the primary pathway for H2O2 production is Achmatowicz rearrangement, achieving a rate ten times higher than that reliant on oxygen reduction reaction in pure water, reaching 4549 &#181;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;. Mechanism studies revealed 1O2 selectively engaged FFA, bypassing hole oxidation to trigger the Achmatowicz rearrangement, producing valuable 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;(2H)&#8208;pyranone with 99% conversion and 92% selectivity. This work establishes a coupling strategy for simultaneous synthesis of H2O2 and biochemicals, offering a transformative approach to sustainable photocatalysis.

         <title>Coupling Photocatalytic Reduction and Biosynthesis Towards Sustainable CO2 Upcycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work delivers a photocatalysis&#8208;biosynthesis tandem strategy towards upgrading CO2 into long&#8208;chain sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene, which offers a sustainable paradigm for CO2 conversion to value&#8208;added compounds.







Abstract
Upcycling carbon dioxide (CO2) into long&#8208;chain compounds has attracted considerable attention with respect to mitigating environmental problems and obtaining value&#8208;added feedstocks, but remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a tandem photocatalysis&#8208;biosynthesis strategy for efficient CO2 reduction to energy&#8208;rich sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene. Firstly, photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4 was optimized over the transitional metal doped ZnO (M&#8722;ZnO). The as&#8208;prepared Ni&#8722;ZnO preferentially reduces CO2 to CH4 with a production rate of 1539.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 90&#8201;%, owing to the unique interface structure (Zn&#948;+&#8722;O&#8722;Ni&#946;+). Subsequently, Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1C was genetically engineered to produce sucrose or &#945;&#8208;farnesene using photocatalytically&#8208;obtained CH4 as the sole carbon source, with a titer of 96.3 and 43.9&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1, respectively. This study provides a green, low&#8208;energy pathway for the synthesis of long&#8208;chain compounds from CO2 as the carbon source, which sheds new light on tackling long&#8208;term energy demands and sustainable CO2 upcycling.

         <title>Highly Strained Electron&#8208;Rich Molecular Bowl and Nanographene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesizing small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowls is essential due to their potential complementary properties to molecules such as corannulene and sumanene. However, their development is challenging because of the inherent high strain. Herein, the small electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl 1 (C20N2H8) and the wavy dimer 2 have been synthesized, and their optical, electronic, and supramolecular properties are extensively studied.







Abstract
Introducing two pyrrole rings at the armchair edges of perylene creates the small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl 1, which can be viewed as a nitrogen&#8208;doped end&#8208;cap of C70. Despite numerous attempts since 2008, its synthesis has been hindered by strain and synthetic challenges. In this study, we present the synthesis and property analysis of molecular bowl 1 and its dimer, the wavy&#8208;shaped nanographene 2. Substituents on nitrogen atoms significantly affect the bowl depth, intermolecular interactions, and supramolecular behaviors. Consequently, the butyl&#8208;substituted molecular bowl 1&#8201;a forms unusual polar crystals with all bowls oriented similarly, suggesting potential pyroelectric or ferroelectric applications. Due to the electron&#8208;rich nature, compounds 1 exhibit significantly strong binding affinity towards fullerene, with 1&#8201;a forming a sandwich structure with C70. Furthermore, neutral bowls 1 display counter&#8208;rotating ring currents similar to corannulene, while their dications exhibit global anti&#8208;aromaticity. The wavy&#8208;structured nanographene 2 demonstrates two continuously reversible oxidation processes, and its dication 22+ shows remarkably high stability under ambient conditions. In summary, this work constructs a small, electron&#8208;rich molecular bowl and its nanographene dimer, highlighting their exceptional properties, promising applications, and potential as foundations for future advanced nanostructure fabrication.

         <title>Nanoconfinement&#8208;Induced Electrochemical Ion&#8208;Solvent Cointercalation in Pillared Titanate Host Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interlayer&#8208;expansion of hydrogen tetratitanate is realized with organic pillars. Optimized atomistic configurations of the pillared materials are proposed by characterization with experiment and simulation. The nanoconfinement modification of HTO induces ion&#8208;solvent cointercalation reactions with improved kinetics and increased storage capacity.







Abstract
Electrochemical ion&#8208;solvent cointercalation reactions are an avenue to reach improved kinetics compared to the corresponding intercalation of desolvated ions. Here, we demonstrate the impact of different structural pillar molecules on the electrochemical Li+ intercalation mechanism in expanded hydrogen titanate (HTO) electrode materials. We show that interlayer&#8208;expansion of HTO with organic pillars can enable cointercalation reactions. Their electrochemical reversibility is drastically improved when non&#8208;cross&#8208;linking pillars are employed that expand and separate the host material's individual layers, underlining the impact of the electrochemo&#8208;mechanics of the nanoconfined interlayer space. This pillared HTO structure results in an increased Li+ storage capacity and reversibility compared to pristine HTO. We derive structural models of the pillared HTO host materials based on combined experiments and theoretical calculations, and employ electrochemical operando experiments to unambiguously demonstrate the nanoconfinement&#8208;induced cointercalation mechanism in pillared HTO electrode materials. The work demonstrates the potential of nanoconfined pillar molecules to modify host materials and enable highly reversible cointercalation reactions with improved capacity and kinetics.

         <title>Engineered Polymeric Microspheres with Synergistic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Nanotraps and Multisite Adsorption for Ultrafast Herbicide Decontamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crosslinked polymer microsphere &#947;CD&#8208;PF was constructed utilizing hydrogen bond&#8208;incorporating cyclodextrins and conjugated hexafluorocyclotriphosphazene. The removal efficiencies exceeding 98% for PQ and DQ within 5&#160;s, with pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order adsorption kinetics constants (k2) of 127.09 and 192.64&#160;g mg&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, respectively. The ultrafast adsoprtion is facilitated by a hydrogen&#8208;bond nanotrap&#8208;dominated multisite adsorption, which follows an initial electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction&#8208;induced surface enrichment.








Abstract
The ultrafast removal of trace herbicides like paraquat (PQ) and diquat (DQ) from water is urgent yet challenging due to their highwater stability and strong&#8208;binding properties. Here, efficient PQ and DQ removal based on hydrogen&#8208;bonding nanotraps dominant multisite adsorption were developed. Two crosslinked polymeric microspheres, &#946;CD&#8208;PF and &#947;CD&#8208;PF, were synthesized from cyclodextrins (CDs) and hexafluorocyclotriphosphazene (HFP). The &#947;CD&#8208;PF microsphere with sufficient hydrogen&#8208;bonding nanotraps on the pore surface prompts adsorption kinetics constants of PQ and DQ up to 127.09 and 192.64&#160;g mg&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, achieving 99% removal efficiency for PQ and DQ within 5&#160;s. &#947;CD&#8208;PF exhibits exceptional selectivity for PQ and DQ over larger competing dyes. Importantly, trace PQ (1&#160;ppm) can be effectively treated with &#947;CD&#8208;PF to achieve a concentration far below the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard (0.003&#160;ppm) within 30&#160;s. The ultrafast adsorption is driven by a multisite mechanism: electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions from HFP promote adsorbate accumulation on the CD surface, while the high&#8208;density hydrogen&#8208;bonding nanotraps in &#947;CD&#8208;PF enhance hydrogen bond strength, enabling rapid capture. This work provides a valuable strategy for designing ultrafast adsorbents for effective herbicide removal from water.

         <title>Chlorinated Bithiophene Imide&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type Polymers: Synthesis, Structure&#8211;Property Correlations, and Applications in Organic Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chlorinated imide&#8208;functionalized electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes, ClBTI and ClBTI2, were developed, and the n&#8208;type polymers built from them showed ordered structure, high crystallinity, and sizable electron mobility. Ternary all&#8208;polymer solar cells fabricated using them as the third component delivered power conversion efficiencies up to 19.35%, much higher than that (15.84%) of the binary one.








Abstract
Developing electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)arenes with optimized geometries and electronic properties is imperative for advancing n&#8208;type polymers and organic electronic devices. We report here the design and synthesis of two chlorinated imide&#8208;functionalized electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes, namely chlorine&#8208;substituted bithiophene imide (ClBTI) and its fused dimer (ClBTI2). The corresponding polymers show a near&#8208;planar framework, appropriate frontier molecular orbital levels, and good solubility. When integrated into organic thin&#8208;film transistors, ClBTI2&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer afforded unipolar electron mobility of up to 0.48 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The binary all&#8208;PSCs based on PM6 and new polymers show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 1%. Interestingly, by introducing these polymers with ordered structure, high crystallinity, and sizable electron mobility as the third component into the host system PM6:PY&#8208;IT, continuous interpenetrating networks with large fibrillar structures can be formed. Investigations of charge transfer kinetics and energy loss analyses unveiled that ClBTI2&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer P(ClBTI2&#8208;BTI) enables optimized charge transport, reduced charge recombination, and minimized non&#8208;radiative loss within the all&#8208;polymer ternary blends, yielding a remarkable PCE of 19.35% (certified: 19.20%) through optimizing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PM6:PY&#8208;IT blend. The structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationships provide valuable insights into the design of electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)arenes and n&#8208;type polymers, marking a great progress in the development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers for organic electronic devices.

         <title>Artificial Carbon Neutrality Through Aprotic CO2 Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the reducing hydrogen&#8208;mediated natural photosynthesis, in which CO&#8322; is converted into O&#8322; and glucose, a lithium&#8208;mediated aprotic electrochemical strategy for splitting CO&#8322; into O&#8322; and carbon taking advantage of the stronger reducibility of lithium over hydrogen is developed. Within the designed electrochemical device, CO2 is reduced sequentially into Li&#8322;CO&#8323; and Li&#8322;O, followed by the oxidation of Li2O to release O2. Moreover, the high O2 yield of over 98% can be achieved with the assistance of appropriate catalysts, significantly advancing carbon&#8208;neutral technologies.








Abstract
Global climate change mitigation necessitates global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. Natural photosynthesis exemplifies an ingenious approach to carbon neutrality, converting CO2 into O2 and glucose through light and dark reactions. Inspired by the hydrogen&#8208;involved processes in photosynthesis, an aprotic electrochemical strategy for CO2 splitting into O2 and carbon using lithium as a reducing mediator is presented. The designed electrochemical device features a gas cathode with a nanoscale Co catalyst and a metallic lithium anode. When CO2 is introduced to the cathode, it undergoes a two&#8208;step lithium&#8208;related electrochemical reduction, converting it sequentially into Li2CO3 and Li2O. Li2O is then oxidized to produce O2 gas at the expense of renewable electrical energy. This process achieves an impressive O2 yield exceeding 94.7%, significantly outperforming the efficiency of natural photosynthesis. Moreover, the O2 yield can be further increased to 98.6% by employing an optimized RuCo catalyst. This study offers a new practical and controllable pathway to produce O2 from CO2, strongly promoting the sustainable development of human society for realizing carbon neutrality as well as exploring and conquering nature.

         <title>Short&#8208;Path Hydrogen Spillover on CeO2&#8208;Supported PtPd Nanoclusters for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PtPd alloy clusters anchored on CeO2 enable efficient hydrogen spillover via short&#8208;path interfacial transfer, achieving near&#8208;zero Gibbs free energy (0.023 eV) for hydrogen adsorption. This design minimizes the HER energy barrier, yielding an ultralow overpotential of 5.7 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and robust stability in acidic media, offering a novel strategy for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Hydrogen spillover in supported metal electrocatalysts has garnered significant research attention for its potential to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency. However, challenges remain in facilitating hydrogen spillover and reducing the associated energy barriers. Herein, PtPd alloy clusters are anchored to the CeO2 surface, enabling short&#8208;path hydrogen spillover and lowering the reaction energy barrier in acidic environments. During HER, hydrogen is initially adsorbed on the noble metal surface and subsequently migrates to the interface, rather than precipitating directly on the CeO2 surface. This interface exhibits a near&#8208;zero Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (0.023&#160;eV). Consequently, the catalyst demonstrates an exceptionally low overpotential of only 5.7&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic media, along with remarkable long&#8208;term stability. These findings provide valuable insights into designing highly efficient HER electrocatalysts for acidic environments based on hydrogen spillover mechanisms.

         <title>Selectively Deoxygenative Deuteration of Aldehydes by Superwetting Porous Carbon&#8208;Supported Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a class of superwetting carbon&#8208;supported Pd catalysts, which facilitate the site&#8208;specific deoxygenative deuteration of aldehydes to aromatics with &#8208;CD3 group benefitting from the catalyst's surface polarity and electron&#8208;rich effect.








Abstract
We present a method of deoxygenative deuteration of aldehydes (DDA) over heterogeneously superwetting porous carbon&#8208;supported palladium catalyst (Pd/SPC), which is efficient for the synthesis of deuterated aromatic compounds with &#8208;CD3 group. Exemplified by the DDA reaction of 2&#8208;naphthaldehyde (2&#8208;NAL) to 2&#8208;methylnaphthalene (2&#8208;MNE), the total deuterium incorporation radio in the resultant aromatic hydrocarbons was higher than 95% and the selectivity toward 2&#8208;MNE&#8208;d3 reached 87%. The impressed catalytic activity was found relevant to the combined effect of surface wettability and the electron&#8208;rich properties of Pd species of this kind of heterogeneous Pd/SPC catalyst. Mechanistic studies suggest a successive deuteration pathway, that is, hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE), deuterium addition, and ultimate deoxygenative deuteration over Pd/SPC in the cost&#8208;effective D2O/H2 reaction conditions. The in situ&#8208;formed D2 from the first step HIE between H2 and D2O can be readily captured by the electron&#8208;rich Pd centers, which then boost the subsequent deuterogenolysis of C&#9472;O bonds through deuterated alcohol intermediates toward the formation of 2&#8208;MNE&#8208;d3. This work provides a design principle of heterogeneous catalysts for targeted deuterium labeling from aldehyde substrates and may inspire the development of alternative deuterium labeling techniques beyond dominated homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Engineering Asymmetric Electronic Structure of Co&#9472;N&#9472;C Single&#8208;Atomic Sites Toward Excellent Electrochemical H2O2 Production and Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co&#9472;N5 site with asymmetric electronic structure was built to improve the activation of O2, moderate the adsorption of *OOH intermediate, and ideally conserve the generated H2O2, achieving the excellent H2O2 selectivity by 92.5%. The 2e&#8722; ORR coupled oxidation further realized the efficient cellulosic biomass upgrading into valued formic acid with a high yield of 92.1%.








Abstract
To advance electrochemical H2O2 production and unravel catalytic mechanisms, the precise structural coordination of single&#8208;atomic M&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalysts is urgently required. Herein, the Co&#9472;N5 site with an asymmetric electronic configuration is constructed to boost the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) compared to symmetric Co&#9472;N4, effectively overcoming the trade&#8208;off between activity and selectivity in H2O2 production. Both experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that breaking the symmetry of Co&#9472;N sites promotes the activation of O2 molecules and moderates the adsorption of the key *OOH intermediate by disrupting the linear scaling relationship for intermediates&#160;adsorption. This modulation enables efficient H&#8322;O&#8322; production and its effective retention for subsequent applications. As a proof of concept, Co&#9472;N5 achieves a H2O2 production rate as high as 16.1&#160;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in a flow cell, outperforming most recently reported counterparts. Furthermore, the coupling of 2e&#8722; ORR with the oxidation of cellulose&#8208;derived carbohydrates accomplishes high formic acid yields (84.1% from glucose and 62.0%&#8211;92.1% from other substrates), underpinning the sustainable electro&#8208;refinery for biomass valorization at ambient conditions. By elucidating the intrinsic relationship between 2e&#8315; ORR and the asymmetry of single&#8208;atomic sites, this work paves the way for high&#8208;performance electrosynthesis.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SrLiPO4/Sr9MgLi(PO4)7:Eu2+ single&#8208;grain phosphors prepared in this work have achieved remarkable full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum emission efficiency, with record internal and external quantum efficiencies of 76.1% and 56.2%, respectively. The high luminescence efficiency stems from the constructed heterojunction interface, which blocks the detrimental energy&#8208;migration process.








Abstract
Full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum emission phosphors are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs), overcoming the complex and high costs of traditional mixed phosphors. However, their practical application is hindered by low luminescence efficiency. In this regard, a generalization strategy is developed that involves creating heterostructure interfaces to prevent detrimental energy transfer processes, thereby boosting efficiency. The SrLiPO4/Sr9MgLi(PO4)7:Eu2+ single&#8208;grain phosphors prepared in this work have achieved remarkable full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum emission efficiency, with record internal and external quantum efficiencies of 76.1% and 56.2%, respectively. The WLEDs encapsulated with this phosphor feature a high color rendering index (&#8776;93.9), a low correlated color temperature (&#8776;3100&#160;K), and stable color performance, indicating that the as&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;grain phosphors are excellent candidates for healthy full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum lighting. This innovation is expected to accelerate the development of full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum phosphors technology and inspires the creation of more efficient and versatile luminescent materials in the future.

         <title>Modulated Multicomponent Reaction Pathway by Pore&#8208;Confinement Effect in MOFs for Highly Efficient Catalysis of Low&#8208;Concentration CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully modulated reaction pathway in the multicomponent reaction of propargylic amines, phosphine oxide and CO2 through the confinement effect of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as a catalyst. The MOF with pores of 6.5&#8197;&#197;&#215;6.5&#8197;&#197; can selectively permit the entry of propargylamine and CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations, preferentially react to form oxazolidinones, which further react with the phosphine oxide outside the pores to produce the final product. This result in high catalytic performance and excellent substrate generality.







Abstract
The conversion of flue gas CO2 into high&#8208;value chemicals via multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offers the advantages of atom economy, bond&#8208;formation efficiency and product complexity. However, because of the competition between reaction sequences and pathways among substrates, the efficient synthesize the desired product is a great challenge. Herein, a porous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free framework (Cu&#8208;TCA) was synthesized, which can highly effectively catalyze the multicomponent conversion of CO2 by modulating reaction pathways. The pores with the size of 6.5&#8197;&#197;&#215;6.5&#8197;&#197; in Cu&#8208;TCA selectively permit the entry of propargylamine and CO2 at simulated flue gas concentrations, At the same time, the larger&#8208;sized phosphine oxide is hindered outside the pores. Control experiments and NMR spectroscopy revealed that CO2 and propargylamine in the pores preferentially reacted to form oxazolidinones, which further reacted with phosphine oxide outside the pores to produce phosphorylated 2&#8208;oxazolidinones. Therefore, the reaction pathways and sequence of the substrates were controlled by the confinement effect of the pores in Cu&#8208;TCA. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the coordination of Cu&#8208;TCA with the alkyne, significantly reducing the reaction barrier and promoting catalytic reaction. This study developed a new strategy for regulating the reaction pathways to promote MCRs via the confinement effect of MOF.

&lt;p&gt;We successfully modulated reaction pathway in the multicomponent reaction of propargylic amines, phosphine oxide and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through the confinement effect of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as a catalyst. The MOF with pores of 6.5&#8197;&#197;&#215;6.5&#8197;&#197; can selectively permit the entry of propargylamine and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at simulated flue gas concentrations, preferentially react to form oxazolidinones, which further react with the phosphine oxide outside the pores to produce the final product. This result in high catalytic performance and excellent substrate generality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversion of flue gas CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into high-value chemicals via multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offers the advantages of atom economy, bond-formation efficiency and product complexity. However, because of the competition between reaction sequences and pathways among substrates, the efficient synthesize the desired product is a great challenge. Herein, a porous noble-metal-free framework (&lt;b&gt;Cu-TCA)&lt;/b&gt; was synthesized, which can highly effectively catalyze the multicomponent conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by modulating reaction pathways. The pores with the size of 6.5&#8197;&#197;&#215;6.5&#8197;&#197; in &lt;b&gt;Cu-TCA&lt;/b&gt; selectively permit the entry of propargylamine and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at simulated flue gas concentrations, At the same time, the larger-sized phosphine oxide is hindered outside the pores. Control experiments and NMR spectroscopy revealed that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and propargylamine in the pores preferentially reacted to form oxazolidinones, which further reacted with phosphine oxide outside the pores to produce phosphorylated 2-oxazolidinones. Therefore, the reaction pathways and sequence of the substrates were controlled by the confinement effect of the pores in &lt;b&gt;Cu-TCA&lt;/b&gt;. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the coordination of &lt;b&gt;Cu-TCA&lt;/b&gt; with the alkyne, significantly reducing the reaction barrier and promoting catalytic reaction. This study developed a new strategy for regulating the reaction pathways to promote MCRs via the confinement effect of MOF.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mussel Foot Protein Membrane&#8208;Enclosed Crystalline Drug with Zero&#8208;Order Release Kinetics for Long&#8208;Acting Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a mussel foot protein (Mfp) membrane&#8208;enclosed zero&#8208;order controlled release system by biomimicking the working principle of the mussel plaque. The thin membrane forms directly in situ on the surface of the crystalline drugs, achieving a high drug&#8208;loading capability. In streptozotocin&#8208;induced type 1 diabetic mice, a single injection of Mfp&#8208;encapsulated insulin crystals can maintain blood glucose at normoglycemia for a week. Similarly, in healthy rats, a single injection of Mfp&#8208;encapsulated progesterone crystals can maintain its plasma drug concentration for up to one week.







Abstract
Injectable formulations with sustained and steady release capabilities are critically required to treat diseases requiring temporary or lifelong continuous therapy, especially for drugs with a short half&#8208;life. Additionally, achieving a sufficiently high drug loading in a single dose remains a persistent challenge. Herein, by mimicking the formation principles of mussel adhesive plaques, we have developed membrane&#8208;enclosed crystalline systems of insulin and progesterone as model macro&#8208; and small&#8208;molecular crystalline drugs. The system exhibits a substantial drug loading capacity (&gt;90&#8201;%). It exhibits sustained and zero&#8208;order release kinetics, thereby facilitating the establishment of a subcutaneous reservoir containing a substantial drug load, enabling progressive and continuous release of the drug into the body. One single injection of membrane&#8208;enclosed insulin crystal can maintain normoglycemia in diabetic mice for up to 7&#8197;days. Meanwhile, membrane&#8208;coated progesterone crystals can sustain drug release in rats for over 7&#8197;days. The protein membrane can be cleared from the injection sites in 35&#8197;days. This system can serve as a versatile platform for the sustained release of various crystalline pharmaceuticals and the treatment of distinct diseases.

         <title>Polychromatic Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Single Heteroligand Metal&#8211;Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a series of heteroligand MOFs composting of porphyrin and pyrene ligands as crystalline emitters for polychromatic ECL imaging. Due to rational conjugated spacing of MOF, it exhibits excellent energy transfer efficiency and unique polychromatic ECL imaging characteristics, providing the first instance of single MOF crystals in ECL imaging.








Abstract
Conventional polychromatic electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging is realized with the several separated luminophores at the different potentials. In this study, an emerging polychromatic ECL imaging system was constructed based on single heteroligand metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) crystals as nanoemitters through an intrareticular energy transfer process. The heteroligand MOF crystals, named h&#8208;NJU&#8208;241, were coassembled of meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) with 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(p&#8208;benzoic acid)pyrene (TBAPy) ligand using benzoic acid catalyst with coordination ability, leading to the conjugated spacing of 0.624&#160;nm between two ligands. Remarkably, an energy transfer efficiency of 92.2% was achieved when the coordination weight ratio of TCPP acceptor and TBAPy donor was only 1.87&#8240;. Different from monoligand MOFs, the heteroligand h&#8208;NJU&#8208;241 exhibits dual ECL emissions in both blue and red regions at one step applied potential, which is first example of polychromatic ECL imaging for single MOF crystals. Furthermore, by adjusting the reaction conditions, the morphology distribution of porphyrin within the crystal can be dynamically controlled, providing a tailored crystal platform for decoding fundamentals in polychromatic ECL imaging.

         <title>Pd Ensemble Sites Tuned Local Environment of Cu Catalysts for Matching Propyne Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction pathways of catalytic hydrogenations exemplified by the propyne hydrogenation here are obediently regulated by manipulating the local environments. The presence of Pd ensemble sites is shown to enable a facile dissociation of hydrogen and control the hydrogenation via the semi&#8208;hydrogenation pathway, which contributes to high activity and selectivity for propyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.








Abstract
Tailoring local environments of active sites to match targeted configuration of key species is significant for controlling reaction pathways in selective hydrogenations. Herein, differently typed Pd sites are introduced onto Cu catalysts to tune the local environment of Cu sites for controlling the configuration of semi&#8208;hydrogenation pathway of propyne hydrogenation used in production of polymer&#8208;grade propylene. Detailed structure characterizations demonstrate the controllable construction of Pd single&#8208;atom and Pd ensemble sites modified Cu surfaces and PdCu alloy via fine tuning the Pd/Cu ratios. Catalytic tests, kinetics analysis, and temperature&#8208;programmed experiments demonstrate that the presence of Pd ensemble sites on Cu surface directly catalyzes the hydrogenation of propyne that occurs on the Cu sites in other cases, and enables a facile activation for hydrogen and simultaneously promotes the desorption of propylene against its hydrogenation. Accordingly, the selectivity to target propylene is up to 95.3% at the full conversion of propyne on the corresponding Pd0.1Cu catalyst. In contrast, the C&#9472;C coupling pathway is quite facile on the Cu surface tuned by single&#8208;atom Pd sites, which is similar to that on the pristine Cu sites on the Cu catalyst, and the well&#8208;defined Pd&#9472;Cu coordination on PdCu alloy catalyst leads to facile over&#8208;hydrogenation process.

         <title>Luminescent Alkylaluminium Anthranilates Reaching Unity Quantum Yield in the Condensed Phase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tetrameric alkylaluminium anthranilates have been synthesised that&#160;exhibit poor&#8208;to&#8208;excellent photoluminescence performance. In one of the complexes,&#160;intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions have been found to lead to a unity photoluminescence quantum yield in the condensed phase.







Abstract
Transition, post&#8208;transition and rare earth metal complexes supported by (O,N)&#8208; and (N,N)&#8208;type ligands dominate organometallic photochemistry. However, despite a vast number of aminobenzoate metal complexes having been reported, and aluminium being globally abundant, alkylaluminium anthranilates have not yet been considered as effective luminophores. Herein, using a family of commercially available ligands composed of anthranilic acid (anth&#8208;H2) and its N&#8208;substituted derivatives, we report the isolation and characterisation of a series of unique tetrameric chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal alkylaluminium anthranilates, [(R'&#8208;anth)AlR]4. The resulting compounds are characterised using spectroscopic methods and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction to analyse structure&#8208;determining factors in the solid state and solution. Moreover, by changing the N&#8208;substituents from H to Me and Ph, we have yielded a series of luminophores that exhibit poor&#8208;to&#8208;excellent performance, providing a [(Ph&#8208;anth)AlEt]4 derivative that achieves a unity photoluminescence quantum yield in the condensed phase, which is unprecedented for aluminium complexes.

         <title>Arrangement of Ordered D&#8211;A Components in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Cocatalyst&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordered D&#8211;A components in MOFs provide a driving force for the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, resulting in excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity without additional cocatalysts. Due to the arrayed uncoordinated carboxyl groups, D&#8211;A MOFs form dual channels for rapid proton transfer. Efficient charge separation and fast proton transport kinetics of the D&#8211;A MOFs promote the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The arrangement of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) components in order at a molecular level provides a means to achieve efficient electron&#8208;hole separation for promoting the activity of photocatalysts. Herein, we report the coordination assembly of D&#8211;A molecules with desired staggered energy levels in two isostructural metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) 1 and 2, which exhibit high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity without using any cocatalysts and photosensitizers. The modulation of active metal sites of the D&#8211;A MOFs leads to an increase in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates from 1260 to 3218&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1. A detailed mechanism study revealed that the energy bond defined by the D&#8211;A components assisted with metal centers is the key to efficiently generating photogenerated charge carriers, and 2 has an appropriate affinity to proton to reduce the energy barrier for hydrogen evolution. Besides, the enhanced proton transport kinetics based on the arrayed free carboxyl groups in the hydrogen&#8208;bonded network endows 2 with higher proton conductivity than 1, thus promoting the usage rate of active metal sites in 2 for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics.

         <title>Lithium Anionic Dicarbenes or Acetylides: What is in the Name?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;fold deprotonation of the C2&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolium salts with nBuLi affords the so&#8208;called lithium anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC). X&#8208;Ray diffraction studies reveal that Li(ADC) exist as lithium acetylides Li(ACT). Exposure of Li(ACT) to CO2 and N2O readily afford ADC&#8208;compounds Li[(ADC)(CO2)2] and Li[(ADC)N2O], respectively.







Abstract
The two&#8208;fold deprotonation of the C2&#8208;arylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolium salts (IPr&#8208;Ar)X (1&#8208;Ar)X (IPr&#8208;Ar = ArC{N(Dipp)CH}2; Ar = Ph, 4&#8208;Me2NC6H4 (DMP) or 4&#8208;PhC6H4 (Bp); Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with nBuLi affords the so&#8208;called anionic dicarbenes Li(ADC) (2&#8208;Ar) (ADC = ArC{N(Dipp)C}2). 2&#8208;Ar can be used to prepare a variety of main group heterocycles, however their structures in the solid&#8208;state remained hitherto unknown. Herein reported single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal an acetylide type [ArC{N(Dipp)}(Dipp)NC&#8801;CLi)]n (3&#8208;Ar) dimeric (n = 2) or trimeric (n = 3) molecular structure for 2&#8208;Ar. Treatment of 3&#8208;Ph with Et3B cleanly yields the monoanionic carbene Li[(ADC)(BEt3)] (4&#8208;Ph) featuring a weakly coordinating anion embedded in the same molecular entity. 3&#8208;Ar readily undergo reactions with CO2 and N2O to form the ring&#8208;closing products Li[(ADC)(CO2)2] (5&#8208;Ar) and Li[(ADC)N2O] (6&#8208;Ar), respectively.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Engineered Hydrophilic Perovskite Enabling Surface Potential&#8208;Driven Anions Exchange for Multicolor Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The geometric preorganization induced by C=C bonds in unsaturated alkylamines and the &#8220;bridge&#8221; effect of haloalkanoic acids are harnessed to promote the SN2 reaction and design zwitterionic ligands, enabling CsPbBr3 NCs with hydrophilicity and a 100&#8201;% PLQY. Based on the positive surface potential&#8208;driven fast anion exchange (FAE) reaction, AgI NPs are developed as latent anion exchangers, realizing multicolor biosensing with H2S as an example.







Abstract
The difficulty in designing zwitterionic ligands impedes the water&#8208;dispersed CsPbX3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) and their application as fast anion exchange (FAE) probes in biosensing. This study proposes a design paradigm for zwitterionic ligands predicated upon revealing the mechanism of the SN2 reaction between unsaturated alkylamines (Cn&#8242;) and haloalkanoic acids (HAAs). Among them, the C=C bond can enhance the nucleophilicity of Cn&#8242; and promote the electrostatic adsorption of HAAs onto Cn&#8242;, i.e., the geometric preorganization process, thereby initiating the SN2 reaction. Moreover, an appropriate &#8220;bridge&#8221; length enables HAAs to balance the geometric preorganization process and the Sigma hole intensity of the C&#8722;Br bond. Zwitterionic ligands derived from oleylamine (C18&#8242;) and 5&#8208;bromovaleric acid (5&#8208;BVA) endow CsPbBr3 NCs with water dispersibility, an almost 100&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield, and enhanced surface potential, facilitating the capture of halide ions and driving the FAE reaction. Using AgI nanoparticles (NPs) as latent anion exchangers, a third FAE strategy is presented for multicolor biosensing. Such a robust biosensing strategy can generate wavelength shift and chromatic difference for biological target molecules, exemplified by H2S, and is ultimately applicable to multicolor assay in biological, environmental and food samples, demonstrating the immense potential of perovskite&#8208;based FAE probes in biosensing.

         <title>Enhancing the Reversibility and Kinetics of Heterovalent Ion&#8208;Substituted Mn&#8208;Based Prussian Blue Analogue Cathodes via Intervalence Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) of manganese and iron to vanadium ions in the design of Prussian blue analogues (PBA) cathodes for SIBs is verified and series of novel V3+&#8208;substituted MnPBA are successfully prepared. The optimized Na1.2V0.63Mn0.58Fe(CN)6 cathode demonstrates incredible rate capability (94.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and remarkable long&#8208;cycle stability, surpassing the majority of reported sodium&#8208;ion cathodes.







Abstract
Mn3+ (d4) in manganese&#8208;based Prussian blue analogues (MnPBA) exhibits intrinsic orbital degeneracy upon sodiation/desodiation, resulting in severe Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, which usually causes rapid capacity decay and sluggish kinetics. Unfortunately, traditional modification strategies are insufficient for electronic tuning of Mn3+ to mitigate these issues. Herein, Intervalence Charge Transfer (IVCT) of manganese and iron to vanadium ions is unraveled in a series of novel V3+&#8208;substituted MnPBA to enhance electrochemical reaction reversibility and kinetics. IVCT drives electron distribution from localized to delocalized, achieves electronic coupling, and mitigates Jahn&#8211;Teller by transferring a single&#8208;electron of Mn3+ eg orbital. Notably, the reported Na1.2V0.63Mn0.58Fe(CN)6 cathode demonstrates excellent rate capability (136.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 94.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), remarkable long&#8208;cycle stability (91.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 90.7&#8201;% after 2000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and robust performance across a wide temperature range (98.59&#8201;% capacity after 300 cycles at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C and 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), surpassing the majority of reported sodium&#8208;ion cathodes. The intrinsic functioning mechanism of IVCT and quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;strain reaction mechanism were adequately understood through systematic in situ/ex situ characterizations. This study further develops electron&#8208;tuning of PBA, opening a new avenue toward advanced sodium&#8208;ion battery cathode materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) in manganese-based Prussian blue analogues (MnPBA) exhibits intrinsic orbital degeneracy upon sodiation/desodiation, resulting in severe Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, which usually causes rapid capacity decay and sluggish kinetics. Unfortunately, traditional modification strategies are insufficient for electronic tuning of Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to mitigate these issues. Herein, Intervalence Charge Transfer (IVCT) of manganese and iron to vanadium ions is unraveled in a series of novel V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-substituted MnPBA to enhance electrochemical reaction reversibility and kinetics. IVCT drives electron distribution from localized to delocalized, achieves electronic coupling, and mitigates Jahn&#8211;Teller by transferring a single-electron of Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; orbital. Notably, the reported Na&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;0.63&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.58&lt;/sub&gt;Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cathode demonstrates excellent rate capability (136.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 94.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), remarkable long-cycle stability (91.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 90.7&#8201;% after 2000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and robust performance across a wide temperature range (98.59&#8201;% capacity after 300 cycles at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C and 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), surpassing the majority of reported sodium-ion cathodes. The intrinsic functioning mechanism of IVCT and quasi-zero-strain reaction mechanism were adequately understood through systematic in situ/ex situ characterizations. This study further develops electron-tuning of PBA, opening a new avenue toward advanced sodium-ion battery cathode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Chemistry in a Capillary Applied to the Facilitation of the Crystalline Sponge Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;One&#8208;droplet&#8221; host&#8211;guest chemistry was achieved by using a glass capillary, enabling the efficient crystallization and structure determination of various host&#8211;guest complexes. Two coordination hosts, the cage and the crystalline sponge (CS), were examined. Notably, using a capillary addressed several persistent technical challenges in the CS method, greatly simplifying and accelerating the analysis of molecular structures.







Abstract
Capillary is a handy tool for transferring, mixing, and storing small volumes of liquid. Here, we show that the stepwise dipping of host and guest solutions into a capillary allows efficient preparation, crystallization, and X&#8208;ray analysis of various host&#8211;guest complexes. The crystals formed in capillaries are comparable in quality to those grown in regular flasks and subjected to X&#8208;ray analysis without being removed from the capillary. We further apply the capillary technique to the crystalline sponge method, a practical domain of host&#8211;guest chemistry, successfully overcoming several technical issues.

         <title>Functional SELEX and Biomedical Applications of Aptamers: Beyond Molecular Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamers, developed through SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment), are generally short oligonucleotide molecules with remarkable specificity and binding affinity to diverse biological targets. These molecules have shown promise across such fields as biosensing, molecular diagnostics, and bioimaging. However, while conventional aptamer selection strategies predominantly emphasize binding affinity, they overlook the broader spectrum of potential biological functionalities. This oversight results in aptamers that frequently exhibit limited capacity for direct biological regulation. This inherent limitation in the selection process significantly constrains both the widespread application of aptamers across diverse fields and their therapeutic potential as direct drug candidates. Functional SELEX represents an advancement by refining selection library construction and selection processes to create F&#8208;aptamers that integrate precise molecular recognition with specific biological activities. F&#8208;aptamers hold transformative potential as therapeutic agents, diagnostic tools, and molecular regulators, marking a significant step forward in biomedical applications. This minireview critically assesses recent developments in F&#8208;aptamer SELEX strategies, addressing challenges and exploring opportunities for future research in this dynamic field.</dc:description>

Remarkably, the novel 1,1&#8208;dilithiostannane exhibits three distinct structural motifs in the solid state, which are determined by the synthesis conditions: (1)&#8197;an unsolvated co&#8208;aggregate of two 1,1&#8208;dilithiostannanes with two silyllithium molecules; (2)&#8197;an ionic solvated trimeric stannyllithium dianion associated with two THF&#8208;solvated Li+ cations; (3)&#8197;a THF&#8208;solvated dimeric contact&#8208;ion pair of 1,1&#8208;dilithiostannane.

         <title>Re and Ru Co&#8208;Doped Transition Metal Alloy as a Bifunctional Catalyst for Electrooxidation of Glycerol to Formate Coupled with H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru and Re co&#8208;doped NiCoFe alloy exhibited efficient electrooxidation of glycerol to formate. By employing NiCoFeRuRe as a bifunctional catalyst, the cell is constructed to produce hydrogen and formate simultaneously with a stable operation over 450&#8197;h.







Abstract
Glycerol electrooxidation (GOR), as an innovative strategy for the production of value&#8208;added chemicals, is considered a promising anodic alternative to oxygen evolution reaction in electrocatalysis. However, the high potential and the limited selectivity and faradaic efficiency impede the industrial&#8208;scale application toward GOR. Herein, we for the first time constructed rhenium and ruthenium co&#8208;doped transition metal alloy (NiCoFeRuRe) for the efficient electrooxidation of glycerol to formate. Benefiting from the rapid generation of M3+&#8208;OOH induced by Ru element and the inhibition of OER and excessive oxidation of glycerol by Re species through in situ chacterization, the optimized NiCoFeRuRe requires only 1.133 VRHE to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a faradaic efficiency of 95.6&#8201;% for formate product with a stability more than 450&#8197;h. Importantly, employing NiCoFeRuRe as a bifunctional catalyst, the cell is constructed to produce hydrogen and formate simultaneously, which is 265&#8197;mV lower than the electrolytic water splitting owning an excellent stability of 350&#8197;h. This work provides a facile strategy for rationally designing high&#8208;performance GOR catalysts for biomass upgradings.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Induced Quantum Confinement of Negative Charge Carriers by Organic Nanoporous Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We characterize the attachment of excess&#8208;electrons to organic nanoporous systems such as molecular nanohoops and models of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) using many&#8208;body methods. All the nanopore systems exhibit diffuse electronic states where the excess&#8208;electron is bound to the molecular scaffold via long&#8208;range polarization forces, and the excess&#8208;electron is predominantly localized in the interior of the nanopore or away from the molecular scaffold. Such ``nanopore&#8208;bound'' states show an enhanced electron&#8208;transfer coupling compared to more strongly&#8208;bound skeletal&#8208;states (or valence&#8208;bound states), where the excess&#8208;electron is confined to the molecular skeleton. For 1D assemblies of nanohoops,&#160; the bands formed from nanopore&#8208;bound states have a consistent nearly&#8208;free&#8208;electron character, indicating an efficient excited&#8208;state pathway for charge&#8208;carriers, while the bands from skeletal&#8208;states have higher effective mass along certain lattice directions. The nanopore&#8208;bound states show distinct size&#8208;dependent variations in electron affinities compared to skeletal&#8208;states and previously observed molecular quantum corral states. We conclude that nanopore&#8208;bound states emerge from polarization&#8208;induced quantum confinement, forming a distinct common feature of organic nanoporous matter with potential for efficient electron&#8208;transport.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We characterize the attachment of excess-electrons to organic nanoporous systems such as molecular nanohoops and models of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) using many-body methods. All the nanopore systems exhibit diffuse electronic states where the excess-electron is bound to the molecular scaffold via long-range polarization forces, and the excess-electron is predominantly localized in the interior of the nanopore or away from the molecular scaffold. Such ``nanopore-bound'' states show an enhanced electron-transfer coupling compared to more strongly-bound skeletal-states (or valence-bound states), where the excess-electron is confined to the molecular skeleton. For 1D assemblies of nanohoops,&#160; the bands formed from nanopore-bound states have a consistent nearly-free-electron character, indicating an efficient excited-state pathway for charge-carriers, while the bands from skeletal-states have higher effective mass along certain lattice directions. The nanopore-bound states show distinct size-dependent variations in electron affinities compared to skeletal-states and previously observed molecular quantum corral states. We conclude that nanopore-bound states emerge from polarization-induced quantum confinement, forming a distinct common feature of organic nanoporous matter with potential for efficient electron-transport.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Catalysts with Fe Single Atoms and Fe3C Clusters for Accelerated Oxygen Adsorption Kinetics in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of cost&#8208;effective and efficient catalysts based on transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial yet challenging for energy&#8208;conversion devices like metal&#8208;air batteries. In this work, we present a cost&#8208;effective strategy for preparing catalysts consisting of single&#8208;atomic Fe sites and Fe3C clusters encapsulated in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers (FeSA&#8208;Fe3C/NC). The FeSA&#8208;Fe3C/NC electrocatalyst demonstrates outstanding ORR performance in alkaline electrolytes, achieving a high half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2 = 0.902 V), 4e&#8208; ORR selectivity, and robust methanol tolerance. The exceptional ORR catalytic performance is credited to the relatively substantial specific surface area and the optimal arrangement of active sites, including atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N sites and synergistic Fe3C clusters. In situ spectroelectrochemical characterization and theoretical calculations verify that Fe3C clusters disrupt the symmetric electronic structure of Fe&#8208;N4, optimizing 3d orbitals of Fe centers, thereby accelerating O&#8208;O bond cleavage in *OOH to boost ORR activity. Furthermore, a zinc&#8208;air battery constructed with FeSA&#8208;Fe3C/NC demonstrates excellent potential in energy storage application, yielding a maximum power density of 151.3 mW cm&#8208;2 and robust cycling durability surpassing that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. This study establishes a cost&#8208;effective route for producing metal&#8208;based carbon electrocatalysts with exceptional performance using environmentally friendly raw materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoding Double Layer Dynamics for CO2 Electroreduction over Cu</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding of the nature and role of the electric double layer (EDL) at electrocatalytic interfaces&#160;is critical to optimizing electrochemical processes such as the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Despite its postulated influence on CO2RR activity, direct spectroscopic evidence of the complex interplay between EDL structure and reaction kinetics remains&#160;elusive. Here, we introduce Dynamic Response Spectroscopy (DRS), a novel approach that isolates spectroscopic signatures of key physicochemical features of the EDL, including the compact (interfacial) layer and the diffuse double layer based on their time&#8208;variance profiles. By analyzing multi dimensional time&#8208;variance within a matrix of time&#8208;resolved infrared spectral data recorded during sequential potential steps, we reveal that EDL equilibration is not continuous but involves discrete restructuring events. These sudden EDL reorganizations correlate with the rapid adsorption and conversion of CO2 to CO. Furthermore, we show that saturation of aqueous NaHCO3 electrolytes with CO2, as opposed to Ar, induces more frequent and pronounced water reorientation in the diffuse double layer, characterized by less ice&#8208;like ordering and increased randomness. These findings provide novel insights into the dynamic nature of the EDL and its synergistic role in electrocatalysis, establishing a&#160; paradigm to better understand, and thus optimize electrochemical systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of R3PNNPR3 species with Boranes: Classical Adducts, FLPs and Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the nature of bis&#8208;phosphazine species are of much interest, there are few reports of their reactivity. Herein, we show that the bis&#8208;phosphazine species Ph3PNNPPh31 react with Lewis acids to give the Lewis acid adducts Ph3PNN(B(C6F5)3)PPh33 and Ph3PN(BF3)N(BF3)PPh34. Compound 1 also generates a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) in the presence of BPh3 and thermolysis of 1/BPh3, or 3 at 80 &#176;C released N2 while 4 was stable at 80 &#176;C. In contrast, the species Cy3PNNPCy32 reacted with B(C6F5)3 to effect single electron transfer affording a frustrated radical pair (FRP). Independent reactions of 1 and 2 with [Cp2Fe][BF4] gave the corresponding radical salts [R3PNNPR3]&#8226;+[BF4] (R = Cy 5b Ph 6). Structural and computational data show the N&#8208;N bond is strengthened in the bis&#8208;phosphazine radical cation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile&#160;Route to Shape Polymer Nanoparticles by Deforming Nanoreactors Made from Magnetic Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directions are equivalent in an amorphous system, so anisotropy cannot emerge of its own accord, resulting in a gap for preparing polymer nanoparticles deviating from a spherical shape. Unlike inorganic nanocrystals for which faceting controls shape, polymers are not directly available as rod&#8208;like particles, for instance. Here, we show a highly versatile, non&#8208;toxic, novel approach to break this paradigm and obtain polymer nanorods by emulsion polymerization using a unique surfactant comprising a magnetic head group. Surprisingly, even applying a weak magnetic field to the magnetic surfactant within an emulsion polymerization transforms diamagnetic polymers into rod&#8208;like nanoparticles instead of their usual spherical shapes. The polarization in a magnetic field exerts a torque on the molecular structure, and as a result, the emulsion droplets deform. The method can be applied to arbitrary polymers, and it is demonstrated here for multiple polymers. The magnetic surfactant is recovered quantitatively and can be reused; one obtains metal&#8208;free polymer particles, and the process is sustainable. The straightforward approach presented here will unlock several applications of these previously inaccessible polymer nanorods, particularly in the case of conducting polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Biaryl Phosphates and Phosphonates&#160;as Selective Inhibitors of the Transcription Factor STAT4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transcription factor STAT4 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus. Here, we report p&#8208;biaryl phosphates and phosphonates as the first small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of STAT4. The most potent p&#8208;biaryl phosphate inhibited the protein&#8208;protein interaction domain of STAT4, the SH2 domain, with submicromolar potency (Ki = 0.35 &#181;M) and 14&#8208;fold selectivity over the closely related family member STAT3, which has the same core peptide binding motif as STAT4. Further development resulted in the phosphatase&#8208;stable inhibitor Stafori&#8208;1, which protected STAT4, but not STAT3, against thermal denaturation in cell lysates. Its cell&#8208;permeable prodrug Pomstafori&#8208;1 selectively inhibited STAT4 phosphorylation in cultured human cells at low micromolar concentrations. Our data open up the possibility of exploring STAT4 as a target protein for small molecules in the treatment of unmet medical needs.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium(III) Carbene Complexes Featuring either Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer (MLCT) or Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer (TSCT) Blue Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) rather than the commonly postulated metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) process was proposed in getting the lowest lying excited state of newly designed Ir(III) blue phosphors. Accordingly, two benzo[d]imidazolylidene pro&#8208;chelates L12H2+ and L13H2+, one with two cyano groups at the peri&#8208;benzo and N&#8208;aryl pendent and the other with its peri&#8208;cyano group being replaced with methyl substituent, were employed in syntheses of Ir(III) complexes f&#8208;ct12b,c and f&#8208;ct13b,c. Notably, complexes f&#8208;ct12b,c exhibited the traditional MLCT process, while f&#8208;ct13b,c were dominated by the TSCT transition, resulting in a smaller S1&#8208;T1 energy gap &#916;EST. Next, it prompted us to explore whether their long&#8208;lived emission was originated from phosphorescence or thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Although temperature&#8208;dependent emission studies favor TADF, the unresolved concerns are still discussed in depth. For application, OLED with the TSCT based dopant f&#8208;ct13b delivered a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.2% and a max. luminance of 10000 cd m&#8210;2, together with CIExy of (0.155, 0.120). Moreover, the hyper&#8208;OLED with f&#8208;ct13c sensitizer and v&#8208;DABNA terminal emitter exhibited a max. EQE of 28.2% and CIExy of (0.123, 0.129), demonstrating a new approach in developing efficient Ir(III) blue phosphors.</dc:description>

Notably, complexes f-ct12b,c exhibited the traditional MLCT process, while f-ct13b,c were dominated by the TSCT transition, resulting in a smaller S1-T1 energy gap &#916;EST. Next, it prompted us to explore whether their long-lived emission was originated from phosphorescence or thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Although temperature-dependent emission studies favor TADF, the unresolved concerns are still discussed in depth. For application, OLED with the TSCT based dopant f-ct13b delivered a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.2% and a max. luminance of 10000 cd m&#8210;2, together with CIExy of (0.155, 0.120). Moreover, the hyper-OLED with f-ct13c sensitizer and v-DABNA terminal emitter exhibited a max. EQE of 28.2% and CIExy of (0.123, 0.129), demonstrating a new approach in developing efficient Ir(III) blue phosphors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Olefin Radical Based Thiele&#8242;s Hydrocarbon Derivative and Macrocyclic Tetraradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A persistent Thiele&#8242;s hydrocarbon derivative, containing two five&#8208;membered dioxoborocyclic monoradical units bridged by a p&#8208;phenylene, was generated. It exhibits an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a large singlet&#8722;triplet energy gap. A macrocyclic molecule, composed of two units of the Thiele&#8242;s hydrocarbon derivative, was also prepared. The macrocyclic molecule possesses an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state but with considerable tetraradical character. The diradical and tetraradical compounds can be viewed as a zwitterionic species containing olefin radical cations. These newly formed compounds are stable both in the solid state and solution under inert atmosphere for several days. They have been fully investigated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR, EPR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, and SQUID measurements, as well as theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Linear and Cyclic Poly(allenamer)s by Powerful Cyclic&#8211;Alkyl&#8211;Amino&#8211;Carbene (CAAC) Ruthenium Catalysts and Facile Post&#8208;modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic polymers are very attractive due to their unique properties, however so far, have simple and less reactive backbone structures due to synthetic limitations, restricting their further post&#8208;modification. Notably, allenes present a potentially useful platform in polymer chemistry due to their well&#8208;established toolbox in organic chemistry. Nevertheless, the biggest challenge remains in synthesizing poly(allenamer)s with high allene contents or polymerization efficiency, as well as synthesizing different types of cyclic poly(allenamer)s. Herein, we synthesized linear and cyclic poly(allenamer)s via ring&#8211;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and ring&#8211;expansion metathesis polymerization (REMP), employing highly efficient cyclic&#8211;alkyl&#8211;amino&#8211;carbene (CAAC) ruthenium catalysts. Mechanistic studies suggested CAAC ligands enhanced stability of propagating Ru vinylidene, enabling various linear and cyclic poly(allenamer)s with turnover number up to 1360 and molecular weight reaching 549 kDa. Their cyclic architecture was thoroughly characterized by multi&#8208;angle light scattering (MALS) SEC with viscometer. Moreover, controlled ROMP of a highly reactive &#945;&#8211;substituted cyclic allene was achieved using third&#8211;generation Grubbs' catalyst. Finally, we demonstrated highly efficient and selective post&#8208;modifications on poly(allenamer)s with primary and secondary alcohols. This broadens the scope of cyclic polymers with improved efficiency and structural control, affording a practical platform for diverse macromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Impact of Polysulfide Solvation Structure on Electrical Double Layer Chemistry in Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries are garnering attention for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, their practical application is hindered by challenges, such as the shuttle effect of sodium polysulfides (NaPS) and dendrite growth. The high solubility of NaPS in the electrolyte is particularly problematic. It disrupts electron transfer and obstructs mass transport in the electrical double layer (EDL) region. The EDL plays a pivotal role governing the interfacial chemistry between the electrode and electrolyte, significantly impacting the overall electrochemical performance. Through simulations and experimental screening of various solvents, including 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and tetrahydropyran (THP), along with ethyl 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl ether (ETFE) as a diluent, the relationship between NaPS solvation structure and EDL chemistry has been elucidated. Our findings reveal that THP&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) not only reduces the solubility of NaPS by altering its solvation structure, but also promotes the formation of a stable inorganic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and improves compatibility with sodium metal. Consequently, Na&#8208;S batteries with LHCE&#8208;THP/ETFE exhibit long&#8208;term stability over 500 cycles at 1C rate with a capacity decay rate of only 0.07% per cycle. This study provides a methodology for designing electrolytes based on molecular structure, polysulfides solvation properties, and EDL interfacial chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>An ultra robust tough, stretchable, and super high elastic recovery supramolecular elastomer resulting from hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction by sp2 hybridized boron&#8208;urethane bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elastomers are omnipresent in everyday life and industry, yet the development of an elastomer with both superb stress and toughness presents a prodigious challenge. In this report, a high&#8208;strength, tough, and high&#8208;elastic elastomer derived from sp2 hybrid orbitals of phenylboronic acid was designed. The spatial conformation of network becomes significantly more compact due to the sp2 hybridization of boron. This enhances supramolecular hydrogen bonding interactions, resulting in a marked improvement in the material&#8217;s mechanical properties. Notably, the hydrogen bonding energy in the polyurethane chain segments enhanced by 37%. The robust hydrogen bonding imparts the elastomer with super high true stress (1.30 GPa), superior toughness (442.2 MJ&#183;m&#8208;3), and super puncture resistance strength of 167.8 N&#183;mm&#8208;1. The material exhibited excellent fatigue resistance during continuous tensile cycles, while the irreversible deformation disappeared after standing at room temperature. Moreover, the elastomer bespeaks extraordinary elastic restorability, swiftly reverting to its primitive length after being extended to 16 times. This work provides a strategy that the mechanical properties of materials can be enhanced and toughened by utilizing spatial conformational changes in intermolecular interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Double Sb&#8208;N Coordination Enables Record&#8208;High Birefringence in UV&#8208;Transparent Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high birefringence in ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;transparent crystals has remained a significant challenge due to the absence of systematic design methodologies. Herein, we present a novel organic&#8208;inorganic coordination strategy that combines &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic ligands ([C12H8N2]) with inorganic Sb&#8208;based polyhedra featuring stereochemically active lone pairs. This approach facilitates the formation of the first coplanar double Sb&#8208;N coordination framework, enabling the synthesis of two new birefringent hybrid crystals: (C12H8N2)SbF2(H2PO3) (PNSP) and (C12H8N2)SbF3 (PNSF). Notably, PNSF demonstrates an unprecedented birefringence of 0.79 at 546 nm, exceeding all known UV&#8208;transparent birefringent materials to date. These results not only expand the performance limits of birefringent hybrid crystals but also emphasize the pivotal role of stereochemically induced anisotropy in manipulating optical properties. Our study establishes a solid foundation for the rational design of next&#8208;generation optical materials, offering significant advancements for applications in cutting&#8208;edge photonic technologies, including UV polarizers and optical modulators.</dc:description>

         <title>Transaminase&#8208;Triggered Cascades for the Synthesis and Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Chiral N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalysis is now a well&#8208;established branch of catalysis and the growing toolbox of natural, evolved and designer enzymes is enabling chemistry previously deemed inaccessible. However, most enzyme methodologies have been developed for functional group interconversions, such as the conversion of a ketone to an amine or alcohol, and do not result in the generation of significant 3D molecular complexity. The application of enzyme&#8208;triggered reaction cascade methodologies has the potential to transform simple substrates into complex sp3&#8208;rich molecules in one step. Herein, we describe a single&#8208;step biocatalytic route to high&#8208;value, complex indolizidine and quinolizidine alkaloids, which relies on a transaminase&#8208;triggered double intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction. This approach allows access to architecturally complex, natural product&#8208;like N&#8208;heterocycles and reveals intriguing examples of diastereoselectivity in these enzyme&#8208;triggered reactions. Significantly, we demonstrate an elegant example of a biocatalytic cascade where the transaminase plays a dual role in generating complex N&#8208;heterocycles and where a retro&#8208;double intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael reaction mediates a dynamic kinetic resolution and enables the isolation of sp3&#8208;rich indolizidine diastereoisomers containing five stereocenters, as single isomers.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Biocatalysis is now a well-established branch of catalysis and the growing toolbox of natural, evolved and designer enzymes is enabling chemistry previously deemed inaccessible. However, most enzyme methodologies have been developed for functional group interconversions, such as the conversion of a ketone to an amine or alcohol, and do not result in the generation of significant 3D molecular complexity. The application of enzyme-triggered reaction cascade methodologies has the potential to transform simple substrates into complex sp3-rich molecules in one step. Herein, we describe a single-step biocatalytic route to high-value, complex indolizidine and quinolizidine alkaloids, which relies on a transaminase-triggered double intramolecular aza-Michael reaction. This approach allows access to architecturally complex, natural product-like N-heterocycles and reveals intriguing examples of diastereoselectivity in these enzyme-triggered reactions. Significantly, we demonstrate an elegant example of a biocatalytic cascade where the transaminase plays a dual role in generating complex N-heterocycles and where a retro-double intramolecular aza-Michael reaction mediates a dynamic kinetic resolution and enables the isolation of sp3-rich indolizidine diastereoisomers containing five stereocenters, as single isomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Gold Nanostructure Monolayers as SERS Substrates for Ultrasensitive Detection of Enantiomer Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitive and specific biomarkers are needed for early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, a new type of chiral gold nanostructure induced by D&#8208;/L&#8208;cysteine&#8208;leucine dipeptides&#160;with a g&#8208;factor of 0.1&#160;was successfully synthesized. To enhance the discrimination performance, the chiral gold nanostructures&#160;were assembled into D&#8208;/L&#8208;Au monolayers.&#160;As surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates, the&#160;D&#8208;/L&#8208;Au monolayers simultaneously deliver&#160;molecular structural specificity and enantioselectivity within a single spectrum, which can be&#160;a versatile, label&#8208;free chiral discrimination strategy for the detection of D&#8208;/L&#8208;kynurenine&#160;(Kyn). The mechanism was unveiled to involve high enantioselective adsorption energies between L&#8208; and D&#8208;Kyn on the lattice plane (221), resulting in enantioselective sensing.&#160;The results showed that L&#8208;Au monolayer&#160;reached a limit of detection (LOD)&#160;of 3.7 nM for&#160;L&#8208;Kyn,&#160;while D&#8208;Au monolayer&#160;reached a&#160;LOD of 3.6 nM&#160;for&#160;D&#8208;Kyn, respectively.&#160;Notably, there was a&#160;significant difference in D&#8208;Kyn&#160;levels&#160;between AD patients and healthy individuals in serum samples, a distinction not observed for L&#8208;Kyn, which&#160;positioned D&#8208;Kyn&#160;as a potential novel biomarker for clinical&#160;prediagnosis&#160;of AD patients, marking the first report of its kind worldwide.

         <title>DNA Framework&#8208;Ensembled Aptamers Enhance Fluid Stability in Circulating Tumor Cells Capture for Tumor Treatment Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a tetrahedral DNA framework (TDF) engineered multivalent aptamers (TEAn) with programmable ligands size and configuration, enabling high&#8208;efficiency capture of CTCs and accurate monitoring of clinical treatment progress. The precisely structured TEAn ensures the size&#8208;matching and cooperative hybridization with epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) clusters on cell membrane.








Abstract
The recognition and binding via receptor&#8208;ligand interactions on cell membranes often weaken in complex environments, such as whole blood samples from cancer patients, making disease diagnosis and treatment evaluation unfavorable. Constructing multivalent ligands with sufficient fluid stability in complex environments remains a challenge. Herein, we develop a tetrahedral DNA framework (TDF) ensembled multivalent aptamers (TEAn, n = 1&#8211;3) with programmable ligands size, enabling efficient capture of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and accurate monitoring of clinical treatment progress. The precisely structured TEAn ensures the size&#8208;matching and cooperative hybridization with epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) on cell membrane. Compared to traditional aptamer approach, the dissociation constants (Kd) of TEA3 exhibits &#8764;20&#8208;fold growth in serum due to its precise size and rigid DNA framework. This high&#8208;affinity interaction significantly enhances capture efficiency by improving fluid stability of TEAn and magnetic beads complex in complex environment. In addition, this CTC detection strategy is applied for clinical tumor treatment evaluation and progress monitoring in liver cancer patient samples, achieving an accuracy of &#8764;83.3% in classifying patients as complete or partial responses (CR/PR). Overall, this strategy will strongly promote potential clinical application of DNA framework for cancer diagnosis and disease progression monitoring.

         <title>Synthesis of Abiotic Supramolecular Polymers Inside Living Cells via Organocatalysis&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cells execute mesmerizing functions using supramolecular polymers (SPs) formed through the self&#8208;assembly of biological precursors. Integration of the vast array of synthetic SPs with living cells would offer a powerful way to remold cellular functions and bridge the gap between synthetic materials and biological realm, yet remains a challenge because of the lack of robust abiotic SP systems that can be triggered to self&#8208;assemble inside cells. Here, we report how fully abiotic SPs can be synthesized inside living cells via an organocatalysis&#8208;responsive self&#8208;assembly strategy, and how the in situ&#8208;generated SPs are capable of interfering with cellular functions. The incorporation of a nucleophilic organocatalyst (CAT) into living cells accelerates the intracellular conversion of hydrazide (H) and aldehyde&#8208;derived precursors (A) to hydrazone&#8208;based monomers (HA3) that locally self&#8208;assemble into SPs. Interestingly, the in situ&#8208;generated SPs possess ignorable effects on cell viability and proliferation but remarkably hinder the cell migration. Furthermore, the presence of SPs is found to retard intracellular diffusion and alter the organization of actin cytoskeleton, both of which are suggested to be responsible for the hindered cellular migration. In considering of the vastly wide range of synthetic SPs, tremendous non&#8208;natural cellular functionalities can be obtained by in situ&#8208;synthesizing SPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Aggregation State to Achieve Low&#8208;Temperature Fast Charging of Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By optimizing the solvent chemistry, the aggregation states have been disrupted, leading to the formation of contact ion pairs within weakly solvating electrolytes. This approach effectively isolates the solvation structure, reducing interactions between structures. Consequently, it maintains a favorable low desolvation energy barrier and anions&#8208;driven SEI. Simultaneously, it enhances ion migration kinetics, enabling fast charging at low temperatures.







Abstract
Insufficient ionic conductivity and elevated desolvation energy barrier of electrolytes limit the low&#8208;temperature applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Weakly solvating electrolytes (WSEs), with limited lithium salt dissociation capability, are prone to desolvate and drive anion&#8208;rich aggregates (AGGs). However, significant AGGs result in increased viscosity and low ionic mobility, contributing to battery failure at low temperatures (&#8804;&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C). Here, we propose and achieve a transformation of WSEs&#8217; solvation structures from AGGs to contact ion pairs (CIPs) through modulating the overall solvation capability, thereby achieving the balance between weak Li+&#8208; solvent interactions and desired ion migration kinetics. Remarkably, CIPs&#8208;dominated electrolyte shows a ten&#8208;fold increase in ionic conductivity compared to conventional WSEs. The Li||LiFePO4 (LFP) battery achieves more than 1400 cycles with 86.9&#8201;% capacity retention at 5&#8197;C. The practical 1.2&#8197;Ah LFP pouch cell delivered 69&#8201;% of the capacity at 25&#8201;&#176;C when cycled at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy for solvation structure transformation in WSEs provides a novel approach for the development of electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature batteries.

The practical 1.2&#8197;Ah LFP pouch cell delivered 69&#8201;% of the capacity at 25&#8201;&#176;C when cycled at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This strategy for solvation structure transformation in WSEs provides a novel approach for the development of electrolytes for low-temperature batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Sulfated Ganglio&#8208;Oligosaccharides for Probing Ligand Requirements of Glycan Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical synthesis of orthogonal protected tetra&#8208; and pentasaccharides combined with chemical sulfation and enzymatic sialylations gave a panel of sulfated ganglio&#8208;oligosaccharides that were printed as microarray and screened for binding to lectins, glycan binding proteins, and antibodies. It revealed that sulfation modulates recognition in complex manners.







Abstract
Sulfoglycolipids are an important class of acidic glycosphingolipids that have been implicated in a multitude of biological processes. Little is known about the interactome of sulfated gangliosides, and it is not well understood how a possible interplay between sialylation and sulfation influences molecular recognition. Here, we describe a chemoenzymatic strategy that readily provided a panel of twenty&#8208;one sulfated and sialylated ganglio&#8208;oligosaccharides. It is based on the chemical synthesis of a core tetra&#8208; and pentasaccharide that are equipped with the orthogonal protecting groups allyloxycarbonate (Alloc), levulinate ester (Lev) and t&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl ether (TBS). Selective removal of one or more protecting groups followed by sulfation of the resulting alcohol(s) and deprotecting gave several ganglio&#8208;oligosaccharides. Compound lacking an internal sialic acid could be prepared by exposing several derivatives to a sialidase. Compounds having an unmodified terminal galactoside could enzymatically be sialylated to give hybrid structures, which could be further extended to provide 2,8&#8208;sialosides. The synthetic glycans were printed as a microarray which was used to examine ligand requirements of a series of glycan&#8208;binding proteins including antibodies, toxins, galectins and siglecs. It was found that sulfation regulates protein binding in complex manners and in general sulfation and sialylation of C&#8208;3 of the terminal Gal influences protein binding in different ways.

         <title>Regioregular Poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane): A Strictly Alternating BN&#8208;Isostere of Poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) with Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inorganic poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) analogue with a strictly alternating arrangement of BN units along the chain was prepared by an AB&#8208;polymerization process. The polymer and monodisperse oligomers show emission from locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) states, respectively, which can be addressed by various stimuli, giving rise to solvatochromic, thermochromic, and reversible mechanochromic behavior.







Abstract
Incorporation of BN units into &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic compounds, as substitutes for specific CC couples, often leads to new hybrid materials with modified physical and chemical properties. Poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane)s are derived from well&#8208;known poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (PPV) by replacement of the vinylene groups by B=N linking units. Herein, an unprecedented poly(p&#8208;phenylene iminoborane) is presented that features a strictly alternating sequence of BN units along the main chain. The synthesis thereof was achieved by AB&#8208;type polymerization of a monomer featuring an N and a B terminus. Monodisperse oligomers with up to three BN units in the chain were additionally prepared and structurally characterized. Associated with the introduction of a dipole in the regioregular backbone structure, they display notable fluorescence already in solution and large Stokes shifts, distinct from their previously reported BBNN&#8208;sequenced congeners. All compounds show aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) properties. Computational studies provided evidence for emission from either locally excited (LE) or twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) states. These processes can be optionally addressed by various stimuli, giving rise to dual emission, solvatochromic, thermochromic, and reversible mechanochromic behavior.

         <title>Low&#8208;Dimensional Hetero&#8208;Interlayer Enabling Sub&#8208;Bandgap Photovoltaic Conversion for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;dimensional hetero&#8208;interlayer of HQ2ZnI4 acts as the sensitizer actualizing additional near&#8208;infrared photovoltaic conversion, the buffer layer with strong interaction and suitable binding interval, the energy modification interface for facilitating carrier transfer, and the buffer preventing instability decomposition, making devices achieving sub&#8208;band gap photovoltaic gain and enhancement in photoelectric performance.







Abstract
Actualizing sub&#8208;band gap photovoltaic conversion is effective in remitting energy loss and pushing theoretical efficiency limits for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a zero&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide based on hydroxyquinoline (HQ) is developed to sensitize PSCs for near&#8208;infrared region gain to implement sub&#8208;band gap photovoltaic conversion for enhancing power&#8208;conversion&#8208;efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. [ZnI4]2&#8722; skeletons containing heavy atoms intensify the direct singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet state transition of organic chromophores HQ. Meanwhile, the triplet energy of HQ is close to resonance with perovskite band gap, favoring the energy transfer to perovskite and exciting the additional electron&#8208;hole pairs, which was observed by transient absorption spectroscopy, confirming the sensitization of perovskite to increase sub&#8208;band gap photocurrent. HQ2ZnI4 modifies electronic and crystal structure, optimizes energy&#8208;level arrangement, and acts as a protective layer, realizing considerable PCEs in small (6.25&#8197;mm2)&#8208;/larger&#8208;area (1&#8197;cm2) devices and excellent operational stability. This low&#8208;cost strategy brings vitality to the light management of PSCs and expands low&#8208;dimensional materials.

         <title>In/Outside Catalytic Sites of the Pore Walls in One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influences of the location of catalytic sites inside or outside of the pore walls on the performance were first explored by constructing metal sites on the channels of one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks. The inside catalytic sites showed higher catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Pore channels play a decisive role in mass transport in catalytic systems. However, the influences of the location of catalytic sites inside or outside of the pore walls on the performance were still under&#8208;explored due, because it is difficult to construct sites anchored in or outside of pore walls. Herein, one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks with precisely anchored active sites were used to explore the effects of channels on a typical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis. Electrocatalytic evaluations showed that single Pt sites located inside of the channels exhibited higher kinetic activity compared to those anchored outside. The in situ spectroscopic analysis revealed that local reconstruction of Pt&#8722;Cl breaking and potential&#8208;induced anion transport occurred more effectively inside the channels. The superior anion transportability and kinetic activity of the inside&#8208;channel active sites also facilitated *OH desorption during the ORR process outperforming their outside&#8208;channel counterparts. The results of this study provide strategies for designing active sites in porous catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Nitric Oxide Generation via Thermal Decomposition of N&#8208;Trityl Dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;Oxazines</title>

This work describes the design and performance of novel nitric oxide donors for gas flow release applications such as inhaled nitric oxide therapies. Dispersions of N&#8208;trityl dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazines in hyper cross&#8208;linked polymers are shown to yield consistent gas phase nitric oxide release at therapeutically relevant concentrations and are stable under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a promising therapy for a&#160;variety of pulmonary conditions but is limited by the cost, portability, and safety limitations of the compressed gas cylinders used in conventional iNO delivery systems. On&#8208;demand generation of iNO via thermally controlled decomposition of an NO&#8208;genic precursor is an attractive alternative to systems based on compressed gas cylinders. However, most NO&#8208;releasing materials, which would form the basis of such a system, are designed for in vivo applications, but not for gas flow release at elevated temperatures. Novel NO donors with tunable kinetics suited for simple thermal generation are needed to realize such iNO delivery systems. Here we report the development of a&#160;new class of NO donors based on N&#8208;trityl 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazines. We show that amorphous solid dispersions of these molecules in porous polymers exhibit consistent, thermoresponsive NO release in good yields when heated above 90&#8201;&#176;C&#160;in the presence of a carrier gas. We further demonstrate that these donors undergo NO release in aqueous media at 37&#8201;&#176;C. Collectively, this work adds a new class of NO donor to the basis set of known NO&#8208;genic molecules and establishes a potential chemical basis for a low&#8208;power, small&#8208;footprint iNO delivery system.&#160;&#160;

         <title>Monodisperse Chemical Oligophosphorylation of Peptides via Protected Oligophosphorimidazolide Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The more the merrier: Oligophosphorimidazolide reagents enable the concomitant conjugation of multiple phosphate units to phosphopeptides, yielding derivatives with monodisperse phosphate chain lengths (up to hexaphosphate). This simple transformation occurs chemoselectively under mild conditions. This work paves the way for future development of mass spectrometry&#8208;based analytical methods for &#8220;oligophosphoproteomics.&#8221;







Abstract
Protein poly&#8208; and oligophosphorylation are recently discovered post&#8208;translational modifications that remain poorly characterized due to (1) the difficulty of extracting endogenously polyphosphorylated species without degradation and (2) the absence of synthetic and analytical tools to prepare and characterize poly&#8208; and oligophosphorylated species in biochemical contexts. Herein, we report a methodology for the selective oligophosphorylation of peptides with monodisperse phosphate chain lengths (Pn=3&#8211;6). A library of oligophosphorimidazolide (oligoP&#8208;imidazolide) reagents featuring benzyl and o&#8208;nitrophenylethyl protecting groups was synthesized in moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields (65&#8211;93&#8201;%). These oligoP&#8208;imidazolide reagents enabled the selective and simultaneous conjugation of multiple phosphate units to phosphoryl nucleophiles, circumventing tedious iterative processes. The generalizability of this approach is illustrated by a substrate scope study that includes several biologically relevant phosphopeptide sequences, culminating in the synthesis of &gt;60 examples of peptide oligophosphates (Pn=2&#8211;6). Moreover, we report the preparation of oligoP&#8208;diimidazolides (Pn=3&#8211;5) and discuss their application in generating unique condensed phosphate&#8208;peptide conjugates. We also demonstrate that human phospho&#8208;ubiquitin (pS65&#8208;Ub) is amenable to functionalization by our reagents. Overall, we envision the methods described here will enable future studies that characterize these newly discovered but poorly understood phosphorylation modes.

         <title>Degradable Adhesives as Sustainable Alternatives to Acrylics via Ring&#8208;Opening Radical Polymerization of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) using vinylcycloproapne&#8208;based monomers and a crosslinker, achieving molecular&#8208;level degradation while maintaining adhesion and viscoelastic properties comparable to traditional acrylic PSAs.







Abstract
Acrylic pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are loosely crosslinked polymer networks widely used across various industries. However, the network structure and inert nature of the acrylic polymer backbone present sustainability challenges. To address these issues, efforts are being made to incorporate degradable units into the polymer backbone. Yet, two key obstacles remain: i) the polymer does not degrade into sufficiently small fragments, and ii) the adhesive and viscoelastic properties are often inferior to those of conventional acrylic polymers. In this study, we developed a PSA utilizing vinylcyclopropane (VCP)&#8208;based monomers and a VCP&#8208;based crosslinker, achieving molecular&#8208;level degradation while maintaining adhesive performance and viscoelastic properties comparable to traditional acrylic PSAs. Under optimized polymerization conditions, the polymer incorporates ozone&#8208;labile double bonds into its backbone, enabling controlled molecular degradation without compromising its properties. By synthesizing and strategically combining various VCP&#8208;based monomers, we developed PSAs with tailored adhesion and viscoelastic behavior on par with conventional acrylic PSAs. These advancements indicate that the degradable polymers and PSAs developed in this study are poised for practical application in the near future.

         <title>Enhanced Electroluminescence and Stability of Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive was engineered to regulate crystallization, passivate defects, and resist moisture in blue perovskites using the biomimetic additive 2H,2H,3H,3H&#8208;heptadecafluoroundecanoic acid (HFUA). As a result, sky&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit excellent operational and moisture stability, achieving a champion external quantum efficiency of 22.88&#8201;% at 490&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Although remarkable breakthroughs have been witnessed in the field of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), achieving efficient and stable blue PeLEDs still remains as a critical challenge to towards commercial applications. Inspired by the protection effect and water&#8208;repellent properties of swan feathers, 2H,2H,3H,3H&#8208;heptadecafluoroundecanoic acid (HFUA) has been designed as adsorbed functional molecule for blue perovskites, which can simultaneously enhance the electroluminescence performance and moisture stability. The HFUA molecule features a long&#8208;chain structure where the carboxylic acid group acts as an anchor, coordinating with undercoordinated lead atoms in blue perovskites. The fluorine atoms at the opposite end of the chain form ionic bonds with the halogen octahedron, thereby stabilizing the octahedral structure. In addition, HFUA adsorption lowers the adsorption energy of organic spacers on the perovskite lattice, optimizing the reduced&#8208;dimensional phase distribution to facilitate smooth exciton transfer. Furthermore, the unique molecular structure of HFUA, rich in fluorine atoms, enhances the hydrophobicity of the perovskite surface, effectively inhibiting moisture penetration and preventing perovskite hydrolysis. The target blue PeLEDs obtain a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.88&#8201;% at 490&#8197;nm and exhibit greatly improved air stability under humid and high&#8208;temperature conditions. Our findings provide a unique and effective strategy for producing efficient and stable blue PeLEDs.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State and Steric Hindrances Engineering Enable Fast Spin&#8208;Flip Narrowband Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters with Enhanced Quenching Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple donors have been integrated into multi&#8208;resonance moieties to engineer excited states and steric hindrances to generate blue and green thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules with enhanced quenching resistance and spin&#8208;flip processes. The resulting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show high external quantum efficiencies, reduced efficiency roll&#8208;offs, and good operational stability across a wide dopant concentration.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials have great potential for applications in ultrahigh&#8208;definition (UHD) organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays, that benefit from their narrowband emission characteristic. However, key challenges such as aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect and slow triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet spin&#8208;flip process, especially for blue MR&#8208;TADF materials, continue to impede their development due to planar skeletons and relatively large &#916;ESTs. Here, an effective strategy that incorporates multiple carbazole donors into the parent MR moieties is proposed, synergistically engineering their excited states and steric hindrances to enhance both the spin&#8208;flip process and quenching resistance.

&lt;p&gt;Multiple donors have been integrated into multi-resonance moieties to engineer excited states and steric hindrances to generate blue and green thermally activated delayed fluorescence molecules with enhanced quenching resistance and spin-flip processes. The resulting organic light-emitting diodes show high external quantum efficiencies, reduced efficiency roll-offs, and good operational stability across a wide dopant concentration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) materials have great potential for applications in ultrahigh-definition (UHD) organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays, that benefit from their narrowband emission characteristic. However, key challenges such as aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect and slow triplet-to-singlet spin-flip process, especially for blue MR-TADF materials, continue to impede their development due to planar skeletons and relatively large &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;s. Here, an effective strategy that incorporates multiple carbazole donors into the parent MR moieties is proposed, synergistically engineering their excited states and steric hindrances to enhance both the spin-flip process and quenching resistance. As expected, the designed materials namely 5Cz-BNO and 5Cz-BN exhibit bright blue and green emissions with narrow full-width at half-maximums (FWHMs) around 23&#8197;nm, together with significantly improved reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates. The OLEDs based on 5Cz-BNO and 5Cz-BN with doping concentrations from 5 to 20&#8197;wt&#8201;% achieve high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) values exceeding 30&#8201;% with suppressed efficiency roll-offs and improved operational stability. This work offers an effective approach for designing doping-insensitive blue and green MR-TADF materials with fast spin-flip processes by integrating the engineering of excited states and steric hindrances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Glucuronidase&#8208;Instructed Glycopeptide Self&#8208;Assembly for Selective Killing of Cancer Cells through Lysosomal Membrane Permeabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glucuronidase&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly of a glycopeptide induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization and apoptosis in cancer cells. This glycopeptide also synergizes with cisplatin and adriamycin to enhance cytotoxicity, including in drug&#8208;resistant cancer strains.







Abstract
Current cancer treatments face significant challenges, including limited tumor specificity and drug resistance. Enzyme&#8208;instructed supramolecular peptide assembly targeting lysosomes offers a promising strategy to address these issues; however, self&#8208;assembling units that withstand lysosomal conditions are still scarce. Herein, we present a versatile glycopeptide incorporating glucuronic acid and glucose that undergoes glucuronidase&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly to form nanofibers, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) in cancer cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that in glucuronidase&#8208;overexpressing HepG2 cells, glycopeptide assembly induces cytoskeletal disruption and apoptosis. The involvement of carbohydrate&#8208;binding receptor in enhancing the cellular entry of glycopeptides and improving proteolytic stability highlights the importance of glycan modification. Notably, combining this glycopeptide with cisplatin or Adriamycin results in synergistic cytotoxicity, including in drug&#8208;resistant cancer cell lines. These findings establish a novel, LMP&#8208;inducing glycopeptide scaffold for developing targeted approaches for cancer treatment.

A highly efficient chemoenzymatic approach was developed to achieve site&#8208;selective I&#8208;branching of poly&#8208;LacNAc chains. The approach relies on three orthogonal protecting groups, each of which &#8220;caps&#8221; one branching site for selective &#8220;decapping&#8221; and GCNT2&#8208;catalyzed I&#8208;branching. A diverse library of 41 linear and branched poly&#8208;LacNAc glycans were prepared from a single precursor. Glycan array analysis then revealed unique recognition of I&#8208;branches.







Abstract
Poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (poly&#8208;LacNAc) is ubiquitously expressed on cell surface glycoconjugates, serving as the backbone of complex glycans and an extended scaffold that presents diverse glycan epitopes. The branching of poly&#8208;LacNAc, where internal galactose (Gal) residues have &#946;1&#8208;6 linked N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) attached, forms the blood group I&#8208;antigen, which is closely associated with various physiological and pathological processes including cancer progression. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear as many of the I&#8208;antigen sequences are undefined and inaccessible. In this study, we developed a highly efficient orthogonal&#8208;group&#8208;controlled approach to access site&#8208;selectively I&#8208;branched poly&#8208;LacNAc chains. The approach relies on three orthogonal protecting groups, each of them &#8220;caps&#8221; one internal Gal residue of poly&#8208;LacNAc. These groups can be readily &#8220;decapped&#8221; by specific enzymes or chemical reduction to expose desired sites for GCNT2&#8208;catalyzed I&#8208;branching. This approach enabled the rapid preparation of a diverse library of 41 linear and branched poly&#8208;LacNAc glycans from a single precursor. Glycan microarray analysis using these complex glycans revealed unique recognitions of I&#8208;branches by lectins, anti&#8208;I mAbs, and galectins. Surprisingly, oxidized forms of linear poly&#8208;LacNAc strongly bound to several glycan&#8208;binding proteins (GBPs). These findings help to bridge the gap in recognition of I&#8208;branching and open new avenues for therapeutic development by targeting galectins.

         <title>Co&#8208;Feeding CO2 for Methylfuran Aromatization over Bifunctional Zeolite&#8208;Supported ZnMoO4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ZnMoO4/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst effectively facilitates co&#8208;feeding CO2 for 2&#8208;methylfuran aromatization reactions, preferring the dehydro&#8208;aromatization pathways based on cyclopentenones and alkenes over those based on benzofurans. Additionally, the abundant surface oxygen vacancies of ZnMoO4 enhance the adsorption of CO2 and its subsequent reaction with coke.







Abstract
Aromatization of biofuran offers promising approaches for sustainable biochemical production. However, this process is often hampered by low yields and severe coking on traditional zeolite catalysts. Herein, we report co&#8208;feeding CO2 for 2&#8208;methylfuran (MF) aromatization (CCMA) over bifunctional ZSM&#8208;5 supported ZnMoO4. This bifunctional catalyst can achieve both MF and CO2 conversions of &gt;97&#8201;%, generating &gt;85&#8201;% carbon yield of target arenes and CO with negligible alkenes (0.05&#8201;%). Meanwhile, coke formation is remarkably suppressed from 22.3&#8201;% to 8.6&#8201;%. ZnMoO4/ZSM&#8208;5 is capable of selectively manipulating the reaction intermediates and pathways of the CCMA reactions, favoring the cyclopentenones&#8208; and alkenes&#8208;based dehydro&#8208;aromatization rather than the benzofurans&#8208;based pathway. This finding challenges the prevailing understanding that MF aromatization follows a hydrocarbon pool mechanism. Moreover, the abundant surface oxygen vacancies of ZnMoO4 facilitate the adsorption of CO2 and its subsequent reaction with coke. These insights into reaction mechanism and catalyst design for co&#8208;conversion of CO2 and biofuran can offer guidelines for process intensification in biomass utilization with a carbon&#8208;negative manner.

         <title>Accessing a Carboxyl&#8208;Anhydride Molecular Switch&#8208;Mediated Recyclable PECT Through Upcycling End&#8208;of&#8208;Use PET</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel recycling strategy, based on the principles of polycondensation, is proposed for upcycling waste PET to produce high&#8208;value recyclable poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) (PECT) containing molecular switches. Upon activation of the molecular switch, PECT undergoes rapid depolymerization to form a prepolymer. Conversely, the prepolymer can be efficiently polymerized back into high molecular weight PECT.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), with an annual production of exceeding 70 million tons, is mainly utilized in disposable fields and subsequently contribute to severe environmental pollution. Conventional chemical recycling, which typically involves depolymerizing polymer into monomers, is limited due to the intricate recycling process, excess using unrecyclable solvents and low polymer conversion. Inspired by protein's molecular switches, we propose a novel polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer recycling strategy based on polycondensation principles upcycling waste PET to high&#8208;value recyclable poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) derivatives containing molecular switches. Upon deactivating the molecular switch, an acidification reaction occurs within the system, leading to a rapid and controllable reduction in molecular weight due to the imbalance of reactive group.

     alt="Accessing a Carboxyl-Anhydride Molecular Switch-Mediated Recyclable PECT Through Upcycling End-of-Use PET"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel recycling strategy, based on the principles of polycondensation, is proposed for upcycling waste PET to produce high-value recyclable poly(ethylene-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) (PECT) containing molecular switches. Upon activation of the molecular switch, PECT undergoes rapid depolymerization to form a prepolymer. Conversely, the prepolymer can be efficiently polymerized back into high molecular weight PECT.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), with an annual production of exceeding 70 million tons, is mainly utilized in disposable fields and subsequently contribute to severe environmental pollution. Conventional chemical recycling, which typically involves depolymerizing polymer into monomers, is limited due to the intricate recycling process, excess using unrecyclable solvents and low polymer conversion. Inspired by protein's molecular switches, we propose a novel polymer-to-polymer recycling strategy based on polycondensation principles upcycling waste PET to high-value recyclable poly(ethylene-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) derivatives containing molecular switches. Upon deactivating the molecular switch, an acidification reaction occurs within the system, leading to a rapid and controllable reduction in molecular weight due to the imbalance of reactive group. Conversely, activating the molecular switch triggers a ring-closing reaction that detaches acid anhydrides, bringing about equal molar ratio of groups and thereby facilitating an increase in molecular weight. By simply incorporating a molecular switch into condensation products based on melt polycondensation, closed-loop recycling capability is achieved without necessitating excessive organic solvents or complex depolymerization processes. The present study not only presents a novel pathway for end-of-use PET upcycling but also introduces an innovative concept of molecular switching for the closed-loop recyclability of condensation polymers, thereby demonstrating significant potential for large-scale implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatially Preorganized Hybridization Chain Reaction for the Prompt Diagnosis of Inflammation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially preorganized hybridization chain reaction (HCR) probes on a triangular DNA origami nanostructure (TRI&#8208;HCR) enables fast detection of nucleic acid targets. When applied to in vivo imaging of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA in mice afflicted with acute gouty arthritis or sepsis&#8208;associated acute kidney injury, TRI&#8208;HCR can diagnose inflammation in the early stages, significantly earlier than histological examination.







Abstract
Biological systems utilize precise spatial organization to facilitate and regulate information transmission within signaling networks. Inspired by this, artificial scaffolds that enable delicate spatial arrangements are desirable to increase the local concentration of reactants, expedite specific interactions, and minimize undesired interference. In this study, we presented an integrated biosensing nanodevice, termed TRI&#8208;HCR, in which hybridization chain reaction (HCR) probes were precisely organized on a triangular DNA origami nanostructure (TRI) with finely&#8208;tuned distance, quantity, and pattern. Compared to traditional HCR in the free form, this nanodevice demonstrated increased reaction rate and signal level. We further employed the optimized TRI&#8208;HCR for in vivo imaging of a nucleic acid biomarker of inflammatory diseases. In both acute gouty arthritis (AGA) and sepsis&#8208;associated acute kidney injury (SA&#8208;AKI) model mice, TRI&#8208;HCR was capable of diagnosing inflammation in the early stages, significantly earlier than histological examination. We anticipate that this precise spatial preorganization strategy for HCR holds promise for broader applications in early disease detection and monitoring.

         <title>Counterions Determine if Metal&#8208;Organic Cages Convert SO2 to Sulfate or Reversibly Adsorb It</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different counterions modulate the solid&#8208;state SO2 adsorption behavior in M6L8 Metal&#8208;Organic Cages (M=Pd(II), Co(II), Cu(II), Zn(II)). Certain anions induce reversible SO2&#8208;adsorption, while nitrate promotes its transformation to sulfate at room temperature. Among these cages, Pd6L8 exhibits the highest cavity&#8208;mediated SO2 conversion, excellent stability, and is quantitatively regenerated.







Abstract
The continuous emission of harmful gases into the atmosphere damages the environment, air quality, and public health worldwide. To mitigate their impact, materials that capture and chemically inactivate gases are required; however, integrating and precisely controlling both abilities within a single material remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that switching between SO2&#8208;physisorption and chemisorption is possible for porous materials by using different counterions, as illustrated with a series of Pd6L8 Metal&#8208;Organic Cages (MOCs). Pd&#8208;MOCs bearing BF4&#8722;, PF6&#8722;, or SO42&#8722; expressed reversible adsorption (up to 3.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1), cyclability, and SO2/CO2 selectivity. NO3&#8722; promoted conversion of SO2 to sulfate, as corroborated with M6L8 cages built on Co(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) ions. Noteworthy, the nitrate derivative of Pd6L8 captures 6.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 of SO2, cleanly transforms it to SO42&#8722; within its cavity in 94&#8201;% yield at room temperature, it is quantitatively regenerated, and tolerates humid SO2; such qualities are unprecedented for SO2 adsorbents. The deliberate use of counterions for modulating adsorption could be applied to charged MOFs, COFs, or POCs, potentially leading to the development of new reactivity or catalysis pathways for advanced applications against contaminant gases.

         <dc:description>
The axially chiral dialdehydes were synthesized via Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H amidation. The reaction proceeded smoothly by using chiral amine as the transient directing group. The detailed mechanistic studies implied that an intramolecular C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction might play a key role in the control of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Achieving axially chiral biaryl dialdehydes through asymmetric catalysis remains significantly challenging due to the lack of efficient strategies. In this report, we developed a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H amidation through chiral transient directing group strategy. With this new approach, a series of axially chiral amido dialdehydes were achieved in up to 86&#8201;% yields with 99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er. Furthermore, detailed mechanistic studies indicated that both the imine formation and C&#8722;H bond cleavage steps were reversible. More interestingly, the X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of Int&#8208;2 showed probable C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction between biaryl group and chiral amine moiety. This process offered a convenient route to access axially chiral dialdehyde derivatives. More broadly, it demonstrated a new tool through transient and C&#8722;H/&#960; synergistic interactions, which would stimulate further development of asymmetric catalytic system in enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization.

         <title>Adjusting TADF and Phosphorescence for Tailored Dynamic Time&#8208;Dependent Afterglow Colored Carbon Dots spanning Full Visible Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

We have developed a convenient strategy to achieve TDAC CDs that cover the entire visible region. By optimizing the doping level of Pyr&#8208;CDs and embedding them in different rigid matrices, we can effectively tailor various color variations of the afterglow within the visible region. The successful utilization of 4D coding technique for multimodal anti&#8208;counterfeiting and advanced dynamic information encryption promotes the practical applications of afterglow materials.







Abstract
Time&#8208;dependent afterglow colored (TDAC) behavior differs from static afterglow by involving wavelength changes, enabling low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;level encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, the existing carbon dot (CD)&#8208;based TDAC materials lack a clear mechanistic explanation and controllable wavelength changes, significantly hindering the progress of practical applications in this field. In this study, we synthesized CDs composites with customizable tunable TDAC wavelengths across the visible region. Furthermore, we elucidated the underlying mechanism of TDAC that exhibits sequential weakening and relative strengthening of long&#8208; and short&#8208;wavelength afterglow centers. This phenomenon arises due to strong emission with a short lifetime originating from long&#8208;wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), along with weak emission having a longer lifetime originating from short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence. The presence of surface&#8208;rich carboxyl groups on CDs determines the short&#8208;wavelength afterglow in their dispersed state while their high conjugation degree governs the long&#8208;wavelength afterglow in their aggregated state. Additionally, appropriate doping levels of CDs enhance color change phenomena during afterglow. Finally, by embedding CDs into different rigid matrix, the range of afterglow changes can be tailored arbitrarily within the visible light region. Leveraging these exceptional TDAC characteristics has allowed us to successfully develop advanced 4D coding technologies that facilitate multi&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting and dynamic information encryption.

&lt;p&gt;Time-dependent afterglow colored (TDAC) behavior differs from static afterglow by involving wavelength changes, enabling low-cost, high-level encryption and anti-counterfeiting. However, the existing carbon dot (CD)-based TDAC materials lack a clear mechanistic explanation and controllable wavelength changes, significantly hindering the progress of practical applications in this field. In this study, we synthesized CDs composites with customizable tunable TDAC wavelengths across the visible region. Furthermore, we elucidated the underlying mechanism of TDAC that exhibits sequential weakening and relative strengthening of long- and short-wavelength afterglow centers. This phenomenon arises due to strong emission with a short lifetime originating from long-wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), along with weak emission having a longer lifetime originating from short-wavelength phosphorescence. The presence of surface-rich carboxyl groups on CDs determines the short-wavelength afterglow in their dispersed state while their high conjugation degree governs the long-wavelength afterglow in their aggregated state. Additionally, appropriate doping levels of CDs enhance color change phenomena during afterglow. Finally, by embedding CDs into different rigid matrix, the range of afterglow changes can be tailored arbitrarily within the visible light region. Leveraging these exceptional TDAC characteristics has allowed us to successfully develop advanced 4D coding technologies that facilitate multi-mode anti-counterfeiting and dynamic information encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Octahedral Lanthanide Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient circularly polarized luminescence of lanthanide cages was achieved through amino acid induction, the luminescence asymmetry factor and quantum yield are 0.53 and 61&#8201;%, respectively. The induction ability of amino acid is positively correlated with the number of coordination bonds and coordination bond energies in the precursor formed by amino acid and lanthanide ions.







Abstract
Chiral metal organic cage compounds with excellent circularly polarized luminescent performance have broad application prospects in many fields. Herein, two lanthanide complexes with luminescent properties in the form of racemic hexagonal octahedral cages were synthesized using a tri (&#946;&#8208;diketone) ligand. Eu6(C21H6F15O6)8(H2O)6 exhibited red light emission with high quantum yields of 61&#8201;%. Then, we successfully synthesized lanthanide compounds with circularly polarized luminescent activity by chiral induction of the racemic mixture with arginine. The luminescence asymmetry factor was 0.53, and the circularly polarized luminescent merit figure reached 0.323. High&#8208;performance circularly polarized luminescent of racemic cage like compound systems have achieved using cheap and readily available chiral amino acid molecules through chiral induction.

         <title>Multiscale Engineered Bionic Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes Breaking the Stiffness&#8208;Damping Trade&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bionic solid&#8208;state electrolyte composed of amorphous titania nanotube arrays intertwined with polymer electrolytes accurately replicates the superstructure of tooth enamel, effectively breaking the stiffness&#8208;damping trade&#8208;off, not only inhibiting dendrites growth, but also ensuring electrolyte/electrode mechanical compatibility.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are regarded as next&#8208;generation devices for energy storage due to their safety and high energy density. The issues of Li dendrites and poor mechanical compatibility with electrodes present the need for developing solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high stiffness and damping, but it is a contradictory relationship. Here, inspired by the superstructure of tooth enamel, we develop a composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte composed of amorphous ceramic nanotube arrays intertwined with solid polymer electrolytes. This bionic electrolyte exhibits both high stiffness (Young&#8242;s modulus=15&#8197;GPa, hardness=0.13&#8197;GPa) and damping (tan&#948;=0.08), breaking the trade&#8208;off. Thus, this composite electrolyte can not only inhibit Li dendrites growth but also ensure intimate contact with electrodes. Meanwhile, it also exhibits considerable Li+ transference number (0.62) and room temperature ionic conductivity (1.34&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), which is attributed to oxygen vacancies of the amorphous ceramic effectively decoupling the Li&#8208;TFSI ion pair. Consequently, the assembled Li symmetric battery shows an ultra&#8208;stable cycling (&gt;2000&#8197;hours at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 60&#8201;&#176;C, &gt;500&#8197;hours at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 30&#8201;&#176;C). Moreover, the LiFePO4/Li and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state full cells both show excellent cycling performance. We demonstrate that this bionic strategy is a promising approach for the development of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

         <title>Selection of Plastic&#8208;Binding DNA Aptamers for Microplastics Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), a pyrimidine&#8208;rich DNA aptamer was isolated for PVS and PS microplastics, despite their different chemical structures. The high affinity of the aptamer for plastics allowed fluorescence&#8208;based microplastic detection.







Abstract
Plastics are critical materials for modern technological applications, yet environmental contamination by microplastics has become a growing concern. In this study, DNA aptamers were isolated for two of the most abundant plastic materials: polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polystyrene (PS). These aptamers contain approximately 90&#8201;% cytosine and thymine but only 10&#8201;% purine content. Among them, the PVC&#8208;1 aptamer binds to PVC with a six&#8208;fold higher capacity than a random sequenced DNA. Among the tested plastic materials, PVC and PS exhibited the highest specific binding capacity. Using fluorophore&#8208;labeled PVC&#8208;1 aptamer, PS/PVC microplastics as low as 1&#8197;mg were detected, and the aptamer was selective for microplastics over other environmentally relevant materials, such as silica. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the aptamer attempted to maximize contact with the plastic surface for adsorption. This plastic&#8208;binding aptamer is expected to find applications in environmental monitoring and has fundamental implications for surface&#8208;binding aptamers.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel method to activate elemental germanium through mechanical force, facilitating the Reformatsky reaction without external reducing agents. We also demonstrate the catalytic activity of elemental germanium for the first time, successfully achieving this through the bromoalkylation of alkenes.







Abstract
In the realm of materials science and chemical industry, germanium emerges as a strategic resource with distinctive properties that extend its applicability beyond traditional electronics and optics into the promising field of chemical catalysis. Despite its significant role in advanced technological applications, the potential of elemental germanium as a catalyst remains unexplored. Leveraging recent developments in mechanochemistry, this study introduces a groundbreaking approach to activate elemental germanium via mechanical force, facilitating the Reformatsky reaction without the reliance on external reducing agents. Meanwhile, we have also demonstrated, for the first time, the catalytic activity of elemental germanium, successfully achieving this through the bromoalkylation of alkenes. These achievements mark a significant advancement in the field of catalysis and open up a new promising avenue for both academic research and industrial applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a &#8220;two&#8208;level spatially localized proximity labeling (P2L)&#8221; platform by cascading galactose oxidase (GAO)&#8208;based oxidation reaction and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;based proximity labeling (PL). P2L integrates enzymatic logic computation and PL, enabling rapid output of spatial localization information across biological hierarchies as covalent tags for cell&#8208;selective assembly programming and microenvironmental proteomic analysis.







Abstract
Proximity labeling (PL) has emerged as a powerful technique for the in situ elucidation of biomolecular interaction networks. However, PL methods generally rely on single&#8208;biological&#8208;hierarchy control of spatial localization at the labeling site, which limits their application in multi&#8208;tiered biological systems. Here, we introduced another enzymatic reaction upstream of an enzyme&#8208;based PL reaction and targeted the two enzymes to markers indicating different biological hierarchies, establishing a two&#8208;level spatially localized proximity labeling (P2L) platform for in situ molecular measurement and manipulation. Using the cellular&#8208; and glycan&#8208;level as the hierarchical models, we demonstrated the ability of P2L to efficiently execute a two&#8208;step logic operation and to discriminate target cells with different levels of glycosylation within mixed cell populations. By mounting clickable handles via P2L, we reprogrammed the robust covalent assembly of cells at designated sites. The combination of P2L with proteomics led to the profiling of the protein microenvironment of specific glycans on target cells, revealing changes in tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;surface interactions under immune pressure from a glycan perspective. P2L provides not only a solution for revealing the heterogeneity of biological systems, but also new insights in the fields of intelligent logic computation, enzyme engineering, tissue engineering, etc.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated [4+2] Annulation of Silylimines with Olefins to 1&#8208;Aminotetralins Enabled by Diradical Hydrogen Atom Transfer of C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;mediated diradical hydrogen atom transfer (DHAT) of primary, secondary, and tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;alkyl arylsilylimines and C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;formyl arylsilylimines and their subsequent [4+2] annulations with olefins were accomplished via energy transfer. The silyl substituent on the nitrogen atom was crucial for the success of the reaction by modulating the reactivities of the diradical intermediates derived from the excited imines in DHAT and cascade cyclization process.







Abstract
A facile photochemical, one&#8208;pot synthesis of highly functionalized 1&#8208;aminotetralins derivatives (&gt;70 examples) from readily accessible o&#8208;alkyl and o&#8208;formyl aryl silylimines with olefins is described. A diradical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (DHAT) of primary, secondary, and tertiary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;alkyl arylsilylimines and C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds of o&#8208;formyl arylsilylimines enabled a [4+2] annulation with olefins in excellent diastereoselectivity. This was accomplished upon irradiation at &#955; = 420&#8197;nm in the presence of thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the sensitizer via energy transfer. Moreover, sulfur&#8208;substituted o&#8208;alkyl silylimines can undergo such photochemical process in the absence of an external photosensitizer. This effective protocol is compatible with a variety of functional groups and can be applied to the modification of bioactive molecules. Based on mechanistic evidences and computational studies, it is suggested that the silyl substituent enables an efficient energy transfer leading to the formation of a key C,N&#8208;diradical and subsequent [4+2]&#8208;cyclization was supported by a better molecular orbital matching between the HSOMO of the 1,4&#8208;diradical intermediate and the LUMO of the olefins. Thus, upon irradiation, the excited silylimine unlocks a carbon&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen DHAT and subsequent [4+2] cyclization that allows the divergent functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds and C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds.

         <title>Quantitative Formation of Octa&#8208;substituted Cyclobutanes by the [2+2] Photocycloaddition of Stiff&#8208;stilbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;template strategy has been utilized to generate octa&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes from stiff&#8208;stilbene precursors. The obtained cycloadducts display shape&#8208;persistent geometry and can be reversibly converted into their stiff&#8208;stilbene precursors with a controllable E/Z distribution.







Abstract
The creation of new molecules with specific structural motifs is a primary goal in synthetic chemistry. In this context, cyclobutanes (CBs), the highly strained ring systems, are of great interest because of their wide applications from pharmaceutical chemistry to materials science. The [2+2] photocycloaddition is the most straightforward approach for CBs; however, access to fully substituted cyclobutanes presents a significant challenge due to the steric hindrance imposed by eight substituents. Here, we report an efficient synthesis of structurally unique, octa&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes from stiff&#8208;stilbene precursors, which is enabled by adaptable anion coordination through hydrogen bonding networks. The synthesized spiro&#8208;benzocyclopentyl&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes are confirmed by single&#8208;crystal structures. DFT calculations indicate that these cyclobutanes have high ring&#8208;strain energies (~20.1&#8197;kcal/mol) and can be completely converted back to stiff&#8208;stilbenes. Such a reversible cycloaddition/reversion process offers a promising platform for applications in responsive and energy storage materials.

         <title>Discovery and Total Synthesis of a New Class of Minor Immunosuppressive Plant Sesterterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gracilisoids, a new family of plant sesterterpenoids with highly functionalized bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane carbon skeletons (named neo&#8208;eurysolanes), were discovered from Eurysolen gracilis. The collective total synthesis of nine gracilisoid members has been accomplished by employing a Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization and late&#8208;stage photo&#8208;oxidation as key steps. Immunosuppressive activity of these sesterterpenoids was also found.







Abstract
Plant sesterterpenoids are an extremely rare family of natural products that generally possess novel chemical structures and diverse biological activities. Herein, we report the discovery of an unprecedented group of minor plant sesterterpenoids, gracilisoids B&#8722;E (2&#8211;5), which feature two types of highly functionalized bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane carbon skeletons, along with their biogenetically related precursor gracilisoid A (1), from a Lamiaceae ethnomedicinal plant, Eurysolen gracilis. To confirm their structures and obtain adequate materials for biological research, the asymmetric total syntheses of gracilisoids A&#8722;E (1&#8211;5) and four new biogenetically&#8208;related congeners gracilisoids F&#8722;I (6&#8211;9) were achieved from commercially available (&#8722;)&#8208;citronellal by a bioinspired approach that involves a Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization/&#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketone rearrangement tandem reaction and a late&#8208;stage biomimetic photooxidation as key steps. Biological investigations revealed that gracilisoids A&#8722;I (1&#8211;9) significantly inhibited IFN&#8208;&#947; production and/or T cell proliferation probably through inhibition of the STAT pathway. The findings herald the potential of these gracilisoids as novel immunosuppressive agents, and efficient synthetic approaches will facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of their value in future drug development.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a cooperative multiscale&#8208;assembly method for porous organic cages that controls intermolecular interactions and fluid flow across scales, directing the growth of single&#8208;crystal tubular structures with oriented micropores and defined dimensionality. These nanocage&#8208;based architectures enhance chemoenzymatic reactions by compartmentalizing metal clusters and enzymes, offering powerful efficiency in complex catalysis.







Abstract
The directional assembly of porous organic molecules into long&#8208;range ordered architectures, featuring controlled hierarchical porosity and oriented pore channels with defined spatial arrangements, is a fundamental challenge in chemistry and materials science. Herein, using porous organic cages as starting units, we present a cooperative multiscale&#8208;assembly strategy enabling the simultaneous alignment of pore channels and directional hierarchical growth in a single step. At the microscopic level, we employed double solvents to manipulate the intermolecular packing of microporous tetrahedral [4+6] imine cages (CC1 and CC3), resulting in pore channel orientation. Concurrently, at the mesoscopic level, convective flow in the double&#8208;solvent system directed the spatial distribution of nuclei species, followed by diffusion limited growth, leading to the directional formation of single&#8208;crystal microtubes. By precisely controlling the direction of convective flow, the nanocages were successfully organized into 2D and 3D single&#8208;crystal microtube arrays while maintaining oriented micropores. This hierarchical porous architecture enhanced mass transfer, as confirmed by adsorption measurements. Interestingly, such 3D hierarchical microtube arrays can be utilized to immobilize Pd clusters and enzymes (lipase or Glucose oxidase) within the micro&#8208; and macropores, respectively, showing a 3.8&#8208; to 4&#8208;fold enhancement in one&#8208;pot tandem reaction activity compared to physical mixtures of individual analogues.

         <title>Conformationally Stable and Sterically Hindered Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium Modification of FAPbI3 Enhances the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

The ammonium moiety of the conformationally stable dicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium odide presents significant steric hindrance but boasts a high binding energy at the surface of FAPbI3 perovskite. The surface treatment with this salt leads to FAPbI3 film with smoother surface, lower charge trap densities, and higher iodine migration activation energy, ultimately enhancing both power conversion efficiency and operational stability of solar cells.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films frequently exhibit structural defects and impurities that impede the durable operation of solar cells. In this study, we introduced a conformationally stable, sterically bulky molecular passivator, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium iodide (BCPDAI), by spin&#8208;coating from an isopropanol solution onto the perovskite film surface, followed by thermal annealing. This treatment effectively converted PbI2 and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 into a two&#8208;dimensional perovskite structure and significantly enhanced the crystal quality of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. The BCPDAI&#8208;treated perovskite films exhibited smoother surface morphology and reduced trap densities for charge carriers, leading to improved power conversion efficiency in the solar cells. Notably, the BCPDAI&#8208;modified perovskite films provided the solar cells with enhanced operational stability. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the high positive charge density of BCPDA2+ confers greater binding energy at the perovskite surface and elevates the diffusion activation energy of the iodide anion.

         <title>Binder&#8208;Mediated Supramolecular Polymerization with Controllable Gel&#8208;to&#8208;Crystal Transformation in Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

An intricate binder&#8208;mediated MOC&#8208;based supramolecular assembly has been developed with tunable viscoelastic behavior and a controllable spontaneous gel&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation process. Adjusting the ratio of Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en enables precise control over nanostructure length and evolution by influencing both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the assembly.







Abstract
Controlling supramolecular polymerization across various length scales through metal&#8208;organic polyhedra in aqueous media enables functional nanomaterial fabrication beyond traditional &#960;&#8208;chromophoric systems. Herein, we present a straightforward strategy to tune the nano&#8208; and microscopic structural evolution of a co&#8208;assembled system. Ga&#8208;MOC ([Ga8(ImDC)12]12&#8722;, ImDC = imidazoledicarboxylate) is introduced as a discrete unit, while the Ni&#8208;ethylenediamine complex [Ni(en)3]2+ (Ni&#8208;en), served as the binder towards supramolecular polymerization. Comprehensive investigations revealed that adjusting the binder ratio in the bicomponent (Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en) co&#8208;assembly process allows precise control over nanostructure length and evolution by influencing both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the assembly. At higher concentrations, this assembly forms a hydrogel above a critical binder ratio. Furthermore, the binder&#8242;s ratio significantly influences the viscoelastic strength of the hydrogels by modulating the connectivity between the MOCs through hydrogen (H)&#8208;bonding. Intriguingly, the hydrogels gradually transformed into crystals without any external stimuli, with different timescales regulated by the binder ratio. Single crystal structure determination reveals a 3D structure composed of Ga&#8208;MOC and Ni&#8208;en, extended through charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonding (CAHB) interactions, resulting through the transformation from a kinetically controlled gel state to a thermodynamically stable crystal product. This study provides an understanding of binder&#8208;mediated control over nanostructural evolution in co&#8208;assembled MOCs.

         <title>Towards Rational Design of Confined Catalysis in Carbon Nanotube by Machine Learning and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was found that a set of chemical reactions can be accelerated in confined catalysis, while it also negatively suppressed the activity in several cases. In this work, the operando atmosphere of confined catalysis is simulated with Grand Canonical Monte Carlo accelerated by machine learning potential. It was found that compressive strain is a key for confinement effects. This work provides a pathway for the rational design of confined catalysis.







Abstract
The microenvironment is recognized to be as crucial as active sites in heterogeneous catalysis. It was found that the catalytic activity of a set of chemical reactions can be significantly influenced by the confined space of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with some reactions showing superior activity, while others experience a negative impact. The rational design of confined catalysis must rely on the accurate insights of confined microenvironment. However, the structural complexity of confined catalysts and the interaction with microenvironment hinders the deciphering of chemical origins behind experiments. In this work, Grand&#8208;canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations are conducted for confined catalysis in CNTs at various reaction atmospheres, accelerated by machine learning potentials. The statistical outcomes of GCMC simulations corroborate a general feature that the electronic interaction (binding energy) inside CNTs is weaker than outside cases. By using Random Forest (RF) model, we ascertain that the shortening of the bond lengths of catalysts within the confined space is the dominant factor, resulting in the weakened binding energy and the downshift of the d&#8208;band center. Using the bond length variation as a simplified descriptor, our microkinetic models successfully reproduced the seemingly contradictive experiments, namely, the observed enhancement and suppression for the same reaction.

         <title>Improving the Methane Oxidation by Self&#8208;Adaptive Optimization of Liquid&#8208;Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane's high symmetry and thermodynamic stability challenge catalytic conversion. Traditional rigid catalysts require extreme conditions, limiting efficiency. A dynamic Cu&#8208;embedded liquid metal catalyst (Cu&#8208;LMC) achieves 5.9&#8197;mol&#8901;gCu&#8722;1&#8901;h&#8722;1 methanol yield with 82&#8201;% selectivity. Mild surface oxidation forms Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Ga sites, enhancing active copper availability while retaining structural flexibility. These findings highlight dynamic catalyst designs as critical for overcoming traditional limitations.







Abstract
Methane (CH4), a major greenhouse gas and abundant carbon resource, presents significant challenges in catalysis due to its high symmetry and thermodynamic stability, which tend to cause over&#8208;oxidation to CO2. Traditional catalysts require high temperatures and pressures to facilitate CH4 conversion, constrained by their rigid structures which lack the flexibility needed for optimizing complex reaction steps. This study introduces a novel Cu embedded liquid metal catalyst (Cu&#8208;LMC) based on gallium alloys, characterized by dynamic, self&#8208;adaptive structures that provide enhanced catalytic performance and selectivity. Our findings reveal that Cu&#8208;LMC achieves a high methane conversion to methanol yield (5.9&#8197;mol&#8901;gCu&#8722;1&#8901;h&#8722;1) with a selectivity of 82&#8201;%. The results show that mild surface oxidation significantly boosts the catalytic performance of Cu&#8208;LMC by increasing active copper sites through the formation of a Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Ga configuration while preserving the catalyst&#8216;s structural flexibility. In situ X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) analyses, along with ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations, demonstrate that the Cu&#8208;LMC enables self&#8208;adaptive structural adjustments that lower methanol desorption energy and increase the energy barrier for by&#8208;product formation, optimizing the overall methane conversion process. The results underscore the importance of designing catalysts with dynamic and adaptable structures to overcome traditional limitations and improve efficiency in catalytic reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Methane's high symmetry and thermodynamic stability challenge catalytic conversion. Traditional rigid catalysts require extreme conditions, limiting efficiency. A dynamic Cu-embedded liquid metal catalyst (Cu-LMC) achieves 5.9&#8197;mol&#8901;g&lt;sub&gt;Cu&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; methanol yield with 82&#8201;% selectivity. Mild surface oxidation forms Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Ga sites, enhancing active copper availability while retaining structural flexibility. These findings highlight dynamic catalyst designs as critical for overcoming traditional limitations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), a major greenhouse gas and abundant carbon resource, presents significant challenges in catalysis due to its high symmetry and thermodynamic stability, which tend to cause over-oxidation to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Traditional catalysts require high temperatures and pressures to facilitate CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion, constrained by their rigid structures which lack the flexibility needed for optimizing complex reaction steps. This study introduces a novel Cu embedded liquid metal catalyst (Cu-LMC) based on gallium alloys, characterized by dynamic, self-adaptive structures that provide enhanced catalytic performance and selectivity. Our findings reveal that Cu-LMC achieves a high methane conversion to methanol yield (5.9&#8197;mol&#8901;g&lt;sub&gt;Cu&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with a selectivity of 82&#8201;%. The results show that mild surface oxidation significantly boosts the catalytic performance of Cu-LMC by increasing active copper sites through the formation of a Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Ga configuration while preserving the catalyst&#8216;s structural flexibility. In situ X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) analyses, along with ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulations, demonstrate that the Cu-LMC enables self-adaptive structural adjustments that lower methanol desorption energy and increase the energy barrier for by-product formation, optimizing the overall methane conversion process.

         <title>Diffusion/Modulator Dual&#8208;Mediated Solid&#8208;Liquid/Vapor Interfacial Synthesis of Crystalline Covalent Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thirteen kinds of highly crystalline and oriented COF membranes are grown directly on the inner wall of glass vessel, through a diffusion/modulator dual&#8208;mediated solid&#8211;liquid/vapor interfacial synthesis strategy. Good compatibility of solvent&#8208;monomer&#8208;substrate and the slowed down imine exchange reaction promote heterogeneous nucleation and ordered crystal growth in the interface. The resultant COF membranes exhibit satisfactory adsorption performances and LCMs removal efficiency.







Abstract
Constructing oriented crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with controllable thickness for water purification is highly desirable. Herein, we present a simple and universal protocol to prepare high&#8208;quality COF membranes on the inner wall of a glass vessel using a diffusion/modulator dual&#8208;mediated solid&#8211;liquid/vapor interfacial synthesis strategy. By meticulous control of solvent and temperature, a thin supersaturated spreading liquid layer was formed on the glass wall surface and served as a confined microreactor for incubating crystal nuclei. This induced the aniline&#8208;modulated solid&#8211;liquid/vapor interfacial exchange reaction and upward growth of a highly ordered COF membrane. The experiments and theoretical simulations revealed the underlying mechanisms of solid&#8211;liquid/vapor interfacial nucleation, growth and crystallization. Using this strategy, we created 13 types of new, free&#8208;standing, imine&#8208;linked COF membranes with exceptional performances in crystallinity, porosity, stability, processability and adsorption capacity. As an application demonstration, a COF membrane&#8208;filled filter was coupled with high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography system for the automated removal of multitarget liquid&#8208;crystal monomers in real water samples (removal efficiency&#8805;96&#8201;%). This study enriches the synthesis toolboxes of COF membranes and broadens their application scopes.

         <title>Polyurethane Elastomers Strengthened by Pseudo[1]rotaxanes Based on Pillararenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pillar[5]arene&#8208;based pseudo[1]rotaxane is introduced into a linear polyurethane to prepare a class of polyurethane elastomers with spring&#8208;like structures. It is found that intramolecular sliding motions of the pseudo[1]rotaxane can greatly improve the mechanical properties of polyurethane elastomers.







Abstract
As a unique property of the interlocked structures, rotaxane allows for intramolecular motions between its wheel and axle components. Introduction of rotaxanes into polymers can endow them with distinctive macroscopic features and outstanding mechanical properties. Here, we prepare a copillar[5]arene with a hydroxyl and an amino&#8208;group on each end, which can spontaneously form a pseudo[1]rotaxane through intramolecular hydrogen bonds. This pseudo[1]rotaxane possesses a releasable extra alkyl chain, which is then incorporated into a linear polyurethane by reacting with a diisocyanate to prepare polyurethane elastomers with spring&#8208;like structures. The results of stress&#8208;strain test and dynamic mechanical analysis all indicate that sliding motions of the axle part on the pseudo[1]rotaxane in the polymer skeleton can greatly dissipate energy, which endows the elastomers with higher toughness and better fatigue resistance. Moreover, the addition of moderate amount of cuprous bromide to form cuprous&#8208;thioether coordination in the polymers can further improve the mechanical properties.

         <title>Electrolyte Decoupling Strategy for Metal Oxide&#8208;Based Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries Free of Crosstalk Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated a decoupled electrolyte (DCE) composed of a nonaqueous&#8208;phase (N&#8208;phase) anolyte and an aqueous&#8208;phase (A&#8208;phase) catholyte to prevent the Mn2+ crosstalk while facilitating Zn2+ conduction. The as&#8208;developed Zn|DCE|MnO2 full cells exhibited an extended cyclability over 900&#8197;cycles with negligible Mn2+ crosstalk, a decreased byproducts formation and H2 evolution compared with cells using an aqueous ZnCl2 electrolyte.







Abstract
The crosstalk of transition metal ions between the metal oxide cathode and Zn anode restricts the practical applications of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Herein, we propose a decoupled electrolyte (DCE) consisting of a nonaqueous&#8208;phase (N&#8208;phase) anolyte and an aqueous&#8208;phase (A&#8208;phase) catholyte to prevent the crosstalk of Mn2+, thus extending the lifespan of MnO2&#8208;based ZIBs. Experimental measurements and theoretical modelling verify that trimethyl phosphate (TMP) not only synergistically works with NH4Cl in the N&#8208;phase anolyte to enable fast Zn2+ conduction while blocking Mn2+ diffusion toward anode, but also modifies the Zn2+ solvation structure to suppress the dendrite formation and corrosion on Zn anode. Meanwhile, the A&#8208;phase catholyte effectively accelerates the cathode reaction kinetics. The as&#8208;developed Zn|DCE|MnO2 cell delivers 80.13&#8201;% capacity retention after 900&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This approach is applicable for other metal oxide cathode&#8208;based ZIBs, thereby opening a new avenue for developing ultrastable ZIBs.

         <title>Unraveling the Multifunctional Mechanism of Fluoroethylene Carbonate in Enhancing High&#8208;Performance Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

In this work, we comprehensively reveal the two&#8208;step &#8220;chocolate&#8208;cookie&#8221; shaped CEI formation mechanism in RT Na&#8208;S batteries driven by FEC. The solid&#8208;solid conversion of sulfur and impressive performance are achieved in this simplified system (456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C), which has the potential for further improvement.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries has attracted growing attentions in large&#8208;scale energy storage technology, while the serious shuttle effect and interface side reaction limit its practical application. Despite fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) has been widely used as an electrolyte additive or co&#8208;solvent to facilitate the optimization of electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase in RT Na&#8722;S batteries, its crucial influence and mechanism have not been clearly understood. Herein, we deeply reveal the two&#8208;steps cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation by using FEC as the exclusive electrolyte solvent. The results demonstrate that FEC participates in both rapid nucleophilic reaction and electrochemical decomposition on cathode, which can effectively in situ construct a unique &#8220;chocolate&#8208;cookie&#8221; shaped CEI consisted of NaF&#8208;rich double layers. This CEI eliminates the shuttle effect and ensures the solid&#8208;solid conversion of sulfur. Along with the stable F&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the Na anode, the RT Na&#8722;S battery delivers an impressive performance (456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C) with almost 100&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency. This significantly simplifies electrolyte design and provides valuable insights into the application of FEC in practical Na&#8722;S batteries.

     alt="Unraveling the Multifunctional Mechanism of Fluoroethylene Carbonate in Enhancing High-Performance Room-Temperature Sodium-Sulfur Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we comprehensively reveal the two-step &#8220;chocolate-cookie&#8221; shaped CEI formation mechanism in RT Na-S batteries driven by FEC. The solid-solid conversion of sulfur and impressive performance are achieved in this simplified system (456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C), which has the potential for further improvement.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room-temperature sodium-sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries has attracted growing attentions in large-scale energy storage technology, while the serious shuttle effect and interface side reaction limit its practical application. Despite fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) has been widely used as an electrolyte additive or co-solvent to facilitate the optimization of electrode-electrolyte interphase in RT Na&#8722;S batteries, its crucial influence and mechanism have not been clearly understood. Herein, we deeply reveal the two-steps cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation by using FEC as the exclusive electrolyte solvent. The results demonstrate that FEC participates in both rapid nucleophilic reaction and electrochemical decomposition on cathode, which can effectively in situ construct a unique &#8220;chocolate-cookie&#8221; shaped CEI consisted of NaF-rich double layers. This CEI eliminates the shuttle effect and ensures the solid-solid conversion of sulfur. Along with the stable F-rich solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the Na anode, the RT Na&#8722;S battery delivers an impressive performance (456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C) with almost 100&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency. This significantly simplifies electrolyte design and provides valuable insights into the application of FEC in practical Na&#8722;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Propane Activation on Pt Electrodes at Room Temperature: Quantification of Adsorbate Identity and Coverage</title>

Elucidating propane activation on Pt electrocatalyst, via the use of on&#8208;line electrochemical mass spectrometer, in aqueous acidic electrolyte. Combination of mass spectrometry and reductive coulometry sheds light on adsorption and desorption of propane&#8208;derived adsorbate species.







Abstract
C&#8722;H bond activation is the first step in manufacturing chemical products from readily available light alkane feedstock and typically proceeds via carbon&#8208;intensive thermal processes. The ongoing emphasis on decarbonization via electrification motivates low&#8208;temperature electrochemical alternatives that could lead to sustainable chemicals production. Platinum (Pt) electrocatalysts have shown activity towards reacting alkanes; however, little is known about propane electrocatalytic activation and conditions suitable for enabling selective oxidation to valuable products. Herein, we utilize a combination of electrochemical mass spectrometry (ECMS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the potential dependence of propane activation on Pt electrocatalysts. Results show a strong dependence of adsorption on the applied potential in room&#8208;temperature aqueous acidic electrolyte, with a maximum coverage of propane&#8208;derived adsorbates at 0.30&#8197;V vs RHE. Using charge deconvolution and deuterated experiments, the mechanism of adsorption was elucidated, and C3H2* was determined as the average dehydrogenated propane&#8208;derived adsorbate species. DFT calculations further corroborate these results, showing that the formation of deeply dehydrogenated species is energetically accessible at room temperature. The combined theoretical and experimental findings yield insights for selective activation of paraffinic C&#8722;H bonds at room temperature, aqueous conditions&#8212;a critical step towards decarbonized chemical manufacturing.

         <title>Sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom Porosity Tuning in Calixarene&#8208;Derived Porous Liquids via Supramolecular Complexation Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom porosity tuning in liquid phase was achieved via the constructure and structure engineering in calixarene&#8208;derived type&#8197;II porous liquids through supramolecular complexation. The well&#8208;maintained permanent porosity was confirmed via pressure swing gas adsorption and altered CO2 physisorption behavior. Slight difference between 4&#8211;5&#8197;&#197; in porosity of the calixarene host caused significant dynamic motion and transport behavior of CO2 and Xe molecules.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;&#197;ngstrom&#8208;level porosity engineering, which is appealing in gas separations, has been demonstrated in solid carbon, polymer, and framework materials but rarely achieved in the liquid phase. In this work, a gas molecular sieving effect in the liquid phase at sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom scale is created via sophisticated porosity tuning in calixarene&#8208;derived porous liquids (PLs). Type&#8197;II PLs are constructed via supramolecular complexation between the sodium salts of calixarene derivatives and crown ether solvents. The chemical structure variation and assembly behavior of the porous host upon PL construction are monitored by spectroscopy&#8208;, X&#8208;ray&#8208;, and neutron&#8208;scattering techniques. The presence of permanent porosity in calixarene&#8208;derived PLs is verified by pressure swing gas uptake, altered CO2 physisorption behavior, and molecular simulations. Sub&#8208;5 &#197;ngstrom porosity tuning within the PL phase is achieved by introducing bulky substituted groups on the benzene ring of the calixarene host, which then greatly affects the dynamic motion and transport behavior of CO2 molecules and the Xe uptake performance. The approach being demonstrated in this work represents a promising pathway to tune and leverage the porosity effect for enhanced gas uptake capacity and selectivity in liquid sorbents.

         <title>Enzymatic Reaction Network&#8208;Driven Polymerization&#8208;Induced Transient Coacervation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

An enzymatic reaction network (ERN) for polymerization&#8208;induced transient coacervation (ERN&#8208;PIC), with complete control over the system: polymerization, coacervation, dissolution and selective cargo uptake.







Abstract
A living cell has a highly complex microenvironment whereas numerous enzyme&#8208;driven processes are active at once. These procedures are incredibly accurate and efficient, although comparable control has not yet been established in vitro. Here, we design an enzymatic reaction network (ERN) that combines antagonistic and orthogonal enzymatic networks to produce adjustable dynamics of ATP&#8208;fueled transient coacervation. Using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;mediated Biocatalytic Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (BioATRP), we synthesized poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate), which subsequently formed coacervates with ATP. We rationally explored enzymatic control over coacervation and dissolution, using orthogonal and antagonistic enzyme pairs viz., alkaline phosphatase, Creatine phosphokinase, hexokinase, esterase, and urease. ATP&#8208;fuelled coacervates also demonstrate the enzymatic catalysis to prove its potential to be exploited as a cellular microreactor. Additionally, we developed ERN&#8208;polymerization&#8208;induced transient coacervation (ERN&#8208;PIC), with complete control over the system, polymerization, coacervation, and dissolution. Notably, the coacervation process itself determines functional properties, as seen in selective cargo uptake. The strategy offers cutting&#8208;edge biomimetic applications, and insights into cellular compartmentalization by bridging the gap between synthetic and biological systems. The development of temporally programmed coacervation is promising for the spatial arrangement of multienzyme cascades, and offers novel ideas on the architecture of artificial cells.

         <title>Hour&#8208;Long Afterglow in Flexible Polymeric Materials through the Introduction of Electron Donor/Acceptor Exciplexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hour&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) polymers were fabricated through the introduction of electron donor/acceptor exciplexes. The polymers exhibited a remarkable green afterglow persisting for 12&#8197;hours under ambient conditions. The polymers are flexible and transparent, which are useful properties for flexible display applications. Moreover, the polymers were spun into fibers with the HLA property remaining, which holds promise for application in wearable smart devices.







Abstract
The development of organic afterglow materials has garnered significant attention due to their diverse applications in smart devices, optoelectronics, and bioimaging. However, polymeric afterglow materials often suffer from short emission lifetimes, typically ranging from milliseconds to seconds, posing a significant challenge for achieving hour&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) polymers. This study presents the successful fabrication of transparent HLA polymers by introducing electron donor/acceptor exciplexes. Employing aromatic polyesters as the polymer electron acceptor and charge reservoirs, the resulting HLA polymers exhibited a remarkable green afterglow that persisted for 12&#8197;hours under ambient conditions, representing the longest duration achieved for polymeric afterglow materials to date. Intriguingly, these HLA polymers could be activated solely by sunlight, maintaining a green afterglow for over 6&#8197;hours at room temperature in air, which outperformed all previously reported afterglow polymers. The doped polymers exhibited superior flexibility and transparency, making them ideal candidates for flexible display applications. Furthermore, successfully spinning these doped polymers into fibers while retaining their HLA properties opens up exciting possibilities for their use in wearable smart devices.

         <title>Dynamic Passivation of Perovskite Films via Gradual Additive Release for Enhanced Solar Cell Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this, we propose a dynamic passivation strategy that employs a pre&#8208;passivator, formamidinesulfinic acid (FSA), to synchronize the release of additives with the generation of defect sites, thereby enabling in situ and real&#8208;time defect passivation. A champion perovskite solar cell achieves an impressive solar conversion efficiency of 25.33&#8201;%, accompanied with an exceptional stability.







Abstract
Modifying perovskites with functional additives has proven effective in refining the crystallization process and passivating the defects of perovskite films, thereby ensuring high photovoltaic efficiencies. However, conventional methods that involve pre&#8208;mixing additives into the precursor solution often face challenges due to discrepancies in the spatial distribution of slow&#8208;diffused additives relative to dynamically formed defect sites, resulting in limited passivation effectiveness. To address this issue, this study innovatively proposes a dynamic passivation strategy that utilizes a pre&#8208;passivator to gradually release active additives during the thermal crystallization process of perovskite films. By leveraging the principle of energy minimization, these timely&#8208;released additives can interact precisely and selectively with the high&#8208;energy defect sites generated during crystallization, thus facilitating efficient additive utilization and in situ real&#8208;time defect passivation. Through analysis of crystallization kinetics and carrier dynamic, it is demonstrated that this dynamic passivation approach significantly improves film quality and prolongs carrier lifetime, outperforming traditional pre&#8208;mixing tactics. Consequently, the final perovskite solar cell achieves an impressive solar conversion efficiency of 25.33&#8201;%, along with exceptional stability. This work provides strong support of tailored additive strategies aimed at further enhancing the efficiency of perovskite solar cells and their subsequent commercial applications.

         <title>Interfacial Water Orientation in Neutral Oxygen Catalysis for Reversible Ampere&#8208;Scale Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

A significant breakthrough in neutral oxygen catalysis was achieved by altering the orientation of water molecules from conventional O&#8208;down to unexpected H&#8208;down in the hydrogen bond network.







Abstract
The neutral oxygen catalysis is an electrochemical reaction of the utmost importance in energy generation, storage application, and chemical synthesis. However, the restricted availability of protons poses a challenge to achieving kinetically favorable oxygen catalytic reactions. Here, we alter the interfacial water orientation by adjusting the Br&#248;nsted acidity at the catalyst surface, to break the proton transfer limitation of neutral oxygen electrocatalysis. An unexpected role of water molecules in improving the activity of neutral oxygen catalysis is revealed, namely, increasing the H&#8208;down configuration water in electric double layers rather than merely affecting the energy barriers for reaction limiting steps. The proposed porous nanofibers with atomically dispersed MnN3 exhibit record&#8208;breaking activity (EORR@1/2/EOER@10&#8197;mA = 0.85/1.65&#8201;V vs. RHE) and reversibility (2500&#8197;h), outperforming all previously reported neutral catalysts and rivaling conventional alkaline systems. In particular, practical ampere&#8208;scale zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) stack are constructed with a capacity of 5.93 Ah and can stably operate under 1.0&#8201;A and 1.0&#8201;Ah conditions, demonstrating broad application prospects. This work provides a novel and feasible perspective for designing neutral oxygen electrocatalysts and reveals the future commercial potential in mobile power supply and large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Lattice Modulation on Singlet&#8208;Triplet Splitting of Silver Cluster Boosting Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TADF&#8208;active silver cluster exhibiting near&#8208;unity PLQY has been achieved through lattice modulation involving cation exchange followed by desolvation. The removal of the guest solvent via thermal activation in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) transformation fashion effectively controls the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting and surpasses both phosphorescence and non&#8208;radiative decay of the clusters, thereby boosting the PLQY from 12% to near&#8208;unity.







Abstract
Developing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;active silver clusters with near&#8208;unity quantum efficiency is of practical importance in cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic devices, but remains a tremendous challenge due to the difficulty of de novo synthesis and uncertainty of properties. Herein, we demonstrate a lattice modulation on parent TADF&#8208; active silver cluster, achieving TADF&#8208;driven photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 12&#8201;% to near&#8208;unity. Systematic experimental and calculated results reveal that the lattice modulation effectively lowers the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting (&#916;EST) from 718 to 549&#8197;cm&#8208;1, thereby facilitating thermally activated reverse intersystem crossing: T5&#8594;S5, leading to extremely efficient TADF by surpassing both phosphorescence and non&#8208;radiative decay, thus boosting the near&#8208;unity PLQY. Such high PLQY is extremely rare in the TADF&#8208;active silver clusters and even in the whole noble&#8208;metal clusters. This research showcases an unparalleled example of lattice modulation to realize near unity PLQY of TADF&#8208;active silver clusters.

         <title>Precise Separation of Complex Ultrafine Molecules through Solvating Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic and reversible structural deformations in crystallographically oriented two&#8208;dimensional COF membranes upon solvent exposure are disclosed. We leverage this to design molecular separation membranes and correlate sieving pore sizes with the number of COF layers. The membrane delivers exceptional stability, molecular selectivity, and practicality for pharmaceutical purification.







Abstract
Isoporous nanomaterials, with their proven potential for accurate molecular sieving, are of substantial interest in propelling sustainable membrane techniques. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are prominent due to their customizable isopores and chemistry. Still, the discrepancy in experimental and theoretical structures poses a challenge to developing COF membranes for molecular separations. Here, we report high&#8208;selectivity sieving of complex ultrafine molecules through solvating pore&#8208;to&#8208;pore&#8208;aligned two&#8208;dimensional COF membranes. Our structurally oriented membrane shows reversible interlayer expansion with intralayer shift in response to solvent exposure. This dynamic deformation induced by solvents leads to a reduction in the aperture of the membrane's sieving pores, which correlates with the number of COF layers. The resultant membranes yield largely improved molecular selectivity to discriminate binary and trinary complex mixtures, exceeding the conventional COF membranes. The membrane's robustness against solvents and physical aging permits extremely stable microporosity and reliable operation for over 3000&#8197;h. This exceptional performance positions our membrane as an alternative to enriching and purifying value&#8208;added chemicals, such as active pharmaceutical ingredients.

In this study, two distinctive carbene pro&#8208;chelates LAH2+ and LBH2+ (or LCH2+) were employed in preparation of heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes, to which LAH2+ bears a cyano substituted benzoimidazolium along with N&#8208;mesityl appendage, while LBH2+ (or LCH2+) carries the symmetrical benzoimidazolium entity. Notably, the reversible equilibration at high temperature was observed for m, f&#8208;ct14 and m, f&#8208;ct15 with a single LA chelate. In contrast, only the mer&#8208;substituted m&#8208;ct16 was obtained upon employing two LA chelates. All Ir(III) complexes exhibited blue photoluminescence (&#934;PL

         <title>A Hydrolytically Stable Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Simultaneous Desulfurization and Dehydration of Wet Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrolytically stable MOF has been reported for capturing SO2 from wet flue gas. Strikingly, the SO2 capture efficiency of the material is barely influenced by humidity, even if the pore filling with water is reached. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that its delicate pore structure featuring diverse pore dimensions and chemistry enables the segregation of trace SO2 and a large amount of water into different domains, paving the way for simultaneous desulfurization and dehydration by a single adsorbent.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have great prospects as adsorbents for industrial gas purification, but often suffer from issues of water stability and competitive water adsorption. Herein, we present a hydrolytically stable MOF that could selectively capture and recover trace SO2 from flue gas, and exhibits remarkable recyclability in the breakthrough experiments under wet flue&#8208;gas conditions, due to its excellent resistance to the corrosion of SO2 and the water&#8208;derived capillary forces. More strikingly, its SO2 capture efficiency is barely influenced by the increasing humidity, even if the pore filling with water is reached. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the delicate pore structure with diverse pore dimensions and chemistry leads to different adsorption kinetics and thermodynamics as well as segregated adsorption domains of SO2 and H2O. Significantly, this non&#8208;competitive adsorption mechanism enables simultaneous desulfurization and dehydration by a single adsorbent, opening an avenue toward cost&#8208;effective and simplified processing flowcharts for flue gas purification.

         <title>Flexible Fiber Sensors for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Redox Signaling Molecules in Exercise&#8208;Mimicking Engineered Skeletal Muscle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has reported the fabrication of dual flexible electrochemical sensors and achieved simultaneous monitoring of H2O2 and NO release from engineered skeletal muscle in response to exercise&#8208;mimicking stretch. The results proved that proper warm&#8208;up training could help improve exercise adaptation in skeletal muscle.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) in skeletal muscle provides crucial insights into the cause&#8208;and&#8208;effect relationships between physical activity and health benefits. However, the dynamic production of exercise&#8208;induced RONS remains poorly explored, due to the lack of sensing tools that can conform to soft skeletal muscle while monitor RONS release during exercise. Here we introduce dual flexible sensors via twisting carbon nanotubes into helical bundles of fibers and subsequent assembling electrochemical sensing components. These flexible sensors exhibit low bending stiffness, excellent H2O2 and NO sensing abilities, outstanding biocompatibility and compliance with engineered skeletal muscle tissue. This allows real&#8208;time and simultaneous monitoring of H2O2 and NO release from engineered skeletal muscle in response to different exercise&#8208;mimicking stretches, which reveals that warm&#8208;up activities before high&#8208;intensity exercise may enhance adaptive responses by down&#8208;regulating H2O2 and up&#8208;regulating NO production. The proposed sensing strategy demonstrates great versatility in monitoring multiple biomarkers of soft tissue and organs.

         <title>C&#8722;H Bond Activation by Sulfated Zirconium Oxide is Mediated by a Sulfur&#8208;Centered Lewis Superacid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfated Zirconium Oxide contains pyrosulfates that act as a reservoir of transiently adsorbed SO3 and sulfate. The open form of the pyrosulfate is very reactive towards C&#8722;H bonds in Ph3CH to form Ph3C+ or C&#8722;H bonds in highdensity polyethylene or isotactic polypropylene polymers to form cleavage products under hydrogenolysis conditions.







Abstract
Sulfated zirconium oxide (SZO) catalyzes the hydrogenolysis of isotactic polypropylene (iPP, Mw=13.3&#8197;kDa, &#272;=2.4, &lt;mmmm&gt;=94&#8201;%) or high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE, Mn=2.5&#8197;kDa, &#272;=3.6) to branched alkane products. We propose that this reactivity is driven by the pyrosulfate sites SZO, which open under mild conditions to transiently form adsorbed SO3 and sulfate groups. This adsorbed SO3 is a very strong Lewis acid that binds 15N&#8208;pyridine or triethylphosphineoxide (TEPO) (&#916;Eads&gt;&#8722;39&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), reacts with Ph3CH to form Ph3C+, and mediates H/D exchange in dihydroanthracene&#8208;d4. DFT studies show that pyrosulfate sites open with a modest 26.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 barrier to form the adsorbed SO3 and sulfate in the presence of a tetramer of propylene. Hydride abstraction from the tertiary C&#8722;H in this model is exothermic and subsequent &#946;&#8208;scission forms cleaved products. Analysis of the energetics provided here brackets the hydride ion affinity (HIA) of the adsorbed SO3 between 226.2 to 237.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, among largest values reported for a formally neutral Lewis acid. This study explains how SZO, a classic heterogeneous catalyst, can form carbocations by a redox neutral hydride abstraction reaction by very strong Lewis sites.

DFT studies show that pyrosulfate sites open with a modest 26.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; barrier to form the adsorbed SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and sulfate in the presence of a tetramer of propylene. Hydride abstraction from the tertiary C&#8722;H in this model is exothermic and subsequent &#946;-scission forms cleaved products. Analysis of the energetics provided here brackets the hydride ion affinity (HIA) of the adsorbed SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; between 226.2 to 237.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, among largest values reported for a formally neutral Lewis acid. This study explains how &lt;b&gt;SZO&lt;/b&gt;, a classic heterogeneous catalyst, can form carbocations by a redox neutral hydride abstraction reaction by very strong Lewis sites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Modular Peptide Nanoparticles for Ferroptosis&#8208;Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an orchestrated nanoparticle system utilizing modular peptide assemblies for optimizing both assembly properties and therapeutic functionalities. The resulting nanoparticles, which integrate a hydrophobic ferroptosis precursor, an IDO1 inhibitor, and a hydrophilic peptidic PD&#8722;L1 antagonist, address the limitations of current IDO1 inhibitors through ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced tumor immunotherapy.







Abstract
Indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitors are promising for treating tumors but have limited efficacy due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In this study, we develop an orchestrated nanoparticle system using modular peptide assemblies, where the co&#8208;assembled sequences are designed for the specific binding to the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains, guiding the assembly process and enabling the customization of nanoparticle properties. We exploit the modularity of this platform to integrate a hydrophobic ferroptosis precursor, an IDO1 inhibitor, and a hydrophilic peptidic PD&#8722;L1 antagonist for optimizing therapeutic outcomes through ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced tumor immunotherapy. The resulting nanoparticles induce immunogenic ferroptosis, enhance the intratumoral function of T lymphocytes, suppress regulatory T cells, and effectively modulate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby facilitating regression of tumor growth. This work provides a modular peptide&#8208;based nanoparticle engineering strategy and holds significant potential for advancing cancer treatment.

         <title>In Vivo Self&#8208;Assembly of PROTACs by Bioorthogonal Chemistry for Precision Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

Nano&#8208;click&#8208;formed PROTACs (Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs) are an innovative strategy for tumor protein degradation, using divided precursors encapsulated in cyclic RGDfC peptide&#8208;modified liposomes (cRGD&#8208;LPs). This system enables in situ self&#8208;assembly to form complete PROTACs within tumors, preventing premature bioorthogonal reactions and enhancing targeting to integrin &#945;v&#946;3&#8208;expressing tumors for precise and efficient degradation.







Abstract
Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) hold immense promise for targeted protein degradation; however, challenges such as off&#8208;target effects, poor drug&#8208;likeness properties, and the &#8220;hook effect&#8221; remain. This study introduces Nano&#8208;Click&#8208;formed PROTACs (Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs) for precise tumor protein degradation in vivo. Traditional PROTACs with high molecular weight were first divided into two smaller druglike precursors capable of self&#8208;assembling to form functional PROTACs through a bioorthogonal reaction. Then, optimal CLIPTACs precursors (W4 and Z2) were encapsulated individually into cyclic RGDfC&#8208;peptide&#8208;modified liposomes to prepare Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs, enabling tumor&#8208;targeted delivery and subsequent in situ self&#8208;assembly to form PROTACs WZ42 within tumor cells. The degradation abilities of Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs in vitro and in vivo were further verified using a key oncology target, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), validating the safety, efficacy and &#8220;anti&#8208;hook effect&#8221; of this strategy. Overall, Nano&#8208;CLIPTACs represent a critical step towards the clinical translation of PROTACs technology for precise targeted anti&#8208;cancer therapies.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Sensing Analogue Nanopore for Rapid Detection of Protein&#8208;Related Targets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;sensing analogue nanopore (CeSa&#8208;nanopore) captures SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by specific receptor proteins ACE2 and changes the charge on the outer surface of the nanopore to enable the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This method eliminates the need for sample pre&#8208;treatment, enables rapid target detection, and allows for the detection of different targets by changing the cell membrane.







Abstract
Nanopores offer significant advantages in biosensing. Conventional nanopore sensors require probe modification within the pore, and there are two major obstacles: inhomogeneity of probe modification within the pore, and distortion of the detection signal due to the uncontrollable dynamics of the target within the pore. Here, we constructed a cell&#8208;sensing analogue nanopore (CeSa&#8208;nanopore), by coating the outer surface of the nanopore with cell membrane. The inhomogeneity of probe modification and the uncontrollable kinetics of target&#8208;probe binding were also addressed. Specific cells are selected to prepare CeSa&#8208;nanopore, for example, cells with high expression of angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are used to achieve the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. When SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 binds to CeSa&#8208;nanopore the surface potential changes, causing a change in the ionic current, thus enabling its detection with a detection rate of 100&#8201;%. In addition, the detection of different proteins, such as follicle&#8208;stimulating hormone (FSH), can be achieved by changing the cell membrane coating. The identification of cancer cells in ascites can also be achieved by utilizing homologous targeting between cancer cells. Importantly, the use of CeSa&#8208;nanopores for the detection of these targets eliminates the need for pre&#8208;processing and significantly reduces detection time.

         <title>Interface Engineering of MOF Nanosheets for Accelerated Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Zr&#8208;TCPP(Ni) nanosheets with the merits of robust structures and efficient catalytic metal sites has been presented for separator modification in Li&#8208;S batteries. The ultrathin modification layer with the uniform pore channels and efficient catalytic species can achieve fast Li+ transportation, effective polysulfides interception, and rapid catalytic conversion of polysulfides.







Abstract
Modifying the separator is considered as an effective strategy for achieving high performance lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. However, most modification layers are excessively thick, with catalytic active sites primarily located within the material&#8242;s interior. This configuration severely impacts Li+ transport and the efficient catalytic conversion of polysulfides. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a multifunctional separator that integrates ultrathin design, catalytic activity, and ion sieving capabilities. Herein, we successfully linked TCPP(Ni) as a secondary ligand with Zr&#8208;BTB nanosheets to create an ultra&#8208;thin separator modification layer (Zr&#8208;TCPP(Ni)) with efficient ion sieving and catalytic properties. The resultant multifunctional separators provide robust ion sieving capabilities that promote rapid Li+ transport and intercept polysulfides shuttling. Therefore, The Zr&#8208;TCPP(Ni)@PP cell maintains 70.0&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 600&#8197;cycles at a high rate of 3&#8197;C, while achieving an impressive areal capacity of 4.55&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;cm&#8722;2 even with high sulfur content of 80&#8197;wt% at 0.5&#8197;C. This work provides valuable insights for rational design of MOF interface engineering in high energy density Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Transitioning Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Solid States to Aqueous Phases via a Cyclic Peptide&#8208;Based Supramolecular Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universally applicable supramolecular strategy to transition room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from solid states to aqueous phases is reported. By utilizing a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, a series of aqueous RTP materials are constructed through the noncovalent dispersion of diverse organic phosphors within its rigid hydrophobic microdomain.







Abstract
Aqueous room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered considerable attention for their significant potential across various applications such as bioimaging, sensing, and encryption. However, establishing a universally applicable method for achieving aqueous RTP remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we present a versatile supramolecular strategy to transition RTP from solid states to aqueous phases. By leveraging a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, we have developed a noncovalent approach to molecularly disperse diverse organic phosphors within its rigid hydrophobic microdomain in water, yielding a series of aqueous RTP materials. Moreover, high&#8208;performance supramolecular phosphorescence resonance energy transfer (PRET) systems have been constructed. Through the facile co&#8208;assembly of a fluorescent acceptor with the existing RTP system, these PRET systems exhibit high energy transfer efficiencies (&gt;80&#8201;%), red&#8208;shifted afterglow emission (520&#8211;790&#8197;nm), ultralarge Stokes shifts (up to 450&#8197;nm), and improved photoluminescence quantum yields (6.1&#8211;30.7&#8201;%). This study not only provides a general strategy for constructing aqueous RTP materials from existing phosphors, but also facilitates the creation of PRET systems featuring color&#8208;tunable afterglow emission.

         <title>Selective Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Catalysed by Simple Alkali&#8208;Metal Bases in DMSO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple alkali&#8208;metal bases catalyse efficient and selective hydrogen isotope exchange in the presence of the deuterium source dimethyl sulfoxide&#8208;d6. Heterocycles, amides, fluoroarenes and other aromatic motifs can be selectively deuterated at room temperature under mild reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies show the crucial role of the metalated solvent, enabling the design of a new set of conditions for less reactive substrates.







Abstract
Isotope Exchange processes are becoming the preferred way to prepare isotopically labelled molecules, avoiding the redesign of multistep synthetic protocols. In the case of deuterium incorporation, the most used strategy has employed transition metals, that offer high reactivity under mild reaction conditions. Despite their success, the trade&#8208;off is that these metals are precious, so expensive, and often exhibit high toxicity. Therefore, alternative transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocols would be a welcome addition to this field. In this report we show how the simple bases NaHMDS (HMDS=hexamethyldisilazide) and NaCH2SiMe3 can efficiently and selectively promote deuteration of a wide range of C(sp2)&#8722;H and C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in DMSO&#8208;d6, providing an easy and direct access to deuterated compounds. Heterocycles, fluoroarenes, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, amides and other aromatic molecules could be deuterated under mild conditions using catalytic amounts of base. Mechanistic studies along with the isolation and characterisation of reaction intermediates have flagged up the importance of the metalated substrate and metalated solvent in solution, establishing an equilibrium between these compounds is crucial for the success of this approach. An alkali&#8208;metal effect was observed, with heavier alkali&#8208;metal amides being more reactive at room temperature, but their lower stability at higher temperatures made sodium bases the optimal reagents for Hydrogen Isotope Exchange.

         <title>Photochromic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Based on Host&#8208;Guest Strategy and Different Viologen Derivatives for Organic Amines Sensing and Information Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the design of three photochromic MOFs (NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3) encapsulating viologen derivatives by host&#8208;guest strategy. NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3 exhibit notable reversible photochromic change from yellow to green under 365&#8197;nm UV irradiation owing to the production of intermolecular viologen radicals. Based on the excellent photochromic properties of viologens, NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3 enable intuitive detection of volatile amine and anticounterfeiting applications.







Abstract
The encapsulation of viologen derivatives in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to construct host&#8208;guest materials has been widely discussed owing to their distinctive spatial arrangement and physical/chemical properties. Herein, three new photochromic MOFs (NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3) have been successfully synthesized by 1,1,2,2&#8208;Tetra(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)ethylene (H4TCPE) ligand as well as three different viologen derivatives based on host&#8208;guest strategy. Remarkably, NWM&#8208;1&#8211;3 exhibit a notable reversible photochromism change from yellow to green under 365&#8197;nm UV irradiation. The distance between the electron&#8208;deficient N atom in the viologens and the electron&#8208;rich carboxylate oxygens satisfies the electron transfer (ET) pathway, and thus ET occurs upon irradiation, producing intermolecular viologen radicals. NWM&#8208;1 is able to produce colored responses to different volatile amines by ET and can be recognizable to the naked eye. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) analysis and comparative experiments have demonstrated that the host&#8208;guest strategy significantly enhances the electron&#8208;accepting ability of viologens, thereby achieving superior amine sensing performance. NWM&#8208;2 and 3 have been realized in various applications, such as security code, fingerprint, and QR codes for anticounterfeiting. This work provides new host&#8208;guest strategy for designing highly sensitive photochromic materials and color&#8208;tunable luminescent materials, advancing the development of assembled photochromic materials closer to commercialization.

         <title>Identifying N Coordination Types of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Spin&#8208;Modulated Luminol Cathodic Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental and theoretical evidences have been provided that modulating the type of nitrogen coordination in Co single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) can change the d&#8208;orbital spin&#8208;electron configuration of Co atom and selectively regulate the O2 activation capacity, resulting in the production of different reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn affects the subsequent electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behaviour. Based on the correlation between nitrogen coordination type and luminol/dissolved oxygen cathodic ECL behaviour, we propose a strategy based on luminol cathode ECL to rapidly identify the nitrogen coordination type of SACs.







Abstract
The type of coordinated N atoms in the metal&#8208;N coordination structure is of paramount importance to the catalytic property of N&#8208;modified carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for analyzing the coordination environments of SACs. Despite its efficacy, the limited availability of synchrotron light sources and the complexity of data analysis have constrained its broader application in identifying metal&#8208;N coordination types within SACs. In this work, two kind of CoN4 SACs, were prepared by varying the N source. Then their electrochemiluminescence (ECL) behavior in the luminol/dissolved oxygen system during cathodic scanning were investigated. In comparison to CoN4(pyridinic N), for which the spin density displays dz2 orbital characteristics, CoN4(pyrrolic N) exhibits dxz orbital features, which was more conducive to the subsequent cleavage of the O&#8722;O bond in O2&#8901;&#8722; to &#8901;OH, resulting in the generation of more active intermediates *OH and the promotion of cathodic ECL emission. This work demonstrates that the ECL technique provides a novel method for the rapid identification of Co&#8722;N coordination types and the spin nature of the metal center in CoN4 SACs.

         <title>A Gate&#8208;Opening Control Strategy via Nitrate&#8211;Chloride Anion Exchange for Enhanced Hydrogen Isotope Separation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

Gate&#8208;opening control via anion exchange in JCM&#8208;1 enables enhanced hydrogen isotope separation through precise tuning of pore aperture and diffusion barriers. The dynamic interplay between structural flexibility and adsorption energetics maximizes D2/H2 selectivity, establishing a robust platform for cryogenic gas separation applications.







Abstract
Efficient separation of hydrogen isotopes, especially deuterium (D2), is pivotal for advancing industries such as nuclear fusion, semiconductor processing, and metabolic imaging. Current technologies, including cryogenic distillation and Girdler sulfide processes, suffer from significant limitations in selectivity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, we introduce a novel approach utilizing an imidazolium&#8208;based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF), JCM&#8208;1, designed to enhance D2/H2 separation through temperature&#8208;dependent gate&#8208;opening controlled by ion exchange. By substituting NO3&#8722; ions in JCM&#8208;1(NO3&#8722;) with Cl&#8722; ions to form JCM&#8208;1(Cl&#8722;), we precisely modulate the gate&#8208;opening threshold, achieving a significant enhancement in isotope selectivity. JCM&#8208;1(NO3&#8722;) exhibited a D2/H2 selectivity (SD2/H2) of 14.4 at 30&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, while JCM&#8208;1(Cl&#8722;) achieved an exceptional selectivity of 27.7 at 50&#8197;K and 1&#8197;mbar. This heightened performance is attributed to the reduced pore aperture and higher gate&#8208;opening temperature resulting from the Cl&#8722; exchange, which optimizes the selective adsorption of D2. Our findings reveal that JCM&#8208;1 frameworks, with their finely tunable gate&#8208;opening properties, offer a highly efficient and adaptable platform for hydrogen isotope separation. This work not only advances the understanding of ion&#8208;exchanged MOFs but also opens new pathways for targeted applications in isotope separation and other gas separation processes.

         <title>CO Adsorption on a Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Stably Embedded in Graphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the chemical activity of isolated metal atoms confined in graphene on Ni(111), using carbon monoxide as a probe molecule. At room temperature, CO stably adsorbs on Co but not on Ni. Electronic descriptors clarify this behavior, offering valuable insights for designing graphene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts.







Abstract
Confined single metal atoms in graphene&#8208;based materials have proven to be excellent catalysts for several reactions and promising gas sensing systems. However, whether the chemical activity arises from the specific type of metal atom or is a direct consequence of the confinement itself remains unclear.

         <title>A Catch&#8208;Release Strategy for the Genomics&#8208;Driven Discovery of Antiproliferative Furan&#8208;Functionalized Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A streamlined strategy for the discovery and isolation of pharmacologically relevant furan&#8208;containing nonribosomal peptides is presented. Genome mining prioritizes microbes harboring specialized 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) synthases, and a reversible Fua Diels&#8211;Alder reaction enables the rapid and selective discovery and resin&#8208;based purification of Fua&#8208;bearing compounds. Two new classes of antiproliferative Fua&#8208;harboring peptides were identified in this way.







Abstract
Furan&#8208;functionalized peptides are of significant pharmacological interest due to their pronounced bioactivities and unique potential for orthogonal bioconjugation and derivatization. However, naturally occurring peptides with furyl side chains are exceedingly rare. This study presents a streamlined method to predict and assess the microbial production of peptides incorporating 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) moieties. The approach integrates genome mining and the reversible, chemoselective tagging of furyl residues, utilizing their unique Diels&#8211;Alder reactivity, for mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;guided identification of candidate compounds. By employing the rhizonin Fua synthase as a bioinformatic handle and through heterologous reconstitution of Fua biosynthesis, we identified previously unknown Fua biosynthetic pathways in diverse bacterial phyla, including actinomycetes, cyanobacteria, actinobacteria, and &#947;&#8208;proteobacteria, suggesting that Fua&#8208;containing peptides are remarkably widely distributed. Metabolic profiling by reversible tagging facilitated the detection of Fua&#8208;containing metabolites in their native producers. The successful adaptation of this method for solid support enabled the direct enrichment of furyl&#8208;substituted peptides from complex mixtures. This multi&#8208;pronged approach enabled the discovery and characterization of two novel families of Fua cyclopeptides (rubriamides and typhamides) with potent antiproliferative effects against human tumor cells and nematodes. The innovative catch&#8208;and&#8208;release strategy, in conjunction with genome mining, represents a valuable tool for the discovery of new furan&#8208;substituted natural products.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Confined Disordered Hydrogen Bonds Enable Efficient Lithium Transport in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State PEO&#8208;Based Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (ASSEs) optimization approach with surface&#8208;confined disordered H&#8208;bonds is developed through the construction of rich donor&#8208;acceptor interactions. The crystallization inhibition of PEO, anchoring of TFSI&#8722;, and weak coordination of Li+ are realized while maintaining the stability of the Li+&#8208;conducting system, which are conducive to efficient Li+ transport in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes are essential to advance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) with high safety/energy density due to their inherent flexibility and scalability. However, the inefficient Li+ transport in PEO often leads to poor rate performance and diminished stability of the ASSLBs. The regulation of intermolecular H&#8208;bonds is regarded as one of the most effective approaches to enable efficient Li+ transport, while the practical performances are hindered by the electrochemical instability of free H&#8208;bond donors and the constrained mobility of highly ordered H&#8208;bonding structures. To overcome these challenges, we develop a surface&#8208;confined disordered H&#8208;bond system with stable donor&#8208;acceptor interactions to construct a loosened chain segments/ions arrangement in the bulk phase of PEO&#8208;based electrolytes, realizing the crystallization inhibition of PEO, weak coordination of Li+ and entrapment of anions, which are conducive to efficient Li+ transport and stable Li+ deposition. The rationally designed LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLB demonstrates a long cycle&#8208;life of over 400 cycles at 1.0&#8197;C and 65&#8201;&#176;C with a capacity retention rate of 87.5&#8201;%, surpassing most of the currently reported polymer&#8208;based ASSLBs. This work highlights the importance of confined disordered H&#8208;bonds on Li+ transport in an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery system, paving the way for the future design of polymer&#8208;based ASSLBs.

         <title>Directing Zn Growth with Biased Adsorption of Straight&#8208;chain Molecules for Superior Zn Anode Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straight&#8208;chain molecule (Scm) with double terminated polar groups was designed as an additive for the aqueous electrolyte. The hydroxyl groups firmly anchor the Scms to the Zn anode surface through horizontal adsorption, which enables high surface coverage. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that selective adsorption of Scms on Zn surface induces the deposition behavior of Zn and protects the Zn anode. The electrochemical performance of cells with Scms is significantly improved, especially at a high temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C.

Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs), which have attracted attentions in the field of energy storage, is affected by dendrites and side reactions of Zn anode, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance of AZIBs. Herein, we propose a biased adsorption strategy mediated by straight&#8208;chain molecule (Scm) for stabilizing Zn anode. The dual polar termini of Scms guaranties securely anchor themselves in a parallel orientation upon the Zn anode surface. This provides a comprehensive coverage, effectively sequestering water molecules from the Zn anode and precipitating the formation of a water&#8208;depleted electric double layer (EDL). Furthermore, the Scms selectively adsorb along the crystallographic planes, guiding the deposition of Zn2+. Consequently, the incorporation of these Scms successfully mitigates anode corrosion, HER, and dendrites. The Zn||Zn, Zn||Cu and Zn||V6O13 cells with Scms display significantly enhanced electrochemical performance, especially at elevated temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work highlights the potential of cost&#8208;effective, straight&#8208;chain electrolyte additives for enhancing Zn anode stability.

     alt="Directing Zn Growth with Biased Adsorption of Straight-chain Molecules for Superior Zn Anode Stability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A straight-chain molecule (Scm) with double terminated polar groups was designed as an additive for the aqueous electrolyte. The hydroxyl groups firmly anchor the Scms to the Zn anode surface through horizontal adsorption, which enables high surface coverage. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that selective adsorption of Scms on Zn surface induces the deposition behavior of Zn and protects the Zn anode. The electrochemical performance of cells with Scms is significantly improved, especially at a high temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>t2 Occupancy as an Effective and Predictive Descriptor for the Design of High&#8208;Performance Spinel Oxide Peroxidase&#8208;like Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
t2 occupancy was first reported as an effective and predictive descriptor for spinel oxide nanozymes. Spinel oxides with a medium t2 occupancy of about 4.4 occupied the volcanic apex, possessing the highest peroxidase&#8208;like activity. By combining t2 occupancy with a dual descriptors strategy (O&#946; as a secondary descriptor) that drove a 3D volcanic curve and a dual&#8208;site optimizing strategy beyond the limits of volcanic curve, a rational design strategy was proposed, obtaining the high&#8208;performance CuCo2O4 nanozyme.







Abstract
Nanozymes are next generation of enzyme mimics. Due to the lack of activity descriptors, most nanozymes were discovered through trial&#8208;and&#8208;error strategies or by accident. While eg occupancy in an octahedral crystal field was proven as an effective descriptor, the t2 in a tetrahedral crystal field has rarely been explored. Here, we first identified t2 occupancy as an effective and predictive descriptor. Then, we predicted and demonstrated that spinel oxide nanozymes (AB2O4) with a t2 occupancy of around 4.4 at A site had the highest activity. Furthermore, we introduced O&#946; content as a secondary descriptor. The dual descriptor strategy resulted in a three&#8208;dimensional volcanic curve, converging at a vertex. To surpass the limitations of volcanic curves, a dual site optimizing strategy was proposed, guiding the optimization of both A and B sites as Cu and Co, respectively. The designed CuCo2O4 exhibited the highest activity, achieving around 100&#8208; and 2&#8208;fold enhancement compared to initial material and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spinel oxide nanozyme LiCo2O4, respectively. Density functional theory calculations provided a theoretical basis for the catalytic process. This work provides a new strategy for the rational design of nanozymes, and t2 occupancy may also be applicable to the design of other catalysts.

         <title>Constrained Heterogeneous CoFe2O4/ZnO/PMS Fenton&#8208;Like System for Industrial Wastewater Remediation with Recyclability and Zero Metal Loss</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

The reaction region in constrained completely heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like reaction was clarified to within slipping plane rather traditional particle interface, which exhibited outstanding salt resistance, recyclability, and extremely low metal ion loss.







Abstract
Although heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like processes have attracted widespread attention in wastewater treatment, the mass leached active ions lead to secondary pollution and confuse the demarcation of reaction region. By constructing a constrained completely heterogeneous system and highlighting its reaction region concentrated within the slipping plane of particles, this work achieves efficient organic pollutants degradation without leaching of any free active metal components. Based on the Poisson&#8211;Boltzmann equation and electric double layer model, the specific existing of the constrained region is confirmed, and this neglected reaction region between solid interface and slipping plane in traditional heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like reaction is clarified firstly. Due to the unique constrained property, this system demonstrates exceptional potentials application to natural water and actual industrial wastewater for its broad resistance to environmental interference. Furthermore, the alkalization aging process enables this system achieve catalyst recycle and zero metal ions emission with maintaining outstanding pollutants removing performance even in high&#8208;salt wastewater, exhibiting the superiority of the constrained completely heterogeneous system. This work demonstrated the important reaction region within slipping plane and provided a clearer boundary in heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like system.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction through Enhanced Mass Transfer in Cu&#8208;Bipyridine 2D Covalent Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabricating Cu&#8208;bipyridine 2D covalent organic framework films with significantly exposed catalytic sites and boosting electrocatalytic nitrate reduction through Cu&#8722;N synergistic deoxidation and hydrogenation mechanism. Cu sites act as key centers for adsorption and activation, while bipyridine sites facilitate water adsorption and dissociation, providing H* and accelerating efficient synthesis of ammonia.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO3RR) is a promising method for pollutant removal and ammonia synthesis and involves the transfer of eight electrons and nine protons. As such, the rational design of catalytic interfaces with enhanced mass transfer is crucial for achieving high ammonia yield rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE). In this work, we incorporated a Cu&#8208;bipyridine catalytic interface and fabricated crystalline 2D covalent organic framework films with significantly exposed catalytic sites, leading to improved FE and ammonia yield (FE=92.7&#8201;%, NH3 yield rate=14.9&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#8197;M nitrate) compared to bulk catalysts and outperforming most reported NO3RR electrocatalysts. The film&#8208;like morphology enhances mass transfer across the Cu&#8208;bipyridine interface, resulting in superior catalytic performance. We confirmed the reaction pathway and mechanism through in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. The Cu sites act as primary centers for adsorption and activation, while the bipyridine sites facilitate water adsorption and dissociation, supplying sufficient H* and accelerating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics. This study provides a viable strategy to enhance mass transfer at the catalytic interface through rational morphology control, boosting the intrinsic activity of catalysts in the NO3RR process.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Conjugated Macrocycles: Synthesis, Conductivity, and Application in Electrochemical CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of nitrogen&#8208;rich conjugated macrocycles are reported that mimic the structure and function of semiconducting 2D metal&#8211;organic and covalent organic frameworks while providing improved processability and surface tunability. By using electrochemically mediated CO2 capture as an example, it is shown how colloidal phenazine&#8208;based organic macrocycles improve electrical contact and active&#8208;site electrochemical accessibility relative to bulk COF powders.







Abstract
Here we report a series of nitrogen&#8208;rich conjugated macrocycles that mimic the structure and function of semiconducting 2D metal&#8211;organic and covalent organic frameworks while providing greater solution processability and surface tunability. Using a new tetraaminotriphenylene building block that is compatible with both coordination chemistry and dynamic covalent chemistry reactions, we have synthesized two distinct macrocyclic cores containing Ni&#8722;N and phenazine&#8208;based linkages, respectively. The fully conjugated macrocycle cores support strong interlayer stacking and accessible nanochannels. For the metal&#8211;organic macrocycles, good out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport is preserved, with pressed pellet conductivities of 10&#8722;3&#8197;S/cm for the nickel variants. Finally, using electrochemically mediated CO2 capture as an example, we illustrate how colloidal phenazine&#8208;based organic macrocycles improve electrical contact and active site electrochemical accessibility relative to bulk covalent organic framework powders. Together, these results highlight how simple macrocycles can enable new synthetic directions as well as new applications by combining the properties of crystalline porous frameworks, the processability of nanomaterials, and the precision of molecular synthesis.

Using a new tetraaminotriphenylene building block that is compatible with both coordination chemistry and dynamic covalent chemistry reactions, we have synthesized two distinct macrocyclic cores containing Ni&#8722;N and phenazine-based linkages, respectively. The fully conjugated macrocycle cores support strong interlayer stacking and accessible nanochannels. For the metal&#8211;organic macrocycles, good out-of-plane charge transport is preserved, with pressed pellet conductivities of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S/cm for the nickel variants. Finally, using electrochemically mediated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture as an example, we illustrate how colloidal phenazine-based organic macrocycles improve electrical contact and active site electrochemical accessibility relative to bulk covalent organic framework powders. Together, these results highlight how simple macrocycles can enable new synthetic directions as well as new applications by combining the properties of crystalline porous frameworks, the processability of nanomaterials, and the precision of molecular synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of High&#8208;Performance Infrared Nonlinear Optical PAs3S3 with Perfectly Aligned Polar Molecular Cage via a Bipolar&#8208;Axis&#8208;Symmetry Coupling Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduce a bipolar&#8208;axis&#8208;symmetry coupling strategy to enhance the arrangement of polar molecular cages for infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals. By substituting C3v symmetric [B3O6] groups with polar [PAs3S3] cages in the &#946;&#8208;BBO lattice, we synthesized PAs3S3 (PAS), which maintains a consistent polar arrangement crucial for optimal NLO performance. PAS exhibits an impressive second harmonic generation (SHG) approximately eight times that of AgGaS2, with a substantial band gap of 2.75&#8197;eV and robust stability against air and moisture, positioning it as a promising candidate for IR NLO applications.







Abstract
Strong polar molecular cages have recently emerged as novel functional building units for high&#8208;performance infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) crystals. However, these highly polar molecular cages often arrange themselves in a way that cancels out their polarity, leading to a more energetically stable state. As a result, most cage crystal formations tend to crystallize in centrosymmetric space groups, which conflicts with the primary requirement for NLO crystals. Herein, we address the challenge of polar molecular cage arrangement through bipolar&#8208;axis&#8208;symmetry coupling strategy, utilizing classical NLO parent compounds. By substituting the C3v symmetric [B3O6] groups with polar C3v symmetric [PAs3S3] cages within the &#946;&#8208;BBO polar aixs lattice, we successfully synthesized a new compound, PAs3S3 (PAS), which exhibits a consistent arrangement of polar molecular cages &#8212; crucial for maximizing NLO performance. Additionally, due to the non&#8208;covalent interactions among [PAs3S3] polar molecular cages, PAS demonstrates an unexpectedly strong second harmonic generation (SHG) about 8 times that of AgGaS2, along with a significant band gap of 2.75&#8197;eV. Furthermore, PAS exhibits remarkable stability against air and moisture. These findings validate our design strategy and position PAS as a promising candidate for applications in IR NLO crystals.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Carbon Fixation Using Photosynthetic Organelles in Artificial Photosynthetic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosynthetic organelles were constructed to efficiently produce ATP in the presence of phycocyanin. They were encapsulated into giant unilamellar vesicles together with a carbon fixation pathway to build artificial photosynthetic cells to produce acetyl&#8208;CoA upon light irradiation.







Abstract
Building an artificial photosynthetic cell from scratch helps to understand the working mechanisms of chloroplasts. It is a challenge to achieve carbon fixation triggered by photosynthetic organelles in an artificial cell. ATP synthase and photosystem II (PSII) are purified and reconstituted onto the phospholipid membrane to fabricate photosynthetic organelles. With the integration of phycocyanin, the ATP production yield increases by 2.51&#8208;fold due to the enhanced light harvesting capability. The carbon fixation pathway is established by converting &#945;&#8208;oxoglutarate to acetyl&#8208;CoA and oxaloacetate with cascade enzyme reactions including the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), aconitase (ACO), and ATP citrate lyase (ACL). The photosynthetic organelles, phycocyanin, and carbon fixation pathway are encapsulated into giant unilamellar vesicles to obtain artificial photosynthetic cells, which convert &#945;&#8208;oxoglutarate to acetyl&#8208;CoA and oxaloacetate inside artificial cells upon light irradiation. The acetyl&#8208;CoA is the most important intermediate product in the cellular metabolic networks for the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. Our results provide a way for efficient light energy conversion to produce ATP and fix CO2, and pave the path to build autonomous artificial cells with more complicated metabolic networks.

         <title>Amplified Cascade Catalysis for RAFT Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amplified cascade catalysis consisting of glucose oxidase (GOx) deoxygenation and Fenton reaction is reported and applied to reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The two catalysts used in this amplified cascade catalysis can interact with each other, enabling regeneration of ferrocene catalyst and thus enhancing hydroxyl radical production and polymerization rate. The concept of amplified cascade catalysis and the way how a biocatalyst recycles a chemical catalyst to enhance catalysis efficiency may inspire development of sustainable and ecofriendly catalytic methodologies for organic and material synthesis.







Abstract
We report a conceptually new amplified cascade catalysis that converts oxygen to hydroxyl radical for controlled RAFT polymerization. This catalysis consists of two sequential reactions, deoxygenation catalyzed by glucose oxidase and Fenton reaction catalyzed by ferrocene. The two catalysts can communicate with each other, leading to ferrocene recycling and hence amplification in radical generation. Ferrocene recycling was confirmed by UV/Vis spectroscopy, molecular docking simulation, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as polymerization studies. This catalysis was applied to RAFT polymerization of various monomers, yielding well&#8208;defined homopolymers and diblock copolymers with controlled molecular weights and low dispersities. Poly(N,N&#8208;dimethyl acrylamide) with molecular weight over 1 million g&#8201;mol&#8722;1 was also successfully synthesized under ambient conditions. Ferrocene&#8208;functionalized microspheres were prepared and used as recyclable Fenton catalyst for five consecutive polymerizations with minimal declination in monomer conversion, which further improved the ecofriendly character of this polymerization methodology.

         <title>Chiroptical Response of Carbon Nanocages Enhanced by Achiral Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The geometrical reinforcement of chiral carbon cages by supramolecular technique led to enhancement of sensitivity against circularly polarized red light with an improved dissymmetry factor where the achiral guests such as Ar, CO2, and CH3CN are engaged in inhibition of undesired arrangement of transition dipole moments.







Abstract
Opening up [60]fullerene makes itself inherently chiral without loss of congenital &#960;&#8208;conjugation. An immoderately large aperture on [60]fullerene, however, renders the molecule less rigid and therefore it would reduce dissymmetry factors. Herein, we examined supramolecular technique in geometrical reinforcement of chiral open&#8208;[60]fullerenes by encasing achiral guests such as Ar, CO2, and CH3CN. At a lowest&#8208;energy transition, we confirmed a guest&#8208;dependency on chiroptical responses with increasing a dissymmetry factor by nearly twice to three times. It should be noted that the guests play a negligible role in electronic structures of the carbon cages. Instead, they are engaged in preclusion of an orifice shrinking not to reduce chiroptical response.

         <title>Dynamically Stable Cu0Cu&#948;+ Pair Sites Based on In Situ&#8208;Exsolved Cu Nanoclusters on CaCO3 for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We systematically investigated factors influencing Cu&#8722;O reducibility, focusing on electron affinity and anion vacancy formation energy. The Cu/CaCO3 interface was found to generate low&#8208;reducibility Cu0Cu0.13+ sites, achieving an impressive C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 83.7&#8201;%. An in situ reconstruction strategy during CO2RR enabled dynamically stable, highly dispersed Cu nanoclusters on CaCO3 nanospheres.







Abstract
Copper&#8208;based catalysts are the choice for producing multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) during CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), where the Cu0Cu&#948;+ pair sites are proposed to be synergistic hotspots for C&#8722;C coupling. Maintaining their dynamic stability requires precise control over electron affinity and anion vacancy formation energy, posing significant challenges. Here, we present an in situ reconstruction strategy to create dynamically stable Cu0Cu0.18+OCa motifs at the interface of exsolved Cu nanoclusters and CaCO3 nanospheres (Cu/CaCO3). In situ XAFS analysis confirmed the low&#8208;valency state of Cu&#948;+ during CO2RR. DFT calculations demonstrated that the nanocluster size arises from the balance between metal&#8208;support interactions and Cu&#8722;Cu cohesive energy, while the dynamic stability of rich interfacial Cu&#948;+ sites is attributed to their low electron affinity and high CO32&#8722; vacancy formation energy, which collectively contribute to reduced reducibility. The transformed Cu/CaCO3 exhibits an impressive C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 83.7&#8201;% at a partial current density of 393&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, facilitated by adsorption of *CO with varying electronegativity at heterogeneous copper sites that lowers the C&#8722;C coupling energy barrier. Our findings establish insoluble carbonate as an effective anion pairing for Cu0Cu&#948;+ sites, highlighting the effectiveness of the in situ reconstitution strategy in producing a high density of dynamically stable Cu0Cu&#948;+ pair sites.

         <title>Precise Manipulation on the Structural Defects of Poly (Triazine Imide) Single Crystals for Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two compositionally complementary comonomers are employed to synthesize poly (triazine imide) single crystal and to continuously manipulate the nature of structural defect, aiming at obtaining the fully conjugated &#960;&#8208;system with atomic precision. By inhibiting the C&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced exciton radiative loss and N&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced nonradiative loss, a record apparent quantum efficiency of 37.8&#8201;% for photocatalytic overall water splitting is achieved.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers, represented by polymeric carbon nitrides (PCNs), have risen to prominence as new&#8208;generation photocatalysts for overall water splitting (OWS). Despite considerable efforts, achieving highly crystalline PCNs with minimal structural defects remains a great challenge, and it is also difficult to examine the exact impact of complex defect states on OWS process, which largely limits their quantum efficiency. Herein, we devise a &#8216;in&#8208;situ salt flux&#8217; assisted copolymerization protocol by using nitrogen&#8208;rich and nitrogen&#8208;deficient monomers to precisely manipulate the structural defects of poly (triazine imide) (PTI) single crystals. Stoichiometric control between two comonomers enables continuous tunning of carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;vacancies within PTI, allowing the construction of a series of PTI crystals with different defect states. Theoretical and experimental results unveil the carbon vacancies are related with the radiative decay of excitons, while the nonradiative decay is mainly derived from the nitrogen vacancies. Owing to the effective suppression of both radiative and nonradiative losses, the as&#8208;synthesized PTI achieves a record apparent quantum efficiency of 37.8&#8201;% by one&#8208;step&#8208;excitation OWS. This work highlights the significance of rational control of the structural defects and describes clear structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationships in PTI photocatalyst, offering guidance for the development of polymer photocatalysts for solar fuel production.

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Design of Single&#8208;atom Catalysts with Nonplanar and Triple Pyrrole&#8208;N Coordination for Highly Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper designs a series of nonplanar and precise triple&#8208;coordinated SACs (ppy&#8208;MN3) for highly active and selective 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysis and proposes a new descriptor (&#916;&#1013;d&#8208;p). Moreover, constant&#8208;potential kinetics explain a low kinetic barrier under alkaline conditions due to hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between the OOH* intermediate and interfacial water. This study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept and performance&#8208;oriented design of nonplanar catalysts with precise coordination configurations and presents a complement to the d&#8208;band theory for more accurately predicting the catalytic activities for nonplanar materials.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with nonplanar configurations possess unique capabilities for tailoring the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic performance compared with the ones with planar configurations, owing to the additional orbital rearrangement arising from the asymmetric coordination atoms. However, the systematic investigation of these nonplanar SACs has long been hindered by the difficulty in screening feasible nonplanar configurations and precisely controlling the coordination structures. Herein, we demonstrate a combined high&#8208;throughput screening and experimental verification of nonplanar SACs (ppy&#8208;MN3) with metal atoms triple&#8208;coordinated by pyrrole&#8208;N, for highly active and selective 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysis. With the additional p&#8208;orbital rearrangement of N&#8208;ligands for ppy&#8208;MN3 during catalysis, a new descriptor on the energy difference between d&#8208;band center of metal sites and p&#8208;band centers of N&#8208;ligands (&#916;&#1013;d&#8722;p) is proposed to accurately identify the relationship between their catalytic activities and electronic structures, on top of the conventional d&#8208;band center theory. Consequently, ppy&#8208;ZnN3 is identified with excellent 2e&#8722; ORR activity (&#951;=0.08&#8197;eV) and selectivity, as well as a low 2e&#8722; ORR kinetic barrier under alkaline condition owing to a strong hydrogen bonding between OOH* intermediate and interfacial water, which is then experimentally verified by its high electrocatalytic H2O2 yield (43&#8197;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and selectivity (92&#8201;%) under alkaline condition. This study thus presents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the performance&#8208;oriented and precise coordination design of nonplanar SACs for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis, and, more importantly, provides an essential complement to the d&#8208;band theory for more accurately predicting the catalytic activities of catalysts with nonplanar configurations for series potential electrochemical processes.

         <title>Modulating Built&#8208;In Electric Field Strength in Ru/RuO2 Interfaces through Ni Doping to Enhance Hydrogen Conversion at Ampere&#8208;level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We use DFT calculations to identify Ni&#8208;RuO2 as the most promising candidate among 3d transition metal&#8208;doped M&#8208;RuO2 (M=Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn). Ni&#8208;RuO2 is experimentally synthesized confirming that introducing Ni atoms promotes the partial reduction of RuO2 to form a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO2 interface with a strong built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical processes. Consequently, the Ni&#8208;RuO2 catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Ni&#8208;RuO2&#8208;based AEMWE in 1&#8197;M KOH delivers a voltage of only 1.71&#8197;V to reach 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 1000&#8197;h stable operation.







Abstract
Improving the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency is essential for developing advanced anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) that operate at industrial ampere&#8208;level currents. Herein, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify Ni&#8208;RuO2 as the leading candidate among various 3d transition metal&#8208;doped M&#8208;RuO2 (where metal M includes Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). The incorporation of Ni atoms facilitates the partial reduction of RuO2, resulting in the formation of a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO2 interface having a significant built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical reactions. The resulted BIEF enhances electron transfer across the interface, which is critical in lowering energy barriers and accelerating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics. As a result, the Ni&#8208;RuO2 catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 20.85&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, with just 0.03&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of Ru loading. The highly effective BIEF, therefore, plays a pivotal role in the catalyst&#8216;s remarkable performance, allowing the Ni&#8208;RuO2&#8208;based AEMWE to require only 1.71&#8197;V to maintain stable operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over a 1000&#8208;hour period.

&lt;p&gt;We use DFT calculations to identify Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the most promising candidate among 3d transition metal-doped M-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M=Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn). Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is experimentally synthesized confirming that introducing Ni atoms promotes the partial reduction of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface with a strong built-in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical processes. Consequently, the Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based AEMWE in 1&#8197;M KOH delivers a voltage of only 1.71&#8197;V to reach 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with 1000&#8197;h stable operation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency is essential for developing advanced anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) that operate at industrial ampere-level currents. Herein, we employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the leading candidate among various 3d transition metal-doped M-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (where metal M includes Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). The incorporation of Ni atoms facilitates the partial reduction of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in the formation of a Ni&#8722;Ru/RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface having a significant built-in electric field (BIEF) during electrochemical reactions. The resulted BIEF enhances electron transfer across the interface, which is critical in lowering energy barriers and accelerating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics. As a result, the Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 134&#8197;mV at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a low Tafel slope of 20.85&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with just 0.03&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; of Ru loading. The highly effective BIEF, therefore, plays a pivotal role in the catalyst&#8216;s remarkable performance, allowing the Ni-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based AEMWE to require only 1.71&#8197;V to maintain stable operation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over a 1000-hour period.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Ring Assembly Facilitates the Synthesis of a [12]Cycloparaphenylene ABC&#8208;Type [3]Catenane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By threading a secondary ammonium salt through the crown ether and closing the third ring via CuAAC click reaction, we obtained a rare ABC&#8208;type hetero&#8208;[3]catenane comprising [12]CPP, 24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 and a dibenzylammonium macrocycle. X&#8208;ray crystallography shed light on the ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring pre&#8208;organization. Molecular simulations provided insights into the intriguing ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring dynamics of the [3]catenane.







Abstract
Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) represent a significant challenge for the synthesis of mechanically interlocked architectures, because they lack heteroatoms, which precludes traditional active and passive template methods. To circumvent this problem and explore the fundamental and functional properties of CPP rotaxanes and catenanes, researchers have resorted to unusual non&#8208;covalent and even to labor&#8208;intensive covalent template approaches. Herein, we report a ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring non&#8208;covalent template strategy that makes use of the surprisingly strong non&#8208;covalent inclusion of crown ethers into suitably sized CPPs. By threading a secondary ammonium salt through the crown ether and closing the third ring via CuAAC click reaction, we obtained a rare ABC&#8208;type hetero&#8208;[3]catenane comprising [12]CPP, 24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 and a dibenzylammonium macrocycle. X&#8208;ray crystallography shed light on the ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring pre&#8208;organization and the [3]catenane topology was confirmed by NMR and MS&#8208;MS studies. Molecular simulations provided insights into the intriguing ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring&#8208;vs.&#8208;ring dynamics of the [3]catenane, which are highly dependent on the protonation state of the dibenzylammonium site. This ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring assembly strategy opens new avenues for the synthesis of complex CPP architectures and their use in functional supramolecular systems.

         <title>Mass Transfer&#8208;Enhanced Photothermal Membranes with Synergistic Light Utilization for High&#8208;Turbidity Wastewater Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A suspended photothermal Fenton membrane is specifically designed to address the challenges of light attenuation and impurity interference in treating high&#8208;turbidity and colored wastewater. Impressive light utilization and mass transfer allow for continuous operation in a flow reactor for up to 10&#8197;days without any significant decline in actual industrial wastewater.







Abstract
The photo&#8208;Fenton process faces significant limitations in treating high&#8208;turbidity, colored wastewater due to light attenuation and impurity interference (blocked mass transfer). To address these issues, we developed a suspended photothermal Fenton membrane by loading a photothermal catalyst on a hydrophobically modified cotton filter paper, enabling precise suspension 1&#8197;mm below the water surface. This design achieved 89.49&#8201;% light utilization and high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, even in wastewater with extreme chromaticity (10 multiples) and turbidity (703 NTU). The enhanced photothermal conversion accelerated molybdenum co&#8208;catalyzed Fenton reactions and improved peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, maintaining over 90&#8201;% phenol removal for 15&#8197;days. Mechanistic simulations revealed improved mass transfer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pollutants at the solid&#8211;liquid interface, with PMS diffusion identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step. The membrane resisted fouling from suspended solids and maintained stable operation in soil&#8208;containing solutions for 10&#8197;days. This innovative approach offers an efficient solution for degrading pollutants in dark&#8208;colored, high&#8208;turbidity wastewater, overcoming traditional process limitations.

Co&#8208;feeding CO2 for methylfuran aromatization (CCMA) was investigated by Anqing Zheng and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202420779). Compared to the individual conversion of methylfuran, CCMA boosts arene formation, enhances catalyst stability, and enables efficient CO2 reduction simultaneously. Employing SVUV&#8208;PI&#8208;ReTOF&#8208;MS, operando spectroscopic techniques, and isotopic labeling elucidates key reaction pathways, paving the way for the innovative and efficient valorization of biomass in a carbon&#8208;negative manner.

In their Research Article (e202416088), Holger Helten and co&#8208;authors present a strictly alternating BN&#8208;isostere of poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) and well&#8208;defined oligomers. The polymerization was achieved by an AB&#8208;type step&#8208;growth polycondensation of a monomer (illustrated on the top right) featuring one N and one B terminus. The compounds show pronounced fluorescence with hypsochromic shifts with increasing chain length and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties to water (AIEE), solvent polarity and viscosity, temperature, as well as mechanical impact (Cover design: Leonie W&#252;st).

Oligophosphorylated peptides were prepared by Kevin Qian, Bj&#246;rn Hanf, Christopher Cummins, and Dorothea Fiedler in their Research Article (e202419147). Oligophosphorimidazolide reagents are presented that enable the conjugation of multiple phosphates to phosphopeptides, yielding derivatives with monodisperse phosphate chain lengths. The picture illustrates different peptides with varying phosphate chain lengths, bearing either a terminal protecting group or a free oligophosphate moiety.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review offers an introduction on the recent development of the porphyrin&#8208;based COFs with advantageous visible light absorption ability, adjustable optic/electronic properties, definite active center, post&#8208;modification capability, and excellent stability for photo/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction in terms of the synthetic methods, structure optimization, performance enhancement, and catalytic mechanisms.







Abstract
Photo/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction into high&#8208;value products are promising strategies for addressing both environmental problems and energy crisis. Duo to their advantageous visible light absorption ability, adjustable optic/electronic properties, definite active center, post&#8208;modification capability, and excellent stability, porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as attractive photo/electro&#8208;catalysts towards CO2 reduction. In this review, the research progress of the porphyrin&#8208;based COFs for photo/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction is summarized including the design principles, catalytic performance, and reaction mechanism. In addition, this review also presents some challenges and prospects for the application of porphyrin&#8208;based COFs in photo/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction, laying the base for both fundamental research and application efforts.

         <title>Porous Supramolecular Crystalline Materials for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
Porous supramolecular crystalline materials (PSCMs), such as hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), &#960; frameworks, can be defined as a type of porous supramolecular assemblies stabilized by hydrogen&#8208;bonding, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and other non&#8208;covalent interactions. Benefiting from the unique features of mild synthesis conditions, well&#8208;defined and synthetically tailorable structures, easy healing and regeneration, PSCMs have garnered widespread interest in research fields including molecular recognition, sensor, gas storage and separation. Moreover, they have emerged as promising photocatalysts because these PSCMs could be readily endowed with optical function, and the hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking can offer channels for electron transfer to boost the photocatalytic activity. However, the research on PSCMs for photocatalysis is still at an early stage, and a review on this topic would help to promote the development of supramolecular chemistry. In this Minireview, we first introduce the synthesis methods for PSCMs, and then highlight their advantages in photocatalysis. Subsequently, we summarize the applications of PSCMs in photocatalysis including CO2 reduction, H2 evolution, H2O2 production, organic transformation and pollutant degradation, and we put particular emphasis on delineating the structure&#8208;performance relationship. At the end, we discuss the challenges and perspectives in developing high&#8208;performance PSCM&#8208;based photocatalysts.

As an efficient synthetic strategy, radical rearrangement reactions demonstrate significant potential in the construction of complex valuable molecules. This Minireview summarizes the emerging area of asymmetric functionalization involving radical&#8208;mediated functional&#8208;group migration (FGM) reactions, providing extensive discussion of the reported examples and highlighting the potential of this area







Abstract
Along with the renaissance of radical chemistry, the past decade has witnessed rapid development in radical&#8208;mediated rearrangement reactions. A wide diversity of radical approaches harnessing functional&#8208;group migration (FGM) have been devised to enhance both synthetic efficiency and molecular complexity. However, the application of FGM reactions to construct stereogenic centers remains underexplored owing to the inherent challenges of asymmetric radical reactions. In this Minireview, we summarize the emerging area of asymmetric functionalization involving radical&#8208;mediated FGM reactions. Enantioselectivity can be regulated by chiral substrates, auxiliaries or reagents, or achieved through asymmetric transition&#8208;metal catalysis. This synthetic strategy demonstrates its superiority in the production of valuable complex molecules that are otherwise difficult to obtain by conventional methods.

         <title>Revealing the Potential of a Chimaera: a Peptide&#8208;Peptide Nucleic Acid Molecule Designed To Interact with the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can a chimeric molecule mimic RNA and bind an RNA&#8208;binding protein? We designed and synthesized a ligand with a dual nature within the same sequence: a pure peptide component and a peptide nucleic acid one. This chimaera is able to target the construct of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid protein, which comprises the RNA&#8208;binding globular domain and the two flanking disordered regions.







Abstract
Numerous RNA&#8208;binding proteins have modular structures with folded domains and intrinsically disordered regions, making their atomic characterization difficult. This severely limits the investigation of their modalities of interaction as well as the evaluation of possible ways to interfere with this process. We report herein a rational strategy for the design and synthesis of a ligand able to interfere with the protein function, monitoring the interaction through solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our approach employs a chimaera composed of two different fragments, a peptide and a peptide&#8208;nucleic acid, allowing to incorporate in the resulting molecule key features to address RNA&#8208;protein interactions. Focusing on two constructs of the Nucleocapsid protein from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, the globular N&#8208;terminal domain and a more extended one comprising also two flanking intrinsically disordered regions, we demonstrate the enhanced affinity of the designed peptide&#8208;peptide nucleic acid chimaera for the protein compared to a related peptide lacking &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking contributions within the chain. Furthermore, we emphasize the increasingly recognized relevant and synergistic role of the intrinsically disordered regions in protein&#8208;ligand interaction.

         <title>Stereoselective Preparation and Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkenyl Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facile preparation of alkenyl sulfoximines, monoaza analogues of sulfones, by condensation of alkyl sulfoximines with aldehydes and their palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling are reported. These alkenyl electrophiles underwent unique oxidative addition of the C&#8722;S bond to Pd to provide alkenes with three substituents. DFT calculations revealed the crucial role of the boronic acid in the transformation.







Abstract
Although numerous transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of alkenyl electrophiles with a sulfur(VI) leaving group, mainly alkenyl sulfones, have been developed, most rely heavily on highly nucleophilic Grignard reagents, and the use of organoboron reagents remains challenging. We report herein facile preparation and the following Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction of alkenyl sulfoximine, a monoaza analog of sulfone. The condensation of alkyl sulfoximine with aldehydes, developed in this study, makes alkenyl sulfoximines more readily available. The resulting alkenes undergo an unprecedented oxidative addition of the C&#8722;S bond to the Pd center. This cross&#8208;coupling proceeds with retention of its original stereochemistry and provided alkenes bearing three different functionalities in a stereoselective fashion. DFT calculations highlight the critical role of boronic acid and in situ&#8208;generated boroxines in facilitating this transformation.

         <dc:description>
We report herein an unprecedented desymmetrization of 1,4&#8208;diynes via a Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric redox cycloisomerization. This method operates through a novel mechanism involving initiation at the allylic alcohol moiety, and provides efficient access to multi&#8208;functional pyrrolidines and tetrahydrofurans in high to excellent stereoselectivities. Diverse derivatizations of the heterocyclic products including intriguing skeletal rearrangements have also been demonstrated.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Epoxidation of Aldehydes with &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Diazosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective epoxidation reaction between aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl diazosilanes for the synthesis of chiral trifluoromethyl epoxides have been developed, which has overcome racemic background reaction. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. The observed positive nonlinear effect supports ligand acceleration. The gram scale reaction and down&#8208;stream transformation based on the removable silyl group demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction.







Abstract
Catalytic epoxidation of readily available aldehydes with diazo compounds is an atom economical strategy to synthesize epoxides. However, the asymmetric epoxidation reaction of aldehydes and fluorinated diazo compounds is challenging, because of the severe racemic background reaction. Herein, we report the first Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective epoxidation reaction between aldehydes and &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl diazosilanes for the synthesis of chiral trifluoromethyl epoxides. This reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. The observed positive nonlinear effect supports the ligand acceleration and the achievement of high enantioselectivity with a chiral ligand possessing lower enantiopurity. The gram scale reaction and down&#8208;stream transformation based on the removable silyl group demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction.

         <title>Contrasting Mechanochromic Luminescence of Enantiopure and Racemic Pyrenylprolinamides: Elucidating Solid&#8208;State Excimer Orientation by Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrasting mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) has been observed for enantiopure and racemic crystals of pyrenylprolinamides with different substituents. Enantiopure crystals exhibited circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and mechanochromic CPL was achieved due to the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded excimers in the amorphous state. For the first time, the amorphous&#8208;state CPL was elucidated based on the excimer chirality rule.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) have independently made substantial progress in recent years. However, the exploration of MCL in solid&#8208;state CPL materials, which holds practical significance, is still in its infancy. Herein, we report the MCL properties of readily accessible chiral pyrenylprolinamides bearing tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl (Boc) or 2,2,2&#8208;trichloroethoxycarbonyl (Troc) groups. Enantiopure crystals of the Boc derivative display a greater MCL wavelength shift than racemic crystals, while the Troc derivative exhibit the opposite trend. Most notably, the enantiopure crystals show mechanochromic CPL. Unlike in previous examples, where CPL is quenched upon amorphization, robust CPL spectra were observed even in the amorphous states. By applying the excimer chirality rule, we have, for the first time, acquired insights into the excited&#8208;state structures within mechanically generated amorphous states. These findings offer a novel design strategy for developing mechanochromic CPL materials, paving the way for the future advancements in this emerging field.

         <title>High Pressure Synthesis of Pr2O5 &#8211; A Unique Lanthanoid(IV) Oxide Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of PrO2 and oxygen at 27&#8197;GPa in a diamond anvil cell afforded the unique oxide peroxide Pr2(O2)O3 in which praseodymium is found in its rare oxidation state of +IV. Pr2(O2)O3 constitutes the most oxygen rich binary phase of any lanthanoid and oxygen. It could be characterised by X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction analysis at various pressure points, Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Reacting praseodymium(IV) oxide with oxygen at 27&#8197;GPa in a diamond anvil cell yielded the oxide peroxide Pr2IV(O2)O3, which was characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction on multi&#8208;grain samples, Raman spectroscopy and quantum theoretical calculations at various pressure points. The presence of tetravalent praseodymium ions is supported by electronic structure calculations, showing a band gap of ca. 1.2&#8197;eV, which is consistent with the anticipated chemical model of an ionic solid. Pr2(O2)O3 thus far represents the most oxygen rich phase of any binary compound of a lanthanoid and oxygen and is the first example of a peroxide anion next to Pr4+. Additionally, these results demonstrate that instead of oxidizing the praseodymium ions past their +IV oxidation state, oxygen undergoes a comproportionation to form peroxide anions. Direct oxidation of the oxide anions by Pr4+&#8208;ions was ruled out by a control experiment in argon instead of oxygen, where no oxidation of oxide ions was observed.

         <dc:description>
We have developed a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed lactonization reaction to activate non&#8208;polar C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds in cyclobutene and cyclopropane carboxylic acids. Using a dual ligand approach with pyridone&#8208;phosphine significantly boosts catalyst reactivity, creating a robust catalyst for unsaturated lactonization. This method shows excellent functional group tolerance and offers a straightforward, adaptable synthesis pathway for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;lactones. Computational studies provided mechanistic insights, identifying the TDI and TDTS, and revealing the role of dual ligands in facilitating the reaction.







Abstract
The activation of non&#8208;polar aliphatic C&#8722;C bonds represents a significant challenge that remains to be addressed in the field of Pd(II) catalysis. In this study, we present a dual ligand approach as a means of addressing this issue. The process entails lactonization of cyclobutane and cyclopropane carboxylic acid via the activation of non&#8208;polar C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond despite the high feasibility of both &#959;rtho&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H and &#946; or &#947; &#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H activation. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed to reveal the mechanistic insights and elucidate the role of dual ligands in facilitating this challenging transformation.

         <title>meta&#8208;Hydroxylation of Pyridines, Quinolines, and Isoquinolines Using Dearomatized Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenging C3&#8208;hydroxylation of valuable aza&#8208;arene cores is presented. Nucleophilic dearomatized intermediates react with electrophilic peracids and peroxides in a highly regioselective manner. This protocol is distinguished by its broad scope, exceptional regioselectivity, scalability, and potential for late&#8208;stage diversification.







Abstract
The functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds in heterocycles holds considerable importance in chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recently, the regioselective introduction of various functionalities at the meta&#8208;position of azines, utilizing readily accessible dearomatized intermediates, has emerged as a highly attractive approach. Along these lines, the meta&#8208;hydroxylation of azines is an appealing but challenging transformation due to the inherent electronic nature of these heterocycles. Herein, we report a meta&#8208;selective hydroxylation of pyridines, quinolines and isoquinolines through easily accessible oxazinoaza&#8208;arene intermediates. The nucleophilic C3&#8208;position of these dienamine&#8208;type intermediates engages in highly regioselective hydroxylation upon treatment with electrophilic peroxides.

&lt;p&gt;The challenging C3-hydroxylation of valuable aza-arene cores is presented. Nucleophilic dearomatized intermediates react with electrophilic peracids and peroxides in a highly regioselective manner. This protocol is distinguished by its broad scope, exceptional regioselectivity, scalability, and potential for late-stage diversification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds in heterocycles holds considerable importance in chemical synthesis and drug discovery. Recently, the regioselective introduction of various functionalities at the &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-position of azines, utilizing readily accessible dearomatized intermediates, has emerged as a highly attractive approach. Along these lines, the &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxylation of azines is an appealing but challenging transformation due to the inherent electronic nature of these heterocycles. Herein, we report a &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-selective hydroxylation of pyridines, quinolines and isoquinolines through easily accessible oxazinoaza-arene intermediates. The nucleophilic C3-position of these dienamine-type intermediates engages in highly regioselective hydroxylation upon treatment with electrophilic peroxides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroglycosylation of Alkynes for the Synthesis of Vinyl &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;Glycosides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroglycosylation of terminal alkynes was developed with bench&#8208;stable ortho&#8208;iodobiphenyl substituted sulfides as glycosyl donors. This reaction, which proceeds by the intermediacy of glycosyl radicals, affords E&#8208;configured vinyl &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides with high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity and can be applied to the derivatization of bioactive compounds and the preparation of naturally occurring compounds.







Abstract
Herein we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroglycosylation of terminal alkynes, employing bench&#8208;stable ortho&#8208;iodobiphenyl (oIB) substituted sulfides as glycosyl donors. This reaction occurs with high stereo&#8208; and regioselectivity to afford E&#8208;configured vinyl &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides, a class of compounds nontrivial to access by previous methods. The use of a bis(oxazoline) ligand with bulky side chains is critical for the high selectivities observed. Aryl iodides have not been used previously as surrogates for alkyl (glycosyl) electrophiles in Co&#8722;H catalyzed reactions. The transformation features mild reaction conditions, simple reagents, and broad substrate scope. This method can be applied to the derivatization of bioactive compounds and the preparation of naturally occurring products. Mechanistic studies suggest this stereoconvergent process involves glycosyl radicals as key reaction intermediates.

         <title>Fluoro&#8208;Fucosylation Enables the Interrogation of the Lea&#8208;LecB Interaction by BioNMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis antigen Lea is a selective ligand for Lectin B in P. aeruginosa. Interrogating a key hydrogen bond in this complex has important ramifications for antibiotic research. Through the development of stereoselective fluoro&#8208;fucosylation, it has been possible to design F&#8208;Lea as a structural biology tool. BioNMR analyses with both the native (Lea) and fluorinated (F&#8208;Lea) glycans have unequivocally established the importance of this interaction in the Lea&#8208;LecB complex.







Abstract
Fucosylation patterns in cell&#8208;surface glycans are essential mediators of recognition and signalling. Aberrations in these signatures serve as vital diagnostic markers of disease progression, and so understanding fucose&#8208;protein interactions at the molecular level is crucial. Molecular editing of l&#8208;fucose (Fuc) at C2 with fluorine provides a platform to reconcile the ubiquity of fucosylation with the paucity of strategies to interrogate site&#8208;specific interactions. Through judicious introduction of a pseudo&#8208;equatorial fluorine [C(sp3)&#8208;F] adjacent to the anomeric position, &#946;&#8208;selective fucosylation can be achieved with a range of diverse acceptors (&gt;50&#8201;:&#8201;1): the selectivity of this process can be inverted through changes in the donor scaffold. Reaction development was driven by the desire to construct a fluorinated analogue of Lewis antigen a (F&#8208;Lea), in which fluorine replaces a key OH group at C2. Lea is a ligand for Lectin B (LecB) in the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and thus delineating the importance of key interactions in this complex has ramifications for drug discovery. Independent syntheses of Lea and F&#8208;Lea, and systematic bioNMR analyses with both glycans has unequivocally established the essential role of O2 of fucose in the Lea&#8208;LecB complex.

         <title>Zeolite Blending: A New Approach to Direct Crystallization of Aluminosilicate Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The blending of two types of zeolites, MFI and Beta, as raw material in the interzeolite conversion/transformation method resulted in the collection of the required composite building&#8208;units of the CON&#8208;type topology, leading to the direct crystallization of the CON&#8208;type aluminosilicate with high Al content (Si/Al=20).







Abstract
Various synthesis methods for zeolites have been developed to date; however, precise control over aluminum (Al) content remains a significant challenge. For instance, in the case of CON&#8208;type zeolites, it is especially difficult to obtain a Si/Al ratio below a value of approximately 100 by direct synthesis, and below approximately 30 by post&#8208;treatment. In this study, we have developed a novel direct synthesis method of the CON&#8208;type zeolite having desired Al content by applying the interzeolite conversion/interzeolite transformation, wherein precursor zeolites that possess common composite building units (CBUs) with the target zeolite are employed as the Al and Si source. Initially, a single zeolite was utilized as a precursor, resulting in the successful synthesis of a high Al CON&#8208;type zeolite (Si/Al=40). Finally, we developed a novel synthesis method of the CON&#8208;type zeolite; blending of two types of zeolites, MFI and Beta, as starting material in the IZC method led to the direct crystallization of the CON&#8208;type aluminosilicate with high Al content (Si/Al=20).

         <title>Putting Charge Transfer Degree as a Bridge Connecting Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy revealed that ZnO with various amounts of copper doping exhibit very high consistency in the photocatalytic activity and the &#961;CT for surface&#8208;absorbed reactant molecules. This study firstly demonstrated the effectiveness of SERS spectroscopy based on the CT enhancement mechanism in predicting the interfacial CT process in semiconductor photocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling model reactions.







Abstract
To date, few systematic approach has been established for predicting catalytic performance by analyzing the spectral information of molecules adsorbed on photocatalyst surfaces. Effective charge transfer (CT) between the semiconductor photocatalysts and surface&#8208;absorbed molecules is essential for enhancing catalytic activity and optimizing light energy utilization. This study aimed to validate the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based on the CT enhancement mechanism in investigating the CT process during semiconductor photocatalytic C&#8722;C coupling model reactions. A copper ion doping strategy was employed to simultaneously enhance the SERS effect and catalytic activity of zinc oxide (ZnO) derived from metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). By analyzing molecular fingerprint SERS spectra, we calculated the degree of CT (&#961;CT), revealing that SERS enhancement is attributed to the CT mechanism. In situ SERS spectra confirmed a high correlation between the catalytic activity and &#961;CT of ZnO with varying copper ion doping levels. A range of photoelectric and spectroscopic tests validated the effectiveness of SERS in linking CT to photocatalytic performance, consistent with first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) simulations. This finding is also validated in other semiconductor materials and catalytic reactions, demonstrating the broad applicability of &#961;CT for predicting and evaluating SERS and catalytic activity.

         <title>Helical Quintulene: Synthesis, Chirality, and Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helical, bowl&#8208;shaped extended quintulene (1) was synthesized by incomplete dehydrocyclization, revealing quintuple [5]helicenes fused at the rim. Chiroptical studies on 1 demonstrated strong dissymmetry in both the absorption and luminescence. The bowl shape of 1 enables supramolecular assembly between 1 and fullerene. These findings expand the structural diversity of quintulene and represent the first example of a cycloarene fused with helicenes.







Abstract
Quintulene is a quintuply symmetrical cycloarene with a positively curved molecular geometry. First described by Staab and Sauer in 1984, its successful synthesis was not achieved until 2020. Due to the challenges posed by its positive curvature, structural extensions of quintulene have been studied rarely. In this work, we report the synthesis of a chiral quintulene (1) featuring five [5]helicene units at its rim constructed through the introduction of steric hindrance. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis confirmed the structure of 1 that showcases a unique chirality combining helicity and rotational symmetry. The enantiomers of 1 were separated and their chiroptical properties were examined, revealing the dissymmetric absorption and luminescence. Additionally, the bowl shape facilitates supramolecular assembly between 1 and fullerenes, with a binding constant to C60 10&#8208;fold higher than to C70. This work expands the structural diversity of quintulene and bridges the structures of cycloarenes and multi&#8208;helicenes, paving the way for the structural design of chiral cycloarenes.

         <title>Manipulating the dynamics of chiral molecular bearings through subtle structural changes of guest molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isotropic rotation of a diamondoid molecule within a cylinder array was hindered by subtle structural changes introduced through a fluorine substituent. This bias in rotation induced precession with its direction controlled by an external electric field.







Abstract
By introducing fluorine substituents, anisotropic rotational motion was induced in diamondoid guests trapped in cylindrical hosts arranged in a 2D honeycomb crystal. Despite the subtle structural changes, the substituent hindered flipping motions in the host and biased its rotations toward tilted precession. The fluorine substituent facilitated the dielectric response of the crystal, as revealed through dielectric constant measurements, which provided insight into the detailed dynamics of the anisotropic rotations. The up&#8208;down flipping motion of the guest within the 2D crystal was constrained by an energy barrier but remained manipulable under an external electric field. Consequently, the angular momentum of the spinning guest, with its C&#8722;F pole, was forced to align with the applied electric field.

         <title>Enhanced Azo Dye Removal through Sequential Ultrasound&#8208;Assisted&#8208;Treatment and Photocatalysis Using CdZnS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>

A novel sequential adsorption&#8208;photocatalytic system for the efficient degradation of complex dye mixtures in concentrated wastewater, showcasing enhanced removal kinetics and superior pollutant&#8208;catalyst interaction.







Abstract
The treatment of high&#8208;concentration azo dyes remains challenging due to the inherent limitations of conventional single&#8208;mode approaches. Here, we propose an integrated strategy that sequentially combines ultrasound&#8208;assisted adsorption with photocatalysis using CdZnS solid solutions to efficiently and rapidly remove high&#8208;concentration azo dyes. CdZnS exhibits high adsorption capacity and exceptional photocatalytic activity, enabling initial dye capture and enrichment, followed by significantly enhanced photocatalytic degradation. The adsorption of Congo Red (CR) on CdZnS solid solutions follows the Freundlich and pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order models, demonstrating a multilayer adsorption behavior involving physical and chemical interactions. Ultrasound assistance during the first stage not only significantly reduces equilibrium time, but also results in enhanced negative charges in CdZnS that extend to the subsequent photocatalysis stage. This charge enhancement substantially improves CR photodegradation performance, establishing synergistic interactions between ultrasonic treatment and photodegradation. The system demonstrates excellent performance in treating both concentrated single dyes and complex dye mixtures, maintaining high efficiency over multiple treatment cycles. This integrated approach provides new insights for developing more effective technologies for dye degradation and practical wastewater treatment applications.

         <title>Semirational Protein Engineering of a Decarboxylative Aldolase for the Regiodivergent and Stereodivergent Synthesis of Cyclic Imino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 11, March 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The decarboxylative aldolase UstD was semirationally engineered through a focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy. The obtained mutant showed complementary regioselectivity and stereoselectivity to the wild&#8208;type UstD, which enabled the divergent synthesis of cyclic imino acids in excellent yields and selectivity.







Abstract
Aldolases are powerful C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming enzymes for asymmetric organic synthesis because of their supreme stereoselectivity, compatibility with diverse electrophiles and nucleophiles, and promising scalability. Stereodivergent engineering of aldolases to tune the selectivity for the synthesis of stereoisomers of chiral molecules is highly desirable but has rarely been reported. Herein we report the semirational engineering of the decarboxylative aldolase UstD with a focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy to perform a C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reaction with dione electrophiles. The variant obtained from a small mutant library showed divergent regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity compared to the wild&#8208;type enzyme, resulting in the production of 30 cyclic imino acids with stereocenters at the &#945; and &#947; positions. Molecular dynamics simulation and kinetic data revealed the basis of selectivity.

         <title>Whole&#8208;Cell Lysosome SMLM Imaging as Indicators for Functional Diagnostics with a Low&#8208;Phototoxic Spontaneously Blinking Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NIR spontaneously blinking fluorophore, Aze&#8208;HMSiR, optimized for long&#8208;term SMLM imaging of lysosomes is developed. It exhibits superior photostability, pH responsiveness, and minimal phototoxicity. Aze&#8208;HMSiR can reveal key lysosomal characteristics, including distribution, size, and lumen pH, in response to various anticancer agents. Such whole&#8208;cell lysosome SMLM imaging serves as a valuable indicator for lysosomal functional diagnostics.








Abstract
Lysosomal morphology and pH dynamics are key indicators of lysosomal function, making long&#8208;term single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) imaging a promising tool for functional diagnostics. However, phototoxicity often compromises imaging reliability. Here, we develop Aze&#8208;HMSiR, a spontaneously blinking silicon rhodamine probe with near&#8208;infrared excitation, enabling low&#8208;phototoxicity, long&#8208;term (50 min) SMLM imaging of lysosomal morphology and pH dynamics. This probe provides super&#8208;resolution insights into lysosomal distribution, size, and lumen pH, essential for understanding their physiological and pathological roles. Using Aze&#8208;HMSiR, we investigate lysosomal function under acidosis, starvation, and anticancer drug treatments. Among seven tested drugs, periplocoside significantly reduced lysosomal size, while paclitaxel increased pH and altered lysosomal distribution. These findings highlight Aze&#8208;HMSiR as a powerful tool for lysosomal functional diagnostics and drug screening, offering a robust platform for studying lysosomal dynamics in response to physiological and pharmacological perturbations, particularly in cancer therapy.

         <title>Full Recovery of Epoxy Resin Wastes into Bisphenol A and Epoxy Monomers via Lewis Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient recycling strategy is developed, where a commercially available boron catalyst is used to selectively break C(sp3)&#9472;O bond in epoxy resins to recover bisphenol A, and the other part of epoxy resin is recovered as epoxy monomers by the reconstruction of C(sp3)&#9472;N bond and hydroxyl cyclization, realizing the high&#8208;value and full recovery of epoxy resins.








Abstract
Epoxy resins (EPs) are important thermosetting plastics and difficult to recycle because of their stable cross&#8208;linked structure. In this study, we report a full recovery strategy for the conversion of EPs into high&#8208;value platform compounds, i.e., bisphenol A (BPA) and epoxy monomers such as 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenebis (N,N&#8242;&#8208;diglycidylaniline) (AG80), which involves the selective breaking of the C(sp3)&#9472;O bond using commercially available boron trichloride (BCl3), the reconstruction of the broken C(sp3)&#9472;N bond and the cyclization of the hydroxy groups. The yield of BPA is 93 wt% with a purity of 99%, and the yield of AG80 is 96 wt% with an epoxy value of 0.43. 100% recovery of EP elements was achieved theoretically, and the actual mass recovery of the EPs is as high as 91%. Because of its versatility, simplicity of operation, mild reaction conditions, and recyclability of all solvents and by&#8208;products, this approach shows the potential in solving the current recycling challenges associated with EP waste.

         <title>Iron Single&#8208;Atom Based Double&#8208;Reaction&#8208;Center Catalysis Triggers Internal&#8208;Driven and External&#8208;Driven Pathways for Green Fenton&#8208;Like Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
Iron single atoms in double&#8208;reaction&#8208;centers (DRCs)&#8208;based catalysts substituted the oxidants and dissolved oxygen as the predominate electron acceptors to extract the electrons from the electron&#8208;donating pollutants with iron valence decreasing from +2.37 to +2.07, and they could also be recovered under O2 atmosphere.








Abstract
Double&#8208;reaction&#8208;centers (DRCs) Fenton&#8208;like chemistry with low or zero oxidant addition has garnered increasing attentions due to their alignment with the principles of green and sustainable development. However, the regulation of such processes remains a significant challenge, primarily due to deficiencies in the microscopic interpretation of their electron migration mechanisms operating with low or zero oxidant addition. In this work, iron single&#8208;atom DRCs catalyst (Fe/N&#8208;SAC) was prepared for internal&#8208;driven system (zero oxidant addition) and external&#8208;driven system (low peroxymonosulfate [PMS] addition). Results indicated the absence of dissolved oxygen activation in the PMS&#8208;zreo Fe/N&#8208;SAC system, and the iron single atoms in the Fe/N&#8208;SAC acted as the predominate electron acceptors to extract the electrons from the electron&#8208;donating pollutants with iron valence decreasing from +2.37 to +2.07 and they could also be recovered under O2 atmosphere. In contrast, the electrons from the pollutants could be transferred to both PMS and iron atoms in the external&#8208;driven Fe/N&#8208;SAC/PMS system involving both predominant electron transfer process (ETP) and iron internal&#8208;driven. Furthermore, two experimental devices based on core mechanisms of internal&#8208;driven and external&#8208;driven systems were designed to achieve long&#8208;term operation. These studies will complement the core catalytic mechanisms and module applications of internal&#8208;driven and external&#8208;driven DRCs systems.

         <title>&#8220;Pulsed&#8221; Chain Transfer Anionic Polymerization: A Green and Cost&#8208;Effective Approach for Controlled Polymer Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy significantly enhances catalyst atom economy in living polymerization by introducing intermittent, switchable chain&#8208;transfer reactions. The temperature&#8208;sensitive catalytic system allows multiple regenerations of the initiator without using expensive organometallic compounds such as ZnEt2 or MgBu2. This green and cost&#8208;effective approach achieves up to 1500% initiator efficiency and enables the synthesis of polybutadiene and styrene&#8208;butadiene copolymers with narrow molecular weight distribution, providing a sustainable alternative for producing well&#8208;defined, low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers. 








Abstract
Herein, we report a method that significantly enhances the atom economy of catalysts in living polymerization. By introducing intermittent, switchable chain&#8208;transfer reactions during the polymerization process, multiple regenerations of the catalyst are achieved while preserving the &#8220;living&#8221;/controlled characteristics. The specially designed catalytic system, composed of 1,2&#8208;dipyrrolidinoethane/n&#8208;butyllithium/n&#8208;butylpotassium/toluene, exhibits a chain&#8208;transfer rate that is highly sensitive to temperature. It enables living polymerization at low temperatures, while at high temperatures, rapid chain transfer to toluene occurs. Utilizing this characteristic, polymerization is initially carried out at low temperatures; once the monomer is consumed, increasing the temperature promotes chain transfer, resulting in initiator regeneration. The regenerated initiator can then initiate new cycles of living polymerization upon the addition of fresh monomers. This process was repeated for more than a dozen cycles, achieving an initiator efficiency of up to 1500%. Using this method, we successfully synthesized polybutadiene and styrene&#8208;butadiene copolymer with an extremely narrow molecular weight distribution (&#272; = 1.1). The mechanism was investigated by in situ NMR spectroscopy, MALDI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS, and DFT calculations. This approach is particularly well&#8208;suited for the controllable, green, and cost&#8208;effective production of low&#8208; to medium&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers and block copolymers.

         <title>Highly Ordered Polymorphism of Small Molecule Acceptor Delivering Efficient and Stable Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach employing 4&#8208;bromochlorobenzene as a volatile solid additive enables the formation of highly ordered BTP&#8208;eC9 polymorphic crystals at low annealing temperatures. This enhances PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 active layer morphology, achieving a PCE of 20.32% with antireflection layers and exceptional device stability, advancing scalable strategies for high&#8208;performance OSCs.








Abstract
Advancements in narrow bandgap organic small molecule acceptors (SMAs) has promoted organic solar cell (OSC) efficiencies beyond 20%. Achieving this milestone necessitates precise control over the active layer morphology, particularly its crystallinity and phase distribution, to optimize light absorption, charge transport, and suppress charge recombination. However, controlling SMA morphology remains a significant challenge due to their strong aggregation tendency. Existing methods, including high&#8208;temperature annealing, and introducing high boiling point additives, frequently yield disordered polymorphs with limited scalability. Here, we report a novel approach of utilizing 4&#8208;bromochlorobenzene as a volatile solid additive to induce the formation of a highly ordered polymorph of BTP&#8208;eC9 through mild annealing at 60 &#176;C. This marks the first demonstration of such an ordered SMA polymorph, exhibiting optical properties comparable to ideal crystals, including enhanced anisotropy, refractive index, and extinction coefficients. The specific polymorph further enables the formation of a well&#8208;organized PM6 donor arrangement, establishing an optimal bicontinuous network morphology. Consequently, the OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 achieve a power conversion efficiency of 19.53%, which further increases to 20.32% with the addition of an antireflection layer. This work provides a scalable and effective strategy for enhancing OSC performance and highlights the critical role of polymorphism in optimizing photovoltaic performance.

         <title>Enabling Unconventional &#8220;Alternating&#8208;Distal&#8221; N2 Reduction Pathway for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional &#8220;alternating&#8208;distal&#8221; hybrid pathway is achieved by shifting the &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH2NH2&#8221; to &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH + NH3&#8221; step with an amorphous CeMnOx electrocatalyst. In this unconventional process, N2 activation is realized through &#960; back donation on Mn site, while the Mn/Ce dual active sites can regulate the intermediate configurations to avoid the by&#8208;product formation for boosting NH3 synthesis.








Abstract
The general understanding on the reaction path is that the electrocatalytic&#160;N2 reduction follows either individual associative alternating or distal pathways, where efficient N2 activation and selective NH3 production are very challenging. Herein, an unconventional &#8220;alternating&#8208;distal&#8221; pathway was achieved by shifting the &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH2NH2&#8221; to &#8220;*NHNH2&#8594;*NH&#160;+&#160;NH3&#8221; step to boost NH3 synthesis with an amorphous CeMnOx electrocatalyst. In this unconventional process, N2 activation was realized through &#960; back donation on the Mn site, while the Mn/Ce dual active sites could regulate the intermediate configurations to avoid the nitrogen&#8208;containing by&#8208;product formation.

     alt="Enabling Unconventional &#8220;Alternating-Distal&#8221; N2 Reduction Pathway for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unconventional &#8220;alternating-distal&#8221; hybrid pathway is achieved by shifting the &#8220;*NHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;*NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; to &#8220;*NHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;*NH + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; step with an amorphous CeMnO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; electrocatalyst. In this unconventional process, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation is realized through &#960; back donation on Mn site, while the Mn/Ce dual active sites can regulate the intermediate configurations to avoid the by-product formation for boosting NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general understanding on the reaction path is that the electrocatalytic&#160;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction follows either individual associative alternating or distal pathways, where efficient N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and selective NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production are very challenging. Herein, an unconventional &#8220;alternating-distal&#8221; pathway was achieved by shifting the &#8220;*NHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;*NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; to &#8220;*NHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;*NH&#160;+&#160;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; step to boost NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis with an amorphous CeMnO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; electrocatalyst. In this unconventional process, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation was realized through &#960; back donation on the Mn site, while the Mn/Ce dual active sites could regulate the intermediate configurations to avoid the nitrogen-containing by-product formation. Such &#8220;alternating-distal&#8221; pathway was affirmed by in situ spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations. In a neutral media, an average ammonia production rate of 82.8&#160;&#181;g h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an outstanding Faradaic efficiency of 37.3% were attained. This work validated an unconventional mechanism in electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis, which might be extended to other catalytic process with multiple possible reaction paths.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Using Colour to Control Conformation in a Chemical System Containing Multiple Tricyanofuran Photoacids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colour vision relies on selective, reversible isomerisation by visible light of a mixture of retinyl chromophores in photoreceptor cells. Synthetic molecular mimics of this wavelength&#8208;dependent induction of function are rare, despite the attractiveness of controlling chemical processes solely by the wavelength of incident light. Here, we report a colour&#8208;responsive chemical system composed of a cationic receptor complex, two competing chiral anionic ligands and two metastable photoacids with contrasting absorption properties. Tricyanofuran photoacids were synthesised with absorption maxima of varying wavelengths across the whole visible spectrum. Protons released by the photoacids upon selective&#160;irradiation reversibly mask the more basic receptor&#8208;bound ligand, leading to ligand exchange that can be observed as a shift in the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the reporter complex. A ~90 nm separation between the absorbance maxima of the photoacids allowed each to be selectively photoisomerised in the presence of the other. The concentration of released protons, and hence the magnitude of the shift in CD response, were controlled by changing the wavelength of the incident visible light. Different output behaviours (OR/AND logic gates and wavelength detection) were programmed into the system by varying the relative proportions of the photoacids.</dc:description>

         <title>Leaflet&#8208;specific Structure and Dynamics of Solid and Polymer Supported Lipid Bilayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer&#8208;supported or tethered lipid bilayers serve as versatile platforms for mimicking plasma membrane structure and dynamics, yet the impact of polymer supports on lipid bilayers remains largely unresolved. In this study, we introduce a novel methodology that combines graphene&#8208;induced energy transfer (GIET) with line&#8208;scan fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy (lsFLCS) to examine the structural and dynamic properties of lipid bilayers. Our findings reveal that polymer supports markedly influence both the structural parameters, such as the membrane height from the substrate, its thickness, as well as dynamic properties, including leaflet&#8208;specific diffusion coefficients and interleaflet coupling. These findings highlight the complex interplay between a polymer support and the lipid bilayers. By resolving leaflet&#8208;specific diffusion and heights of the two leaflets from the substrate, this study emphasizes the potential of GIET&#8208;lsFLCS for probing membrane dynamics and structure. These insights significantly advance the understanding and application of polymer&#8208;supported membranes across diverse research contexts.</dc:description>

         <title>Conditional Activation of Protein Therapeutics by Templated Removal of Peptide Nucleic Acid Masking Groups</title>

         <dc:description>Interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2)&#8208;based therapeutics are emerging as treatments for immunotherapy; however, systemic activation of immune cells hampers their success. Chemically controlling the activity of potent cytokines could mitigate unwanted T cell stimulation and widen their therapeutic window. In this study, we developed a strategy for the conditional activation of proteins utilizing removable peptide nucleic acid (PNA) masking groups. Site&#8208;specific installation of &#8220;Lock&#8221;&#8208;PNAs containing a cleavage thioester linkage enabled steric blockage of receptor binding sites. Rapid unmasking and activation were performed by the addition of a complementary &#8220;Key&#8221;&#8208;PNA containing a cysteine (Cys) residue, which forms a PNA&#8208;PNA duplex leading to a proximity&#8208;accelerated cleavage step and release of the active protein. We exemplified the versatility of this methodology on de novo cytokine neoleukin&#8208;2/15 (Neo&#8208;2/15) through the preparation of PNA conjugates including homo&#8208;dimers, PNA&#8208;stapled conjugates and dual PNA&#8208;bridged dimers. All constructs were effectively unmasked at low micromolar concentrations. Further, we demonstrated the conditional activation of a masked conjugate of Neo&#8208;2/15 in binding studies to the IL&#8208;2 receptors and in an ex vivo T cell signaling assay displaying a 480&#8208;fold potency increase upon activation.

         <title>Fluorescence of Helical Molecular Springs under High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the unique structure of helicenes resembles molecular springs, the effects of their extension&#8211;contraction cycles on their properties have rarely been explored. Here, we investigated the fluorescence of two &#960;&#8208;extended [n]helicenes with different helical lengths n, named [7] and [9], under high pressures in a diamond anvil cell. The experimental results showed that compound [9], with a longer helical length, exhibited a more sensitive fluorescence response than [7] in both crystalline and solvated states upon compression. Theoretical calculations reveal that &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlapping at their helices in these molecular springs provides an additional contribution to their fluorescence properties under compression when the overlap becomes sufficiently strong. Our results provide insights into structure&#8208;property relationships of helical molecules under high&#8208;pressure conditions and verify the potential of helicenes as molecular springs for future applications in molecular machines.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding and Tuning Singlet&#8208;Triplet (S1/T1) Energy Gaps in Planar Organic Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules with large gaps between their first singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST) are key components of various modern technologies, most prominently singlet fission photovoltaics and triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion. The design of these molecules is hampered by the fact that only limited rules for maximizing &#916;EST exist, other than increasing the overlap between the frontier molecular orbitals (FMO). Here we suggest a new strategy for tuning and maximizing &#916;EST based on a detailed analysis of the underlying quantum mechanical energy terms. We present a model based on the transition density and derive three straightforward design rules: &#916;EST values can be maximized by (i) minimizing the overall number of &#960;&#8208;electrons, (ii) reducing delocalization, and (iii) optimizing specific geometric interactions. The validity of these rules is first exemplified for a set of 18 hydrocarbon backbones before proceeding to a varied set of dye molecules highlighting their transferability to realistic settings. We believe that the developed rules will provide an enormous boost to the field enabling rational design instead of trial&#8208;and&#8208;error screening. More generally, this work demonstrates the power of going beyond the FMO approximation in designing advanced molecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Key Fragment in Carbon Schwarzite Unit Cells and Its Triple [6]Helicene Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores two structurally related &#960;&#8208;skeletons. The &#960;&#8208;skeleton of compounds 1a&#8211;e containing three heptagons represents a key fragment in theoretical carbon schwarzites, while that of 2a&#8211;b is a triple [6]helicene. Compounds 1a&#8211;e were synthesized via Scholl reactions, and using a weaker acid allowed the reaction to stop at an intermediate stage, yielding 2a&#8211;b. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed not only distinct stereochemistry of 1b and 2a but also unique supramolecular assemblies in the clathrate of 2a with chloroform. Compound 1b adopts a saddle&#8208;like geometry, while 2a exhibits a propeller&#8208;like structure with C3 symmetry, consistent with DFT calculations. The &#960;&#8208;skeleton of 1a&#8211;e is flexible, enabling rapid enantiomerization, whereas that of 2a&#8211;b is rigid, allowing resolution of 2b into optically pure forms with an absorption dissymmetry factor as high as 0.015. Comparative analysis shows that introducing seven&#8208;membered rings in 1a&#8211;e does not significantly alter the local aromaticity of the triple [6]helicene framework.</dc:description>

         <title>A Phenazine&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework for Photochemical CO2 Reduction with Increased Selectivity for Two&#8208;Carbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable products will contribute to sustainable carbon use. Here we report the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide, formate, and oxalate ions using a redox&#8208;active phenazine&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (Phen&#8208;COF) and its phenazine monomer. Under similar irradiation conditions, Phen&#8208;COF produced 2.9 times more CO, 11 times more formate and 13 times more oxalate compared to equimolar amounts of the monomeric phenazine, demonstrating that the COF architecture enhances catalytic performance (TOFCOF: 10&#8208;7 s&#8208;1 CO, 10&#8208;8 s&#8208;1 formate, 10&#8208;11 s&#8208;1 oxalate). Structural analysis, including X&#8208;ray diffraction and N2 porosimetry, confirmed the COF&#8217;s long&#8208;range order and porosity. Mechanistic studies suggest a sequential formate&#8208;to&#8208;oxalate pathway, with CO and formate acting as intermediates. These results demonstrate the potential of the COF architecture to improve the performance of metal&#8208;free, redox&#8208;active aromatic systems such as phenazines to facilitate efficient and selective CO2 conversion under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Glycolipid Library Reminiscent of Mycobacterial Cell Wall Motif A and Its Significance by Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) is distinguished by its unique glycolipid composition, notably mycolyl arabinogalactan, that features Araf, Galf, and mycolic acid. The terminal portion of arabinogalactan (AG) is motif A, a pentaarabinofuranoside characterized by two &#946;&#8208;1,2 linkages and one each of &#945;&#8208;1,5 and &#945;&#8208;1,3 linkages. The C5 positions of motif A are esterified with mycolic acids, further enriched by unusual cyclopropanes. In this study, we synthesized a diverse array of MTb cell wall glycolipids inspired by motif A and explored their self&#8208;assembly behavior using microscopy. This collection of glycolipids includes variations with &#945; or &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;2, 3, or 5) Araf linkages in di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and penta&#8208;arabinofuranosides, esterified with saturated, doubly unsaturated, or cyclopropanated long&#8208;chain fatty acids. The TEM analysis of the resulting self&#8208;assemblies revealed that subtle modifications in the anomeric linkages, length of the glycan, and the presence or absence of cyclopropanes impacted the morphology of the self&#8208;assembled structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Quasi&#8208;industrial Preparation of SWCNTs&#8208;confined High&#8208;entropy Oxides as Self&#8208;supported Electrodes for Continuous Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) are emerging as highly promising materials for electrochemical applications due to their exceptional electronic properties and active sites. However, the synthesis of 1D HEO with high aspect ratios and mechanical properties has been challenging, particularly on an industrial scale. Herein, we report a spatially confined oxidation (SCO) method to synthesize 1D HEO@SWCNTs with high specific surface area and stability. This method enables the large&#8208;scale production of HEO@SWCNTs, achieving quasi&#8208;industrially quantities in a single batch, and can be extended to seven&#8208;element 1D HEO. The resulting exhibit a homogeneous distribution of elements and a single&#8208;phase solid solution structure, as confirmed by STEM&#8208;EDS and XRD analysis. The Fermi level of SWCNTs is downshifted into the valence band upon HEO doping, enhancing conductivity and electrochemical activity. The HEO@SWCNTs electrode demonstrates superior flexibility and self&#8208;supported properties, making it suitable for large&#8208;scale electrochemical applications. Chronoamperometric measurements reveal excellent stability, maintaining 94% current retention after 20 h. Notably, in the electrochemical epoxidation reaction cycloolefin, the HEO@SWCNTs self&#8208;supported electrode achieves an average FE of 70.7% for epoxy&#8208;cyclohexane over 24 h. This work provides a scalable and versatile approach to the synthesis of self&#8208;supported electrodes for advanced electrochemical systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Customizing Room&#8208;Temperature Perovskite Ferroelectrics toward the Multichannel Domain Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manipulating domain structure in ferroelectrics by external stimuli presents a fascinating avenue for new&#8208;generation electronic devices. However, multichannel controlling of ferroelectric domains is still a challenge, due to the lack of knowledge on their bistability to diverse physical stimuli. Herein, we have customized a series of perovskite ferroelectrics, (CnH2n+1NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3Br10 (n = 2&#8208;7), of which the Curie temperatures are modulated in a wide temperature range (&#916;T = 74 K) by tailoring chain length of organic spacers. Strikingly, the n = 7 member is a room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric with bistable characteristics, thus endowing the manipulation of domains via four channels (i.e., thermal, stress, light, and electric fields). Such a non&#8208;volatile memory behavior of the stress&#8208;switching domain is unprecedented in hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics. This manipulation of domains reveals unique bistability of its ferroelectric orders, which sheds light on the future advance of customizing electric&#8208;ordered materials toward the smart device applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Color Single&#8208;Molecule Blinking Ratiometricity: A Functional Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging Approach for Resolving Lysosomal pH and Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence super&#8208;resolution microscopy has enabled nanoscale imaging of intracellular structures, but it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve structural imaging and quantitative functional characterization, such as pH measurement, within the same region. Here, we introduce Two&#8208;Color Single&#8208;Molecule Blinking Ratiometricity (2C&#8208;SMBR), a novel method that integrates structural and functional imaging with single&#8208;molecule precision. By loading lysosomes with two pH&#8208;dependent spontaneously blinking fluorophores of distinct colors, 2C&#8208;SMBR leverages single&#8208;molecule localization of either fluorophore to achieve nanoscale structural imaging of lysosomes, while the ratiometric analysis of blinking dynamics between the two fluorophores provides&#160;quantitative pH measurement at the single&#8208;lysosome level. This dual&#8208;color ratiometric approach at the single&#8208;molecule level enables precise quantification of lysosomal pH with exceptional spatiotemporal resolution. Using 2C&#8208;SMBR, we reveal that lysosomal pH is highly heterogeneous at the single&#8208;lysosome level, with distinct subpopulations exhibiting diverse pH values. Our measurements show a pH range of 4.0 to 6.0 within lysosomes, with perinuclear lysosomes averaging a pH of approximately 4.88, while peripheral lysosomes average around 5.64. Crucially, 2C&#8208;SMBR enables real&#8208;time correlation between lysosomal dynamics and pH changes, overcoming a key limitation of super&#8208;resolution imaging. This approach not only advances nanoscale organelle characterization but also provides mechanistic insights into lysosomal physiology and function.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Oximes are widely used precursors in synthetic chemistry due to their broad availability and versatile chemical properties, in which N&#8208;O bond fragmentation represents a key reactivity mode. However, these transformations typically require the use of oxygen&#8208;protected oximes, and a general strategy to directly utilize free oximes remains challenging due to their vulnerability to side reaction pathways, rendering low tendency towards N&#8208;OH bond cleavage. Here we report a unified platform to achieve direct cyclization of unprotected oximes with enals, as well as other coupling partners through dual copper/organophotoredox catalysis under green light irradiation. This protocol enables concurrent activation of both N&#8208;OH and &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds of free oximes to form multisubstituted pyridines with exceeding structural diversity and high functional group tolerance. In this process, the photocatalyst (Rose Bengal) also serves as a hydrogen atom transfer agent to generate radical intermediates. In the meanwhile, copper catalyst activates free oximes via single&#8208;electron reduction induced N&#8208;O bond fragmentation, and controls the selectivity for intermediate trapping. The synthetic utility of this approach is further demonstrated by its successful applications in late&#8208;stage modification of biologically active compounds and rapid assembly of solvatochromic fluorescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Accelerated Design of High&#8208;Efficient Lithium Adsorbents for Salt Lake Brines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The urgent demand for lithium resources has been advancing the development of high&#8208;efficient lithium extraction from brines. Aluminum&#8208;based lithium adsorbent, as the only one used in salt lake industry, is limited to further improve the extraction efficiency due to the low adsorption capacity. Here, we develop a high&#8208;throughput screening framework via interpretable machine learning (ML) to rapidly determine high&#8208;performance modification strategies for the aluminum&#8208;based lithium adsorbent, avoiding huge workload from traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error doping experiments in view of multiple doping schemes and the unique trade&#8208;off between performance and structural stability. Relying on the recommended modifications, a series of doped adsorbents are prepared and verified the structure stability and cyclic adsorption performance, which match well with the uncovered correlation between dopant features and adsorption capacity. Experimental validations confirm the screened doped one exhibits an increased stable adsorption capacity by near 40% in various types of brine. These results indicate that ML&#8208;accelerated approach can significantly promote the upgrading of lithium resource adsorption industry in salt lakes.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchor Peptide&#8208;based Immobilization Strategy Promote the Applications of Pickering Emulsion System in Natural Product&#160;Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pickering emulsion systems are an advanced platform for efficient fine chemical production in biphasic enzymatic catalysis, while their applications are currently limited to a few commercial enzyme classes. Herein, we designed an anchor peptide&#8208;based immobilization strategy for Pickering emulsions to achieve efficient glycosylation of natural products by glycosyltransferases (GTs). Firstly, through enzyme mining, natural GTs were utilized to synthesize pharmaceutically important acacetin glucoside and galactoside. However, the best&#8208;performing enzymes, BacGT and BarGT&#8208;3, still showed low conversions for acacetin glucoside (&lt;40%) and galactoside (&lt;10%). Then, Spy chemistry was employed to cyclize these two GTs (Spy_BacGT and Spy_BarGT&#8208;3) for improved robustness, and a Pickering emulsion was formed with the free two Spy_GTs, using 20% 2&#8208;hexanone and 1% mesoporous silica nanoparticles (CM), achieving 70% and 66% conversions of acacetin glucoside and galactoside, respectively. Further immobilization of the cyclized GTs onto CM via the anchor peptide LCI (Spy_BacGT/BarGT&#8208;3_LCI@CM) further enabled the system to reach more than 90% conversions of acacetin glycosides, retaining 90% conversions after 6&#8208;8 cycles. Moreover, this strategy was applied to GTs exhibiting substrate selectivity, achieving efficient non&#8208;selective catalysis. This study provides a simple and efficient immobilization strategy to broaden the applications of the Pickering emulsion system in enzymatic glycosylation.</dc:description>
