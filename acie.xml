         <title>Assembly&#8208;Dissociation&#8208;Reconstruction Synthesis of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with High Continuity for Efficient CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), at the forefront of porous materials, hold tremendous potential in membrane separation; however, achieving high continuity in COF membranes remains crucial for efficient gas separation. Here, we present a unique approach termed assembly&#8208;dissociation&#8208;reconstruction for fabricating COF membranes tailored for CO2/N2 separation. A parent COF is designed from two&#8208;node aldehyde and three&#8208;node amine monomers and dissociated to high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. Subsequently, COF nanosheets are orderly reconstructed into a crack&#8208;free membrane by surface reaction under water evaporation. The membrane exhibits high crystallinity, open pores and a strong affinity for CO2 adsorption over N2, resulting in CO2 permeance exceeding 1060 GPU and CO2/N2 selectivity surpassing 30.6. The efficacy of this strategy offers valuable guidance for the precise fabrication of gas&#8208;separation membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Diyne&#8208;Ene Annulation for the Synthesis of Polysubstituted Benzenes through Formal [3+3] Approach with Amide as the Critical Co&#8208;Catalyst</title>

         <dc:description>The one&#8208;step synthesis of tetra&#8208;substituted benzenes was accomplished via gold&#8208;catalyzed diyne&#8208;ene annulation. Distinguished from prior modification methods, this novel strategy undergoes formal [3+3] cyclization, producing polysubstituted benzenes with exceptional efficiency.&#160; The critical factor enabling this transformation was the introduction of amides, which were reported for the first time in gold catalysis as covalent nucleophilic co&#8208;catalysts.&#160; This interesting protocol not only offers a new strategy to achieve functional benzenes with high efficiency, but also enlightens potential new reaction pathways within gold&#8208;catalyzed alkyne activation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds and In&#8208;situ Photoinduced Metallic Bi0/Ni0&#160;Accelerating Z&#8208;scheme Charge Transfer of BiOBr@NiFe&#8208;LDH for Highly Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For heterojunction system, the lack of stable interfacial driving force and definite charge transfer channel makes the charge separation and transfer efficiency unsatisfactory. The photoreaction mechanism occurring at the interface also receives less attention. Herein, a 2D/2D Z&#8208;scheme junction BiOBr@NiFe&#8208;LDH with large&#8208;area contact featured by abundant interfacial hydrogen bonds and a strong interfacial electric field (IEF) is synthesized, and in&#8208;situ photoinduced metallic species assisting charge transfer mechanism is demonstrated. The hydrogen bonds between O atoms from BiOBr and H atoms from NiFe&#8208;LDH induce a significant interfacial charge redistribution, establishing a robust IEF. Notably, during photocatalytic reaction, Bi0 and Ni0 are in&#8208;situ isolated from BiOBr and NiFe&#8208;LDH in heterojunction, which separately act as electron transport mediator and electron trap to further accelerate charge transfer efficiency up to 71.2%. Theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the existence of Bi0 strengthens the IEF. Therefore, high&#8208;speed spatial charge separation is realized in Bi0/BiOBr@Ni0/NiFe&#8208;LDH, leading to a prominent photocatalytic activity with a tetracycline removal ratio of 88.3% within 7 minutes under visible&#8208;light irradiation and the presence of persulfate, far exceeding majority of photocatalysts reported previously. This study provides valid insights for designing hydrogen bonding heterojunction systems, and advances mechanistic understanding on in&#8208;situ photoreaction at interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Low&#8208;loaded PdOx/AlSiOx for Ethylene Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylene dimerization is an industrial process that is currently carried out using homogeneous catalysts. Here we present a highly active heterogeneous catalyst containing minute amounts of atomically dispersed Pd. It requires no co&#8208;catalyst(s) or activator(s) and significantly outperforms previously reported catalysts tested under similar reaction conditions. The selectivity to C4&#8208; and C6&#8208;hydrocarbons was about 80% and 10% at 42% ethylene conversion at 200&#176;C using an industrially relevant feed containing 50 vol% ethylene, respectively. Our&#160;kinetic and catalyst characterization experiments complemented by density functional theory calculations provide molecular insights into the local environment of isolated Pd(II)Ox species and their role in achieving high activity in the target reaction. When the developed catalyst was rationally integrated with a Mo&#8208;containing olefin metathesis catalyst in the same reactor, the formed butenes reacted with ethylene to propylene with a selectivity of 98% at about 24% ethylene conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photosensitizer for Combined Pyroptosis and Apoptosis with NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence/Photoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overcoming tumor apoptosis resistance is a major challenge in enhancing cancer therapy. Pyroptosis, a lytic form of programmed cell death (PCD) involving inflammasomes, Gasdermin family proteins, and cysteine proteases, offers potential in cancer treatment. While photodynamic therapy (PDT) can induce pyroptosis by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the activation of photosensitizers (PSs), many PSs lack specific subcellular targets and are limited to the first near&#8208;infrared window, potentially reducing treatment effectiveness. Therefore, developing effective, deep&#8208;penetrating, organelle&#8208;targeted pyroptosis&#8208;mediated phototherapy is essential for cancer treatment strategies. Here, we synthesized four molecules with varying benzene ring numbers in thiopyrylium structures to preliminarily explore their photodynamic properties. The near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) PS Z1, with a higher benzene ring count, exhibited superior ROS generation and mitochondria&#8208;targeting abilities, and a large Stokes shift. Through nano&#8208;precipitation method, Z1 nanoparticles (NPs) also demonstrated high ROS generation (especially type&#8208;I ROS) upon 808 nm laser irradiation, leading to efficient mitochondria dysfunction and combined pyroptosis and apoptosis. Moreover, they exhibited exceptional tumor&#8208;targeting ability via NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging (NIR&#8208;II FI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). Furthermore, Z1 NPs&#8208;mediated phototherapy effectively inhibited tumor growth with minimal adverse effects. Our findings offer a promising strategy for cancer therapy, warranting further preclinical investigations in PDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Aluminum Alkyl Induced Isomerization of Group IV meso Metallocene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of group IV metallocene precatalysts for the polymerization of propylene generally yields two different isomers: The racemic isomer that produces isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and the meso isomer that produces atactic polypropylene (aPP). Due to its poor physical properties, aPP has very limited applications. To avoid obtaining blends of both polymers and thus diminish the mechanical and thermal properties of iPP, the meso metallocene complexes need to be separated from the racemic ones tediously &#8211;rendering the metallocene&#8208;based polymerization of propylene industrially far less attractive than the Ziegler/Natta process. To overcome this issue, we established an isomerization protocol to convert meso metallocene complexes into their racemic counterparts. This protocol increased the yield of iPP by 400% while maintaining the polymer&#8217;s excellent physical properties and was applicable to both hafnocene and zirconocene complexes, as well as different precatalyst activation methods. Through targeted variation of the ligand frameworks, methoxy groups at the indenyl moieties were found to be the structural motifs responsible for an isomerization to take place &#8211;this experimental evidence was confirmed by density functional theory calculations. Liquid injection field desorption ionization mass spectrometry, as well as 1H and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance studies, allowed the proposal of an isomerization mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Blade&#8208;Coating (100)&#8208;Oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite Films via Crystal Surface Energy Regulation for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite  Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoactive formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) perovskite has dominated the prevailing high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs), normally for those spin&#8208;coated, conventional n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured devices. Unfortunately, &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 has not been made full use of its advantages in inverted p&#8208;i&#8208;n structured PSCs fabricated via blade&#8208;coating techniques owing to uncontrollable crystallization kinetics and complicated phase evolution of FAPbI3 perovskites. Herein, a customized crystal surface energy regulation strategy has been innovatively developed by incorporating 0.5 mol% of N&#8208;aminoethylpiperazine hydroiodide (NAPI) additive into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystal&#8208;derived perovskite ink, which enabled the formation of phase&#8208;pure, highly&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films. We deciphered the phase transformation mechanisms and crystallization kinetics of blade&#8208;coated &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films via combining a series of in&#8208;situ characterizations. Interestingly, the strong chemical interactions between the NAPI and inorganic Pb&#8208;I framework help to reduce the surface energy of (100) crystal plane by 42%, retard the crystallization rate and lower the formation energy of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. The resultant blade&#8208;coated inverted PSCs based on (100)&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films realized promising efficiencies up to 24.16% (~26.5% higher than that of the randomly&#8208;oriented counterparts), accompanied by improved operational stability. This result represented one of the best performances reported to date for FAPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs fabricated via scalable deposition methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Group&#8208;driven Competing Mechanism in Electrochemical Reaction and Adsorption/Desorption Processes toward High&#8208;capacity Aluminum&#8208;Porphyrin Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonaqueous organic aluminum batteries are considered as promising high&#8208;safety energy storage devices due to stable ionic liquid electrolytes and Al metals. However, the stability and capacity of organic positive electrodes are limited by their inherent high solubility and low active organic molecules. To address such issues, here porphyrin compounds with rigid molecular structures present stable and reversible capability in electrochemically storing AlCl2+. Comparison between the porphyrin molecules with electron&#8208;donating groups (TPP&#8208;EDG) and with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (TPP&#8208;EWG) suggests that EDG is responsible for increasing both HOMO and LUMO energy levels, resulting in decreased redox potentials. On the other hand, EWG is associated with decreasing both HOMO and LUMO energy levels, leading to promoted redox potentials. EDG and EWG play critical roles in regulating electron density of porphyrin &#960; bond and&#160;electrochemical energy storage kinetics behavior. The competitive mechanism between electrochemical redox reaction and de/adsorption processes suggests that TPP&#8208;OCH3 delivers the highest specific capacity ~171.8 mAh g&#8208;1, approaching a record in the organic Al batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Alkenes Through Hydroalkylation of Alkynyl Boronamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroalkylation of alkynes is a powerful method for alkene synthesis. However, regioselectivity has been difficult to achieve in transformations of internal alkynes hindering applications in the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes. To overcome these limitations, we explored using boryl groups as versatile directing groups that can control the regioselectivity of the hydroalkylation and subsequently be replaced in a cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The result of our exploration is a nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkynyl boronamides that provides access to a wide range of trisubstituted alkenes with high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The reaction can be accomplished with a variety of coupling partners, including primary and secondary alkyl iodides, &#945;&#8208;bromo esters, &#945;&#8208;chloro phthalimides, and &#945;&#8208;chloro boronic esters. Preliminary studies of the reaction mechanism provide evidence for the hydrometalation mechanism and the formation of alkyl radical intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Formamide Synthesis via Coupling of Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Radicals over Atomically Dispersed Bi Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formamide (HCONH2) plays a pivotal role in the manufacture of a diverse array of chemicals, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals. Photocatalysis holds great promise for green fabrication of carbon&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8208;N) compounds owing to its environmental friendliness and mild redox capability. However, the selective formation of the C&#8208;N bond presents a significant challenge in the photocatalytic synthesis of C&#8208;N compounds. This work developed a photocatalytic radical coupling method for the formamide synthesis from co&#8208;oxidation of ammonia (NH3) and methanol (CH3OH).&#160;An exceptional formamide yield rate of 5.47 &#177; 0.03 mmol&#183;gcat&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 (911.87 &#177; 0.05 mmol&#183;gBi&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1) was achieved over atomically dispersed Bi sites (BiSAs) on TiO2. An accumulation of 45.0 mmol&#183;gcat&#8208;1 (0.2 g&#183;gcat&#8208;1) of formamide was achieved after long&#8208;term illumination, representing the highest level of photocatalytic C&#8208;N compounds synthesis. The critical C&#8208;N coupling for formamide formation originated from the &#8220;&#963;&#8208;&#963;&#8221; interaction between electrophilic &#9679;CH2OH with nucleophilic &#9679;NH2 radical. The &#160;BiSAs&#160;sites facilitated the electron transfer between reactants and photocatalysts and enhanced the&#160;nucleophilic attack of&#160;&#9679;NH2&#160;radical at the&#160;&#9679;CH2OH radical, thereby advancing the selective C&#8208;N bond formation.&#160;This work deepens the understanding of the C&#8208;N coupling mechanism and offers an alternative and intriguing photocatalytic approach for the efficient and sustainable production of C&#8208;N compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Hindrance Engineering to Modulate the Closed Pores Formation of Polymer&#8208;Derived Hard Carbon for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The closed pores play a critical role in improving the sodium storage capacity of hard carbon (HC) anode, however, their formation mechanism as well as the efficient modulation strategy at molecular level in the polymer&#8208;derived HCs is still lacking. In this work, the steric hindrance effect has been proposed to create closed pores in the polymer&#8208;derived HCs for the first time through grafting the aromatic rings within and between the main chains in the precursor. The experimental data and theoretical calculation demonstrate that steric&#8208;hindrance effect from the aromatic ring side group can increase backbone rigidity and the internal free volumes in the polymer precursor, which can prevent the over graphitization and facilitate the formation of closed pores during the carbonization process. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared HC anode exhibits a remarkably enhanced discharge capacity of 340.3 mAh/g at 0.1 C, improved rate performance (210.7 mAh/g at 5 C) as well as boosted cycling stability (86.4% over 1000 cycles at 2C). This work provides a new insight into the formation mechanisms of closed pores via steric hindrance engineering, which can shed light on the development of high&#8208;performance polymer&#8208;derived HC anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Regional Functionalization Molecular Design Strategy: A Key to Enhancing the Efficiency of Multi&#8208;Resonance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we propose a regional functionalization molecular design strategy that enables independent control of distinct pivotal parameters through distinct segments of the molecule. Three novel blue emitters A&#8208;BN, DA&#8208;BN, and A&#8208;DBN, have been successfully synthesized by integrating highly rigid and three&#8208;dimensional adamantane&#8208;containing spirofluorene units into the MR framework. These molecules form two distinctive functional parts: part 1 comprises a boron&#8208;nitrogen (BN)&#8208;MR framework with adjacent benzene and fluorene units forming a central luminescent core characterized by an exceptionally rigid planar geometry, allowing for narrow FWHM values; part 2 includes peripheral mesitylene, benzene, and adamantyl groups, creating a unique three&#8208;dimensional "umbrella&#8208;like" conformation to mitigate intermolecular interactions and suppress exciton annihilation. The resulting A&#8208;BN, DA&#8208;BN, and A&#8208;DBN exhibit remarkably narrow FWHM values ranging from 18 to 14 nm and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields. Particularly, OLEDs based on DA&#8208;BN and A&#8208;DBN demonstrate outstanding efficiencies of 35.0% and 34.3%, with FWHM values as low as 22 nm and 25 nm, respectively, effectively accomplishing the integration of high color purity and high device performance.</dc:description>

These molecules form two distinctive functional parts: part 1 comprises a boron-nitrogen (BN)-MR framework with adjacent benzene and fluorene units forming a central luminescent core characterized by an exceptionally rigid planar geometry, allowing for narrow FWHM values; part 2 includes peripheral mesitylene, benzene, and adamantyl groups, creating a unique three-dimensional "umbrella-like" conformation to mitigate intermolecular interactions and suppress exciton annihilation. The resulting A-BN, DA-BN, and A-DBN exhibit remarkably narrow FWHM values ranging from 18 to 14 nm and near-unity photoluminescence quantum yields. Particularly, OLEDs based on DA-BN and A-DBN demonstrate outstanding efficiencies of 35.0% and 34.3%, with FWHM values as low as 22 nm and 25 nm, respectively, effectively accomplishing the integration of high color purity and high device performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>5,18&#8208;Dimesitylorangarin: a Stable Antiaromatic [20]Pentaphyrin(1.0.1.0.0) Displaying Remarkable Oxidative Self&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>5,18&#8208;Dimesitylorangarin and its BF2 complex were synthesized by double SNAr reaction of 3,5&#8208;dibromo&#8208;BODIPY with a&#8208;(pyro&#8208;2&#8208;ly)dipyrrin as the first examples of meso&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted orangarin. These orangarins, delineated as [20]pentaphyrin(1.0.1.0.0), are strongly antiaromatic but rather stable. The free base orangarin was coupled by oxidation with MnO2 to give a 11,11&#8217;&#8208;linked dimer, a cyclooctatetraene(COT)&#8208;centered trimer, and a spiro&#8208;trimer. Fused COT&#8208;centered 3H&#8208;orangarin dimer was oxidized to the corresponding 2H&#8208;orangarin dimer, which was further coupled to give a triply COT centered 2H&#8208;orangarin tetramer. 3H&#8208;Orangarin oligomers are all antiaromatic as evinced by extremely low&#8208;field&#8208;shifted 1H NMR signals of the inner NH and ill&#8208;defined absorption spectra with broad tails. In contrast, COT&#8208;centered 2H&#8208;orangarin dimer and tetramer show moderately low&#8208;field&#8208;shifted NH signals and intense NIR absorbance over 900 nm, suggesting the effective p&#8208;conjugation through the COT bridge and almost non&#8208;antiaromatic character. These orangarin oligomers exhibit many reversible redox potentials owing to the intramolecular electronic interactions. Regardless of the different aromatic characters, all the orangarin monomers and oligomers exhibit very rapid excited&#8208;state decays.</dc:description>

         <title>Embedding Single Pd Atoms on NiGa Intermetallic Surfaces for Efficient and Selective Alkyne Semi&#8208;hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic removal of alkynes is essential in industry for producing polymer&#8208;grade alkenes from steam cracking processes. Non&#8208;noble Ni&#8208;based catalysts hold promise as effective alternatives to industrial Pd&#8208;based catalysts but suffer from low activity. Here we report embedding of single&#8208;atom Pd onto the NiGa intermetallic surface with replacing Ga atoms via a well&#8208;defined synthesis strategy to design Pd1&#8208;NiGa catalyst for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation. The fabricated Pd1Ni2Ga1 ensemble sites deliver remarkably higher specific mass activity under superb alkene selectivity of &gt;96% than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts under industry&#8208;relevant conditions. Integrated experimental and computational studies reveal that the single&#8208;atom Pd located synergizes with the neighbouring Ni sites to facilitate the &#963;&#8208;adsorption of alkyne and dissociation of hydrogen while suppress the alkene adsorption. Such synergistic effects confer the single&#8208;atom Pd on the NiGa intermetallic with a Midas touch for alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation, providing an effective strategy for stimulating low active Ni&#8208;based catalysts for other selective hydrogenations in industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Jellyfish&#8208;inspired Polyurea Ionogel with Mechanical Robustness, Self&#8208;Healing, and Fluorescence Enabled by Hyperbranched Cluster Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionogels are promising for soft iontronics, with their network structure playing a pivotal role in determining their performance and potential applications. However, simultaneously achieving mechanical toughness, low hysteresis, self&#8208;healing, and fluorescence using existing network structures is challenging. Drawing inspiration from jellyfish, we propose a novel hierarchical crosslinking network structure design for in situ formation of hyperbranched cluster aggregates (HCA) to fabricate polyurea ionogels to overcome these challenges. Leveraging the disparate reactivity of isocyanate groups, we induce the in situ formation of HCA through competing reactions, enhancing toughness and imparting the clustering&#8208;triggered emission of ionogel. This synergy between supramolecular interactions in the network and plasticizing effect in ionic liquid leads to reduced hysteresis of the ionogel. Furthermore, the incorporation of NCO&#8208;terminated prepolymer with dynamic oxime&#8211;urethane bonds (NPU) enables self&#8208;healing and enhances stretchability. Our investigations highlight the significant influence of HCA on ionogel performance, showcasing mechanical robustness including high strength (3.5 MPa), exceptional toughness (5.5 MJ m&#8722;3), resistance to puncture, and low hysteresis, self&#8208;healing, as well as&#160;fluorescence, surpassing conventional dynamic crosslinking approaches. This network design strategy is versatile and can meet the various demands of flexible electronics applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we describe an innovative approach to the&#160;asymmetric electrochemical &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes facilitated by a newly designed bifunctional chiral electrocatalyst. The highly efficient bifunctional chiral electrocatalyst combines a chiral aminocatalyst with a redox mediator. It plays a dual role as a redox mediator for electrooxidation, while&#160;simultaneously providing&#160;remarkable asymmetric induction for the stereoselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes. Additionally, this novel catalyst exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and excellent stereoselective control comparable to conventional catalytic systems. As a result, this strategy&#160;provides a new avenue for versatile asymmetric electrochemistry. The&#160;electrooxidation&#160;of diverse phenols enables&#160;the C&#8211;H/C&#8211;H oxidative &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes in a highly chemo&#8208; and stereoselective fashion.

         <title>Phosphonium Iodide Featuring Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence for Highly Efficient X&#8208;ray Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic scintillators are praised for their abundant element reserves, facile preparation procedures, and rich structures.&#160;Herein, a new family of highly efficient organic phosphonium halide salts with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are designed by innovatively adopting quaternary phosphonium as the electron acceptor, while dimethylamine group and halide anions (I&#8208;) serve as the electron donor. The prepared butyl(2&#8208;[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl]phenyl)diphenylphosphonium iodide (C4&#8208;I) exhibits bright blue emission and an ultra&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 100%. Efficient charge transfer is realized through the unique n&#8208;&#960; and anion&#8208;&#960; stacking in solid&#8208;state C4&#8208;I. Photophysical studies of C4&#8208;I suggest that the incorporation of I accounts for high intersystem crossing rate (kISC) and reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC), suppressing the intrinsic prompt fluorescence and enabling near&#8208;pure TADF emission at room temperature. Benefitting from the large Stokes shift, high PLQY, efficient exciton utilization, and remarkable X&#8208;ray attenuation ability endowed by I, C4&#8208;I delivers an outstanding light yield of 80721 photons/MeV and a low limit of detection (LoD) of 22.79 nGy&#183;s&#8208;1. This work would provide a rational design concept and open up an appealing road for developing efficient organic scintillators with tunable emission, strong X&#8208;ray attenuation ability, and excellent scintillator performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rhodamine&#8208;Spiropyran Conjugate Empowering Tunable Mechanochromism in Polymers under Multiple Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochromic functionality realized via the force&#8208;responsive mechanophores in polymers has great potential for damage sensing and information storage. Mechanophores with the ability to recognize multiple stimuli for tunable chromic characteristics are highly sought after for versatile sensing ability and color programmability. Nevertheless, the majority of mechanophores are based on single&#8208;component chromophores with limited sensitivity, or require additional fabrication technology for multi&#8208;modal chromism. Here, we report a novel multifunctional mechanophore capable of vividly detectable and tunable mechanochromism in polymers. This synergistic optical coupling relies on strategically fusing rhodamine and spiropyran (Rh&#8208;SP), and tethering polymer chains on both subunits.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mechanochromic functionality realized via the force-responsive mechanophores in polymers has great potential for damage sensing and information storage. Mechanophores with the ability to recognize multiple stimuli for tunable chromic characteristics are highly sought after for versatile sensing ability and color programmability. Nevertheless, the majority of mechanophores are based on single-component chromophores with limited sensitivity, or require additional fabrication technology for multi-modal chromism. Here, we report a novel multifunctional mechanophore capable of vividly detectable and tunable mechanochromism in polymers. This synergistic optical coupling relies on strategically fusing rhodamine and spiropyran (Rh-SP), and tethering polymer chains on both subunits. The mechanochromic behaviors of the Rh-SP-linked polymers under sonication and compression are thoroughly evaluated in response to changes in force and the light-controlled relaxation process. Non-sequential ring-opening of the two subunits under force is identified, endowing high-contrast mechanochromism. Light-induced differential ring-closing reactions of the two subunits, together with the acidichromism of the SP moiety, are employed to engineer elastomers with programmable and wide-spectrum colors. Our work presents an effective strategy for highly appreciable and regulable mechanochromic functionality, and also provides new insights into the rupture mechanisms of &#960;-fused mechanophores, as well as how the stimuli history controls stress accumulation in polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ribosome&#8208;Free Translation up to Pentapeptides via Template Walk on RNA Sequences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The origin of translation is one of the most difficult problems of molecular evolution. Identifying molecular systems that translate an RNA sequence into a peptide sequence in the absence of ribosomes and enzymes is a challenge. Recently, single&#8208;nucleotide translation via coupling of 5' phosphoramidate&#8208;linked amino acids to 2'/3'&#8208;aminoacyl transfer&#8208;NMPs, as directed by the sequence of an RNA template, was demonstrated for three of the four canonical nucleotides. How single&#8208;nucleotide translation could be expanded to include all four bases and to produce longer peptides without translocation along the template strand remained unclear. Using transfer strands of increasing length containing any of the four bases that interrogate adjacent positions along the template, we now show that pentapeptides can be produced in coupling reactions and subsequent hydrolytic release in situ. With 2'/3'&#8208;aminoacylated mono&#8208;, di, tri&#8208; and tetranucleotides we thus show just how efficient translation can be without biomacromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Cone Angles Quantify and Predict Affinity and Reactivity of Anion Complexes between Trifluoroborates and Rigid Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Steric manipulation is a known concept in molecular recognition but there is currently no linear free energy relationship correlating sterics to the stability of receptor&#8208;anion complexes nor to the reactivity of the bound anion. By analogy to Tolman cone angles in cation coordination chemistry, we explore how to define and correlate cone angles of organo&#8208;trifluoroborates (R&#8211;BF3&#8211;) to the affinities observed for cyanostar&#8208;anion binding. We extend the analogy to a rare investigation of reactivity and how it changes upon anion binding. The substituent on the anion is used to define the cone angle, &#952;. A series of 10 anions were studied including versions with ethynyl, ethylene, and ethyl substituents that were selected to tune steric bulk across the sp, sp2 and sp3 hybridized a&#8208;carbons bearing 0, 1 and 2 hydrogen atoms. A linear relationship between affinity and cone angle is observed for anions bearing substituents larger than the &#8211;BF3&#8211; headgroup. This correlation predicted affinities of two new anions to within &#177;5%. We explored how complexation affects the reactivity of fluoride exchange. The yield of fluoride transfer from R&#8211;BF3&#8211; to Lewis acid triphenylborane is correlated with cone angle. We predict that other rigid macrocycles, like commercially available bambusuril, could follow these trends.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Boroxine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>We report a rapid, room&#8208;temperature mechanochemical synthesis of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;dimensional boroxine covalent organic frameworks (COFs), enabled by using trimethylboroxine as a dehydrating additive to overcome the hydrolytic sensitivity of boroxine&#8208;based COFs. The resulting COFs display high porosity and crystallinity, with COF&#8208;102 being the first example of a mechanochemically prepared 3D COF, exhibiting a surface area of ca.&#160;2,500&#160;m2&#160;g&#8211;1. Mechanochemistry enabled a &gt;20&#8208;fold reduction in solvent use and ~100&#8208;fold reduction in reaction time compared with solvothermal methods, providing target COFs quantitatively with no additional work&#8208;up besides vacuum drying. Real&#8208;time Raman spectroscopy permitted the first quantitative kinetic analysis of COF mechanosynthesis, while transferring the reaction design to Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM) enabled synthesis of multi&#8208;gram amounts of the target COFs (tested up to 10 g).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present a series of borane&#8208;tethered cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC)&#8208;copper complexes, including a borane&#8208;capped Cu(I) hydride. This hydride is unusually hydridic and reacts rapidly with both CO2 and 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenol at room temperature. Its reactivity is distinct from variants without a tethered borane, and the underlying principles governing the enhanced hydricity were evaluated experimentally and theoretically. These stoichiometric results were extended to catalytic CO2 hydrogenation, and the borane&#8208;tethered (intramolecular) system exhibits ~3&#8208;fold enhancement relative to an intermolecular system.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergizing Steric Hindrance and Stacking Interactions to Facilitate the Controlled Assembly of Multiple 41 Metalla&#8208;Knots and Pseudo&#8208;Solomon Links</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a noncoplanar terphenyl served as building block to synthesize a novel 3,3'&#8208;substituted bipyridyl ligand (L1) which further reacted with binuclear half&#8208;sandwich units A/B, giving rise to two aesthetical 41 metalla&#8208;knots in high yields via coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy. Furthermore, given the inherent compactness of the 41 metalla&#8208;knots, it creates favorable conditions for the emergence of steric repulsion. We focused on progressively introducing nitrogen atoms featuring lone pair electrons (LPEs) into ligand L1 to manipulate the balance of H&#183;&#183;&#183;H/LPEs&#183;&#183;&#183;LPEs steric repulsion during the assembly process, ultimately achieving controlled assembly from 41 metalla&#8208;knots to the pseudo&#8208;Solomon link and then to molecular tweezer&#8208;like assembly facilitated by stacking interactions. All the assemblies were well characterized by solution&#8208;state NMR techniques, ESI&#8208;TOF/MS, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The evolutionary process of topological architectures is equivalent to visualizing the synergistic effect of steric hindrance and stacking interactions on structural assembly, providing a new avenue for achieving the controlled synthesis of different topologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Scale Synthesis of a Stable Prefunctionalized Silver Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the stability issue, It is difficult to prepare a silver nanocluster bearing functional sites, especially at a large scale. We report the synthesis and structure of a stable silver nanocluster bearing multiple surface aldehyde groups [Ag21(Ph2PO2)10(p&#8208;CHOPhC&#8801;C)6]SbF6, which allows for postsynthesis modification such as surface functionalization through aldimine condensation to give homochiral clusters. Remarkably, the preparation of this cluster can be done in ~90% high yield at gram scale, which facilitates further studies and potential applications. Through DFT calculations and geometric structure analysis, the high stability of this cluster is attributed to the geometric closure and electronic structure. This is the first time that an effective one&#8208;pot method has been developed to synthesize functional silver nanoclusters in high yield. The title cluster will be useful in the development of a variety of cluster&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanosheet Induced Inverse Growth of Negative Valency Au Clusters for Tumor Treatment by Enhanced Oxidative Stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cluster aggregation states are thermodynamically favored at the subnanoscale, for which an inverse growth from nanoparticles to clusters may be realized on subnanometer supports. Herein, we develop Au&#8208;polyoxometalate&#8208;layered double hydroxide (Au&#8208;POM&#8208;LDH) sub&#8208;1 nm nanosheets (Sub&#8208;APL) based on the above strategy, where sub&#8208;1 nm Au clusters with negative valence are generated by the in&#8208;situ disintegration of Au nanoparticles on POM&#8208;LDH supports. Sub&#8208;1 nm Au clusters with ultrahigh surface atom ratios exhibit remarkable efficiency for glutathione (GSH) depletion. The closely connected sub&#8208;1 nm Au with negative valence and POM hetero&#8208;units can promote the separation of hole&#8208;electrons, resulting in the enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation under ultrasound (US). Besides, the reversible redox of Mo in POM is able to deplete GSH and trigger chemodynamic therapy (CDT) simultaneously, further enhancing the oxidative stress. Consequently, the Sub&#8208;APL present 2&#8208;fold ROS generation under US and 7&#8208;fold GSH depletion compared to the discrete Au and POM&#8208;LDH mixture. Therefore, the serious imbalance of redox in the TME caused by the sharp increase of ROS and rapid decrease of GSH leads to death of tumor ultimately.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Factors Controlling Hydrogen and Methyl Spillover on Rh/Cu(111) Single&#8208;Atom Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spillover of adsorbed species from one active site to another is a key step in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the factors controlling this step, particularly the spillover of polyatomic species, have rarely been studied. Herein, we investigate the spillover dynamics of H* and CH3* species on a single&#8208;atom alloy surface (Rh/Cu(111)) upon the dissociative chemisorption of methane (CH4), using molecular dynamics that considers both surface phonons and electron&#8208;hole pairs. These dynamical calculations are made possible by a high&#8208;dimensional potential energy surface machine learned from density functional theory data. Our results provide compelling evidence that the H* and CH3* can spill over on the metal surface at experimental temperatures and reveal novel dynamical features involving an internal motion during diffusion for CH3*. Increasing surface temperature has&#160;minor effect on promoting spillover, as geminate recombinative desorption becomes more prevalent. However, the poisoning of the active site can be mitigated by&#160;frequent gaseous molecular collisions that occur under ambient pressure in real&#8208;world catalysis, which transfer energy to the trapped adsorbates. Interestingly, the bulky CH3* exhibits a significant spillover advantage over the light H* due to its larger size, which facilitates energy acquisition. These insights help to advance our understanding of spillover in heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of a Decanuclear Organometallic Dysprosium&#160;Complex via a Radical&#8211;Radical Cross&#8211;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the years, polynuclear cyclic or torus complexes have attracted increasing interest due to their unique metal topologies and properties. However, the isolation of polynuclear cyclic organometallic complexes is extremely challenging due to their inherent reactivity, which stems from the labile and reactive metal&#8208;carbon bonds. In this study, the pyrazine ligand undergoes a radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction leading to the formation of a decanuclear [(Cp*)20Dy10(L1)10]&#183;12(C7H8) (1; where L1 = anion of 2&#8208;prop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrazine) complex, where all DyIII metal centers are bridged by the anionic L1 ligand. Amongst the family of polynuclear Ln organometallic complexes bearing CpR2Lnx units, 1 features the highest nuclearity obtained to date. In&#8208;depth computational studies were conducted to elucidate the proposed reaction mechanism and formation of L1, while probing of the magnetic properties of 1, revealed slow magnetic relaxation upon application of a static dc field.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructing Helmholtz Plane Enables Robust F&#8208;Rich Interface for Long&#8208;Life and High&#8208;Safe Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hard carbon (HC) is the most commonly used anode material in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface (SEI) layer formed in carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolytes has an imperceptible dissolution tendency and a sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics, resulting in unsatisfactory performance of the HC anode. Given that electrode/electrolyte interface property is highly dependent on the configuration of Helmholtz plane, we filtrate proper solvents by PFBE (PF6&#8208; anion binding energy) and CAE (carbon absorption energy) and disclose the function of chosen TFEP to reconstruct the Helmholtz plane and regulate the SEI film on HC anode. Benefiting from the preferential adsorption tendency on HC surface and strong anion&#8208;dragging interaction of TFEP, a robust and thin anion&#8208;derived F&#8208;rich SEI film is established, which greatly enhances the mechanical stability and the Na+ ion diffusion kinetics of the electrode/electrolyte interface. The rationally designed TFEP&#8208;based electrolyte endows Na||HC half&#8208;cell and 2.8 Ah HC||Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 pouch cell with excellent rate capability, long cycle life, high safety and low&#8208;temperature adaptability. It is believed that this insightful recognition of tuning interface properties will pave a new avenue on the design of compatible electrolyte for low&#8208;cost, long&#8208;life, and high&#8208;safe sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolable T&#8208;Shaped Planar Silyl Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the isolation of an unprecedented T&#8208;shaped planar silyl anion salt. The non&#8208;classical geometry enables this silyl anion to feature a silicon&#8208;centred HOMO, LUMO and a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap. It not only exhibits nucleophilic behaviour but also undergoes oxidative additions to CO2 and arylisonitrile. Notably, it represents the first example of silyl anions capable of cleaving C&#8722;H and H&#8722;H bonds under mild conditions.







Abstract
Silyl anions have garnered significant attention due to their synthetic abilities. However, previously reported silyl anions have been limited to either trigonal&#8208;pyramidal or trigonal&#8208;planar geometries, which confine them primarily as nucleophiles in substitution reactions. Herein, we report the isolation of the unprecedented T&#8208;shaped planar silyl anion salt 2 by employment of a geometrically constrained triamido pincer ligand. Theoretical calculations disclosed that the silicon centre in 2 possesses both a lone pair of electrons and an empty 3pz orbital. In addition to nucleophilic substitution reactions with Ph3PAuCl and W(CO)6, 2 readily undergoes oxidative additions with CO2 and 2,6&#8208;dimethylphenylisonitrile at room temperature. Furthermore, under mild conditions, compound 2 cleaves Csp2&#8722;H, Csp2&#8722;H, and H&#8722;H bonds in 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene, an intramolecular iPr group, and dihydrogen, representing the first examples of C&#8722;H and H&#8722;H activations mediated by a silyl anion, respectively. This work unveils new reactivity of silyl anions owing to the non&#8208;classical geometry and electronic structure.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Proportion of Grain Boundaries in Zinc Metal Anode Spontaneously Inhibiting Dendrites Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high proportion of grain boundaries create abundant nucleation sites, accelerating zinc nucleation and growth rates allowing for the 2D growth kinetics. This offers advantages over the traditional 3D instantaneous nucleation mode of the commercial zinc foil, constrained by limited nucleation sites and kinetics associated with nucleation and growth.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are an attractive electrochemical energy storage solution for their budget and safe properties. However, dendrites and uncontrolled side reactions in anodes detract the cycle life and energy density of the batteries. Grain boundaries in metals are generally considered as the source of the above problems but we present a diverse result. This study introduces an ultra&#8208;high proportion of grain boundaries on zinc electrodes through femtosecond laser bombardment to enhance stability of zinc metal/electrolyte interface. The ultra&#8208;high proportion of grain boundaries promotes the homogenization of zinc growth potential, to achieve uniform nucleation and growth, thereby suppressing dendrite formation. Additionally, the abundant active sites mitigate the side reactions during the electrochemical process. Consequently, the 15&#8197;&#956;m Fs&#8722;Zn||MnO2 pouch cell achieves an energy density of 249.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and operates for over 60 cycles at a depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge of 23&#8201;%. The recognition of the favorable influence exerted by UP&#8208;GBs paves a new way for other metal batteries.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Distal C(sp3)&#8722;H Bromination of Aliphatic Amines as a Gateway for Forging Nitrogen&#8208;Containing sp3 Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208;selective bromination of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in unprotected aliphatic amines has been developed, achieved by tuning of the electronics properties of the proximal C&#8722;H bonds via substrate protonation. Consecutive intramolecular cyclization of alkyl bromide offered a series of N&#8208;containing heterocycles characterized by high ring strains. Moreover, the resulting C(sp3)&#8722;Br serves as a synthetic linchpin can be readily transferred to C(sp3)&#8722;C, N, O bonds, enabling diverse functionalization at previously untouched C(sp3)&#8722;H sites.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a new strategy that rapidly and reliably incorporates bromine atoms at distal, secondary C(sp3)&#8722;H sites in aliphatic amines with an excellent and predictable site&#8208;selectivity pattern. The resulting halogenated building blocks serve as versatile linchpins to enable a series of carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;formations at remote C(sp3) sites, thus offering a new modular and unified platform that expediates the access to advanced sp3 architectures possessing valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing saturated heterocycles of interest in medicinal chemistry settings.

         <title>[2.2]Benzoindenophane&#8208;Based Chiral Indenyl Ligands: Design, Synthesis, and Applications in Asymmetric C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both the development of optically pure chiral indenyl rhodium(IndxRh) catalysts and IndxRh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation are challenging and seldom reported. Herein, a class of chiral indenyl ligands bearing a [2.2]benzoindenophane skeleton is presented. It is convenient to synthesize and easy to modify (13 variations are shown). Importantly, its coordination to rhodium is face&#8208;specific. Moreover, the utilities of its IndxRh catalysts have been demonstrated by two asymmetric C&#8722;H activation reactions.







Abstract
Development of chiral indenyl ligands for asymmetric C&#8722;H activation is a longstanding challenge, and extremely few successes have been achieved. In this paper, we describe a class of readily accessible, facilely tunable and user&#8208;friendly chiral indenyl ligands featuring a [2.2]benzoindenophane skeleton via a divergent synthesis strategy. The corresponding chiral indenyl rhodium catalysts were successfully applied in the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation reaction of O&#8208;Boc hydroxybenzamide with alkenes to give various chiral dihydroisoquinolone products (up to 97&#8201;% yield, up to 98&#8201;% ee). Moreover, the asymmetric C&#8722;H activation reaction of carboxylic acids with alkynes was also successfully accomplished, providing a range of axially chiral isocoumarins (up to 99&#8201;% yield, up to 94&#8201;% ee). Notably, this represents the first example of enantioselective transition metal catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H activation/oxidative coupling of benzoic acids with internal alkynes to construct isocoumarins. Given many attractive features of this class of indenyl ligands, such as convenient synthesis, high tunability and exclusive face&#8208;selectivity of coordination, its applications in more catalytic asymmetric C&#8722;H activation and in other asymmetric catalysis are foreseen.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Based Multimeric Aptamer Generation and Bio&#8208;Functionalization for Electrochemical Biosensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel surface&#8208;based room temperature rolling circle amplification (RCA) method for multimeric aptamer generation alongside relevant surface bio&#8208;functionalization were employed on nano&#8208;/microislands (NMIs) working electrodes (WEs) for developing highly sensitive and selective NMIs multimeric aptasensors.







Abstract
Multimeric aptamers have gained more attention than their monomeric counterparts due to providing more binding sites for target analytes, leading to increased affinity. This work attempted to engineer the surface&#8208;based generation of multimeric aptamers by employing the room temperature rolling circle amplification (RCA) technique and chemically modified primers for developing a highly sensitive and selective electrochemical aptasensor. The multimeric aptamers, generated through surface RCA, are hybridized to modified spacer primers, facilitating the positioning of the aptamers in the proximity of sensing surfaces. These multimeric aptamers can be used as bio&#8208;receptors for capturing specific targets. The surface amplification process was fully characterized, and the optimal amplification time for biosensing purposes was determined, using SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein (SP). Interestingly, multimeric aptasensors produced considerably higher response signals and affinity (more than 10&#8208;fold), as well as higher sensitivity (almost 4&#8208;fold) compared to monomeric aptasensors. Furthermore, the impact of surface structures on the response signals was studied by utilizing both flat working electrodes (WEs) and nano&#8208;/microislands (NMIs) WEs. The NMIs multimeric aptasensors showed significantly higher sensitivity in buffer and saliva media with the limit of detection less than 2&#8197;fg/ml. Finally, the developed NMIs multimeric aptasensors were clinically challenged with several saliva patient samples.

         <title>Redox Engineering of Myoglobin by Cofactor Substitution to Enhance Cyclopropanation Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;diverse myoglobins containing four different cofactors with different redox potentials (&#8722;198 to +147&#8197;mV vs. NHE) were studied as catalysts for alkene cyclopropanation through carbene transfer. Myoglobin with a positive redox potential is highly reactive for electron&#8208;deficient alkenes, such as 1&#8208;octene. In contrast, myoglobin with a negative redox potential accelerates the formation of a detectable carbene intermediate.







Abstract
Design of metal cofactor ligands is essential for controlling the reactivity of metalloenzymes. We investigated a carbene transfer reaction catalyzed by myoglobins containing iron porphyrin cofactors with one and two trifluoromethyl groups at peripheral sites (FePorCF3 and FePor(CF3)2, respectively), native heme and iron porphycene (FePc). These four myoglobins show a wide range of Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox potentials in the protein of +147&#8197;mV, +87&#8197;mV, +42&#8197;mV and &#8722;198&#8197;mV vs. NHE, respectively. Myoglobin reconstituted with FePor(CF3)2 has a more positive potential, which enhances the reactivity of a carbene intermediate with alkenes, and demonstrates superior cyclopropanation of inert alkenes, such as aliphatic and internal alkenes. In contrast, engineered myoglobin reconstituted with FePc has a more negative redox potential, which accelerates the formation of the intermediate, but has low reactivity for inert alkenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that myoglobin with FePor(CF3)2 generates an undetectable active intermediate with a radical character. In contrast, this reaction catalyzed by myoglobin with FePc includes a detectable iron&#8211;carbene species with electrophilic character. This finding highlights the importance of redox&#8208;focused design of the iron porphyrinoid cofactor in hemoproteins to tune the reactivity of the carbene transfer reaction.

&lt;p&gt;Design of metal cofactor ligands is essential for controlling the reactivity of metalloenzymes. We investigated a carbene transfer reaction catalyzed by myoglobins containing iron porphyrin cofactors with one and two trifluoromethyl groups at peripheral sites (FePorCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and FePor(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively), native heme and iron porphycene (FePc). These four myoglobins show a wide range of Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox potentials in the protein of +147&#8197;mV, +87&#8197;mV, +42&#8197;mV and &#8722;198&#8197;mV vs. NHE, respectively. Myoglobin reconstituted with FePor(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a more positive potential, which enhances the reactivity of a carbene intermediate with alkenes, and demonstrates superior cyclopropanation of inert alkenes, such as aliphatic and internal alkenes. In contrast, engineered myoglobin reconstituted with FePc has a more negative redox potential, which accelerates the formation of the intermediate, but has low reactivity for inert alkenes. Mechanistic studies indicate that myoglobin with FePor(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generates an undetectable active intermediate with a radical character. In contrast, this reaction catalyzed by myoglobin with FePc includes a detectable iron&#8211;carbene species with electrophilic character. This finding highlights the importance of redox-focused design of the iron porphyrinoid cofactor in hemoproteins to tune the reactivity of the carbene transfer reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Pseudo&#8208;Natural Product Tafbromin Selectively Targets the TAF1 Bromodomain 2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;g]quinolone pseudo&#8208;natural product Tafbromin was identified as an inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling&#8208;induced osteogenesis. Tafbromin binds to the second bromodomain of the TATA&#8208;box binding protein&#8208;associated factor 1 (TAF1) with high selectivity over other bromodomains and suppresses the expression of Hedgehog target genes and alkaline phosphatase.







Abstract
Phenotypic assays detect small&#8208;molecule bioactivity at functionally relevant cellular sites, and inherently cover a variety of targets and mechanisms of action. They can uncover new small molecule&#8208;target pairs and may give rise to novel biological insights. By means of an osteoblast differentiation assay which employs a Hedgehog (Hh) signaling agonist as stimulus and which monitors an endogenous marker for osteoblasts, we identified a pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;g]quinoline (PQ) pseudo&#8208;natural product (PNP) class of osteogenesis inhibitors. The most potent PQ, termed Tafbromin, impairs canonical Hh signaling and modulates osteoblast differentiation through binding to the bromodomain 2 of the TATA&#8208;box binding protein&#8208;associated factor 1 (TAF1). Tafbromin is the most selective TAF1 bromodomain 2 ligand and promises to be an invaluable tool for the study of biological processes mediated by TAF1(2) bromodomains.

         <title>Creating High&#8208;entropy Single Atoms on Transition Disulfides through Substrate&#8208;induced Redox Dynamics for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we present a substrate&#8208;mediated SAs formation strategy to successfully fabricate a library of multimetallic SAs and HESAs on MoS2 and MoSe2 supports. The optimized HESAs&#8208;TMDs (Pt,Ru,Rh,Pd,Re&#8208;MoSe2) delivers a much higher activity and durability than state of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt during the HER.







Abstract
The controllable anchoring of multiple metal single&#8208;atoms (SAs) into a single support exhibits scientific and technological opportunities, while marrying the concentration&#8208;complex multimetallic SAs and high&#8208;entropy SAs (HESAs) into one SAC system remains a substantial challenge. Here, we present a substrate&#8208;mediated SAs formation strategy to successfully fabricate a library of multimetallic SAs and HESAs on MoS2 and MoSe2 supports, which can precisely control the doping location of SAs. Specially, the contents of SAs can continuously increase until the accessible Mo atoms on TMDs carriers are completely replaced by SAs, thus allowing the of much higher metal contents. In&#8208;depth mechanistic study shows that the well&#8208;controlled synthesis of multimetallic SAs and HESAs is realized by controlling the reversible redox reaction occurred on the TMDs/TM ion interface. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, a variety of SAs&#8208;TMDs were applied to hydrogen evolution reaction. The optimized HESAs&#8208;TMDs (Pt,Ru,Rh,Pd,Re&#8208;MoSe2) delivers a much higher activity and durability than state of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt. Thus, our work will broaden the family of single&#8208;atom catalysts and provide a new guideline for the rational design of high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkylation/Ring Opening with Vinylbenzofurans Enabled by Triazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented C(sp2)&#8722;O scission enabled annulations of 2&#8208;vinylbenzofurans through a versatile C&#8722;H/C&#8722;O/N&#8722;H functionalization cascade. This reaction was achieved using a peptide&#8208;isosteric triazole and an inexpensive, non&#8208;toxic iron catalyst.







Abstract
We report an unprecedented iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H annulation using readily available 2&#8208;vinylbenzofurans as the reaction pattern. The redox&#8208;neutral strategy, based on cheap, non&#8208;toxic, and earth&#8208;abundant iron catalysts, exploits triazole assistance to promote a cascade C&#8722;H alkylation, benzofuran ring&#8208;opening and insertion into a Fe&#8722;N bond, to form highly functionalized isoquinolones. Detailed mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations fully disclosed the manifold of the iron catalysis.

A Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with ynamides was developed, enabling access to a variety of polysubstituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexenes in good to excellent yields. The prepared products serve as valuable precursors for the synthesis of novel and functionally diverse bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, showcasing their potential utility in other fields.







Abstract
Synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has gained significant attention in drug discovery due to their potential to mimic benzene bioisosteres. Here, we present a mild and scalable Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) with ynamides, yielding a diverse array of polysubstituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;bicyclo[2.1.1]hexenes in good to excellent yields. These products offer valuable starting materials for the construction of novel functionalized bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction involves a nucleophilic addition of ynamides to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, followed by an intramolecular cyclization of in situ generated enolate and keteniminium ion. We expect that these findings will encourage utilization of complex bioisosteres and foster further investigation into BCB&#8208;based cycloaddition chemistry.

         <title>Aromatic 1,4,2,3&#8208;Diazadiborole Featuring an Unsymmetrical B=B Entity: A Versatile Synthon for Unusual Boron Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unveils a 6&#960;&#8208;aromatic 1,4,2,3&#8208;diazadiborole, a BN analogue of cyclopentadienide. Featuring an unsymmetrical B=B entity, this species readily undergoes redox, insertion, addition, and cycloaddition reactions for the synthesis of unusual boron heterocycles. The ring retention, cleavage/recombination, annulation, and expansion have been witnessed during these transformations.







Abstract
The replacement of a CC unit with an isoelectronic BN unit in aromatic systems can give rise to molecules and materials with fascinating properties. We report here the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of a 1,4,2,3&#8208;diazadiborole species, 2, featuring an unprecedented 6&#960;&#8208;aromatic BN&#8208;heterocyclic moiety that is isoelectronic to cyclopentadienide (Cp&#8722;). Bearing an unsymmetrical B=B entity, 2 exhibits reactivity toward oxidants, protic reagents, electrophiles, and unsaturated substrates. This reactivity facilitates the synthesis of a variety of novel mono&#8208; and bicyclic organoboron derivatives through mechanisms including ring retention, cleavage/recombination, annulation, and expansion. These findings reveal innovative synthetic routes to BN&#8208;embedded aromatic compounds via desymmetrization, affording unique building blocks for synthetic chemistry.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The replacement of a CC unit with an isoelectronic BN unit in aromatic systems can give rise to molecules and materials with fascinating properties. We report here the synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of a 1,4,2,3-diazadiborole species, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, featuring an unprecedented 6&#960;-aromatic BN-heterocyclic moiety that is isoelectronic to cyclopentadienide (Cp&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). Bearing an unsymmetrical B=B entity, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; exhibits reactivity toward oxidants, protic reagents, electrophiles, and unsaturated substrates. This reactivity facilitates the synthesis of a variety of novel mono- and bicyclic organoboron derivatives through mechanisms including ring retention, cleavage/recombination, annulation, and expansion. These findings reveal innovative synthetic routes to BN-embedded aromatic compounds via desymmetrization, affording unique building blocks for synthetic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The formation of phosphorus&#8208;rich alanes featuring butterfly&#8208;like geometries is achieved. The two&#8208;electron reduction products feature a unique P42&#8722; structure and can act as a source of P3&#8722;. The treatment of these phosphorus containing products with electrophiles under mild conditions results in the formation of different phosphines. This approach eliminates the need for high temperatures and/or high pressures, which are commonly required in industrial processes for the preparation of useful phosphines.The activation and further functionalization of white phosphorus (P4) by main group complexes has become an increasingly studied topic in recent times. Herein, we report the controlled formation of phosphorus&#8208;rich alanes featuring butterfly&#8208;like geometries from the selective reaction of P4 with dialumenes, ([L(IiPr)Al]2) (1: L=Tripp=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2; 2: L=tBu2MeSi; IiPr=[MeCN(iPr)]2C)). The two&#8208;electron&#8208;reduction product of P4 features a P42&#8722; structure and is shown to be able to act as a source of P3&#8722;. Treatments of different electrophiles (e.g., chlorotrimethylsilane (Me3SiCl), iodotrimethylsilane (Me3SiI), HCl, or acetyl chloride (CH3COCl)) with these alanes under mild conditions gave the corresponding phosphines (e.g., P(SiMe3)3, PH3, or P(COCH3)3).

         <title>Lattice Oxygen Activation through Deep Oxidation of Co4N by Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8211;Active Dopants for Improved Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We inserted Mn dopants in Co4N, to promote the formation of high&#8208;valence Co4+ during the pre&#8208;catalyst activation process. The energy barrier of phase transformation from CoOOH to CoO2 was lowered by introducing J&#8211;T active Mn3+ cations, because the violent distortion of the Mn3+ (t32ge1g)&#8208;centered octahedra MnO6 reduces the structural stability, and facilitates the H desorption. The consistent relationship between the J&#8211;T dopants and the deep&#8208;oxidation process is proved, and this concept can be extended to other elements. Moreover, the lattice oxygen in Mn doped CoO2 (Mn&#8208;CoO2) is activated to participate in the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Triggering the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is crucial for improving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, because it could bypass the scaling relation limitation associated with the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism through the direct formation of oxygen&#8211;oxygen bond. High&#8208;valence transition metal sites are favorable for activating the lattice oxygen, but the deep oxidation of pre&#8208;catalysts suffers from a high thermodynamic barrier. Here, taking advantage of the Jahn&#8211;Teller (J&#8211;T) distortion induced structural instability, we incorporate high&#8208;spin Mn3+ (

) dopant into Co4N. Mn dopants enable a surface structural transformation from Co4N to CoOOH, and finally to CoO2, as observed by various in situ spectroscopic investigations. Furthermore, the reconstructed surface on Mn&#8208;doped Co4N triggers the lattice oxygen activation, as evidenced experimentally by pH&#8208;dependent OER, tetramethylammonium cation adsorption and online electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements of 18O&#8208;labelled catalysts. In general, this work not only offers the introducing J&#8211;T effect approach to regulate the structural transition, but also provides an understanding about the influence of the catalyst's electronic configuration on determining the reaction route, which may inspire the design of more efficient catalysts with activated lattice oxygen.

We present Ba3[PN3]O, containing the first [PN3]4&#8722; anion. Starting from commercial availably starting materials, we successfully synthesized this compound by a medium pressure reaction using the hot isostatic press. The crystal structure was elucidated by combination of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, SEM&#8208;EDX, LCC and MAS NMR, whereby the unambiguous assignment of O/N was verified successfully.







Abstract
Nitridophosphates, with their primary structural motif of isolated or condensed PN4 tetrahedra, meet many requirements for high performance materials. Their properties are associated with their structural diversity, which is mainly limited by this specific building block. Herein, we present the alkaline earth metal nitridophosphate oxide Ba3[PN3]O featuring a trigonal planar [PN3]4&#8722; anion. Ba3[PN3]O was obtained using a hot isostatic press by medium&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature synthesis (MP/HT) at 200&#8197;MPa and 880&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Exfoliatable Layered 2D Honeycomb Crystals of Host&#8208;guest Complexes Networked by CH&#8208;&#960; Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dedicated to Professor Iwao Ojiama on the occasion of his 80th birthdayA cylindrical molecule with D3&#8208;symmetry was found to serve as versatile vertices to form 2&#8208;dimensional, honeycomb networks of host&#8211;guest complexes. Varying the structural elements of the layered systems enabled a wide range of structural combinations to become accessible.







Abstract
Studies of graphene show that robust chemical bonds such as covalent bonds with trigonal&#8208;planar atoms afford layered atomic 2D crystals possessing unique properties. Although layered molecular crystals are of interest to diversify elements and structures of 2D materials, the structural diversity of molecules as well as weak intermolecular interactions inevitably makes the design to be one&#8208;off and individual. We herein report a versatile method to assemble layered molecular crystals. By developing a D3&#8208;symmetry host at vertices to form a honeycomb layer, a diverse range of layered 2D host&#8211;guest crystals were obtained. Substituents on the host, elements/structures of the guest, the stereochemistry of the host and types of intercalants were diversified, which should allow for 6&#215;32&#215;3&#215;2 combinations for structural diversification.

Although layered molecular crystals are of interest to diversify elements and structures of 2D materials, the structural diversity of molecules as well as weak intermolecular interactions inevitably makes the design to be one-off and individual. We herein report a versatile method to assemble layered molecular crystals. By developing a &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetry host at vertices to form a honeycomb layer, a diverse range of layered 2D host&#8211;guest crystals were obtained. Substituents on the host, elements/structures of the guest, the stereochemistry of the host and types of intercalants were diversified, which should allow for 6&#215;32&#215;3&#215;2 combinations for structural diversification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Management of Triplet States in Modified Mononuclear Ruthenium(II) Complexes for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to considerably prolong the triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime by decorating a Ru(II) phosphine complex (RuP&#8208;1) with pendent polyaromatic hydrocarbons to transition their excited state from 3MLCT to 3IL, is presented. RuP&#8208;4 catalyzes CO2 photoreduction to CO with unprecedented performance without additional photosensitizers.







Abstract
Controlling the interplay between relaxation and charge/energy transfer processes in the excited states of photocatalysts is crucial for the performance of artificial photosynthesis. Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer triplet states (3MLCT*) of ruthenium(II) complexes are broadly implemented for photocatalysis, but an effective means of managing the triplets for enhanced photocatalysis has been lacking. Herein, We proposed a strategy to considerably prolong the triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime by decorating a ruthenium(II) phosphine complex (RuP&#8208;1) with pendent polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Systematic studies demonstrate that in RuP&#8208;4 decorated with anthracene, sub&#8208;picosecond electron transfer from anthracene to 3MLCT* leads to a charge&#8208;separated state that can mediate the formation of the intra&#8208;ligand triplet state (3IL) of anthracene, resulting in an exceptionally long excited&#8208;state up to several milliseconds. This triplet management strategy enables impressive photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO with a turnover number (TON) of 404, an optimized quantum yield of 43&#8201;% and 100&#8201;% selectivity, which is the highest reported performance for mononuclear photocatalysts without additional photosensitizers. RuP&#8208;4 also catalyzes photochemical hydrogen generation under argon. This work opens up an avenue for regulating the excited&#8208;state charge/energy flow for the development of long&#8208;lived 3IL multi&#8208;functional mononuclear photocatalysts to boost artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Approaching Sustainable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries through Voltage&#8208;Responsive Smart Prelithiation Separator with Surface&#8208;Engineered Sacrificial Lithium Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart lithium compensation strategy by introducing voltage&#8208;responsive prelithiation separator can staged release active lithium, regenerating spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries and extending their life. The separator's ability to absorb excess lithium below operating voltage protects the cathode from electrochemical failure or short circuit, enhancing safety and sustainability.







Abstract
The surge in lithium&#8208;ion batteries has heightened concerns regarding metal resource depletion and the environmental impact of spent batteries. Battery recycling has become paramount globally, but conventional techniques, while effective at extracting transition metals like cobalt and nickel from cathodes, often overlook widely used spent LiFePO4 due to its abundant and low&#8208;cost iron content. Direct regeneration, a promising approach for restoring deteriorated cathodes, is hindered by practicality and cost issues despite successful methods like solid&#8208;state sintering. Hence, a smart prelithiation separator based on surface&#8208;engineered sacrificial lithium agents is proposed. Benefiting from the synergistic anionic and cationic redox, the prelithiation separator can intelligently release or intake active lithium via voltage regulation. The staged lithium replenishment strategy was implemented, successfully restoring spent LiFePO4&#8217;s capacity to 163.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a doubled life. Simultaneously, the separator can absorb excess active lithium up to approximately 600&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 below 2.5&#8197;V to prevent over&#8208;lithiation of the cathode This innovative, straightforward, and cost&#8208;effective strategy paves the way for the direct regeneration of spent batteries, expanding the possibilities in the realm of lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.

         <title>Vapor/Vapor&#8208;Solid Interfacial Growth of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes on Alumina Hollow Fiber for Advanced Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through vapor/vapor&#8208;solid (V/V&#8722;S) interfacial method, in which vapor&#8208;phase monomers were introduced onto polydopamine(PDA)&#8208;modified alumina at 170&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;atm within 8&#8197;h, ultrathin crystalline TpPa&#8208;1 membranes were successfully grown on the inner lumen surface of alumina hollow fibers substrate. The resulting filtration module exhibits exceptional stability and performance in continuous inside&#8208;out cross&#8208;flow organic solvent nanofiltration.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), known for their chemical stability and porous crystalline structure, hold promises as advanced separation membranes. However, fabricating high&#8208;quality COF membranes, particularly on industrial&#8208;preferred hollow fiber substrates, remains challenging. This study introduces a novel vapor/vapor&#8208;solid (V/V&#8722;S) method for growing ultrathin crystalline TpPa&#8208;1 COF membranes on the inner lumen surface of alumina hollow fibers (TpPa&#8208;1/Alumina). Through vapor&#8208;phase monomer introduction onto polydopamine&#8208;modified alumina at 170&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;atm, efficient polymerization and crystallization occur at the confined V&#8722;S interface. This enables one&#8208;step growth within 8&#8197;h, producing 100&#8197;nm thick COF membranes with strong substrate adhesion. TpPa&#8208;1/Alumina exhibits exceptional stability and performance over 80&#8197;h in continuous cross&#8208;flow organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN), with methanol permeance of about 200&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;bar&#8722;1 and dye rejection with molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of approximately 700&#8197;Da. Moreover, the versatile V/V&#8722;S method synthesizes two additional COF membranes (TpPa2Cl/Alumina and TpHz/Alumina) with different pore sizes and chemical environments. Adjusting the COF membrane thickness between 100&#8211;500&#8197;nm is achievable easily by varying the growth cycle numbers. Notably, TpPa2Cl/Alumina demonstrates excellent OSN performance in separating the model active pharmaceutical ingredient glycyrrhizic acid (GA) from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), highlighting the method's potential for large&#8208;scale industrial applications.

         <title>New Lead&#8208;free Hybrid Layered Double Perovskite Halides: Synthesis, Structural Transition and Ultralow Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new hybrid layered double perovskites (HLDPs) have been synthesized by variations of trivalent metal centers in the inorganic layer as well as modifications in the organic spacers. All the HLDPs display ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (kL) with notable anisotropy in&#160;kL&#160;observed for RP&#8208;HLDP (3N&#8208;CuIn) when&#160;measured parallel and perpendicular&#160;to layer stacking.







Abstract
Hybrid layered double perovskites (HLDPs), representing the two&#8208;dimensional manifestation of halide double perovskites, have elicited considerable interest owing to their intricate chemical bonding hierarchy and structural diversity. This intensified interest stems from the diverse options available for selecting alternating octahedral coordinated trivalent [M(III)] and monovalent metal centers [M(I)], along with the distinctive nature of the cationic organic amine located between the layers. Here, we have synthesized three new compounds with general formula (R&#8242;/R&#8242;&#8242;)4/2M(III)M(I)Cl8; where R&#8242;=C3H7NH3 (i.e. 3N) and R&#8242;&#8242;=NH3C4H8NH3 (i.e. 4N4); M(III)=In3+ or Ru3+; M(I)=Cu+ by simple solution&#8208;based acid precipitation method. The structural analysis reveals that (4N4)2CuInCl8 and (4N4)2CuRuCl8 adopt the layered Dion Jacobson (DJ) structure, whereas (3N)4CuInCl8 exhibits layered Ruddlesden Popper (RP) structure. The alternative octahedra within the inorganic layer display distortions and tilting. Three compounds show temperature&#8208;dependent structural phase transitions where changes in the staking of inorganic layer, extent of octahedral tilting and reorientation of organic spacers with temperature have been noticed. We have achieved ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;L) in the HLDPs in the 2 to 300&#8197;K range, marking a distinctive feature within the realm of HLDP systems. The RP&#8208;HLDP compound, (3N)4CuInCl8, demonstrates anisotropy in &#954;L while measured parallel and perpendicular to layer stacking, showcasing ultralow &#954;L of 0.15 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1 at room temperature, which is one of the lowest values obtained among Pb&#8208;free metal halide perovskite. The observed ultralow &#954;L in three new HLDPs is attributed to significant lattice anharmonicity arising from the chemical bonding heterogeneity and soft crystal structure, which resulted in low&#8208;energy localized optical phonon modes that suppress heat&#8208;carrying acoustic phonons.

The structural analysis reveals that (4N4)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuInCl&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and (4N4)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuRuCl&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; adopt the layered Dion Jacobson (DJ) structure, whereas (3N)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;CuInCl&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits layered Ruddlesden Popper (RP) structure. The alternative octahedra within the inorganic layer display distortions and tilting. Three compounds show temperature-dependent structural phase transitions where changes in the staking of inorganic layer, extent of octahedral tilting and reorientation of organic spacers with temperature have been noticed. We have achieved ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) in the HLDPs in the 2 to 300&#8197;K range, marking a distinctive feature within the realm of HLDP systems. The RP-HLDP compound, (3N)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;CuInCl&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, demonstrates anisotropy in &#954;&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; while measured parallel and perpendicular to layer stacking, showcasing ultralow &#954;&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.15 Wm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature, which is one of the lowest values obtained among Pb-free metal halide perovskite. The observed ultralow &#954;&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; in three new HLDPs is attributed to significant lattice anharmonicity arising from the chemical bonding heterogeneity and soft crystal structure, which resulted in low-energy localized optical phonon modes that suppress heat-carrying acoustic phonons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Organophosphorescence Probe with Ultralong Lifetime and Intrinsic Tissue Selectivity for Specific Tumor Imaging and Guided Tumor Surgery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically compared the influence of phosphorescence emission intensity, lifetime, and wavelength on bioimaging performance, demonstrating that the phosphorescence lifetime is the primary factor. Importantly, the inherent ability of Fe ions to quench the phosphorescence of organic phosphorescent materials was verified. Finally, phosphorescent materials were designed for the specific imaging of liver tumors.







Abstract
Organic phosphorescent materials are excellent candidates for use in tumor imaging. However, a systematic comparison of the effects of the intensity, lifetime, and wavelength of phosphorescent emissions on bioimaging performance has not yet been undertaken. In addition, there have been few reports on organic phosphorescent materials that specifically distinguish tumors from normal tissues. This study addresses these gaps and reveals that longer lifetimes effectively increase the signal intensity, whereas longer wavelengths enhance the penetration depth. Conversely, a strong emission intensity with a short lifetime does not necessarily yield robust imaging signals. Building upon these findings, an organo&#8208;phosphorescent material with a lifetime of 0.94&#8197;s was designed for tumor imaging. Remarkably, the phosphorescent signals of various organic nanoparticles are nearly extinguished in blood&#8208;rich organs because of the quenching effect of iron ions. Moreover, for the first time, we demonstrated that iron ions universally quench the phosphorescence of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials, which is an inherent property of such substances. Leveraging this property, both the normal liver and hepatitis tissues exhibit negligible phosphorescent signals, whereas liver tumors display intense phosphorescence. Therefore, phosphorescent materials, unlike chemiluminescent or fluorescent materials, can exploit this unique inherent property to selectively distinguish liver tumor tissues from normal tissues without additional modifications or treatments.

Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) system ([12]CPP&#8208;8TPAOMe) based on cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) grafted with eight di(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino groups (TPAOMe) as donors. Compared to [12]CPP, D&#8722;A nanohoop exhibited significant changes in physical properties, including a large redshift (&gt;78&#8197;nm) in the fluorescence spectrum and novel positive solvatofluorochromic properties with a maximum peak ranging from 484&#8197;nm to 546&#8197;nm. The potential applications of [12]CPP&#8208;8TPAOMe in electron&#8208; and hole&#8208;transport devices were further investigated, and its bipolar behavior as a charge transport active layer was clearly observed.

         <title>Tetraborated Intrinsically Axial Chiral Multi&#8208;resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using conjugation&#8208;extended bidibenzo[b,d]furan/bidibenzo[b,d]thiophene moieties, two pairs of tetraborated chiral multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence enantiomers have been synthesized that show good photophysical and chiroptical properties. The sulfur atoms accelerate the reverse intersystem crossing process. The circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 30.1&#8201;% with dissymmetry factors of 0.59/1.2&#215;10&#8722;3.







Abstract
Chiral multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF) materials hold promise for circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) and 3D displays. Herein, we present two pairs of tetraborated intrinsically axial CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF materials, R/S&#8208;BDBF&#8208;BOH and R/S&#8208;BDBT&#8208;BOH, with conjugation&#8208;extended bidibenzo[b,d]furan and bidibenzo[b,d]thiophene as chiral sources, which effectively participate in the distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals. Due to the heavy&#8208;atom effect, sulfur atoms are introduced to accelerate the reverse intersystem crossing process and increase the efficiency of molecules. R/S&#8208;BDBF&#8208;BOH and R/S&#8208;BDBT&#8208;BOH manifest ultra&#8208;pure blue emission with a maximum at 458/459&#8197;nm with a full width at half maximum of 27&#8197;nm, photoluminescence quantum yields of 90&#8201;%/91&#8201;%, and dissymmetry factors (|gPL|) of 6.8&#215;10&#8722;4/8.5&#215;10&#8722;4, respectively. Correspondingly, the CP&#8208;OLEDs exhibit good performances with an external quantum efficiency of 30.1&#8201;% and |gEL| factors of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;3.

         <title>A Highly Reversible Sn&#8208;Air Battery Possessing the Ultra&#8208;Low Charging Potential with the Assistance of Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rechargeable Sn&#8208;air battery using Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti multi&#8208;functional catalytic cathode is proposed for the first time. Due to the heterogeneous Fe2O3@TiO2&#8208;induced high photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;catalytic performances, the corresponding Sn&#8208;air battery has achieved the ultra&#8208;low charge/discharge overpotential of ~40&#8197;mV and stably cycled for 160&#8197;hours under irradiation.







Abstract
Aqueous Sn&#8208;air batteries are attracting a great deal of interest in recent years due to the ultra&#8208;high safety, low cost, dendrite&#8208;free and highly reversible Sn anode. However, the slurry oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics on the air cathodes seriously affect the Sn&#8208;air battery performances. Although various advanced catalysts have been developed, the charge overpotentials (~1000&#8197;mV) of these Sn&#8208;air batteries are still not satisfactory. Herein, iron oxide (Fe2O3) modified titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorods with heterogeneous structure are firstly synthesized on Ti mesh (Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti), and the obtained Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti films are further applied as catalytic electrodes for Sn&#8208;air batteries. The core&#8211;shell heterogeneous structure of Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can effectively facilitate the conversion of electrochemical intermediates and separation of photo&#8208;excited electrons and holes to activate oxygen&#8208;related reaction processes. Density functional theory (DFT) and experimental results also confirm that Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can not only act as the electrocatalysts to improve ORR/OER properties, but also exhibit the superior photo&#8208;catalytic activity to promote charging kinetics. Hence, the Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti&#8208;based Sn&#8208;air batteries show ultra&#8208;low overpotential of ~40&#8197;mV, excellent rate capability and good cycling stability under light irradiation. This work will shed light on rational photo&#8208;assisted catalytic cathode design for new&#8208;type metal&#8208;air batteries.

Herein, iron oxide (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) modified titanium dioxide (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) nanorods with heterogeneous structure are firstly synthesized on Ti mesh (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti), and the obtained Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti films are further applied as catalytic electrodes for Sn-air batteries. The core&#8211;shell heterogeneous structure of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti can effectively facilitate the conversion of electrochemical intermediates and separation of photo-excited electrons and holes to activate oxygen-related reaction processes. Density functional theory (DFT) and experimental results also confirm that Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti can not only act as the electrocatalysts to improve ORR/OER properties, but also exhibit the superior photo-catalytic activity to promote charging kinetics. Hence, the Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti-based Sn-air batteries show ultra-low overpotential of ~40&#8197;mV, excellent rate capability and good cycling stability under light irradiation. This work will shed light on rational photo-assisted catalytic cathode design for new-type metal-air batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>pH&#8208;Universal Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction with Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density on Doping&#8208;Engineered Bismuth Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The S&#8208;doped metallic Bi catalyst was formed by the electrochemical reconstruction of Bi2S3, which delivers outstanding performance in converting CO2 to formate/formic acid across a range of pH conditions. The simultaneous production of formate on both cathode and anode was also achieved by coupling CO2 reduction reaction with glycerol oxidation reaction.







Abstract
The practical application of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to form formic acid fuel is hindered by the limited activation of CO2 molecules and the lack of universal feasibility across different pH levels. Herein, we report a doping&#8208;engineered bismuth sulfide pre&#8208;catalyst (BiS&#8208;1) that S is partially retained after electrochemical reconstruction into metallic Bi for CO2RR to formate/formic acid with ultrahigh performance across a wide pH range. The best BiS&#8208;1 maintains a Faraday efficiency (FE) of ~95&#8201;% at 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell under neutral and alkaline solutions. Furthermore, the BiS&#8208;1 catalyst shows unprecedentedly high FE (~95&#8201;%) with current densities from 100 to 1300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under acidic solutions. Notably, the current density can reach 700&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 while maintaining a FE of above 90&#8201;% in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer and operate stably for 150&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ spectra and density functional theory calculations reveals that the S doping modulates the electronic structure of Bi and effectively promotes the formation of the HCOO* intermediate for formate/formic acid generation. This work develops the efficient and stable electrocatalysts for sustainable formate/formic acid production.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Mechanistic Depiction of Photoinduced CO2 Reduction Catalysis on a Urea&#8208;Modified Iron Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pump&#8208;pump excitation strategy induces effective accumulation of charge on an FeIII&#8208;based urea&#8208;modified porphyrin as the fates of the photogenerated species are tracked through their optical transient absorption signatures. In the presence of CO2 as a substrate and H2O as a proton source, the two&#8208;electron accumulated species leads to CO2 activation and reduction, generating FeII&#8208;CO as a stable intermediate in the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The development of functional artificial photosynthetic devices relies on the understanding of mechanistic aspects involved in specialized photocatalysts. Modified iron porphyrins have long been explored as efficient catalysts for the light&#8208;induced reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) towards solar fuels. In spite of the advancements in homogeneous catalysis, the development of the next generation of catalysts requires a complete understanding of the fundamental photoinduced processes taking place prior to and after activation of the substrate by the catalyst. In this work, we employ a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nanosecond optical transient absorption spectroscopic setup with a double excitation capability to induce charge accumulation and trigger the reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO). Our biomimetic system is composed of a urea&#8208;modified iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin (UrFeIII) catalyst, the prototypical [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) used as a photosensitizer, and sodium ascorbate as an electron donor. Under inert atmosphere, we show that two electrons can be successively accumulated on the catalyst as the fates of the photogenerated UrFeII and UrFeI reduced species are tracked. In the presence of CO2, the catalytic cycle is kick&#8208;started providing further evidence on CO2 activation by the UrFe catalyst in its formal FeI oxidation state.

         <title>In Situ Transformation of an Amorphous Supramolecular Coating to a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Membrane to Trigger Selective Gas Permeation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;solution&#8208;processing&#8208;transformation&#8221; strategy has been used for fabricating high&#8208;quality hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) membranes for gas separation. The methanol scaffolds contribute in two ways: methanol&#8208;activated monomer dissolution facilitates equilibrium shifts, and methanol&#8208;guided hydrogen bonding stabilizes the monomer in a thermodynamically favored state. As a result, these HOF membranes display improved hydrogen separation performance.







Abstract
We introduce a &#8220;solution&#8208;processing&#8208;transformation&#8221; strategy, deploying solvent vapor as scaffolds, to fabricate high&#8208;quality hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) membranes. This strategy can overcome the mismatch in processing conditions and crystal growth thermodynamics faced during the facile solution processing of the membrane. The procedure includes the vapor&#8208;trigged in situ transformation of dense amorphous supramolecules to crystalline HOF&#8208;16, with HOF&#8208;11 as the transient state. The mechanism involves a vapor&#8208;activated dissolution&#8208;precipitation equilibrium shifting and hydrogen bonding&#8208;guided molecule rearrangement, elucidated through combined experimental and theoretical analysis. Upon removal of the molecular scaffolds, the resulting HOF&#8208;16 membranes showcase significant improvement in hydrogen separation performance over their amorphous counterparts and previously reported HOF membranes. The method's broad applicability is evidenced by successfully extending it to other substrates and HOF structures. This study provides a fundamental understanding of guest&#8208;induced ordered supramolecular assembly and paves the way for the advanced manufacture of high&#8208;performance HOF membranes for gas separation processes.

         <title>Unraveling the Intertwining Factors Underlying the Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two closely related yet distinctly different heterometallic 3d&#8211;4f clusters, featuring respectively a 96&#8208;metal (Dy52Ni44) and a 188&#8208;metal (Dy112Ni76) core built of multi&#8208;shells of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, were obtained by the controlled co&#8208;hydrolysis of Dy3+ and Ni2+. Comparative experiments under systematically altered conditions were performed to unravel the intertwining factors, including the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;facilitating base, the reaction temperature, and the reaction duration.







Abstract
Two closely related yet distinctly different cationic clusters, [Dy52Ni44(HEIDA)36(OH)138(OAc)24(H2O)30]10+ (1) and [Dy112Ni76(HEIDA)44(EIDA)24(IDA)4(OH)268(OAc)48(H2O)44]4+ (2) (HEIDA=N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)iminodiacetate), each featuring a multi&#8208;shell core of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, were obtained. Depending on the specific conditions used for the co&#8208;hydrolysis of Dy3+ and Ni2+, the product can be crystallized out as one particular type of cluster or as a mixture of 1 and 2. How the reaction process was affected by the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;facilitating base and/or by the reaction temperature and duration was investigated. It has been found that a reaction at a high temperature and/or for an extended period favors the formation of the compact and thermodynamically more stable 1, while a brief reaction with a large amount of the base is good for the kinetic product 2. By tuning these intertwining conditions, the reaction can be regulated toward a particular product.

Depending on the specific conditions used for the co-hydrolysis of Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, the product can be crystallized out as one particular type of cluster or as a mixture of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. How the reaction process was affected by the amount of hydrolysis-facilitating base and/or by the reaction temperature and duration was investigated. It has been found that a reaction at a high temperature and/or for an extended period favors the formation of the compact and thermodynamically more stable &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, while a brief reaction with a large amount of the base is good for the kinetic product &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. By tuning these intertwining conditions, the reaction can be regulated toward a particular product.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox Synergy: Enhancing Gas Sensing Stability in 2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via Balancing Metal Node and Ligand Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox innocent zinc metal center&#8208;based 2D c&#8208;MOF, Zn3(HHTQ)2, with ligand&#8208;centered sensing active sites has been developed for NO2 sensing, which demonstrates excellent cycling stability and high selectivity without compromising the coordination bonds.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising candidates in gas sensing, owing to their tunable porous structure and conductivity. Nevertheless, the reported gas sensing mechanisms heavily relied on electron transfer between metal nodes and gas molecules. Normally, the strong interaction between the metal sites and target gas molecule would result poor recovery and thus bad recycling property. Herein, we propose a redox synergy strategy to overcome this issue by balancing the reactivity of metal sites and ligands. A 2D c&#8208;MOF, Zn3(HHTQ)2, was prepared for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sensing, which was constructed from active ligands (hexahydroxyltricycloquinazoline, HHTQ) and inactive transition&#8208;metal ions (Zn2+). Substantial characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that by utilizing only the redox interactions between ligands and NO2, not only high sensitivity and selectivity, but also excellent cycling stability in NO2 sensing could be achieved. In contrast, control experiments employing isostructural 2D c&#8208;MOFs with Cu/Ni metal nodes exhibited irreversible NO2 sensing. Our current work provides a new design strategy for gas sensing materials, emphasizing harnessing the redox activity of only ligands to enhance the stability of MOF sensing materials.

         <title>A Rechargeable "Rocking Chair" Type Zn&#8722;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rising global temperatures and critical energy shortages have spurred researches into CO2 fixation and conversion within the realm of energy storage such as Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries. However, traditional Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries employ double&#8208;compartment electrolytic cells with separate carriers for catholytes and anolytes, diverging from the "rocking chair" battery mechanism. The specific energy of these conventional batteries is constrained by the solubility of discharge reactants/products in the electrolyte. Additionally, H2O molecules tend to trigger parasitic reactions at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces, undermining the long&#8208;term stability of Zn anodes. In this report, we introduce an innovative "rocking chair" type Zn&#8722;CO2 battery that utilizes a weak&#8208;acidic Zn(OTf)2 aqueous electrolyte compatible with both cathode and anode. This design minimizes side reactions on the Zn surface and leverages the high catalytic activity of the cathode material, allowing the battery to achieve a substantial discharge capacity of 6734 mAh g&#8722;1 and maintain performance over 65 cycles. Moreover, the successful production of pouch cells demonstrates the practical applicability of Zn&#8722;CO2 batteries. Electrode characterizations confirm superior electrochemical reversibility, facilitated by solid discharge products of ZnCO3 and C. This work advances a "rocking chair" Zn&#8722;CO2 battery with enhanced specific energy and a reversible pathway, providing a foundation for developing high&#8208;performance metal&#8722;CO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Allenylic Amination of Allenols Activated by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Interaction with Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquitous nature of amines in drug compounds, bioactive molecules and natural products has fueled intense interest in their synthesis. Herein, we introduce a nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent allenylic amination of methanol&#8208;activated allenols. This protocol affords a diverse array of functionalized allenylic amines in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic potential of this method is demonstrated by employing bioactive amines as nucleophiles and conducting gram&#8208;scale reactions. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations elucidate the role of methanol as an activator in the nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction, facilitating the oxidative addition of the C&#8211;O bond of allenols through hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The remarkable outcomes arise from a rapid racemization of allenols enabled by the nickel catalyst and from highly enantioselective dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation of &#951;3&#8208;alkadienylnickel intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Linearly Arranged Multi&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Stacked Structure for Efficient Through&#8208;Space Charge&#8208;Transfer Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noncovalent spatial interaction has become an intriguing and important tool for constructing optoelectronic molecules. In this study, we linearly attached three conjugated units in a multi &#960;&#8208;stacked manner by using just one trident bridge based on indeno[2,1&#8208;b]fluorene. To achieve this structure, we improved the synthetic approach through double C&#8208;H activation, significantly simplifying the preparation process. Due to the proximity of the C10, C11, and C12 sites in indeno[2,1&#8208;b]fluorene, we derived two novel donor|acceptor|donor (D|A|D) type molecules, 2DMB and 2DMFB, which exhibited closely packed intramolecular stacking, enabling efficient through&#8208;space charge transfer. This molecular construction is particularly suitable for developing high&#8208;performance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials. With donor(s) and acceptor(s) constrained and separated within this spatially rigid structure, elevated radiative transition rates, and high photoluminescence quantum yields were achieved. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes incorporating 2DMB and 2DMFB demonstrated superior efficiency, achieving maximum external quantum efficiencies of 28.6% and 16.2%, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Carboranyl Ligated Gold Nano&#8208;catalysts for Regioselective Aromatic Bromination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving electronic/steric control and realizing selectivity regulation in nanocatalysis remains a formidable challenge, as the dynamic nature of metal&#8208;ligand interfaces, including dissolution (metal leaching) and structural reconstruction, poses significant obstacles. Herein, we disclose carboranyls (CBs) as unprecedented carbon&#8208;bonded functional ligands (Eads.CB&#8208;Au(111) = &#8208;2.90 eV) for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), showcasing their exceptional stabilization capability that is attributed by strong Au&#8208;C bonds combined with B&#8211;H&#8943;Au interactions. The synthesized CB@AuNPs exhibit core(Aun)&#8208;satellite(CB2Au&#8208;) structure, showing high stability towards multiple stimuli (110oC, pH = 1&#8208;12, thiol etchants). In addition, different from conventional AuNP catalysts such as triphenylphosphine (PPh3) stabilized AuNPs, dissolution of catalytically active gold species was suppressed in CB@AuNPs under the reaction conditions. Leveraging these distinct features, CB@AuNPs realized outstanding p:o selectivities in aromatic bromination. Unbiased arenes including chlorobenzene (up to &gt; 30:1), bromobenzene (15:1) and phenyl acrylate were examined using CB@AuNPs as catalysts to afford highly&#8208;selective p&#8208;products. Both carboranyl ligands and carboranyl derived counterions are crucial for such regioselective transformation. This work has provided valuable insights for AuNPs in realizing diverse regioselective transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Oxidative Phenol Coupling by a Mushroom Unspecific Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioactive dimeric (pre&#8208;)anthraquinones are ubiquitous in nature. Their biosynthesis via an oxidative phenol coupling (OPC) step is catalyzed by either cytochrome P450 enzymes, peroxidases, or laccases. While the biocatalysis of OPC in molds (Ascomycota) is well&#8208;known, the respective enzymes of mushroom&#8208;forming fungi (Basidiomycota) are still unknown. Here, we report on the biosynthesis of the atropisomers phlegmacin A1 and B1, unsymmetrical 7,10&#8217;&#8208;homo&#8208;coupled dihydroanthracenones of the mushroom Cortinarius&#160;odorifer. The biosynthesis was heterologously reconstituted in the mold Aspergillus&#160;niger. We show that methylation of the dimeric (pre&#8208;)anthraquinone building block atrochrysone to its 6&#8208;O&#8208;methyl ether torosachrysone by the O&#8208;methyltransferase (CoOMT1) precedes the regioselective homo&#8208;coupling to phlegmacin, catalyzed by an unspecific peroxygenase (CoUPO1). Our results revealed an unprecedented UPO&#8208;mediated unsymmetric OPC reaction, thereby expanding the biocatalytic portfolio of OPC&#8208;type reactions beyond the commonly reported enzymes. The findings highlight the pivotal role of OPC in natural processes, demonstrating that Basidiomycota employed peroxygenases to develop the ability to selectively couple aryls, distinct and convergent to any other group of organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Anion&#8208;Conductive Viologen&#8208;based Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Membranes as Nanopower Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) and their layer&#8208;stacked 2D covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) membranes hold great potential for harvesting sustainable osmotic energy. The nascent research has yet to simultaneously achieve high ionic flux and selectivity, primarily due to inefficient ion transport dynamics. This is directly related to ultrasmall pore size (&lt;3 nm), much smaller than the duple Debye length in the diluted electrolyte (6~20 nm), as well as low charge density (&lt;4.5 mC m&#8208;2). Here, we introduce a &#960;&#8208;conjugated viologen&#8208;based 2DP (V2DP) membrane possessing a large pore size of 4.5 nm, strategically enhancing the overlapping of the electric double layer, coupled with an exceptional positive surface charge density (~6 mC m&#8208;2). These characteristics enable the membrane to facilitate high anion flux while maintaining ideal selectivity. Notably, V2DP membranes realize an impressive current density of 5.5&#215;103 A m&#8208;2, surpassing&#160; previously&#160;nanofluidic membranes. In&#160;practical application scenario involving the mixing of artificial seawater and river water, the V2DP membranes exhibit a considerable ion transference number of 0.70 towards Cl&#8208;, contributing to an outstanding power density of ~55 W m&#8208;2. Theoretical calculations reveal that the&#160;large quantity of anion transport sites act as binding sites evenly located in the positively charged N&#8208;containing pyridine rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Comprehensive Studies of Be&#8208;IV&#8208;N2 (IV = Si, Ge): Solving the Mystery of Wurtzite&#8208;Type Pmc21 Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The research for wurtzite&#8208;type ternary nitride semiconductors containing earth abundant elements with a stoichiometry of 1:1:2 was focused on metals like Mg or Zn, so far. The vast majority of these Grimm&#8208;Sommerfeld analogous compounds crystallize in the &#946;&#8208;NaFeO2 structure, although a second arrangement in space group Pmc21 is predicted to be a viable alternative. Despite extensive theoretical and experimental studies, this structure has so far remained undiscovered. Herein, we report on BeGeN2 in a Pmc21 structure, synthesized from Be3N2 and Ge3N4 using a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 6&#160;GPa and 800&#160;&#176;C. The compound was characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Raman and energy dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX) spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;dependent PXRD, second harmonic generation (SHG) and UV/VIS measurements and in addition also compared to its lighter homologue BeSiN2 in all mentioned analytic techniques. The synthesis and investigation of both the first beryllium germanium nitride and the first ternary wurtzite&#8208;type nitride crystallizing in space group Pmc21 open the door to a new field of research on wurtzite&#8208;type related structures.</dc:description>

         <title>A [2.2]Isoindolinophanyl&#8208;Based Carbene (iPC) Ligand: Synthesis, Electronic and Photophysical Properties, and Application in Photocatalysis**</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic amino(alkyl) and cyclic amino(aryl) carbenes (cAACs/cAArCs) have been established as very useful ligands for catalytic and photonic applications of transition metal complexes. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a structurally related sterically demanding, electrophilic [2.2]isoindolinophanyl&#8208;based carbene (iPC) with a [2.2]paracyclophane moiety. The latter leads to more delocalized frontier orbitals and intense green fluorescence of (HiPC)OTf (2) from an intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer (1ILCT) state in the solid state. Base&#8208;promoted synthesis of the free carbene led to an unusual ring expansion and subsequent dimerization reaction, but the beneficial ligand properties can be exploited by trapping in situ at a metal center. The iPC ligand is a very potent &#960;&#8208;chromophore, which participates in low energy metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand (ML)CT transitions in [RhCl(CO)2(iPC)] (4) and IL&#8208;&#8220;through&#8208;space&#8221;&#8208;CT transitions in [Au(iPC)2]OTf (5). The steric demand of the iPC leads to high stability of 5 against air, moisture, or solvent attack, and ultralong&#8208;lived green phosphorescence with a lifetime of 185 &#956;s is observed in solution. The beneficial photophysical and electronic properties of the iPC ligand, including a large accessible &#960; surface area, were exploited by employing highly efficient energy transfer (EnT) photocatalysis in a [2+2] styrene cycloaddition reaction using 5, which outperformed other established photocatalysts in comparison.</dc:description>

The method provides a convenient way to use reactive and unstable alkyl sulfinylamines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Confined Element Distribution with Structure&#8208;driven Energy Coupling for Enhanced Prussian Blue Analogue Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural failure of Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6] could not be alleviated with traditional modification strategies through the adjustable composition property&#160;of Prussian blue analogues&#160;(PBAs), considering that the accumulation and release of stress derived from the MnN6&#160;octahedrons are unilaterally restrained.&#160;Herein, a novel application of adjustable composition property, through constructing a coordination competition relationship between chelators and [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;&#160;to directionally tune the enrichment of elements, is proposed to restrain structural degradation and induce unconventional energy coupling phenomenon. The non&#8208;uniform distribution of elements at the M1&#160;site of&#160;PBAs&#160;(NFM&#8208;PB) is manipulated by the sequentially precipitated Ni, Fe, and Mn according to the Irving&#8208;William order.&#160;Electrochemically active Fe is operated to accompany Mn, and zero&#8208;strain Ni is modulated to enrich at the surface, synergistically mitigating with the enrichment and release of stress and then significantly improving the structural stability.&#160;Furthermore, unconventional energy coupling effect, a fusion of the electrochemical behavior between FeLS&#160;and MnHS, is triggered by the confined element distribution, leading to the&#160;enhanced electrochemical stability and anti&#8208;polarization ability. Consequently, the NFM&#8208;PB demonstrates superior rate performance and cycling stability. These findings further exploit potentialities of the adjustable composition property and provide new insights into the component design engineering for advanced PBAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Red&#8208;Light Triggered H&#8208;Abstraction Photoinitiators for the Efficient Oxygen&#8208;Independent Therapy of Hypoxic Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clinical application of photodynamic therapy (PDT) is limited by oxygen&#8208;dependence and side effects caused by photosensitizer residues. Photoinitiators based on the H&#8208;abstraction reaction can address these challenges because they can generate alkyl radical&#8208;killing cells independently of oxygen and undergo rapid bleaching following H&#8208;abstraction. Nonetheless, the development of photoinitiators for PDT has been impeded by the absence of effective design strategies. Herein, we have developed aryl&#8208;ketone substituted cyanine (ACy&#8208;R), the first red&#8208;light triggered H&#8208;abstraction photoinitiators for hypoxic cancer therapy. These ACy&#8208;R molecules inherited the near&#8208;infrared absorption of cyanine dye, and aryl&#8208;ketone modification imparted H&#8208;abstraction capability. Experimental and quantum calculations revealed that modifying the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups of the aryl (e.g., ACy&#8208;5F) improved the contribution of the O atom to the photon excitation process promoting intersystem crossing and H&#8208;abstraction ability. Particularly, ACy&#8208;5F rapidly penetrated cells and enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum. Even under severe hypoxia, ACy&#8208;5F initiated red&#8208;light induced H&#8208;abstraction with intracellular biomolecules, inducing necroptosis and ferroptosis. Moreover, ACy&#8208;5F was degraded after H&#8208;abstraction, thus avoiding the side effects of long&#8208;term phototoxicity after therapy. This study not only provides a crucial molecular tool for hypoxic tumors therapy, but also presents a promising strategy for the development of multifunctional photosensitizers and photoinitiators.</dc:description>

         <title>Green Syngas Production from Natural Lignin, Sunlight, and Water over Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transformation of lignin to syngas can turn waste into treasure yet remains a tremendous challenge because of its naturally evolved stubborn structure. In this work, light&#8208;driven reforming of natural lignin in water for green syngas production is explored using Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN nanowires. Syngas is &#160;yielded from the continuous evolution of &#8226;CH3&#160;and &#8226;OH from photocatalytic reforming of lignin in water. Together with the superior optoelectronic attributes of Pt&#8208;decorated InGaN nanowires, the evolution rate of syngas approaches to 43.4&#160;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1&#160;with tunable H2/CO ratios and a remarkable turnover number (TON) of 150, 543mol syngas per mol Pt.&#160;Notably, the architecture demonstrates a high light efficiency of 12.1% for syngas generation under focused light without any extra thermal input. Outdoor test ascertains the viability of producing syngas with the only inputs of natural lignin, water, and sunlight, thus presenting a low&#8208;carbon route for synthesizing transportation fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>A simple and Sequential Strategy for the Introduction of Complexity and Hierarchy in Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Framework (HOF) Crystals for Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are a new class of crystalline porous organic molecular materials (POMMs) with great potential for a diverse range of applications. HOFs face common challenges to POMMs, and in general to purely organic crystals, that is, the difficulty of integrating complexity in crystals. Herein, we proposed a simple and sequential strategy for the formation of HOFs with hierarchical superstructures. The strategy is based on controlling the assembly conditions, avoiding the use of any surface functionalization or template, which allows to obtain hierarchical crystalline porous superstructures in an easy manner. As proof of concept, we obtained the first example of core&#8208;shell (HOF&#8208;on&#8208;HOF) crystals and HOFs with hierarchical superstructures having superhydrophobicity and trapping abilities for the capture of persistent water contaminants such as oils and microplastics. We expect that this strategy could serve as inspiration for the construction of more intricated multiscale structures that could greatly expand the library of HOFs materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetric Anion Mediated&#160;Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Knoevenagel Reaction for N&#8722;C and N&#8722;N Atropisomers Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A symmetric anion mediated dynamic kinetic asymmetric Knoevenagel reaction was established as a general and efficient method for accessing both N&#8722;C and N&#8722;N atropisomers.   The resulting highly enantio&#8208;pure pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones exhibit diverse structures and functional groups. The key to excellent regio&#8208; and remote enantiocontrol could be owed to the hydrogen bond between the enolate anion and triflamide block of the organocatalyst. This connected the enolate anion and iminium cation by a chiral backbone. The mechanism investigation via control experiments, correlation analysis, and density functional theory calculations further revealed how the stereochemical information was transferred from the catalyst into the axially chiral pyridine&#8208;2,6(1H,3H)&#8208;diones. The synthetic applications also demonstrated the reaction's potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Proton Transfer in Carboxylated Supramolecular Polymer for Highly Efficient Overall Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton supply is as critical as O2 activation for artificial photosynthesis of H2O2&#160;via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208; ORR). However, proton release via water dissociation is frequently hindered because of the sluggish water oxidation reaction (WOR), extremely limiting the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production. To tackle this challenge, carboxyl&#8208;enriched supramolecular polymer (perylene tetracarboxylic acid &#8208; PTCA) is elaborately prepared by molecular self&#8208;assembly for overall photosynthesis of H2O2. Interestingly, the interconversion between carboxyl as Br&#248;nsted acid and its conjugated base realizes rapid proton circulation. Through this efficient tandem proton transfer process, the spatial effect of photocatalytic reduction and oxidation reaction is greatly enhanced with reduced reaction barrier. This significantly facilitates 2e&#8208; photocatalytic ORR to synthesize H2O2 and in the meanwhile promotes 4e&#8208; photocatalytic WOR to evolve O2. Consequently, the as&#8208;developed PTCA exhibits a remarkable H2O2 yield of 185.6 &#956;M h&#8208;1 in pure water and air atmosphere under visible light illumination. More impressively, an appreciable H2O2 yield of 78.6 &#956;M h&#8208;1 can be well maintained in an anaerobic system owing to in&#8208;situ O2 generation by 4e&#8208; photocatalytic WOR. Our study presents a novel concept for artificial photosynthesis of H2O2 via constructing efficient proton transfer pathway to enable rapid proton circulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully&#8208;Fused Indacenodithiophene&#8208;Centered Small Molecule n&#8208;Type Semiconductors for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing novel n&#8208;type organic semiconductors is an enduring research endeavour, given their pivotal roles in organic electronics and their relative scarcity compared to p&#8208;type counterparts. In this study, a new strategy was employed to synthesize n&#8208;type organic semiconductors featuring fully&#8208;fused conjugated backbone. By attaching two sets of adjacent amino and formyl groups to the indacenodithiophene&#8208;based central cores and triggering a tandem reaction of Knoevenagel condensation&#8208;intramolecular cyclization, DFA1 and DFA2 were realized. The solution&#8208;processed organic field effect transistors based on DFA1 exhibited unipolar n&#8208;type transport character with a decent electron mobility of ca. 0.10 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 (ca. 0.038 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 for DFA2 based devices). When employing DFA1 as a third component in organic solar cells, a high power conversion efficiency of 19.2% can be achieved in ternary devices fabricated with PM6:L8&#8208;BO:DFA1. This work paves a new pathway in the molecular engineering of n&#8208;type organic semiconductors, propelling relevant research forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Carbon Formation and its Impact on Methane Dry Reforming Kinetics on Rhodium&#8208;based Catalysts by Operando Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mechanism for carbon deposition and its impact on the reaction kinetics of Methane Dry Reforming (MDR) using Rhodium&#8208;based catalysts is presented. By integrating Raman spectroscopy with kinetic analysis in an operando&#8208;annular chemical reactor under strict chemical conditions, we discovered that carbon deposition on a Rh/&#945;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst follows a nucleation&#8208;growth mechanism. The dynamics of carbon aggregates at the surface is found to be ruled by the CO2/CH4 ratio and the inlet CH4 concentration. The findings elucidate the spatiotemporal development of carbon aggregates on the catalyst surface and their effects on catalytic performance. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism for carbon formation shows that the influence of CO2 on MDR kinetics is an indirect result of carbon accumulation over time frames exceeding the turnover frequency, thus reconciling conflicting reports in the literature regarding CO2's kinetic role in MDR.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapidly synthesizing high&#8208;quality two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) is crucial to their practical applications. Here, we use a machine&#8208;learning approach that overcomes the challenges associated with bottom&#8208;up model derivation for the non&#8208;classical 2D COF crystallization processes. The resulting model, referred to as NEgen1, establishes correlations among the induction time, nucleation rate, growth rate, bond&#8208;forming rate constants, and common solution synthesis conditions for 2D COFs that grow by a nucleation&#8208;elongation mechanism. The results elucidate the detailed competition between the nucleation and growth dynamics in solution, which has been inappropriately described previously by classical, empirical models with assumptions invalid for 2D COF polymerization. By understanding the dynamic processes at play, the NEgen1 model reveals a simple strategy of gradually increasing monomer addition speed for growing large 2D COF crystals. This insight enables us to rapidly synthesize large COF&#8208;5 colloids, which could only be achieved previously by prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators. These results highlight the potential for systematically improving the crystal quality of 2D COFs, which has wide&#8208;reaching relevance for many of the applications for which 2D COFs are speculated to be valuable.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Oxygenation of Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative oxygenation strategy that occurs under extraordinarily mild conditions, displays high functional group tolerance, and has a broad substrate scope. We conducted a detailed mechanistic study of the transformation, underpinning the further development of iron&#8208;photocatalyzed decarboxylative methodologies.







Abstract
We report an iron&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;O bond&#8208;forming reaction under mild, base&#8208;free conditions with visible light irradiation. The transformation uses readily available and structurally diverse carboxylic acids, iron photocatalyst, and 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) derivatives as oxygenation reagents. The process exhibits a broad scope in acids possessing a wide range of stereoelectronic properties and functional groups. The developed reaction was applied to late&#8208;stage oxygenation of a series of bio&#8208;active molecules. The reaction leverages the ability of iron complexes to generate carbon&#8208;centered radicals directly from carboxylic acids by photoinduced carboxylate&#8208;to&#8208;iron charge transfer. Kinetic, electrochemical, EPR, UV/Vis, HRMS, and DFT studies revealed that TEMPO has a triple role in the reaction: as an oxygenation reagent, an oxidant to turn over the Fe&#8208;catalyst, and an internal base for the carboxylic acid deprotonation. The obtained TEMPO adducts represent versatile synthetic intermediates that were further engaged in C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions using commercial organo&#8208;photocatalysts and nucleophilic reagents.

         <title>Divalent Titanium via Reductive N&#8722;C Coupling of a TiIV Nitrido with &#960;&#8208;Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A titanium nitride undergoes N&#8722;C bond coupling with carbon monoxide and isocyanides to form TiII cumulene complexes [(PN)2Ti(NCE)]&#8722; (E=O, NAd, NtBu). Oxidation of these affords the TiIII cumulene [(PN)2Ti(NCE)]. Further oxidation affords a TiIV bis&#8208;cumulene trans&#8208;[(PN)2Ti(NCNAd)2]. Structural, electrochemical, and spectroscopic studies (HFEPR, CW X&#8208;band, NMR and IR spectroscopies), including 15N isotopic labelling studies are presented and discussed to understand the bonding and topology.







Abstract
The nitrido&#8208;ate complex [(PN)2Ti(N){&#956;2&#8208;K(OEt2)}]2 (1) (PN&#8722;=(N&#8208;(2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) reductively couples CO and isocyanides in the presence of DME or cryptand (Kryptofix222), to form rare, five&#8208;coordinate TiII complexes having a linear cumulene motif, [K(L)][(PN)2Ti(NCE)] (E=O, L=Kryptofix222, (2); E=NAd, L=3 DME, (3); E=NtBu, L=3 DME, (4); E=NAd, L=Kryptofix222, (5)). Oxidation of 2&#8211;5 with [Fc][OTf] afforded an isostructural TiIII center containing a neutral cumulene, [(PN)2Ti(NCE)] (E=O, (6); E=NAd (7), NtBu (8)) and characterization by CW X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy, revealed unpaired electron to be metal centric. Moreover, 1e&#8722; reduction of 6 and 7 in the presence of Kryptofix222cleanly reformed corresponding discrete TiII complexes 2 and 5, which were further characterized by solution magnetization measurements and high&#8208;frequency and &#8208;field EPR (HFEPR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, oxidation of 7 with [Fc*][B(C6F5)4] resulted in a ligand disproportionated TiIV complex having transoid carbodiimides, [(PN)2Ti(NCNAd)2] (9). Comparison of spectroscopic, structural, and computational data for the divalent, trivalent, and tetravalent systems, including their 15N enriched isotopomers demonstrate these cumulenes to decrease in order of backbonding as TiII&#8594;TiIII&#8594;TiIV and increasing order of &#960;&#8208;donation as TiII&#8594;TiIII&#8594;TiIV, thus displaying more covalency in TiIII species. Lastly, we show a synthetic cycle whereby complex 1 can deliver an N&#8208;atom to CO and CNAd.

Furthermore, oxidation of &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; with [Fc*][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] resulted in a ligand disproportionated Ti&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; complex having &lt;i&gt;transoid&lt;/i&gt; carbodiimides, [(PN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti(NCNAd)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;). Comparison of spectroscopic, structural, and computational data for the divalent, trivalent, and tetravalent systems, including their &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N enriched isotopomers demonstrate these cumulenes to decrease in order of backbonding as Ti&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;Ti&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;Ti&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; and increasing order of &#960;-donation as Ti&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;Ti&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;Ti&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;, thus displaying more covalency in Ti&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; species. Lastly, we show a synthetic cycle whereby complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; can deliver an N-atom to CO and CNAd.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expedited Synthesis of Metal Phosphides Maximizes Dispersion, Air Stability, and Catalytic Performance in Selective Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthesis based on cheap and safe precursors delivers a wide range of supported metal phosphides with small particle diameters and high dispersion. Ni2P/Al2O3 prepared in this fashion is a bench&#8208;stable catalyst that delivers activity on par with the Pd&#8208;based benchmark catalyst in alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.







Abstract
Metal phosphides have been hailed as potential replacements for scarce noble metal catalysts in many aspects of the hydrogen economy from hydrogen evolution to selective hydrogenation reactions. But the need for dangerous and costly phosphorus precursors, limited support dispersion, and low stability of the metal phosphide surface toward oxidation substantially lower the appeal and performance of metal phosphides in catalysis. We show here that a 1&#8208;step procedure that relies on safe and cheap precursors can furnish an air&#8208;stable Ni2P/Al2O3 catalyst containing 3.2&#8197;nm nanoparticles. Ni2P/Al2O3&#8201;1&#8208;step is kinetically competitive with the palladium&#8208;based Lindlar catalyst in selective hydrogenation catalysis, and a loading corresponding to 4&#8197;ppm Ni was sufficient to convert 0.1&#8197;mol alkyne. The 1&#8208;step synthetic procedure alters the surface ligand speciation of Ni2P/Al2O3, which protects the nanoparticle surface from oxidation, and ensures that 85&#8201;% of the initial catalytic activity was retained after the catalyst was stored under air for 1.5&#8197;years. Preparation of Ni2P on a variety of supports (silica, TiO2, SBA&#8208;15, ZrO2, C and HAP) as well as Co2P/Al2O3, Co2P/TiO2 and bimetallic NiCoP/TiO2 demonstrates the generality with which supported metal phosphides can be accessed in a safe and straightforward fashion with small sizes and high dispersion.

         <title>Catalytic Refining Lignin&#8208;Derived Monomers: Seesaw Effect between Nanoparticle and Single&#8208;Atom Pt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seesaw effect between Pt single&#8208;atoms and Pt nanoparticles in the catalytic refining of lignin monomers, viz. demethoxylation on a single&#8208;atom catalyst versus deep deoxygenation on a nanoparticle, is disclosed. The weak hydrogen spillover behavior on SAC Pt/TiO2&#8722;H inhibits hydrogenation of the benzene ring and removal of the phenol hydroxyl group, presenting in a high demethoxylation selectivity.







Abstract
Pt automatically adsorbed on oxygen vacancy of TiO2 via an in situ interfacial redox reaction, resulting in atomically dispersion of Pt on TiO2. In the upgrading of lignin&#8208;derived 4&#8208;propylguaiacol, single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) Pt/TiO2&#8722;H achieved a conversion of 96.9&#8201;% and a demethoxylation selectivity of 93.3&#8201;% under 3&#8197;MPa H2 at 250&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;h, markedly different from the performance of nanoparticle counterpart that gave deep deoxygenation selectivity over 99.0&#8201;%. The high demethoxylation activity of SAC Pt/TiO2&#8722;H is mainly attributed to its weak hydrogen spillover capacity that suppressed the benzene ring hydrogenation and the deep deoxygenation. Additionally, SAC Pt/TiO2&#8722;H reduced the energy barrier of CAr&#8722;OCH3 bond cleavage and accordingly lowered the Gibbs free energy of the demethoxylation reaction. This facile method could fabricate single&#8208;atom Au, Pd, Ir, and Ru supported on TiO2&#8722;H, demonstrating the generality of this strategy for the establishment of a library of SACs. Moreover, SAC exhibited versatile capacity in demethoxylation of different lignin&#8208;derived monomers and high stability. This study showcases the superiority of atomically dispersed metal catalysts for selective demethoxylation reactions and proposes a renewable alternative to fossil&#8208;based 4&#8208;alkylphenols through upgrading of lignin&#8208;derived monomers.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Lissodendoric Acid A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic strategy leading to the first total synthesis of lissodendoric acid A is reported. The 12&#8208;step synthesis centers on an enantiospecific Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition of a strained azacyclic allene to construct the core of the natural product. The study demonstrates that strained cyclic allenes are valuable synthetic building blocks for total synthesis.







Abstract
We describe a full account of our synthetic strategy leading to the first total synthesis of the manzamine alkaloid lissodendoric acid A . These efforts demonstrate that strained cyclic allenes are valuable synthetic building blocks and can be employed efficiently in total synthesis.

         <title>piSTING: A Pocket&#8208;Independent Agonist Based on Multivalency&#8208;Driven STING Oligomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed novel pocket&#8208;independent STING&#8208;activating agonists (piSTINGs), which act through multivalency&#8208;driven oligomerization to activate downstream signalling pathways. piSTINGs could serve as novel STING agonists for vaccines and combination therapies. And STING oligomerization is a useful strategy for the development of a new generation of STING agonists.







Abstract
The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a potent therapeutic target for innate immunity. Despite the efforts to develop pocket&#8208;dependent small&#8208;molecule STING agonists that mimic the endogenous STING ligand, cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), most of these agonists showed disappointing results in clinical trials owing to the limitations of the STING pocket. In this study, we developed novel pocket&#8208;independent STING&#8208;activating agonists (piSTINGs), which act through multivalency&#8208;driven oligomerization to activate STING. Additionally, a piSTING&#8208;adjuvanted vaccine elicited a significant antibody response and inhibited tumour growth in therapeutic models. Moreover, a piSTING&#8208;based vaccine combination with aPD&#8208;1 showed remarkable potential to enhance the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy. In particular, piSTING can strengthen the impact of STING pathway in immunotherapy and accelerate the clinical translation of STING agonists.

         <title>Unraveling the Unique Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction in Titanium Dioxide Supported Platinum Clusters for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is crucial to modulating the nature of metal species, yet the SMSI behaviors of sub&#8208;nanometer metal clusters remain unknown due to the difficulties in constructing SMSI at cluster scale. Herein, we achieve the successful construction of the SMSI between Pt clusters and amorphous TiO2 nanosheets by vacuum annealing, which requires a relatively low temperature that avoids the aggregation of small clusters. In situ scanning transmission electron microscopy observation is employed to explore the SMSI behaviors, and the results reveal the dynamic rearrangement of Pt atoms upon annealing for the first time. The originally disordered Pt atoms become ordered as the crystallizing of the amorphous TiO2 support, forming an epitaxial interface between Pt and TiO2. Such a SMSI state can remain stable in oxidation environment even at 400&#8201;&#176;C. Further investigations prove that the electron transfer from TiO2 to Pt occupies the Pt 5d orbitals, which is responsible for the disappeared CO adsorption ability of Pt/TiO2 after forming SMSI. This work not only opens a new avenue for constructing SMSI at cluster scale but also provides in&#8208;depth understanding on the unique SMSI behavior, which would stimulate the development of supported metal clusters for catalysis applications.

         <title>Suppressed Dissolution of Fluorine&#8208;Rich SEI Enables Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anode for Stable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;rich SEI dissolution is a major cause of zinc anode failure. The SEI content fluctuates significantly during the plating/stripping process, resulting in an unstable electrode/electrolyte interface. A versatile functional electrolyte additive, thioether&#8208;TX was introduced to reduce solvent polarity, as a poor solvent molecule for F&#8722;. Additionally, TX could modulate the Zn2+ solvation structure and adsorb at the electrode/electrolyte interface to reduce the activity of local water, further suppressing the dissolution of ZnF2 and stabilizing the fluorine&#8208;rich SEI layer.







Abstract
The instability of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is a critical challenge for the zinc metal anodes, leading to an erratic electrode/electrolyte interface and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), ultimately resulting in anode failure. This study uncovers that the fluorine species dissolution is the root cause of SEI instability. To effectively suppress the F&#8722; dissolution, an introduction of a low&#8208;polarity molecule, 1,4&#8208;thioxane (TX), is proposed, which reinforces the stability of the fluorine&#8208;rich SEI. Moreover, the TX molecule has a strong affinity for coordinating with Zn2+ and adsorbing at the electrode/electrolyte interface, thereby diminishing the activity of local water and consequently impeding SEI dissolution. The robust fluorine&#8208;rich SEI layer promotes the high durability of the zinc anode in repeated plating/stripping cycles, while concurrently suppressing HER and enhancing Coulombic efficiency. Notably, the symmetric cell with TX demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance, sustaining over 500&#8197;hours at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the Zn||KVOH full cell exhibits excellent capacity retention, averaging 6.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 98&#8201;% retention after 400&#8197;cycles, even at high loading with a lean electrolyte. This work offers a novel perspective on SEI dissolution as a key factor in anode failure, providing valuable insights for the electrolyte design in energy storage devices.

         <title>Rational Design of the Spatial Effect in a Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Dioxygenase Reverses the Regioselectivity of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Hydroxylation in Aliphatic Amino Acids</title>

         <dc:description>
This study addressed the challenge of regioselectivity for remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bond hydroxylation. A Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase (BlAH) was mined with a promiscuous hydroxylation for aliphatic amino acids. The regioselectivity of C(sp3)&#8722;H bond hydroxylation could be regulated by the spatial effect of BlAH. As a proof of concept, the spatial effect of BlAH was redesigned and reversed the regioselectivity from the &#947; to the &#948; site.







Abstract
The hydroxylation of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aliphatic amino acids yields crucial precursors for the synthesis of high&#8208;value compounds. However, accurate regulation of the regioselectivity of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds hydroxylation in aliphatic amino acids continues to be a common challenge in chemosynthesis and biosynthesis. In this study, the Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase from Bacillus subtilis (BlAH) was mined and found to catalyze hydroxylation at the &#947; and &#948; sites of aliphatic amino acids. Crystal structure analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum chemical calculations revealed that regioselectivity was regulated by the spatial effect of BlAH. Based on these results, the spatial effect of BlAH was reconstructed to stabilize the transition state at the &#948; site of aliphatic amino acids, thereby successfully reversing the &#947; site regioselectivity to the &#948; site. For example, the regioselectivity of L&#8208;Homoleucine (5&#8201;a) was reversed from the &#947; site (1&#8201;:&#8201;12) to the &#948; site (&gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1). The present study not only expands the toolbox of biocatalysts for the regioselective functionalization of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, but also provides a theoretical guidance for the precision&#8208;driven modification of similarly remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in complex molecules.

         <title>Concomitant Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermy and Photoluminescence of Rod&#8208;Shaped Au52(PET)32 and Au66(PET)38 Synthesized Concurrently</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two rod&#8208;shaped Au52(PET)32&#8208;G and Au66(PET)38 are synthesized and precisely characterized. Basing on the unreported transverse growth mode from Au52(PET)32&#8208;G to Au66(PET)38, six novel nanoclusters are predicted. Although the two nanoclusters have different aspect ratios and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light collection abilities, they have concomitant photothermy (PT) and photoluminescence (PL) under NIR irradiation, and the PT and PL are in balance.







Abstract
Gold nanoclusters exhibiting concomitant photothermy (PT) and photoluminescence (PL) under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation are rarely reported, and some fundamental issues remain unresolved for such materials. Herein, we concurrently synthesized two novel rod&#8208;shaped Au nanoclusters, Au52(PET)32 and Au66(PET)38 (PET = 2&#8208;phenylethanethiolate), and precisely revealed that their kernels were 4 &#215; 4 &#215; 6 and 5 &#215; 4 &#215; 6 face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) structures, respectively, based on the numbers of Au layers in the [100], [010], and [001] directions. Following the structural growth mode from Au52(PET)32 to Au66(PET)38, we predicted six more novel nanoclusters. The concurrent synthesis provides rational comparison of the two nanoclusters on the stability, absorption, emission and photothermy, and reveals the aspect ratio&#8208;related properties. An interesting finding is that the two nanoclusters exhibit concomitant PT and PL under 785&#8197;nm light irradiation, and the PT and PL are in balance, which was explained by the qualitative evaluation of the radiative and non&#8208;radiative rates. The ligand effects on PT and PL were also investigated.

These performance improvements are correlated with the specific alignment of metal d bands and ligand p band in the Mott&#8208;Hubbard compound, and a larger p&#8208;d transition probability to d&#8208;d transition probability associated with the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion.







Abstract
Nonlinear absorption coefficient and modulation depth stand as pivotal properties of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, while the existing NLO materials exhibit limitations such as low nonlinear absorption coefficients and/or small modulation depths, thereby severely impeding their practical application. Here we unveil that introducing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion in a Mott&#8208;Hubbard system, (MA)2CuX4 (MA=methylammonium; X=Cl, Br) affords the simultaneous attainment of a giant nonlinear absorption coefficient and substantial modulation depth. The optimized compound, (MA)2CuCl4, demonstrates a nonlinear absorption coefficient of (1.5&#177;0.08)&#215;105&#8197;cm&#8201;GW&#8722;1, a modulation depth of 60&#8201;%, and a relatively low optical limiting threshold of 1.22&#215;10&#8722;5&#8201;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2. These outstanding attributes surpass those of most reported NLO materials. Our investigation reveals that a more pronounced distortion of the [CuX6]4&#8722; octahedron emerges as a crucial factor in augmenting optical nonlinearity. Mechanism study involving structural and spectral characterization along with theoretical calculations indicates a correlation between the compelling performance and the Mott&#8208;Hubbard band structure of the materials, coupled with the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion&#8208;induced d&#8208;d transition. This study not only introduces a promising category of high&#8208;performance NLO materials but also provides novel insights into enhancing the performance of such materials.

         <title>Controlling Tin Halide Perovskite Oxidation Dynamics in Solution for Perovskite Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin&#8208;based perovskites hold promise for solar cell and LED applications, but suffer from inherent oxidation issues with the ubiquitous DMSO solvent. NMR spectroscopy reveals SnI2 oxidation kinetics, suggesting water involvement and HI generation. Processing at 60&#8201;&#176;C suppresses the Sn oxidation, improving film quality and PeLEDs. This low&#8208;temperature protocol promises oxidation&#8208;free Sn perovskites, shaping future device fabrication.







Abstract
As a leading contender to replace lead halide perovskites, tin&#8208;based perovskites have demonstrated ever increasing performance in solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). They tend to be processed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent, which has been identified as a major contributor to the Sn(II) oxidation during film fabrication, posing a challenge to the further improvement of Sn&#8208;based perovskites. Herein, we use NMR spectroscopy to investigate the kinetics of the oxidation of SnI2, revealing that autoamplification takes place, accelerating the oxidation as the reaction progresses. We propose a mechanism consistent with these observations involving water participation and HI generation. Building upon these insights, we have developed low&#8208;temperature Sn&#8208;based perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) processed at 60&#8201;&#176;C, achieving enhanced external quantum efficiencies (EQEs). Our research underscores the substantial potential of low&#8208;temperature DMSO solvent processes and DMSO&#8208;free solvent systems for fabricating oxidation&#8208;free Sn&#8208;based perovskites, shaping the future direction in processing Sn&#8208;containing perovskite materials and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Amorphous FeSnOx Nanosheets with Hierarchical Vacancies for Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous 2D nanosheets with abundant nano&#8208;sized perforations and oxygen vancancies, mixed with a small amount of monolayer MXene, are coated on PP separators. This simultaneously regulates uniform Na deposition, facilitates the kinetics of polysulfides conversion, and enhances the mechanical properties.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries, noted for their low material costs and high energy density, are emerging as a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in various applications including power grids and standalone renewable energy systems. These batteries are commonly assembled with glass fiber membranes, which face significant challenges like the dissolution of polysulfides, sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics, and the growth of Na dendrites. Here, we develop an amorphous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) iron tin oxide (A&#8208;FeSnOx) nanosheet with hierarchical vacancies, including abundant oxygen vacancies (Ovs) and nano&#8208;sized perforations, that can be assembled into a multifunctional layer overlaying commercial separators for RT Na&#8722;S batteries. The Ovs offer strong adsorption and abundant catalytic sites for polysulfides, while the defect concentration is finely tuned to elucidate the polysulfides conversion mechanisms. The nano&#8208;sized perforations aid in regulating Na ions transport, resulting in uniform Na deposition. Moreover, the strategic addition of trace amounts of Ti3C2 (MXene) forms an amorphous/crystalline (A/C) interface that significantly improves the mechanical properties of the separator and suppresses dendrite growth. As a result, the task&#8208;specific layer achieves ultra&#8208;light (~0.1&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), ultra&#8208;thin (~200&#8197;nm), and ultra&#8208;robust (modulus=4.9&#8197;GPa) characteristics. Consequently, the RT Na&#8722;S battery maintained a high capacity of 610.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% after 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C.

         <title>Utilizing &#8220;Latent&#8221; Carbon: Repositioning Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Synthons and Assemblies via Halogen Bonding to &#960;&#8208;Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bonding to &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon sites&#8212;unsubstituted carbon sites that are traditionally seen as dead&#8208;ends in hydrogen&#8208;bonded crystal engineering&#8212;has been used to direct the solid&#8208;state arrangement of discrete and extended hydrogen&#8208;bonded substructures based on acid&#8208;, amide&#8208;, and phenol&#8208;based homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;synthons, thereby generating higher&#8208;order molecular solids.







Abstract
Molecules bearing carboxylic acid, amide, and hydroxyl groups are ubiquitous in crystal engineering, where robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded synthons centred on these functionalities enable reliable crystal structure design. We now show that halogen bonding to the carbon &#960;&#8208;system of such molecules, traditionally ignored in crystal engineering, permits the recognition and directional assembly of the resulting hydrogen&#8208;bonded structural subunits, leaving the archetypal hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring, ladder, and chain homosynthons intact, but repositioned in space. When applied to heteromolecular synthons, this enables rearranging more complex hydrogen&#8208;bonded motifs and the evolution of binary cocrystals into ternary ones through &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon&#8208;based recognition sites, demonstrating a rational approach to build higher&#8208;order solid&#8208;state supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Triphenylamine[3]arenes: Streamlining Synthesis of a Versatile Macrocyclic Platform for Supramolecular Architectures and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient synthesis of triphenylamine[3]arenes using triphenylamine derivatized monomers via a BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction with paraformaldehyde is presented. These three&#8208;fold symmetric macrocycles, featuring alternating carbon and nitrogen bridging atoms, exhibit versatile properties in luminescence and iodine adsorption, and serve as building blocks for extended frameworks and molecular cages.







Abstract
Triphenylamine[3]arenes (TPA[3]s), featuring [16]paracyclophane backbone with alternating carbon and nitrogen bridging atoms, were synthesized through a BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction using triphenylamine derivatized monomers and paraformaldehyde. This molecular design yielded a series of TPA[3] macrocycles with high efficiency, with their facile derivatizations also successfully demonstrated. On account of the strong electron&#8208;donating properties of the TPA moieties, these TPA[3]s exhibit remarkable delayed fluorescence, and possess a significant affinity for iodine. Furthermore, their inherent three&#8208;fold symmetry rendered TPA[3]s as novel building blocks for the construction of extended frameworks and molecular cages. This advancement expands the versatility of discrete macrocycles into complex architectures, enhancing their applicability across a broad spectrum of applications.

This molecular design yielded a series of TPA[3] macrocycles with high efficiency, with their facile derivatizations also successfully demonstrated. On account of the strong electron-donating properties of the TPA moieties, these TPA[3]s exhibit remarkable delayed fluorescence, and possess a significant affinity for iodine. Furthermore, their inherent three-fold symmetry rendered TPA[3]s as novel building blocks for the construction of extended frameworks and molecular cages. This advancement expands the versatility of discrete macrocycles into complex architectures, enhancing their applicability across a broad spectrum of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent and Covalent Binding of New Mixed&#8208;Valence Cage&#8208;like Polyoxidovanadate Clusters to Lysozyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In NaCl solutions and in the presence of lysozyme, the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] undergoes ligand exchange, partial oxidation of VIV to VV producing unexpected mixed&#8208;valence polyoxidovanadates with composition [V15O36(OH2)]5&#8722;, [V15O33(OH2)]+ and [V20O51(OH2)]n&#8722;, which bind covalently and non&#8208;covalently to the protein surface.







Abstract
The high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures of the model protein lysozyme in the presence of the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] from crystals grown in 1.1&#8197;M NaCl, 0.1&#8197;M sodium acetate at pH&#8197;4.0 reveal the binding to the protein of different and unexpected mixed&#8208;valence cage&#8208;like polyoxidovanadates (POVs): [V15O36(OH2)]5&#8722;, which non&#8208;covalently interacts with the lysozyme surface, [V15O33(OH2)]+ and [V20O51(OH2)]n&#8722; (this latter based on an unusual {V18O43} cage) which covalently bind the protein. EPR spectroscopy confirms the partial oxidation of VIV to VV and the formation of mixed&#8208;valence species. The results indicate that the interaction with proteins can stabilize the structure of unexpected &#8211; both for dimension and architecture &#8211; POVs, not observed in aqueous solution.

         <title>Inside Cover: Structure&#8208;Function Relationship of p&#8208;Block Bismuth for Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low selectivity is a key scientific challenge that hinders the commercialization of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. In their Research Article (&lt;url href=&#8220;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202407287&#8221;&gt;e202407287), Zhao&#8208;Qing Liu et&#8197;al. found that the CH4 selectivity of p&#8208;block Bi element exhibits a &#8220;volcanic&#8221; structure&#8208;function relationship when gradually decreasing the p&#8208;band center. This CH4 selectivity of Bi element is also positively correlated with the adsorption energy of key intermediate *CHO and the photoexcited carriers separation efficiency.

         <dc:description>
A fluorine&#8208;free, dumbbell&#8208;shaped block&#8208;graft copolymer was synthesized and used as a hydrocarbon polymer electrolyte membrane for fuel cells, as reported by Il&#8197;Seok Chae, Jong&#8197;Hak Kim et&#8197;al in their Communication (e202406796). The unique structure of the polymer chains led to the alignment of phase&#8208;separated domains and continuous proton channels were constructed throughout the membrane. This enabled efficient proton transport and ensured stable performance. A novel design of polymer structure demonstrates a promising prospect for hydrocarbon PEMs as alternatives to PFSAs.

         <title>Cover Picture: Symmetric Electron Transfer Coordinates are Intrinsic to Bridged Systems: an ab initio Treatment of the Creutz&#8211;Taube Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In mixed&#8208;valent systems, an anti&#8208;symmetric motion leads to electron localisation on or electron transfer between the redox centers. In their Research Article (e202404727), Adam &#352;rut, Benjamin&#8197;J. Lear, Vera Krewald show that additionally, a symmetric motion is present in bridged systems: it is responsible for the characteristic shape of the inter&#8208;valence charge transfer band. The close relationship between the two motions is represented by one surface being the shadow of the other.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Built&#8208;in protection: A 1&#8208;step synthesis of supported metal phosphides from cheap precursors is described in the Research Article by Constanze&#8197;N. Neumann (e202404292). The approach delivers Ni2P/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 containing surface ligands that protect the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst from air oxidation. Facile displacement of the surface&#8208;bound phenyl phosphates by substrate molecules gives rise to catalytic activity on par with the palladium&#8208;based Lindlar catalyst.

&lt;p&gt;Built-in protection: A 1-step synthesis of supported metal phosphides from cheap precursors is described in the Research Article by Constanze&#8197;N. Neumann (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202404292"&gt;e202404292&lt;/a&gt;). The approach delivers Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P/&#947;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; containing surface ligands that protect the noble-metal-free catalyst from air oxidation. Facile displacement of the surface-bound phenyl phosphates by substrate molecules gives rise to catalytic activity on par with the palladium-based Lindlar catalyst.

An all&#8208;inorganic zero&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskite featuring a considerable piezochromic range of 232 nm is reported by Guanjun Xiao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202406015). The cover picture describes an intriguing pressure&#8208;induced piezochromic behavior in typical Cs3Cu2Cl5 nanocrystals by using diamond anvil cell. The emission energy shifted from the lowest&#8208;energy red fluorescence (1.85&#8197;eV) to the highest&#8208;energy blue fluorescence (2.83&#8197;eV), covering almost the entire visible wavelength range, thus providing a promising naked&#8208;eye visual pressure monitoring and sensing &#8220;chameleon&#8221;.

         <title>Asymmetric Paired Electrolysis: Enantioselective Alkylation of Sulfonylimines via C(sp3)&#8211;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective transformation of ubiquitous C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds into three&#8208;dimensional chiral scaffolds is of longstanding interest to synthetic chemists. Herein, an asymmetric paired electrolysis enables a highly efficient and sustainable approach to the enantioselective alkylation of sulfonylimines via C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization. In this protocol, anodic oxidation for benzylic radical formation and Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylimine reduction on the cathode were seamlessly cross&#8208;coupled (up to 88% yield). Enantioenriched chiral amines containing a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter are accessed with high enantioselectivity (up to 96% ee). Mechanistic studies suggest that the amine generated in situ could serve as a base to deprotonate phenols and decrease the oxidation potential of the reaction, allowing phenols with lower potentials to be preferentially oxidized.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Janus heterostructures consisting of multiple jointed components with distinct properties have gained growing interest in the photoredox catalytic field. Herein, we have developed a facile low&#8208;temperature method to gain anisotropic one&#8208;dimensional Au&#8208;tipped CdS (Au&#8208;CdS) nanorods (NRs), followed by assembling Ru molecular co&#8208;catalyst (RuN5) onto the surface of the NRs. The CdS NRs decorated with plasmonic Au nanoparticles (NPs) and RuN5 complex harness the virtues of metal&#8208;semiconductor and inorganic&#8208;organic interface, giving directional charge transfer channels, spatially separated reaction sites, and enhanced local electric field distribution. As a result, the Au&#8208;CdS&#8208;RuN5 can act as an efficient dual&#8208;function photocatalyst for simultaneous H2 evolution and valorization of biomass&#8208;derived alcohols. Benefiting from the interfacial charge decoupling and selective chemical bond activation, the optimal all&#8208;in&#8208;one Au&#8208;CdS&#8208;RuN5 heterostructure shows greatly enhanced photoactivity and selectivity as compared to bare CdS NRs, along with a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 40.2% at 400 nm. The structural evolution and working mechanism of the heterostructures are systematically analyzed based on experimental and computational results.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom 3d Transition Metals on SnO2 as Model Cell for Conversion Mechanism: Revealing Thermodynamic Catalytic Effects on Enhanced Na Storage of Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the discovery in 2000, conversion&#8208;type materials have emerged as a promising negative&#8208;electrode candidate for next&#8208;generation batteries with high capacity and tunable voltage, limited by low reversibility and severe voltage hysteresis. Heterogeneous construction stands out as a cost&#8208;effective and efficient approach to reducing reaction barriers and enhancing energy density. However, the second term introduced by conventional heterostructure inevitably complicates the electrochemical analysis and poses great challenges to harvesting systematic insights and theoretical guidance. A model cell is designed and established herein for the conversion reactions between Na and TMSA&#8208;SnO2, where TMSA&#8208;SnO2 represents single atom modification of eight different 3d transition elements (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu or Zn). Such a model unit fundamentally eliminates the interference from the second phase and thus enables independent exploration of activation manifestations of the heterogeneous architecture. For the first time, a thermodynamically dependent catalytic effect is proposed and verified through statistical data analysis. The mechanism behind the unveiled catalytic effect is further elucidated by which the active d orbitals of transition metals weaken the surface covalent bonds and lower the reaction barriers. This research provides both theoretical insights and practical demonstrations of the advanced heterogeneous electrodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#160;Engineering Regulation Achieving&#160;Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Polarization in Rare&#8208;Earth Hybrid Double Perovskites for Ferroelectrics and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is&#160;a highly desired&#160;property of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ferroelectrics for&#160;application in&#160;vertical&#160;sandwich&#8208;type&#160;photoferroelectric devices, especially in ultrathin&#160;ferroelectronic devices. Nevertheless, despite&#160;great advances&#160;that have been made&#160;in recent years, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization remains unrealized&#160;in the 2D hybrid double perovskite&#160;ferroelectric&#160;family. Here, from our&#160;previous work 2D hybrid double perovskite&#160;HQERN&#160;((S3HQ)4EuRb(NO3)8, S3HQ = S&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxylquinuclidinium), we designed a molecular strategy of F&#8208;substitution&#160;on organic component to successfully obtain&#160;FQERN ((S3FQ)4EuRb(NO3)8, S3FQ = S&#8208;3&#8208;fluoroquinuclidinium)&#160;showing&#160;circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) response. Remarkably, compared to the monopolar axis&#160;ferroelectric&#160;HQERN,&#160;FQERN not only shows multiferroicity with the coexistence of multipolar axis ferroelectricity&#160;and&#160;ferroelasticity but also realizes&#160;out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization&#160;and&#160;a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature of&#160;94 K.&#160;This is mainly due to the introduction of F&#8208;substituted organic cations, which leads to a change in orientation and a reduction in crystal lattice void occupancy.&#160;Our study demonstrates&#160;that F&#8208;substitution is an efficient strategy to realize and optimize ferroelectric functional characteristics, giving&#160;more possibility&#160;of 2D ferroelectric materials&#160;for applications in micro&#8208;nano&#160;optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

Remarkably, compared to the monopolar axis&#160;ferroelectric&#160;HQERN,&#160;FQERN not only shows multiferroicity with the coexistence of multipolar axis ferroelectricity&#160;and&#160;ferroelasticity but also realizes&#160;out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization&#160;and&#160;a dramatic enhancement of Curie temperature of&#160;94 K.&#160;This is mainly due to the introduction of F-substituted organic cations, which leads to a change in orientation and a reduction in crystal lattice void occupancy.&#160;Our study demonstrates&#160;that F-substitution is an efficient strategy to realize and optimize ferroelectric functional characteristics, giving&#160;more possibility&#160;of 2D ferroelectric materials&#160;for applications in micro-nano&#160;optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cascade Synthesis of Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;Fe Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Superior Oxygen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have been proposed to break the limitation of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in the synergistic activation of multiple molecules and intermediates, offering an additional degree of freedom for catalytic regulation. However, it remains a challenge to synthesize DACs with high uniformity, atomic accuracy, and satisfactory loadings.  Herein, we report a facile cascade synthetic strategy for DAC via precise electrostatic interaction control and neighboring vacancy construction. We synthesized well&#8208;defined, uniformly dispersed dual Fe sites which were connected by two nitrogen bonds (denoted as Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;Fe). The as&#8208;synthesized DAC exhibited superior catalytic performances towards oxygen reduction reaction, including good half&#8208;wave potential (0.91 V), high kinetic current density (21.66 mA cm&#8208;2), and perfect durability. Theoretical calculation revealed that the DAC structure effectively tunes the oxygen adsorption configuration and decreases the cleavage barrier, thereby improving the catalytic kinetics. The DAC&#8208;based zinc&#8208;air batteries exhibited impressive power densities of 169.8 and 52.18 mW cm&#8208;2 at 25 oC and &#8208;40 oC, which is 1.7 and 2.0 times higher than those based on Pt/C+Ir/C, respectively. We also demonstrated the universality of our strategy in synthesizing other M&#8208;N2&#8208;M DACs (M= Co, Cu, Ru, Pd, Pt, and Au), facilitating the construction of a DAC library for different catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Spillover Mechanism at the Metal&#8211;Metal Interface in Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen spillover in metal&#8208;supported catalysts can largely enhance electrocatalytic hydrogenation performance and reduce energy consumption. However, its fundamental mechanism, especially at the metal&#8211;metal interface, remains further explored, impeding relevant catalyst design. Here, we theoretically profile that a large free energy difference in hydrogen adsorption on two different metals (|&#916;GH&#8208;metal(i) &#8722; &#916;GH&#8208;metal(ii)|) induces a high kinetic barrier to hydrogen spillover between the metals. Minimizing the difference in their d&#8208;band centers (&#916;&#949;d) should reduce |&#916;GH&#8208;metal(i) &#8722; &#916;GH&#8208;metal(ii)|, lowering the kinetic barrier to hydrogen spillover for improved electrocatalytic hydrogenation. We demonstrated this concept using copper&#8208;supported ruthenium&#8211;platinum alloys with the smallest &#916;&#949;d, which delivered record high electrocatalytic nitrate hydrogenation performance, with ammonia production rate of 3.45&#177;0.12 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and Faraday efficiency of 99.8&#177;0.2 %, at low energy consumption of 21.4 kWh kgamm&#8722;1. Using these catalysts, we further achieve continuous ammonia and formic acid production with a record high&#8208;profit space.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modified Arbuzov&#8208;Michalis Reaction for Selective Alkylation of Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The alkylation of nucleophiles is among the most fundamental and well&#8208;developed transformations in chemistry. However, to achieve selective alkylation of complex substrates remains a nontrivial task. We report herein a general and selective alkylation method without using strong acids, bases, or metals. In this method, the readily available phosphinites/phosphites, in combination with ethyl acrylate, function as effective alkylating agents. Various nucleophilic groups, including alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids, imides, and thiols can be alkylated. This method can be applied in the late&#8208;stage alkylation of natural products and pharmaceutical agents, achieving chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective modification of complex substrates. Experimental studies indicate the relative reactivity of a nucleophile depends on its acidity and its steric environment. Mechanistic studies suggest the reaction pathway resembles that of the Arbuzov&#8208;Michalis reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Path&#8208;Independent All&#8208;Visible Orthogonal Photoswitching for Applications in Multi&#8208;Photochromic Polymers and Molecular Computing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic molecular photoswitches have taken center stage as high&#8208;precision tools to introduce light&#8208;responsiveness at the smallest scales. Today they are found in all areas of applied chemistry, covering materials research, chemical biology, catalysis, or nanotechnology. For a next step of applicability truly orthogonal photoswitching is highly desirable but to date such independent addressability of different photoswitches remains to be highly challenging. In this work we present the first example of all&#8208;visible, all&#8208;light responsive, and path independent orthogonal photoswitching. By combining two recently developed indigoid photoswitches &#8208;&#160;peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo and a rhodanine&#8208;based chromophore &#8208; a four&#8208;state system is established and each state can be accessed in high yields completely independently and also with visible light irradiation only. The four states give rise to four different colors, which can be transferred to a solid polymer matrix yielding a versatile multi&#8208;state photochromic material. Further, combination with a fluorescent dye as third component is possible, demonstrating applicability of this orthogonal photoswitching system in all&#8208;photonic molecular logic behavior and information processing.</dc:description>

         <title>Directional Bias in Molecular Photogearing Evidenced by LED&#8208;Coupled Chiral Cryo&#8208;HPLC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular gearing systems are technomimetic nanoscale analogues to complex geared machinery in the macroscopic world and are likewise defined as systems incorporating intermeshed elements which perform correlated rotational motions by mechanical engagement. Only recently, new methods to actively drive molecular gearing motions instead of relying on passive thermal activation have been developed. Further progress in this endeavor will pave the way for unidirectional molecular gearing devices with a distinct type of molecular machine awaiting its realization. Within this work an essential step towards this goal is achieved by evidencing directional biases for the light&#8208;induced rotations in molecular photogear system 1. Using a custom&#8208;designed LED&#8208;coupled chiral cryo&#8208;HPLC setup for the in&#8208;situ irradiation of enantiomeric analytes, an intrinsic selectivity for clockwise or counterclockwise rotations was elucidated experimentally. Significant directional biases in the photogearing processes and light&#8208;induced single bond rotations (SBRs) are observed for photogear 1 with directional preferences of up to 4.8:1. Harnessing these effects will allow to rationally design and construct a fully directional molecular gearing motor in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis and Global Aromaticity of Aza&#8208;Superbenzene and Aza&#8208;Supernaphthalene at Different Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or macrocycles usually display localized aromaticity. On the other hand, incorporation of quinoidal units into the skeleton could lead to effective electron delocalization and global (anti)aromaticity. In this work, fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycle 1 and bismacrocycle 2 containing both para&#8208;quinodimethane and triphenylamine units are efficiently synthesized mainly through intermolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reaction. They can be considered as a tetraazasuperbenzene and a hexaazasupernaphthalene, respectively, due to their similar geometry and electronic structures to the benzene and naphthalene. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses reveal a largely planar geometry for both 1 and 2 and variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements disclose slow dynamic processes owing to restricted ring flipping of the phenyl rings. 1 and 2 can be easily oxidized into higher&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state species. NMR and theoretical calculations indicate that 12+ and 14+ show global anti&#8208;aromaticity and aromaticity, respectively, with a dominant 32&#960; and 30&#960; conjugation pathway, while for the bismacrocycle 2, its dication 22+, tetracation 24+ and hexacation 26+exhibit global aromaticity, antiaromaticity, and aromaticity with a 54&#960;, 52&#960; and 50&#960; conjugation pathway along the outermost backbone, respectively.</dc:description>

NMR and theoretical calculations indicate that 12+ and 14+ show global anti-aromaticity and aromaticity, respectively, with a dominant 32&#960; and 30&#960; conjugation pathway, while for the bismacrocycle 2, its dication 22+, tetracation 24+ and hexacation 26+exhibit global aromaticity, antiaromaticity, and aromaticity with a 54&#960;, 52&#960; and 50&#960; conjugation pathway along the outermost backbone, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Photocaged Microtubule&#8208;Stabilising Epothilone Allows Spatiotemporal Control of Cytoskeletal Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cytoskeleton is essential for spatial and temporal organisation of a wide range of cellular and tissue&#8208;level processes, such as proliferation, signalling, cargo transport, migration, morphogenesis, and neuronal development. Cytoskeleton research aims to study these processes by imaging, or by locally manipulating, the dynamics and organisation of cytoskeletal proteins with high spatiotemporal resolution: which matches the capabilities of optical methods. To date, no photoresponsive microtubule&#8208;stabilising tool has united all the features needed for a practical high&#8208;precision reagent: a low potency and biochemically stable non&#8208;illuminated state; then an efficient, rapid, and clean photoresponse that generates a high potency illuminated state; plus good solubility at suitable working concentrations; and efficient synthetic access. We now present CouEpo, a photocaged epothilone microtubule&#8208;stabilising reagent that combines these needs. Its potency increases approximately 100&#8208;fold upon violet/blue irradiation to reach low&#8208;nanomolar values, allowing efficient photocontrol of microtubule dynamics in live cells, and even the generation of cellular asymmetries in microtubule architecture and cell dynamics. CouEpo is thus a high&#8208;performance tool compound that can support high&#8208;precision research into many microtubule&#8208;associated processes, from biophysics to transport, cell motility, and neuronal physiology.</dc:description>

         <title>Pomotrelvir and Nirmatrelvir Binding and

Reactivity with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease: Implications for Resistance Mechanisms from Computations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We investigate the inhibition mechanism between pomotrelvir and the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease using molecular mechanics and quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics simulations. Alchemical transformations where each Pi group of pomotrelvir was transformed into its counterpart in nirmatrelvir were performed to unravel the individual contribution of each group to the binding and reaction processes. We have shown that while a &#947;&#8208;lactam ring is preferred at position P1, a &#948;&#8208;lactam ring is a reasonable alternative. For the P2 position, tertiary amines are preferred with respect to secondary amines. Flexible side chains at P2 position can disrupt the preorganization of the active site, favouring the exploration of non&#8208;reactive conformations. The substitution of the P2 group of pomotrelvir by that of nirmatrelvir resulted in a compound, named as C2, that presents better binding free energy and a higher population of reactive conformations in the Michaelis complex. Analysis of the chemical reaction to form the covalent complex has shown a similar reaction mechanism and activation free energies for pomotrelvir, nirmatrelvir and C2. We hope that these findings could be useful to design better inhibitors to fight present and future variants of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Skeletal Indole Editing via Nitrogen Atom Insertion by Sustainable Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>Skeletal molecular editing gained considerable recent momentum and emerged as a uniquely powerful tool for late&#8208;stage diversifications. Thus far, superstoichiometric amounts of costly hypervalent iodine(III) reagents were largely required for skeletal indole editing. In contrast, we herein show that electricity enables sustainable nitrogen atom insertion reactions to give bio&#8208;relevant quinazoline scaffolds without stoichiometric chemical redox&#8208;waste product. The transition metal&#8208;free electro&#8208;editing was enabled by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and proved robust on scale, while tolerating a variety of valuable functional groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen, Chalcogen, Pnictogen, and Tetrel Bonding in Non&#8208;Covalent Organocatalysis: An Update</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments on the use of non&#8208;transient non&#8208;covalent interactions based on elements of groups 14&#8211;17 in organic synthesis and organocatalysis are discussed. While halogen and chalcogen bonding are now clearly established in this area, applications of pnictogen and particularly tetrel bonding are only starting to emerge.







Abstract
The use of noncovalent interactions based on electrophilic halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, or tetrel centers in organocatalysis has gained noticeable attention. Herein, we provide an overview on the most important developments in the last years with a clear focus on experimental studies and on catalysts which act via such non&#8208;transient interactions.

         <title>Accelerated Screening of Alternative DNA Base&#8208;Organic Molecule&#8208;Base Architectures via Integrated Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collaborative protocol of fast theoretical simulation and convenient experimental validation was developed for large&#8208;scale screening of alternative DNA base&#8208;organic molecule&#8208;base architectures beyond Watson&#8211;Crick pairs, thereby expanding molecule&#8208;mediated non&#8208;classical DNA self&#8208;assembly structures.







Abstract
Organic molecule&#8208;mediated noncanonical DNA self&#8208;assembly expands the standard DNA base&#8208;pairing alphabets. However, only a very limited number of small molecules have been recognized as mediators because of the tedious and complicated experiments like crystallization and microscopy imaging. Here we present an integrative screening protocol incorporating molecular dynamics (MD) for fast theoretical simulation and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for convenient experimental validation. Melamine, the molecule that was confirmed mediating noncanonical DNA base&#8208;pairing, and 38 other candidate molecules were applied to demonstrate the feasibility of this protocol. We successfully identified seven stable noncanonical DNA duplex structures, and another eight novel structures with sub&#8208;stability. In addition, we discovered that hairpins at both ends can significantly stabilize the noncanonical DNA structures, providing a guideline to design small organic molecule&#8208;incorporated DNA structures. Such an efficient screening protocol will accelerate the design of alternative DNA&#8208;molecule architectures beyond Watson&#8211;Crick pairs. Considering the wide range of potential mediators, it will also facilitate applications such as noncovalent, highly dense loading of drug molecules in DNA&#8208;based delivery system and probe design for sensitive detection of certain molecules.

         <title>Chloride&#8208; and Hydrosulfide&#8208;Bound 2Fe Complexes as Models of the Oxygen&#8208;Stable State of [FeFe] Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights into the oxygen&#8208;stable state of the H&#8208;cluster are revealed. Terminal Cl&#8208; and SH&#8208;bound [2Fe&#8208;2S] complexes, bearing relevance to the oxygen&#8208;stable state within a biological context, demonstrate a striking structural resemblance to the enzymatic Hinact state. These complexes exhibit notable resistance against oxygen&#8208;induced decomposition, and labile and kinetically controlled binding of the Cl&#8208;/SH&#8208;group.







Abstract
[FeFe] hydrogenases demonstrate remarkable catalytic efficiency in hydrogen evolution and oxidation processes. However, susceptibility of these enzymes to oxygen&#8208;induced degradation impedes their practical deployment in hydrogen&#8208;production devices and fuel cells. Recent investigations into the oxygen&#8208;stable (Hinact) state of the H&#8208;cluster revealed its inherent capacity to resist oxygen degradation. Herein, we present findings on Cl&#8208; and SH&#8208;bound [2Fe&#8208;2S] complexes, bearing relevance to the oxygen&#8208;stable state within a biological context. A characteristic attribute of these complexes is the terminal Cl&#8722;/SH&#8722; ligation to the iron center bearing the CO bridge. Structural analysis of the t&#8208;Cl demonstrates a striking resemblance to the Hinact state of DdHydAB and CbA5H. The t&#8208;Cl/t&#8208;SH exhibit reversible oxidation, with both redox species, electronically, being the first biomimetic analogs to the Htrans and Hinact states. These complexes exhibit notable resistance against oxygen&#8208;induced decomposition, supporting the potential oxygen&#8208;resistant nature of the Htrans and Hinact states. The swift reductive release of the Cl&#8208;/SH&#8208;group demonstrates its labile and kinetically controlled binding. The findings garnered from these investigations offer valuable insights into properties of the enzymatic O2&#8208;stable state, and key factors governing deactivation and reactivation conversion. This work contributes to the advancement of bio&#8208;inspired molecular catalysts and the integration of enzymes and artificial catalysts into H2&#8208;evolution devices and fuel&#8208;cell applications.

These complexes exhibit notable resistance against oxygen-induced decomposition, and labile and kinetically controlled binding of the Cl-/SH-group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[FeFe] hydrogenases demonstrate remarkable catalytic efficiency in hydrogen evolution and oxidation processes. However, susceptibility of these enzymes to oxygen-induced degradation impedes their practical deployment in hydrogen-production devices and fuel cells. Recent investigations into the oxygen-stable (H&lt;sub&gt;inact&lt;/sub&gt;) state of the H-cluster revealed its inherent capacity to resist oxygen degradation. Herein, we present findings on Cl- and SH-bound [2Fe-2S] complexes, bearing relevance to the oxygen-stable state within a biological context. A characteristic attribute of these complexes is the terminal Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/SH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ligation to the iron center bearing the CO bridge. Structural analysis of the t-Cl demonstrates a striking resemblance to the H&lt;sub&gt;inact&lt;/sub&gt; state of &lt;i&gt;Dd&lt;/i&gt;HydAB and &lt;i&gt;Cb&lt;/i&gt;A5H. The t-Cl/t-SH exhibit reversible oxidation, with both redox species, electronically, being the first biomimetic analogs to the H&lt;sub&gt;trans&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;inact&lt;/sub&gt; states. These complexes exhibit notable resistance against oxygen-induced decomposition, supporting the potential oxygen-resistant nature of the H&lt;sub&gt;trans&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;inact&lt;/sub&gt; states. The swift reductive release of the Cl-/SH-group demonstrates its labile and kinetically controlled binding. The findings garnered from these investigations offer valuable insights into properties of the enzymatic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-stable state, and key factors governing deactivation and reactivation conversion. This work contributes to the advancement of bio-inspired molecular catalysts and the integration of enzymes and artificial catalysts into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-evolution devices and fuel-cell applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Simple Organo&#8208;Electrocatalysis System for the Chlor&#8208;Related Industry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalyst has been applied in the field of electrochemistry. However, the large&#8208;scale production of the catalyst is hard to realize and the catalytic system nowadays is too complex to be applied in the practical production. This work first provides a highly efficient electro&#8208;organocatalyst for chloride ion oxidation both in acidic and neutral processes and cuts the cost down to 0.005&#8201;% compared with that of the dimensionally stable anode (DSA), providing an efficient choice for the chlor&#8208;related industry.







Abstract
Consuming a substantial quantum of energy (~165&#8197;TW&#8201;h), the chlor&#8208;alkali industry garners considerable scholarly and industrial interest, with the anode reaction involving the oxidation of chloride ions being a paramount determinant of reaction rates. While the dimensionally stable anode (DSA) displays commendable catalytic activity and longevity, they rely on precious metals and exhibit a non&#8208;negligible side reaction in sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) production, underscoring the appeal of metal&#8208;free alternatives. However, the molecules and systems currently available are characterized by intricate complexity and are not amenable to large&#8208;scale production. Herein, we have successfully developed an economical and highly efficient molecular catalyst, demonstrating superior performance compared with the former organic molecules in the chloride ion oxidation process (COP) for the production of both chlorine gas (Cl2) and NaClO. The molecule of 2N only needs 92&#8197;mV to reach a current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a small cost of only 0.002&#8197;$&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, we propose a novel mechanism underpinned by non&#8208;covalent interactions, serving as the foundation for an innovative approach to the design of efficient anodes for the COP.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Dynamic Activation of Copper/Silicon Interface for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unprecedentedly reveals the dynamic phase transformation of forming irreversible silicide at Cu/BSi interface during photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, which was validated to originate from the atomic interdiffusion between Cu and Si driven by a light&#8208;induced dynamic activation process. The adaptive junction is activated by an expansion of interatomic Cu&#8722;Cu distance, resulting in a remarkable 16&#8208;fold improvement in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products.







Abstract
Numerous studies have shown a fact that phase transformation and/or reconstruction are likely to occur and play crucial roles in electrochemical scenarios. Nevertheless, a decisive factor behind the diverse photoelectrochemical activity and selectivity of various copper/silicon photoelectrodes is still largely debated and missing in the community, especially the possibly dynamic behaviors of metal catalyst/semiconductor interface. Herein, through in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope, a model system of Cu nanocrystals with well&#8208;defined facets on black p&#8208;type silicon (BSi) is unprecedentedly demonstrated to reveal the dynamic phase transformation of forming irreversible silicide at Cu nanocrystal&#8208;BSi interface during photoelectrocatalysis, which is validated to originate from the atomic interdiffusion between Cu and Si driven by light&#8208;induced dynamic activation process. Significantly, the adaptive junction at Cu&#8722;Si interface is activated by an expansion of interatomic Cu&#8722;Cu distance for CO2 electroreduction, which efficiently restricts the C&#8722;C coupling pathway but strengthens the bonding with key intermediate of *CHO for CH4 yield, resulting in a remarkable 16&#8208;fold improvement in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products and an intriguing selectivity switch. This work offers new insights into dynamic structural transformations of metal/semiconductor junction and design of highly efficient catalysts toward photosynthesis.

         <dc:description>
A tale of a &#8216;naked&#8217; acyclic gallyl and indyl compounds: By exploiting the electronic prowess of N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy (NHBO) groups, &#8242;naked&#8242; acyclic gallyl and indyl anions from [KGa{OB(NDippCH)2}2] and [KIn{OB(NDippCH)2}2] were obtained by K+ extraction, thereby resulting in the first O&#8208;ligated gallyl/indyl systems. The nucleophilicity of these trielyl species can be tuned by the presence of the K+ counterion.







Abstract
By exploiting the electronic capabilities of the N&#8208;heterocyclic boryloxy (NHBO) ligand, we have synthesized &#8220;naked&#8221; acyclic gallyl [Ga{OB(NDippCH)2}2]&#8722; and indyl [In{OB(NDippCH)2}2]&#8722; anions (as their [K(2.2.2&#8208;crypt)]+ salts) through K+ abstraction from [KGa{OB(NDippCH)2}2] and [KIn{OB(NDippCH)2}2] using 2.2.2&#8208;crypt. These systems represent the first O&#8208;ligated gallyl/indyl systems, are ultimately accessed from cyclopentadienyl GaI/InI precursors by substitution chemistry, and display nucleophilic reactivity which is strongly influenced by the presence (or otherwise) of the K+ counterion.

Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,n&#8208;remote aminoacetoxylation of cis&#8208;alkenes has been developed using PhI(OAc)2 as an oxidant, providing the acetoxylated lactams with excellent enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions. The sterically hindered pyridine&#8208;oxazoline (Pyox) L3 with a tert&#8208;butyl group in oxazoline ring and propyl group in C6 position of pyridinyl is vital for the reaction, where the former is good for asymmetric aminopalladation step and the latter for the chain walking process.

         <title>A Versatile Microfluidic Platform for Extravasation Studies Based on DNA Origami&#8212;Cell Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>

Microfluidic device to study cancer cell extravasation that mimics the endothelial barrier using a porous membrane decorated with DNA origami nanostructures displaying adhesion peptides to circulating cancer cells. The device allows visualization of cell transmigration under physiological flow conditions, revealing influences of adhesion peptide type, spatial arrangement, and density on the extravasation of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells.







Abstract
The adhesion of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to the endothelial lumen and their extravasation to surrounding tissues are crucial in the seeding of metastases and remain the most complex events of the metastatic cascade to study. Integrins expressed on CTCs are major regulators of the extravasation process. This knowledge is primarily derived from animal models and biomimetic systems based on artificial endothelial layers, but these methods have ethical or technical limitations. We present a versatile microfluidic device to study cancer cell extravasation that mimics the endothelial barrier by using a porous membrane functionalized with DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) that display nanoscale patterns of adhesion peptides to circulating cancer cells. The device simulates physiological flow conditions and allows direct visualization of cell transmigration through microchannel pores using 3D confocal imaging. Using this system, we studied integrin&#8208;specific adhesion in the absence of other adhesive events. Specifically, we show that the transmigration ability of the metastatic cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 is influenced by the type, distance, and density of adhesion peptides present on the DONs. Furthermore, studies with mixed ligand systems indicate that integrins binding to RGD (arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid) and IDS (isoleucine&#8208;aspartic acid&#8208;serine) did not synergistically enhance the extravasation process of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells.

         <title>NETosis&#8208;Inspired Cell Surface&#8208;Constrained Framework Nucleic Acids Traps (FNATs) for Cascaded Extracellular Recognition and Cellular Behavior Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon pathogenic stimulation, activated neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), capturing and killing microbes. Inspired by this, we introduce framework nucleic acid traps (FNATs), a DNA nanoplatform for dynamic molecule recognition and cellular behavior modulation. This platform visualizes extracellular activities and manipulates cell behaviors using programmable DNA devices.







Abstract
Upon pathogenic stimulation, activated neutrophils release nuclear DNA into the extracellular environment, forming web&#8208;like DNA structures known as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which capture and kill bacteria, fungi, and cancer cells. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as NETosis. Inspired by this, we introduce a cell surface&#8208;constrained web&#8208;like framework nucleic acids traps (FNATs) with programmable extracellular recognition capability and cellular behavior modulation. This approach facilitates dynamic key chemical signaling molecule recognition such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is elevated in the extracellular microenvironment, and triggers FNA self&#8208;assembly. This, in turn, leads to in situ tightly interwoven FNAs formation on the cell surface, thereby inhibiting target cell migration. Furthermore, it activates a photosensitizer&#8208;capturing switch, chlorin e6 (Ce6), and induces cell self&#8208;destruction. This cascade platform provides new potential tools for visualizing dynamic extracellular activities and manipulating cellular behaviors using programmable in situ self&#8208;assembling DNA molecular devices.

         <title>Picturing the Gap Between the Performance and US&#8208;DOE's Hydrogen Storage Target: A Data&#8208;Driven Model for MgH2 Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a data&#8208;driven strategy, we developed models to illustrate the structure&#8208;performance relationships of MgH2&#8208;based materials in solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage. This model also shows the current gap between their performance and the US&#8208;DOE goal.







Abstract
Developing solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage materials is as pressing as ever, which requires a comprehensive understanding of the dehydrogenation chemistry of a solid&#8208;state hydride. Transition state search and kinetics calculations are essential to understanding and designing high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage materials by filling in the knowledge gap that current experimental techniques cannot measure. However, the ab initio analysis of these processes is computationally expensive and time&#8208;consuming. Searching for descriptors to accurately predict the energy barrier is urgently needed, to accelerate the prediction of hydrogen storage material properties and identify the opportunities and challenges in this field. Herein, we develop a data&#8208;driven model to describe and predict the dehydrogenation barriers of a typical solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage material, magnesium hydride (MgH2), based on the combination of the crystal Hamilton population orbital of Mg&#8722;H bond and the distance between atomic hydrogen. By deriving the distance energy ratio, this model elucidates the key chemistry of the reaction kinetics. All the parameters in this model can be directly calculated with significantly less computational cost than conventional transition state search, so that the dehydrogenation performance of hydrogen storage materials can be predicted efficiently. Finally, we found that this model leads to excellent agreement with typical experimental measurements reported to date and provides clear design guidelines on how to propel the performance of MgH2 closer to the target set by the United States Department of Energy (US&#8208;DOE).

         <title>Ternary Rotational Polyanion Coupling Enables Fast Li Ion Dynamics in Tetrafluoroborate Ion Doped Antiperovskite Li2OHCl Solid Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Knowledge on the Li ion dynamics associated with more than two types of polyanions is still lacking. In this work, a novel three&#8208;body responsive dynamics is stimulated by the ternary coupling of OH&#8722;, BF4&#8722; and Li2&#8722;O&#8722;H octahedron movements, which efficiently reduces the activation barrier and consequently improves the Li ion conductivity.







Abstract
Li&#8208;rich antiperovskite (LiRAP) hydroxyhalides are emerging as attractive solid electrolyte (SEs) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMBs) due to their low melting point, low cost, and ease of scaling&#8208;up. The incorporation of rotational polyanions can reduce the activation energy and thus improve the Li ion conductivity of SEs. Herein, we propose a ternary rotational polyanion coupling strategy to fasten the Li ion conduction in tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) ion doped LiRAP Li2OHCl. Assisted by first&#8208;principles calculation, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, solid&#8208;state magnetic resonance and electrochemical impedance spectra, it is confirmed that Li ion transport in BF4&#8722; ion doped Li2OHCl is strongly associated with the rotational coupling among OH&#8722;, BF4&#8722; and Li2&#8722;O&#8722;H octahedrons, which enhances the Li ion conductivity for more than 1.8&#8197;times with the activation energy lowering 0.03&#8197;eV. This work provides a new perspective to design high&#8208;performance superionic conductors with multi&#8208;polyanions.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of High&#8208;Capacity Sulfur Cathodes via In&#8208;Situ Polymerization of a Porous Imine&#8208;Based Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ polymerization techniques encapsulate sulfur within microporous imine polymers, addressing the sulfur&#8208;shuttle issue and boosting electrochemical performance. This innovative strategy marks a new direction for creating efficient sulfur&#8208;based cathodes in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries, essential for electronics and electric vehicles, predominantly use cathodes made from critical materials like cobalt. Sulfur&#8208;based cathodes, offering a high theoretical capacity of 1675&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and environmental advantages due to sulfur's abundance and lower toxicity, present a more sustainable alternative. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sulfur&#8208;based electrodes do not reach the theoretical capacities, mainly because conventional electrode production relies on mixing of components into weakly coordinated slurries. Consequently, sulfur&#8216;s mobility leads to battery degradation&#8212;an effect known as the &#8220;sulfur&#8208;shuttle&#8221;. This study introduces a solution by developing a microporous, covalently&#8208;bonded, imine&#8208;based polymer network grown in situ around sulfur particles on the current collector.

     alt="One-Pot Synthesis of High-Capacity Sulfur Cathodes via In-Situ Polymerization of a Porous Imine-Based Polymer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situ polymerization techniques encapsulate sulfur within microporous imine polymers, addressing the sulfur-shuttle issue and boosting electrochemical performance. This innovative strategy marks a new direction for creating efficient sulfur-based cathodes in lithium-sulfur batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium-ion batteries, essential for electronics and electric vehicles, predominantly use cathodes made from critical materials like cobalt. Sulfur-based cathodes, offering a high theoretical capacity of 1675&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and environmental advantages due to sulfur's abundance and lower toxicity, present a more sustainable alternative. However, state-of-the-art sulfur-based electrodes do not reach the theoretical capacities, mainly because conventional electrode production relies on mixing of components into weakly coordinated slurries. Consequently, sulfur&#8216;s mobility leads to battery degradation&#8212;an effect known as the &#8220;sulfur-shuttle&#8221;. This study introduces a solution by developing a microporous, covalently-bonded, imine-based polymer network grown in situ around sulfur particles on the current collector. The polymer network (i) enables selective transport of electrolyte and Li-ions through pores of defined size, and (ii) acts as a robust host to retain the active component of the electrode (sulfur species). The resulting cathode has superior rate performance from 0.1&#8197;C (1360&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) to 3&#8197;C (807&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Demonstrating a high-performance, sustainable sulfur cathode produced via a simple one-pot process, our research underlines the potential of microporous polymers in addressing sulfur diffusion issues, paving the way for sulfur electrodes as viable alternatives to traditional metal-based cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanical&#8208;Force&#8208;Induced Non&#8208;spontaneous Dehalogenative Deuteration of Aromatic Iodides Enabled by Using Piezoelectric Materials as a Redox Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a catalytic, non&#8208;spontaneous dehalogenation process for the deuteration of aryl iodides using BaTiO3 as a catalyst. This method achieves high levels of deuterium incorporation using only 2.0&#8197;equivalents of D2O, which additionally acts as an electron donor. Furthermore, deuteration enhances the biological activity of D&#8208;ipriflavone, markedly inhibiting osteoclast differentiation.







Abstract
The development of green and efficient deuteration methods is of great significance for various fields such as organic synthesis, analytical chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. Herein, we have developed a dehalogenative deuteration strategy using piezoelectric materials as catalysts in a solid&#8208;phase system under ball&#8208;milling conditions. This non&#8208;spontaneous reaction is induced by mechanical force. D2O can serve as both a deuterium source and an electron donor in the transformation, eliminating the need for additional stoichiometric exogenous reductants. A series of (hetero)aryl iodides can be transformed into deuterated products with high deuterium incorporation. This method not only effectively overcomes existing synthetic challenges but can also be used for deuterium labelling of drug molecules and derivatives. Bioactivity experiments with deuterated drug molecule suggest that the D&#8208;ipriflavone enhances the inhibitory effects on osteoclast differentiation of BMDMs in vitro.

         <title>Reconstructing Solvation Structure by Steric Hindrance&#8208;Coordination Push&#8208;Pull of Dipolymer&#8208;H2O&#8208;Zn2+ toward Long&#8208;life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;chained dipolymer with steric hindrance and coordination reconstructs the Zn2+ solvation structure in liquid electrolyte by a balanced push&#8208;pull dynamic on Zn2+ and H2O, forms a dipolymer&#8208;inorganic hybrid SEI in situ, and regulates the electrochemical reduction kinetics, considerably prolonging the cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries are prospective energy storge devices due to their intrinsically high safety and cost effectiveness. Yet, uneven deposition of zinc ions in electrochemical reduction and side reactions at the anode interface significantly hinder their development and application. Here, we propose a solvation&#8208;interface attenuation strategy enabled by a frustrated tertiary amine amphiphilic dipolymer electrolyte additive. The configuration of superhydrophilic segments with covalently bonded lipophilic spacers enables coupled steric hindrance/coordination, which establishes a balanced push&#8208;pull dynamic of dipolymer&#8208;H2O&#8208;Zn2+. Such interplay reconstructs the solvation structure of Zn2+ and allows the formation of a stable dipolymer&#8208;inorganic hybrid solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. This SEI layer effectively shields the zinc&#8208;metal anode from water and anions, significantly reducing side reactions. In addition, the dipolymer adsorbed at the zinc&#8208;metal anode interface regulates the interfacial electrochemical reduction kinetics and ensures uniform zinc deposition. As a result, the Zn&#8722;Zn symmetric cells with dipolymer&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibit remarkable cycling stability exceeding 5800&#8197;h (242&#8197;days). The Zn&#8208;NVO batteries and Zn&#8208;AC hybrid ion supercapacitors also deliver stable cycling for up to 1440&#8197;h (60&#8197;days) with high&#8208;capacity retention over 80&#8201;%. This research demonstrates the potential to facilitate the development and commercialization of zinc&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Ligand Meta&#8208;Anchoring Strategy in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Remarkable Promotion of Quantum Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy is reported to promote the quantum yields of luminescent metal&#8211;organic frameworks through the restriction of intramolecular motions.







Abstract
Aggregation is a conventional method to enhance the quantum yields (QYs) of pure organic luminophores due to the restriction of intramolecular motions (RIM). However, how to realize RIM in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is still unclear and challenging. In this work, the ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy is first proposed and proved to be an effective and systematic approach to restrict the intramolecular motions of MOFs for the QY improvement. By simply shifting the substituent position in the ligand from para to meta, the QY of the resulting MOF is significantly enhanced by eleven&#8208;fold. The value is even higher than that of ligand aggregates, demonstrating the strong RIM effect of this ligand meta&#8208;anchoring strategy. The introduction of co&#8208;ligand induces the appearance of visible yellow room temperature phosphorescence with a lifetime of 222&#8197;ms due to the QY enhancement and the charge transfer between the donor and accepter units. The present work thus broadens the understanding of the RIM mechanism from a new perspective, develops a novel method to realize RIM and expands the applicable objects from pure organic materials to organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Driven Dispersion of Bismuth Nanoparticles among Carbon Matrix for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique thermal&#8208;driven strategy is proposed to re&#8208;disperse bismuth core into nanoparticles among porous carbon shell, inhibiting the aggregation to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability.







Abstract
The poor electrocatalytic stability and rapid deactivation of metal electrocatalysts are always present in the electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to the harsh reduction condition. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable dispersion of ultrafine bismuth nanoparticles among the hollow carbon shell (Bi@C&#8208;700&#8208;4) simply by a thermal&#8208;driven diffusion process. The confinement effect of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix is able to low the surface energy of bismuth nanoparticles against the easy aggregation commonly observed for the thermal treatment. On the basis of the synergistic effect and confinement effect between bismuth nanoparticles and carbon matrix, the highly dispersed active sites render the obviously improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for CO2 reduction into formate. The in situ experimental observations on the reduction process and theoretical calculations reveal that the incorporation of bismuth nanoparticles with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix would promote the activation of CO2 and the easy formation of key intermediate (*OCHO), thus leading the enhanced electrocatalytic activity, with a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of formate about 94.8&#8201;% and the long&#8208;time stability. Furthermore, the coupling of an anode for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) in solar&#8208;driven system renders the high 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) yield of 81.2&#8201;%, presenting the impressive solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

Furthermore, the coupling of an anode for 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) in solar-driven system renders the high 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) yield of 81.2&#8201;%, presenting the impressive solar-to-fuel conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interlayer Structure Manipulation of FeOCl/MXene with Soft/Hard Interface Design for Safe Water Production Using Dechlorination Battery Deionization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The soft/hard interfaces assembly was designed by manipulating the interlayer structure, in which Ti3C2Tx dressed the fragile FeOCl with a soft and conductive suit, solving the thorny troubles of structural stability and electronic conductivity for FeOCl. The rigidity and flexibility integrated FeOCl/Ti3C2Tx worked for electrochemical dechlorination with simultaneous energy recovery, demonstrating the feasibility of dechlorination battery.







Abstract
Suffering from the susceptibility to decomposition, the potential electrochemical application of FeOCl has greatly been hindered. The rational design of the soft&#8208;hard material interface can effectively address the challenge of stress concentration and thus decomposition that may occur in the electrodes during charging and discharging. Herein, interlayer structure manipulation of FeOCl/MXene using soft&#8208;hard interface design method were conducted for electrochemical dechlorination. FeOCl was encapsulated in Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly layer by layer to form a soft&#8208;hard mechanical hierarchical structure, in which Ti3C2Tx was used as flexible buffer layers to relieve the huge volume change of FeOCl during Cl&#8722; intercalation/deintercalation and constructed a conductive network for fast charge transfer. The CDI dechlorination system of FeOCl/Ti3C2Tx delivered outstanding Cl&#8722; adsorption capacity (158.47 &#177; 6.98&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), rate (6.07 &#177; 0.35&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1), and stability (over 94.49&#8201;% in 30 cycles), and achieved considerable energy recovery (21.14 &#177; 0.25&#8201;%). The superior dechlorination performance was proved to originate from the Fe2+/Fe3+ topochemical transformation and the deformation constraint effect of Ti3C2Tx on FeOCl. Our interfacial design strategy enables a hard&#8208;to&#8208;soft integration capacity, which can serve as a universal technology for solving the traditional problem of electrode volume expansion.

         <title>Merging High&#8208;Pressure Syngas Metal Catalysis and Biocatalysis in Tandem One&#8208;Pot Processes for the Synthesis of Nonchiral and Chiral Alcohols from Alkenes in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem one&#8208;pot process combining high&#8208;pressure hydroformylation of 1&#8208;octene and enzymatic reduction is demonstrated, leading to &gt;99&#8201;% conversion and 80&#8201;% yield of the isolated alcohol isomers. This concept was extended to the hydroformylation of styrene and enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution, resulting in excellent conversion (&gt;99&#8201;%) and an enantiomeric ratio of 91&#8201;:&#8201;9 for (S)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanol.







Abstract
While simultaneously proceeding reactions are among the most fascinating features of biosynthesis, this concept of tandem processes also offers high potential in the chemical industry in terms of less waste production and improved process efficiency and sustainability. Although examples of one&#8208;pot chemoenzymatic syntheses exist, the combination of completely different reaction types is rare. Herein, we demonstrate that extreme &#8220;antipodes&#8221; of the &#8220;worlds of catalysis&#8221;, such as syngas&#8208;based high&#8208;pressure hydroformylation and biocatalyzed reduction, can be combined within a tandem&#8208;type one&#8208;pot process in water. No significant deactivation was found for either the biocatalyst or the chemocatalyst. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the one&#8208;pot process starting from 1&#8208;octene was established with &gt;99&#8201;% conversion and 80&#8201;% isolated yield of the desired alcohol isomers. All necessary components for hydroformylation and biocatalysis were added to the reactor from the beginning. This concept has been extended to the enantioselective synthesis of chiral products by conducting the hydroformylation of styrene and an enzymatic dynamic kinetic resolution in a tandem mode, leading to an excellent conversion of &gt;99&#8201;% and an enantiomeric ratio of 91&#8201;:&#8201;9 for (S)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanol. The overall process runs in water under mild and energy&#8208;saving conditions, without any need for intermediate isolation.

         <title>Solvation Properties of Neutral Gold Species in Supercritical Water Studied By THz Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold clusters in aqueous supercritial solution are found to interact very strongly with the solvent, forming well&#8208;defined metal&#8208;water solvation complexes. Their THz spectrum is distinctly different from that of supercritical water, which can be exploited to probe such neutral metal species in hydrothermal fluids.







Abstract
Supercritical water provides distinctly different solvation properties compared to what is known from liquid water. Despite its prevalence deep in the Earth's crust and its role in chemosynthetic ecosystems in the vicinity of hydrothermal vents, molecular insights into its solvation mechanisms are still very scarce compared to what is known for liquid water. Recently, neutral metal particles have been detected in hydrothermal fluids and proposed to explain the transport of gold species to ore deposits on Earth. Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we elucidate the solvation properties of small gold species at supercritical conditions. The neutral metal clusters themselves contribute enormous THz intensity not because of their intramolecular vibrations, but due to their pronounced electronic polarization coupling to the dynamical supercritical solvent, leading to a continuum absorption up to about 1000&#8197;cm&#8722;1. On top, long&#8208;lived interactions between the gold clusters and solvation water leads at these supercritical conditions to a sharp THz resonance that happens to be close to the one due to H&#8208;bonding in liquid water at ambient conditions. The resulting distinct resonances can be used to analyse the solvation properties of neutral metal particles in supercritical aqueous solutions.

         <title>Identification of &#8220;Structural Pin&#8221; Interactions and their Significance for the Conformational Control of Macrocyclic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we identify structural pins as intramolecular hydrogen bonds in macrocycles that are predominantly responsible for conformational stabilization. Characterization and structural analysis of macrocycles with NMR and molecular modelling indicates that removal of a structural pin drastically influences the conformation of the entire ring, resulting in novel states with increased conformational heterogeneity.







Abstract
While peptide macrocycles with rigidified conformations have proven to be useful in the design of chemical probes of protein targets, conformational flexibility and rapid interconversion can be equally vital for biological activity and favorable physicochemical properties. This study introduces the concept of &#8220;structural pin&#8221;, which describes a hydrogen bond that is largely responsible for stabilizing the entire macrocycle backbone conformation. Structural analysis of macrocycles using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular modelling and X&#8208;ray diffraction indicates that disruption of the structural pin can drastically influence the conformation of the entire ring, resulting in novel states with increased flexibility. This finding provides a new tool to interrogate dynamic behaviour of macrocycles. Identification of structural pins offers a useful conceptual framework to understand positions that can either be modified to give flexible structures or retained to maintain the rigidity of the scaffold.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Enhanced Photoreforming of Biomass Furans over a Urea&#8208;Incorporated Cu(II) Porphyrin Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A urea&#8208;incorporated porphyrin framework can activate molecular oxygen to generate selectively &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 and enable the flat adsorption of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural in a low&#8208;energy configuration leveraging on hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, leading to highly efficient photo&#8208;oxidation that produces bioplastic monomers from renewable feedstocks without over&#8208;oxidation and photo&#8208;corrosion.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven upgrading of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxylmethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) holds great promise for sustainable production of bio&#8208;plastics and resins. However, the process is limited by poor selectivity and sluggish kinetics due to the vertical coordination of HMF at relatively strong metal sites. Here, we purposely developed a Cu(II) porphyrin framework featuring side&#8208;chain incorporated urea linkages, denoted as TBUPP&#8722;Cu MOF, to render HMF a weak hydrogen bond at the urea site and flat adsorption via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking with the benzene moiety. The unique configuration promotes the approaching of &#8722;CHO of HMF to the photoexcited porphyrin ring towards kinetically and thermodynamically favourable intermediate formation and subsequent desorption. The charge localisation and orbital energy alignment enable the selective activation of O2 over the porphyrin to generate &#8901;O2&#8722; and 1O2 instead of highly oxidative H2O2 and &#8901;OH via spin&#8208;flip electron transfer, which drive the ambient oxidation of proximal &#8722;CHO. The effective utilisation of redox species and circumvented over&#8208;oxidation facilitate a FDCA selectivity of &gt;90&#8201;% with a high turnover number of 193&#8197;molHMF&#8201;molCu&#8722;1. The facile purification of high&#8208;purity FDCA and zero&#8208;waste recycling of intermediates and durable catalyst feature TBUPP&#8722;Cu MOF a promising photo&#8208;oxidation platform towards net&#8208;zero biorefining and organic transformations.

         <title>tert&#8208;Butyl as a Functional Group: Non&#8208;Directed Catalytic Hydroxylation of Sterically Congested Primary C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers site&#8208;selective non&#8208;directed hydroxylation of remote primary C&#8722;H bonds in tert&#8208;butyl groups employing hydrogen peroxide and the highly electrophilic Mn(CF3bpeb) catalyst in nonafluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl alcohol (NFTBA).







Abstract
The tert&#8208;butyl group is a common aliphatic motif extensively employed to implement steric congestion and conformational rigidity in organic and organometallic molecules. Because of the combination of a high bond dissociation energy (~100&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and limited accessibility, in the absence of directing groups, neither radical nor organometallic approaches are effective for the chemical modification of tert&#8208;butyl C&#8722;H bonds. Herein we overcome these limits by employing a highly electrophilic manganese catalyst, [Mn(CF3bpeb)(OTf)2], that operates in the strong hydrogen bond donor solvent nonafluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl alcohol (NFTBA) and catalytically activates hydrogen peroxide to generate a powerful manganese&#8208;oxo species that effectively oxidizes tert&#8208;butyl C&#8722;H bonds. Leveraging on the interplay of steric, electronic, medium and torsional effects, site&#8208;selective and product chemoselective hydroxylation of the tert&#8208;butyl group is accomplished with broad reaction scope, delivering primary alcohols as largely dominant products in preparative yields. Late&#8208;stage hydroxylation at tert&#8208;butyl sites is demonstrated on 6 densely functionalized molecules of pharmaceutical interest. This work uncovers a novel disconnection approach, harnessing tert&#8208;butyl as a potential functional group in strategic synthetic planning for complex molecular architectures.

         <title>Microwave Assisted Fast Synthesis of a Donor&#8208;Acceptor COF Towards Photooxidative Amidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a microwave&#8208;assisted rapid synthesis (in time scale, t=10&#8197;seconds to 10&#8197;minutes) of a D&#8722;A based covalent organic framework, TzPm&#8208;COF towards photooxidative amidation reaction from aldehyde and amine. This photocatalytic approach works well with a variety of substituted aromatic aldehydes having electron&#8208;withdrawing or donating groups and cyclic, acyclic, primary or secondary amines with moderate to high yield.







Abstract
The synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) at bulk scale require robust, straightforward, and cost&#8208;effective techniques. However, the traditional solvothermal synthetic methods of COFs suffer low scalability as well as requirement of sensitive reaction environment and multiday reaction time (2&#8211;10&#8197;days) which greatly restricts their practical application. Here, we report microwave assisted rapid and optimized synthesis of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) based highly crystalline COF, TzPm&#8208;COF in second (10&#8197;sec) to minute (10&#8197;min) time scale. With increasing the reaction time from seconds to minutes crystallinity, porosity and morphological changes are observed for TzPm&#8208;COF. Owing to visible range light absorption, suitable band alignment, and low exciton binding energy (Eb=64.6&#8197;meV), TzPm&#8208;COF can efficaciously produce superoxide radical anion (O2.&#8722;) after activating molecular oxygen (O2) which eventually drives aerobic photooxidative amidation reaction with high recyclability. This photocatalytic approach works well with a variety of substituted aromatic aldehydes having electron&#8208;withdrawing or donating groups and cyclic, acyclic, primary or secondary amines with moderate to high yield. Furthermore, catalytic mechanism was established by monitoring the real&#8208;time reaction progress through in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopic (DRIFTS) study.

         <title>New Alkalescent Electrolyte Chemistry for Zinc&#8208;Ferricyanide Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery assembled with an alkalescent (pH=12) Zn&#8208;EDTA anolyte and Fe(CN)63&#8722;/Fe(CN)64&#8722; catholyte is constructed and has an energy density of ~74&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C and remains stable for 1800&#8197;cycles (1800&#8197;hours) at 0&#8201;&#176;C and for &gt;1400&#8197;cycles (2300&#8197;hours) at 25&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow batteries are efficiency and economical as energy storage solutions. However, they suffer from low energy density and short calendar life. The strongly alkaline conditions (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 OH&#8722;) reduce the solubility of ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide (normally only 0.4&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and induce the formation of zinc dendrites at the anode. Here, we report a new zinc&#8208;ferricyanide flow battery based on a mild alkalescent (pH&#8197;12) electrolyte. Using a chelating agent to rearrange ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide ion&#8208;solvent interactions and improve salt dissociation, we increased the solubility of ferri/ferro&#8208;cyanide to 1.7&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 and prevented zinc dendrites. Our battery has an energy density of ~74&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1catholyte at 60&#8201;&#176;C and remains stable for 1800&#8197;cycles (1800&#8197;hours) at 0&#8201;&#176;C and for &gt;1400&#8197;cycles (2300&#8197;hours) at 25&#8201;&#176;C. An alkalescent zinc&#8208;ferricyanide cell stack built using this alkalescent electrolyte stably delivers 608&#8197;W of power for ~40&#8197;days.

The strongly alkaline conditions (3&#8197;mol&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) reduce the solubility of ferri/ferro-cyanide (normally only 0.4&#8197;mol&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&#8201;&#176;C) and induce the formation of zinc dendrites at the anode. Here, we report a new zinc-ferricyanide flow battery based on a mild alkalescent (pH&#8197;12) electrolyte. Using a chelating agent to rearrange ferri/ferro-cyanide ion-solvent interactions and improve salt dissociation, we increased the solubility of ferri/ferro-cyanide to 1.7&#8197;mol&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and prevented zinc dendrites. Our battery has an energy density of ~74&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;catholyte&lt;/sub&gt; at 60&#8201;&#176;C and remains stable for 1800&#8197;cycles (1800&#8197;hours) at 0&#8201;&#176;C and for &amp;gt;1400&#8197;cycles (2300&#8197;hours) at 25&#8201;&#176;C. An alkalescent zinc-ferricyanide cell stack built using this alkalescent electrolyte stably delivers 608&#8197;W of power for ~40&#8197;days.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Thermosalient and Mechanically Compliant Organic Crystalline Optical Waveguide Switcher</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic crystalline material exhibiting both plastic bending and thermosalient behavior with reversible crystal movement during phase transition is reported. The crystals transmit light regardless of their shape or crystalline phase. This unique combination enables switching of the material&#8216;s waveguiding ability within a narrow temperature range, promising applications in heat&#8208;sensitive electronics like central processing units. Being entirely organic, it offers reduced weight compared to the materials that are currently being used in electronics.







Abstract
The dense and ordered molecular arrangements endow dynamic molecular crystals with fast response, rapid energy conversion, low energy dissipation, and strong coupling between heat/light and mechanical energy. Most of the known dynamic crystals can only respond to a single stimulus, and materials that can respond to multiple stimuli are rare. Here, we report an organic crystalline material that can be bent plastically and is also thermosalient, as its crystals can move when they undergo a reversible phase transition. The crystals transmit light regardless of their shape or crystalline phase. The combination of light transduction and reversible thermomechanical deformation provides an opportunity to switch the waveguiding capability of the material in a narrow temperature range, which holds a tremendous potential for applications in heat&#8208;averse electronic components, such as central processing units. Unlike existing electronics, the material we report here is completely organic and therefore much lighter, potentially reducing the overall weight of electronic circuits.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Growth of Convex Sphere with Adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) Interfaces for Effective C2 Production from CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tightly&#8208;coupled adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface manufactured by a bottom&#8208;up growth strategy exhibits outstanding selectivity and stability of CO2RR. The convex sphere with the favorable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface promotes the dimerization of localized *CO adsorbate, thus form the C2 products with a lowered energy barrier.







Abstract
One challenge confronting the Cu2O catalysts in the electrocatalysis of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is the reduction of active Cu(I) species, resulting in low selectivity and quick deactivation. In this study, we for the first time introduce a bottom&#8208;up growth of convex sphere with adjustable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interfaces (Cux@Cu2O convex spheres). Interestingly, the interfaces are dynamically modulated by varying hydrothermal time, thus regulating the conversion of C1 and C2 products. In particular, the 4&#8197;h hydrothermal treatment applied to Cu0.25@Cu2O convex sphere with the favorable Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface results in the highest selectivity for C2 products (90.5&#8201;%). In situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu(0)/Cu(I) interface lowers the energy barrier for the production of ethylene and ethanol while increasing the coverage of localized *CO adsorbate for increased dimerization. This work establishes a novel approach for transforming the state of valence&#8208;sensitive electrocatalysts into high&#8208;value energy&#8208;related engineering products.

         <title>Innovative Approach to Chiral Polyurethanes: Asymmetric Copolymerization with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we demonstrated the first example for the asymmetric copolymerization of various meso&#8208;epoxide with isocyanates toward the synthesis of chiral polymers with unique nitrogen functionality. Intramolecular bimetallic coordination strategies provided completely alternating copolymers with high carbamate unit content (up to 94&#8201;%) and high enantioselectivity (up to 94&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The introduction of nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups to chiral polymer backbones enables the tailoring of physical properties and offers opportunities for further post&#8208;polymerization modification. However, the substrate scope of such polymers is extremely limited because monomers having nitrogen&#8208;containing groups can change coordination state with respect to the metal centers, thus decreasing the activity and enantioselectivity and even poisoning the catalyst completely. In this paper, we report our attempts to carry out the asymmetric copolymerization of meso&#8208;epoxide with highly reactive isocyanates. In particular, we found that biphenol&#8208;linked bimetallic Co(III) complexes with multiple chiral centers are very efficient in catalyzing this asymmetric copolymerization reaction, affording optically active polyurethanes with a completely alternating nature and a high enantioselectivity of up to 94&#8201;% ee. Crucially, we identified that the steric hindrance at the phenolate ortho position of the ligand strongly influences the catalytic activity and product enantioselectivity. In addition, density functional theory calculations revealed that the highly sterically bulky substituents change the mechanism from bimetallic to monometallic, and result in the unexpected inversion of the chiral induction direction. Moreover, the high stereoregularity of the produced polyurethanes enhances their thermal stability, and they can be selectively decomposed into oxazolidinones. This study offers a versatile methodology for the synthesis of chiral polymers containing nitrogen functionalities.

         <title>Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Lipid Heterogeneity in the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane with a Super&#8208;photostable Environment&#8208;Sensitive Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly photostable and polarity&#8208;sensitive labeling agent for the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) has been developed, enabling visualization of mitochondrial cristae using STED microscopy. In combination with FLIM, it also allows the analysis of lipid heterogeneity at the single mitochondrion level. Time&#8208;lapse FLIM observations revealed that mitochondrial swelling is preceded by an increase in the IMM order resulting from lipid peroxidation.







Abstract
The inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) undergoes dynamic morphological changes, which are crucial for the maintenance of mitochondrial functions as well as cell survival. As the dynamics of the membrane are governed by its lipid components, a fluorescent probe that can sense spatiotemporal alterations in the lipid properties of the IMM over long periods of time is required to understand mitochondrial physiological functions in detail. Herein, we report a red&#8208;emissive IMM&#8208;labeling reagent with excellent photostability and sensitivity to its environment, which enables the visualization of the IMM ultrastructure using super&#8208;resolution microscopy as well as of the lipid heterogeneity based on the fluorescence lifetime at the single mitochondrion level. Combining the probe and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) showed that peroxidation of unsaturated lipids in the IMM by reactive oxygen species caused an increase in the membrane order, which took place prior to mitochondrial swelling.

Tuned fluorinated surface was proposed to achieve an ultra&#8208;thin and KF&#8208;enriched solid electrolyte interphase in potassium&#8208;ion battery. The tailored C&#8722;F configurations could induce local surface polarization to guide electrolyte decomposing orderly and prompt the enrichment of KF crystals in SEI by self&#8208;sacrifice dissociation. The electrode shows boosted rate performance and durable cycling performance under high loading of ~8.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) crucially affects the rate performance and cycling lifespan, yet to date more extensive research is still needed in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. We report an ultra&#8208;thin and KF&#8208;enriched SEI triggered by tuned fluorinated surface design in electrode. Our results reveal that fluorination engineering alters the interfacial chemical environment to facilitate inherited electronic conductivity, enhance adsorption ability of potassium, induce localized surface polarization to guide electrolyte decomposition behavior for SEI formation, and especially, enrich the KF crystals in SEI by self&#8208;sacrifice from C&#8722;F bond cleavage. Hence, the regulated fluorinated electrode with generated ultra&#8208;thin, uniform, and KF&#8208;enriched SEI shows improved capacity of 439.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (3.82&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), boosted rate performance (202.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 8.70&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and durable cycling performance (even under high loading of ~8.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). We expect this practical engineering principle to open up new opportunities for upgrading the development of potassium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Guiding Transient Peptide Assemblies with Structural Elements Embedded in Abiotic Phosphate Fuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We focus on fuel modifications to impact non&#8208;equilibrium systems, demonstrating how amino acid side chains within abiotic phosphates direct assembly and reactivity changes during structure formation. Through covalent binding to substrates, fuels drive the yield, the lifetime and the structural organization of transient species. Activated amino acids with varying reactivity and energy contents can pave the way for fabricating structured fuels.







Abstract
Despite great progress in the construction of non&#8208;equilibrium systems, most approaches do not consider the structure of the fuel as a critical element to control the processes. Herein, we show that the amino acid side chains (A, F, Nal) in the structure of abiotic phosphates can direct assembly and reactivity during transient structure formation. The fuels bind covalently to substrates and subsequently influence the structures in the assembly process. We focus on the ways in which the phosphate esters guide structure formation and how structures and reactivity cross regulate when constructing assemblies. Through the chemical functionalization of energy&#8208;rich aminoacyl phosphate esters, we are able to control the yield of esters and thioesters upon adding dipeptides containing tyrosine or cysteine residues. The structural elements around the phosphate esters guide the lifetime of the structures formed and their supramolecular assemblies. These properties can be further influenced by the peptide sequence of substrates, incorporating anionic, aliphatic and aromatic residues. Furthermore, we illustrate that oligomerization of esters can be initiated from a single aminoacyl phosphate ester incorporating a tyrosine residue (Y). These findings suggest that activated amino acids with varying reactivity and energy contents can pave the way for designing and fabricating structured fuels.

         <title>Formation of a Porous Crystalline Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy Overlayer on Metal Catalysts via Controlled Solid&#8208;State Reactions for High&#8208;temperature Stable Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reactions with limited Mg migration transform the amorphous Al2O3 overlayer on MgAl2O4&#8208;supported metal catalysts into a porous Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy crystalline spinel structure with a pore size of 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm and weakened acidity, which allows achieving remarkably high stability while preserving high activity over Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy&#8208;coated Ni/MgAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts in methane dry reforming and propane dehydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Catalyst deactivation by sintering and coking is a long&#8208;standing issue in metal&#8208;catalyzed harsh high&#8208;temperature hydrocarbon reactions. Ultrathin oxide coatings of metal nanocatalysts have recently appeared attractive to address this issue, while the porosity of the overlayer is difficult to control to preserve the accessibility of embedded metal nanoparticles, thus often leading to a large decrease in activity. Here, we report that a nanometer&#8208;thick alumina coating of MgAl2O4&#8208;supported metal catalysts followed by high&#8208;temperature reduction can transform a nonporous amorphous alumina overlayer into a porous Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy crystalline spinel structure with a pore size of 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm and weakened acidity. The high porosity stems from the restrained Mg migration from the MgAl2O4 support to the alumina overlayer through solid&#8208;state reactions at high temperatures. The resulting Ni/MgAl2O4 and Pt/MgAl2O4 catalysts with a porous crystalline Mg1&#8208;xAl2Oy overlayer achieved remarkably high stability while preserving much higher activity than the corresponding alumina&#8208;coated Ni and Pt catalysts on MgO and Al2O3 supports in the reactions of dry reforming of methane and propane dehydrogenation, respectively.

         <title>A Stretchable and Tough Graphene Film Enabled by Mechanical Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [2]rotaxane&#8208;bridged graphene (RBG) film was fabricated, in which graphene nanosheets were cross&#8208;linked by mechanical bonds. During the stretching process, the intramolecular motion of [2]rotaxanes resulted in the release of hidden chains, so that the mechanical properties of RBG films were improved, realizing the effect of strengthening and toughening graphene films.







Abstract
The pursuit of fabricating high&#8208;performance graphene films has aroused considerable attention due to their potential for practical applications. However, developing both stretchable and tough graphene films remains a formidable challenge. To address this issue, we herein introduce mechanical bond to comprehensively improve the mechanical properties of graphene films, utilizing [2]rotaxane as the bridging unit. Under external force, the [2]rotaxane cross&#8208;link undergoes intramolecular motion, releasing hidden chain and increasing the interlayer slip distance between graphene nanosheets. Compared with graphene films without [2]rotaxane cross&#8208;linking, the presence of mechanical bond not only boosted the strength of graphene films (247.3 vs 74.8&#8197;MPa) but also markedly promoted the tensile strain (23.6 vs 10.2&#8201;%) and toughness (23.9 vs 4.0&#8197;MJ/m3). Notably, the achieved tensile strain sets a record high and the toughness surpasses most reported results, rendering the graphene films suitable for applications as flexible electrodes. Even when the films were stretched within a 20&#8201;% strain and repeatedly bent vertically, the light&#8208;emitting diodes maintained an on&#8208;state with little changes in brightness. Additionally, the film electrodes effectively actuated mechanical joints, enabling uninterrupted grasping movements. Therefore, the study holds promise for expanding the application of graphene films and simultaneously inspiring the development of other high&#8208;performance two&#8208;dimensional films.

Timely detection of early&#8208;stage cancer presents a tremendous opportunity to enhance prognostic outcomes, and there is an increasing desire for sensitive and cost&#8208;effective cancer detection tools. We present a liposome nanosensor for sensitive urinalysis&#8208;based cancer monitoring by using sucrose to convert tumor&#8208;specific esterase activity into a glucose meter&#8208;compatible readout. Such a non&#8208;invasive diagnostic platform assists in the personalized assessment of pharmacological efficacy.







Abstract
Timely detection of early&#8208;stage cancer holds immense potential in enhancing prognostic outcomes. There is an increasing desire for versatile tools to enable simple, sensitive, and cost&#8208;effective cancer detection. By exploiting the extraintestinal metabolic inertness and efficiency renal clearance of sucrose, we designed a liposome nanosensor using sucrose as a messenger to convert tumor&#8208;specific esterase activity into glucose meter readout, enabling economical and sensitive urinalysis for cancer detection in point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT). Our results demonstrate that the nanosensors exhibited significant signal differences between tumor&#8208;bearing and healthy mice in both orthotopic and metastatic tumor models. Additionally, efficient elimination of the nanosensors through the hepatobiliary pathway was observed with no significant toxicity. Such a non&#8208;invasive diagnostic modality significantly assists in personalized pharmacological treatment and follow&#8208;up efficacy assessment. We envision that this modular liposome nanosensor platform might be applied for economically detecting diverse diseases via a simple urinary test.

         <title>Chiral Ligand&#8208;Concentration Mediating Asymmetric Transformations of Silver Nanoclusters: NIR&#8208;II Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence Lighting</title>

Chiral ligand&#8208;concentration mediating asymmetric transformations of silver nanoclusters realize visible and second near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized phosphorescences.







Abstract
Near infrared (NIR) emitter with circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP), known as NIR CPP, has emerged as a key part in the research of cutting&#8208;edge luminescent materials. However, it remains a challenge to obtain nanoclusters with NIR CPP activity. Here, we propose an asymmetric transformation approach to efficiently synthesize two pairs of chiral silver nanoclusters (R/S&#8208;Ag29 and R/S&#8208;Ag16) using an achiral Ag10 nanocluster as starting material in the presence of different concentration chiral inducer (R/S)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;diyl hydrogenphosphate (R/S&#8208;BNP). R/S&#8208;Ag29, formed in the low&#8208;concentration R/S&#8208;BNP, exhibits a unique kernel&#8208;shell structure consisting of a distorted Ag13 icosahedron and an integrated cage&#8208;like organometallic shell with a C3 symmetry, and possesses a superatomic 6&#8208;electron configuration (1S2|1P4). By contrast, R/S&#8208;Ag16, formed in the high&#8208;concentration R/S&#8208;BNP, features a sandwich&#8208;like pentagram with AgI&#8208;pure kernel. Profiting from the hierarchically chiral structures and superatomic kernel&#8208;dominated phosphorescence, R/S&#8208;Ag29 exhibits infrequent CPP activity in the second near&#8208;infrared (975&#8197;nm) region, being the first instance of NIR&#8208;II CPP observed among CPL&#8208;active metal nanoclusters. This study presents a new approach to reduce the difficulty of de novo synthesis for chiral silver nanomaterials, and facilitates the design of CPP&#8208;active superatomic nanoclusters in NIR region.

         <title>Assembly of Glycopeptides in Living Cells Resembling Viral Infection for Cargo Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycosylated peptide is designed to formulate SgVEIP that exhibits cancer cell targeting and enzyme&#8208;responsive properties arising from the galactose&#8208;galectin&#8208;1 association and galactosidase&#8208;induced hydrolysis. Precursor SgVEIP undergoes an in situ cascade targeting&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;transformation assembly resembling to viral infection in a holistic manner, thus allowing for efficient delivery of irinotecan and peptide drugs to kill cancer cells.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly in living cells represents one versatile strategy for drug delivery; however, it suffers from the limited precision and efficiency. Inspired by viral traits, we here report a cascade targeting&#8208;hydrolysis&#8208;transformation (THT) assembly of glycosylated peptides in living cells holistically resembling viral infection for efficient cargo delivery and combined tumor therapy. We design a glycosylated peptide via incorporating a &#946;&#8208;galactose&#8208;serine residue into bola&#8208;amphiphilic sequences. Co&#8208;assembling of the glycosylated peptide with two counterparts containing irinotecan (IRI) or ligand TSFAEYWNLLSP (PMI) results in formation of the glycosylated co&#8208;assemblies SgVEIP, which target cancer cells via &#946;&#8208;galactose&#8208;galectin&#8208;1 association and undergo galactosidase&#8208;induced morphological transformation. While GSH&#8208;reduction causes release of IRI from the co&#8208;assemblies, the PMI moieties release p53 and facilitate cell death via binding with protein MDM2. Cellular experiments show membrane targeting, endo&#8208;/lysosome&#8208;mediated internalization and in situ formation of nanofibers in cytoplasm by SgVEIP. This cascade THT process enables efficient delivery of IRI and PMI into cancer cells secreting Gal&#8208;1 and overexpressing &#946;&#8208;galactosidase. In vivo studies illustrate enhanced tumor accumulation and retention of the glycosylated co&#8208;assemblies, thereby suppressing tumor growth. Our findings demonstrate an in situ assembly strategy mimicking viral infection, thus providing a new route for drug delivery and cancer therapy in the future.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Potential Methanol Oxidation on Single&#8208;Ir&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the coupling of thermocatalysis and electrocatalysis, methanol was first thermally catalyzed to decompose to CO and H2 under the voltage promotion, then the generated CO and H2 was electrochemically oxidized to CO2 and proton at ultra&#8208;low onset potential (&lt;0.1&#8197;V) over the the electron&#8208;deficient IrC4 sites, which strongly adsorb the methanol to break H&#8722;O/H&#8722;C.







Abstract
Methanol oxidation plays a central role to implement sustainable energy economy, which is restricted by the sluggish reaction kinetics due to the multi&#8208;electron transfer process accompanied by numerous sequential intermediate. In this study, an efficient cascade methanol oxidation reaction is catalyzed by single&#8208;Ir&#8208;atom catalyst at ultra&#8208;low potential (&lt;0.1&#8197;V) with the promotion of the thermal and electrochemical integration in a high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer. At the elevated temperature, the electron deficient Ir site with higher methanol affinity could spontaneous catalyze the CH3OH dehydrogenation to CO under the voltage, then the generated CO and H2 was electrochemically oxidized to CO2 and proton. However, the methanol cannot thermally decompose with the voltage absence, which confirm the indispensable of the coupling of thermal and electrochemical integration for the methanol oxidation. By assembling the methanol oxidation reaction with hydrogen evolution reaction with single&#8208;Ir&#8208;atom catalysts in the anode chamber, a max hydrogen production rate reaches 18&#8197;mol&#8201;gIr&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is much greater than that of Ir nanoparticles and commercial Pt/C. This study also demonstrated the electrochemical methanol oxidation activity of the single atom catalysts, which broadens the renewable energy devices and the catalyst design by an integration concept.

         <title>Dilute RuCo Alloy Synergizing Single Ru and Co Atoms as Efficient and CO&#8208;Resistant Anode Catalyst for Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>

Developing low&#8208;cost, highly active, stable, and CO resistant alkaline HOR electrocatalysts are crucial for achieving the application of AEMFCs. (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT with and dilute RuCo alloy nanoparticles and highly dispersed Ru and Co single atoms can achieve efficient alkaline HOR, with superior stability and outstanding CO resistance. When used (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT to AEMFC anode catalyst, AEMFCs can achieve high peak power density with low noble metal loading (1.98&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a load of 0.1&#8197;mgRu&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is considered a promising candidate catalyst for alkaline hydroxide oxidation reaction (HOR) due to its hydrogen binding energy (HBE) like that of platinum (Pt) and its much higher oxygenophilicity than that of Pt. However, Ru still suffers from insufficient intrinsic activity and CO resistance, which hinders its widespread use in anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, we report a hybrid catalyst (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT consisting of dilute RuCo alloy nanoparticles and atomically single Ru and Co atoms on N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes The catalyst exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity with a high mass activity of 7.35&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1. More importantly, when (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT is used as an anode catalyst for AEMFCs, its peak power density reaches 1.98&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is one of the best AEMFCs properties of noble metal&#8208;based catalysts at present. Moreover, (RuCo)NC+SAs/N&#8208;CNT has superior long&#8208;time stability and CO resistance. The experimental and density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the dilute alloying and monodecentralization of the exotic element Co greatly modulates the electronic structure of the host element Ru, thus optimizing the adsorption of H and OH and promoting the oxidation of CO on the catalyst surface, and then stimulates alkaline HOR activity and CO tolerance of the catalyst.

         <title>Autophagy&#8208;Inducing MoO3&#8208;x Nanowires Boost Photothermal&#8208;Triggered Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoO3&#8208;x nanowires with high oxygen vacancy acts as a photothermal agent in combination with photothermal therapy to ablate tumors through hyperthermia, thus induces pro&#8208;death function of autophagy, and increases the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens to act as an effective specific immunostimulant, finally promotes immunogenic cell death in tumor therapy.







Abstract
Autophagy could play suppressing role in cancer therapy by facilitating release of tumor antigens from dying cells and inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD). Therefore, discovery and rational design of more effective inducers of cytotoxic autophagy is expected to develop new strategies for finding innovative drugs for precise and successful cancer treatment. Herein, we develop MoO3&#8208;x nanowires (MoO3&#8208;x NWs) with high oxygen vacancy and strong photothermal responsivity to ablate tumors through hyperthermia, thus promote the induction of cytotoxic autophagy and severe ICD. As expected, the combination of MoO3&#8208;x NWs and photothermal therapy (PTT) effectively induces autophagy to promote the release of tumor antigens from the ablated cells, and induces the maturation and antigen presentation of dendritic cells (DCs), subsequently activates cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)&#8208;mediated adaptive immunity. Furthermore, the combination treatment of MoO3&#8208;x NWs with immune checkpoint blockade of PD&#8208;1 could promote the tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization into tumor&#8208;killing M1 macrophages, inhibit infiltration of Treg cells at tumor sites, and alleviate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment, finally intensify the anti&#8208;tumor activity in vivo. This study provides a strategy and preliminary elucidation of the mechanism of using MoO3&#8208;x nanowires with high oxygen vacancy to induce autophagy and thus enhance photothermal immunotherapy.

         <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Frameworks Based on Multiple Dynamic Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of crystalline porous organic frameworks (CPOFs) are prepared based on covalent B&#8722;O, dative B&#8592;N and hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, gram&#8208;scale production can be achieved at low cost, alongside excellent solution processibility, paving the way to diverse applications. Remarkably, the CPOFs exhibit exceptionally high NH3 uptake capacities, indicating their great potential toward NH3 capture.







Abstract
A novel class of crystalline porous materials has been developed utilizing multilevel dynamic linkages, including covalent B&#8722;O, dative B&#8592;N and hydrogen bonds. Typically, boronic acids undergo in situ condensation to afford B3O3&#8208;based units, which further extend to molecular complexes or chains via B&#8592;N bonds. The obtained superstructures are subsequently interconnected via hydrogen bonds and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, producing crystalline porous organic frameworks (CPOFs). The CPOFs display excellent solution processability, allowing dissolution and subsequent crystallization to their original structures, independent of recrystallization conditions, possibly due to the diverse bond energies of the involved interactions. Significantly, the CPOFs can be synthesized on a gram&#8208;scale using cost&#8208;effective monomers. In addition, the numerous acidic sites endow the CPOFs with high NH3 capacity, surpassing most porous organic materials and commercial materials.

         <title>On the Dendrite&#8208;Suppressing Effect of Laser&#8208;Processed Polylactic Acid&#8208;Derived Carbon Coated Zinc Anode in Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bare Zn metal when used as anode in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), is prone to dendrite formation and parasitic side reactions due to uneven Zn deposition on its surface. A porous carbon layer derived from the laser&#8208;assisted carbonization of bio&#8208;derived polylactic acid (PLA) on Zn metal effectively mitigates the formation of dendrites and parasitic side reactions on the Zn anode, thereby enhancing the stability and lifespan of the battery.







Abstract
A major bottleneck limiting the commercialization of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) is dendrite formation on the zinc (Zn) anode during the plating/stripping process, which leads to rapid deterioration in performance and, consequently to the device failure. In this regard, researchers are trying to design more stable anodes toward suppressing dendrite formation. One possible solution to tackle this problem and to extend the cycling life of AZIBs is to modify the zinc anode surface by coating carbonaceous materials, enabling more controlled charge flux and uniform ion distribution. This work reports sustainable and bio&#8208;derived polylactic acid (PLA) as a coating layer on the zinc anode. Carbonizing this polymer under ambient conditions using a high&#8208;power nanosecond laser forms a carbon&#8208;coated zinc foil, which was directly utilized as the anode in aqueous zinc ion batteries. The fabricated laser&#8208;processed PLA&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;coated zinc anode demonstrated an extended cycling life of almost 1600&#8197;hours, significantly outperforming the bare zinc anode. A full aqueous zinc ion battery assembled from as&#8208;modified anode and as&#8208;prepared V2O5 nanofibers as cathode was able to deliver a specific capacity of 238&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 70&#8201;% after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Silylenes with a Small Chalcogenide Substituent: Tuning Frontier Orbital Energies from O to Te</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyclic dicoordinated silylenes with small chalcogenide substituents were prepared and characterised, enabled by a bulky carbazolyl scaffold. The electronic properties change dramatically from O to Te, with decreasing HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps and increasing chemical shift of the 29Si NMR resonances.







Abstract
The general synthesis of heteroleptic acyclic silylenes with a bulky carbazolyl substituent (dtbpCbz) is detailed and a series of compounds with a chalcogenide substituent of the type [(dtbpCbz)SiE16R] (E16R=OtBu, SEt, SePh, TePh) is reported. With the bulky carbazolyl substituent present, the chalcogenide moiety can be very small, as is shown by incorporating groups as small as ethyl, phenyl or tert&#8208;butyl. For the first time, the electronic properties of the silylene can be tuned along a complete series of chalcogenide substituents. The effects are clearly visible in the NMR and UV/Vis spectra, and were rationalised by DFT computations. The reactivity of the heaviest chalcogenide&#8208;substituted silylenes was probed by reactions with trimethylphosphine selenide and the terphenyl azide TerN3 (Ter=2,6&#8208;dimesitylphenyl).

&lt;p&gt;The general synthesis of heteroleptic acyclic silylenes with a bulky carbazolyl substituent (&lt;sup&gt;dtbp&lt;/sup&gt;Cbz) is detailed and a series of compounds with a chalcogenide substituent of the type [(&lt;sup&gt;dtbp&lt;/sup&gt;Cbz)SiE&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;R] (E&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;R=O&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu, SEt, SePh, TePh) is reported. With the bulky carbazolyl substituent present, the chalcogenide moiety can be very small, as is shown by incorporating groups as small as ethyl, phenyl or &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl. For the first time, the electronic properties of the silylene can be tuned along a complete series of chalcogenide substituents. The effects are clearly visible in the NMR and UV/Vis spectra, and were rationalised by DFT computations. The reactivity of the heaviest chalcogenide-substituted silylenes was probed by reactions with trimethylphosphine selenide and the terphenyl azide TerN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (Ter=2,6-dimesitylphenyl).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination Regulating D&#8208;Orbital Spin&#8208;Electron Filling in Single&#8208;Atom Iron Catalyst for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalyst, we implemented an asymmetric coordination within the first coordination shell of Fe site. The creation of the Fe&#8722;N3O configuration, characterized by asymmetrical oxygen coordination and adjacent defect, caused electrons in d orbitals from low&#8208;spin state to a medium&#8208;spin state. This optimization effectively weakened the adsorption of oxygen species and altered the potential&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
The single&#8208;atom Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst has shown great promise for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet the intrinsic activity is not satisfactory. There is a pressing need to gain a deeper understanding of the charge configuration of the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C catalyst and to develop rational modulation strategies. Herein, we have prepared a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst with the co&#8208;coordination of N and O (denoted as Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C) and adjacent defect, proposing a strategy to optimize the d&#8208;orbital spin&#8208;electron filling of Fe sites by fine&#8208;tuning the first coordination shell. The Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C exhibits significantly better ORR activity compared to its Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C counterpart and commercial Pt/C, with a much more positive half&#8208;wave potential (0.927&#8197;V) and higher kinetic current density. Moreover, using the Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C catalyst, the Zn&#8208;air battery and proton exchange membrane fuel cell achieve peak power densities of up to 490 and 1179&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Theoretical studies and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveal that Fe&#8722;N/O&#8722;C undergoes charge redistribution and negative shifting of the d&#8208;band center compared to Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C, thus optimizing the adsorption free energy of ORR intermediates. This work demonstrates the feasibility of introducing an asymmetric first coordination shell for single&#8208;atom catalysts and provides a new optimization direction for their practical application.

         <title>Rapid Defect Engineering in FeCoNi/FeAl2O4 Hybrid for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis: A Pathway to High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the defect engineering, ultrasonic cavitation was utilized to rapidly introduce different types of defects into a FeCoNi/FeAl2O4 coating to increase edge unsaturated active sites. Simultaneously, different defects synergistically enhance the oxygenophilicity character, allowing the coating to activate the surface reconstruction into highly active catalytic species at low potential.







Abstract
Rational modulation of surface reconstruction in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) utilizing defect engineering to form efficient catalytic activity centers is a topical interest in the field of catalysis. The introduction of point defects has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to regulate the electronic configuration of electrocatalysts, but the influence of more complex planar defects (e.g., twins and stacking faults), on their intrinsic activity is still not fully understood. This study harnesses ultrasonic cavitation for rapid and controlled introduction of different types of defects in the FeCoNi/FeAl2O4 hybrid coating, optimizing OER catalytic activity. Theoretical calculations and experiments demonstrate that the different defects optimize the coordination environment and facilitate the activation of surface reconstruction into true catalytic activity centers at lower potentials. Moreover, it demonstrates exceptional durability, maintaining stable oxygen production at a high current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for over 120&#8197;hours. This work not only presents a novel pathway for designing advanced electrocatalysts but also deepens our understanding of defect&#8208;engineered catalytic mechanisms, showcasing the potential for rapid and efficient enhancement of electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Tunable Interfacial Electric Field&#8208;Mediated Cobalt&#8208;Doped FeSe/Fe3Se4 Heterostructure for High&#8208;Efficiency Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An undifferentiated cobalt&#8208;doped FeSe/Fe3Se4 (UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5) heterostructure with optimized interfacial electric field (IEF) is designed and fabricated for high&#8208;efficiency potassium&#8208;ion battery (PIB) anodes. The IEF intensity in UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5 is 3.65&#8197;times that of pure FeSe/Fe3Se4. Intriguingly, this uniform doping strategy has strong generality in improving IEF strength and PIB performance. As expected, amorphous carbon&#8208;coated UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5 exhibits superior rate capability (145.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle life (95.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
The interfacial electric field (IEF) in the heterostructure can accelerate electron transport and ion migration, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Nevertheless, the quantification and modulation of the IEF for high&#8208;efficiency PIB anodes currently remains a blank slate. Herein, we achieve for the first time the quantification and tuning of IEF via amorphous carbon&#8208;coated undifferentiated cobalt&#8208;doped FeSe/Fe3Se4 heterostructure (denoted UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5/C) for efficient potassium storage. Co doping can increase the IEF in FeSe/Fe3Se4, thereby improving the electron transport, promoting the potassium adsorption capacity, and lowering the diffusion barrier. As expected, the IEF magnitude in UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5/C is experimentally quantified as 62.84&#8197;mV, which is 3.65&#8197;times larger than that of amorphous carbon&#8208;coated FeSe/Fe3Se4 heterostructure (Fe4Se5/C). Benefiting from the strong IEF, UN&#8208;CoFe4Se5/C as a PIB anode exhibits superior rate capability (145.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle lifespan (capacity retention of 95.1&#8201;% over 3000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Furthermore, this undifferentiated doping strategy can universally regulate the IEF magnitude in CoSe2/Co9Se8 and FeS2/Fe7S8 heterostructures. This work can provide fundamental insights into the design of advanced PIB electrodes.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Mediated Photochemical C&#8722;H Arylation of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octahedrally coordinated bis(diiminopyridine)cobalt complex enables the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven arylation of pyrroles with chloro&#8208; and bromoarenes. Spectroscopic and computational studies elucidate the photoelectron transfer processes of the metal complex with triethylamine and a bromoarene, suggesting that electron transfer is facilitated by a preassembly of these molecules with the complex.







Abstract
Precious metal complexes remain ubiquitous in photoredox catalysis (PRC) despite concerted efforts to find more earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and replacements based on 3d metals in particular. Most otherwise plausible 3d metal complexes are assumed to be unsuitable due to short&#8208;lived excited states, which has led researchers to prioritize the pursuit of longer excited&#8208;state lifetimes through careful molecular design. However, we report herein that the C&#8722;H arylation of pyrroles and related substrates (which are benchmark reactions for assessing the efficacy of photoredox catalysts) can be achieved using a simple and readily accessible octahedral bis(diiminopyridine) cobalt complex, [1&#8208;Co](PF6)2. Notably, [1&#8208;Co]2+ efficiently functionalizes both chloro&#8208; and bromoarene substrates despite the short excited&#8208;state lifetime of the key photoexcited intermediate *[1&#8208;Co]2+ (8&#8197;ps). We present herein the scope of this C&#8722;H arylation protocol and provide mechanistic insights derived from detailed spectroscopic and computational studies. These indicate that, despite its transient existence, reduction of *[1&#8208;Co]2+ is facilitated via pre&#8208;assembly with the NEt3 reductant, highlighting an alternative strategy for the future development of 3d metal&#8208;catalyzed PRC.

&lt;p&gt;An octahedrally coordinated bis(diiminopyridine)cobalt complex enables the visible-light-driven arylation of pyrroles with chloro- and bromoarenes. Spectroscopic and computational studies elucidate the photoelectron transfer processes of the metal complex with triethylamine and a bromoarene, suggesting that electron transfer is facilitated by a preassembly of these molecules with the complex.

         <title>Grain&#8208;Boundary&#8208;Rich RuO2 Porous Nanosheet for Efficient and Stable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin porous RuO2 nanosheet with abundant of grain boundaries (GB&#8208;RuO2) was synthesized as an efficient acid OER catalyst. Grain boundaries effectively regulated the electronic structure of the active site and optimized the adsorption behavior of intermediates, but also stabilized the active site structure by preventing Ru dissolution and converting the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) to the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM).







Abstract
RuO2 has been considered as the most likely acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst to replace IrO2, but its performance, especially long&#8208;term stability under harsh acidic conditions, is still unacceptable. Here, we propose a grain boundary (GB) engineering strategy by fabricating the ultrathin porous RuO2 nanosheet with abundant of grain boundaries (GB&#8208;RuO2) as an efficient acid OER catalyst. The involvement of GB induces significant tensile stress and creates an unsaturated coordination environment, effectively optimizing the adsorption of intermediates and stabilizing active site structure during OER process. Notably, the GB&#8208;RuO2 not only exhibits a low overpotential (&#951;10=187&#8197;mV) with an ultra&#8208;low Tafel slope (34.5&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), but also steadily operates for over 550&#8197;h in 0.1&#8197;M HClO4. Quasi in situ/operando methods confirm that the improved stability is attributed to GB preventing Ru dissolution and greatly inhibiting the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM). A proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) using the GB&#8208;RuO2 catalyst operates a low voltage of 1.669&#8197;V at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and operates stably for 100&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Template&#8208;Guided Silicon Micromotor Assembly for Enhanced Cell Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optomagnetic hybrid micromotor was developed using an optimized silicon&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Semiconductor (MIS) solar cell. The micromotor displays diverse motion modes influenced by fracture surfaces and interactions with the environment. Additionally, an innovative hole&#8208;assisted assembly strategy is introduced, facilitating assembly into functional microrobots and enabling precise cell manipulation.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven micro/nanorobots (LMNRs) are tiny, untethered machines with great potential in fields like precision medicine, nano manufacturing, and various other domains. However, their practicality hinges on developing light&#8208;manipulation strategies that combine versatile functionalities, flexible design options, and precise controllability. Our study introduces an innovative approach to construct micro/nanorobots (MNRs) by utilizing micro/nanomotors as fundamental building blocks. Inspired by silicon Metal&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Semiconductor (MIS) solar cell principles, we design a new type of optomagnetic hybrid micromotors (OHMs). These OHMs have been skillfully optimized with integrated magnetic constituent, resulting in efficient light propulsion, precise magnetic navigation, and the potential for controlled assembly. One of the key features of the OHMs is their ability to exhibit diverse motion modes influenced by fracture surfaces and interactions with the environment, streamlining cargo conveyance along &#8220;micro expressway&#8221;&#8212;the predesigned microchannels. Further enhancing their versatility, a template&#8208;guided assembly strategy facilitates the assembly of these micromotors into functional microrobots, encompassing various configurations such as &#8220;V&#8208;shaped&#8221;, &#8220;N&#8208;shaped&#8221;, and 3D structured microrobots. The heightened capabilities of these microrobots, underscore the innovative potential inherent in hybrid micromotor design and assembly, which provides a foundational platform for the realization of multi&#8208;component microrobots. Our work moves a step toward forthcoming microrobotic entities boasting advanced functionalities.

         <title>Single&#8208;cluster Functionalized TiO2 Nanotube Array for Boosting Water Oxidation and CO2 Photoreduction to CH3OH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile electrosynthesis strategy was developed to achieve single dispersion of various POMs on TiO2 nanotube array. The POMs can serve as electronic sponge to store multi&#8208;electrons thus greatly improving the surface hole concentration to promote water oxidation. The left electron on P2Mo18@TiO2 can effeiciently drive CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion with much enhanced performance compared to that of pristine TiO2 nanoarray.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction and water oxidation to liquid fuels represents a promising solution to alleviate energy crisis and climate issue, but it remains a great challenge for generating CH3OH and CH3CH2OH dominated by multi&#8208;electron transfer. Single&#8208;cluster catalysts with super electron acceptance, accurate molecular structure, customizable electronic structure and multiple adsorption sites, have led to greater potential in catalyzing various challenging reactions. However, accurately controlling the number and arrangement of clusters on functional supports still faces great challenge. Herein, we develop a facile electrosynthesis method to uniformly disperse Wells&#8208;Dawson&#8208; and Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates on TiO2 nanotube arrays, resulting in a series of single&#8208;cluster functionalized catalysts P2M18O62@TiO2 and PM12O40@TiO2 (M=Mo or W). The single polyoxometalate cluster can be distinctly identified and serves as electronic sponge to accept electrons from excited TiO2 for enhancing surface&#8208;hole concentration and promote water oxidation. Among these samples, P2Mo18O62@TiO2&#8208;1 exhibits the highest electron consumption rate of 1260&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion with H2O as the electron source, which is 11&#8197;times higher than that of isolated TiO2 nanotube arrays. This work supplied a simple synthesis method to realize the single&#8208;dispersion of molecular cluster to enrich surface&#8208;reaching holes on TiO2, thereby facilitating water oxidation and CO2 reduction.

         <title>Hyperbranched Vitrimer for Ultrahigh Energy Dissipation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers have been utilized as damping materials due to the high internal friction of molecular chains, enabling effectively dissipate energy as heat during service. Our work firstly presents hyperbranched vitrimers (HBVs) containing dense pendant chains and loose dynamic crosslinked networks, which exhibit ultrahigh energy&#8208;dissipation performance over a broad frequency range of nearly 10 orders of magnitude. This innovative design concept will provide opportunities for the further development of damping materials with multiple synergistic effects.







Abstract
Polymers are ideally utilized as damping materials due to the high internal friction of molecular chains, enabling effective suppression of vibrations and noises in various fields. Current strategies rely on broadening the glass transition region or introducing additional relaxation components to enhance the energy dissipation capacity of polymeric damping materials. However, it remains a significant challenge to achieve high damping efficiency through structural control while maintaining dynamic characteristics. In this work, we propose a new strategy to develop hyperbranched vitrimers (HBVs) containing dense pendant chains and loose dynamic crosslinked networks. A novel yet weak dynamic transesterification between the carboxyl and boronic acid ester was confirmed and used to prepare HBVs based on poly (hexyl methacrylate&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8208;ethenylphenyl)&#8208;5,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborinane) P(HMA&#8208;co&#8208;ViCL) copolymers. The

&#8208;type of macromonomers, the crosslinking points formed by the dynamic covalent connection via the associative exchange, and the weak yet dynamic exchange reaction are the three keys to developing high&#8208;performance HBV damping materials. We found that P(HMA&#8208;co&#8208;ViCL) 20k&#8208;40&#8208;60&#8197;HBV exhibited ultrahigh energy&#8208;dissipation performance over a broad frequency and temperature range, attributed to the synergistic effect of dense pendant chains and weak dynamic covalent crosslinks. This unique design concept will provide a general approach to developing advanced damping materials.

         <title>Enrooted&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supported metal catalyst with new enrooted&#8208;type metal&#8208;support interaction, where the Ir clusters atomically enrooted into the lattice of WO3 support, has been synthesized through a facile approach, achieving a stable metal&#8208;support interface and maximized exposure of metal active sites.







Abstract
Supported metal catalysts with appropriate metal&#8208;support interactions (MSIs) hold a great promise for heterogeneous catalysis. However, ensuring tight immobilization of metal clusters/nanoparticles on the support while maximizing the exposure of surface active sites remains a huge challenge. Herein, we report an Ir/WO3 catalyst with a new enrooted&#8208;type MSI in which Ir clusters are, unprecedentedly, atomically enrooted into the WO3 lattice. The enrooted Ir atoms decrease the electron density of the constructed interface compared to the adhered (root&#8208;free) type, thereby achieving appropriate adsorption toward oxygen intermediates, ultimately leading to high activity and stability for oxygen evolution in acidic media. Importantly, this work provides a new enrooted&#8208;type supported metal catalyst, which endows suitable MSI and maximizes the exposure of surface active sites in contrast to the conventional adhered, embedded, and encapsulated types.

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Charge Transfer Cocrystals with Dynamically Reversible Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting Display Chain Length&#8208;Selective Vapochromism to Alkyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral macrocycle&#8208;based cocrystal system that undergoes dynamically reversible chiral self&#8208;sorting displays efficient chain length&#8208;selective vapochromism to alkyl ketones. The unique vapochromic behavior was mainly due to different solid&#8208;state superstructures and noncovalent interactions from the homo&#8208; or heterochiral self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
Chirality&#8208;driven self&#8208;sorting plays an essential role in controlling the biofunction of biosystems, such as the chiral double&#8208;helix structure of DNA from self&#8208;recognition by hydrogen bonding. However, achieving precise control over the chiral self&#8208;sorted structures and their functional properties for the bioinspired supramolecular systems still remains a challenge, not to mention realizing dynamically reversible regulation. Herein, we report an unprecedented saucer[4]arene&#8208;based charge transfer (CT) cocrystal system with dynamically reversible chiral self&#8208;sorting synergistically induced by chiral triangular macrocycle and organic vapors. It displays efficient chain length&#8208;selective vapochromism toward alkyl ketones due to precise modulation of optical properties by vapor&#8208;induced diverse structural transformations. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the unique vapochromic behavior is mainly attributed to the formation of homo&#8208; or heterochiral self&#8208;sorted assemblies with different alkyl ketone guests, which differ dramatically in solid&#8208;state superstructures and CT interactions, thus influencing their optical properties. This work highlights the essential role of chiral self&#8208;sorting in controlling the functional properties of synthetic supramolecular systems, and the rarely seen controllable chiral self&#8208;sorting at the solid&#8208;vapor interface deepens the understanding of efficient vapochromic sensors.

A hexagonal prism&#8208;shaped crystal known as KBCOB, renowned for its exceptional second&#8208;harmonic generation response and high transparency in the deep ultraviolet spectrum, is shown on the cover image. At the center of the image, the crystal's chemical structure is depicted. This structure consists of a tri&#8208;layered arrangement of green, multifaceted polyhedral units [B4O5(OH)4]2&#8722; representing the borate's boron&#8208;oxygen framework. Uniquely, the center of the crystal features a rarely reported superhalogen [BO2]&#8722; configuration, as demonstrated by Chi Zhang et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202403328).

THz spectra of aqueous solutions at ambient conditions encode precious information about H&#8208;bonding, but what about aqueous solutions at supercritical conditions? In their Research Article (e202402120) on neutral gold particles in supercritical water Jan Noetzel et&#8197;al. show that a broad continuum absorption comes from the metal particles while an additional sharp THz resonance is due to strongly interacting water.

Photocatalytic electron transfer commonly depends on scarce and precious transition metals like Ru and Ir due to their exceptional photophysical properties. In their Research Article (e202405780), Patrick Nuernberger, Regina de&#8197;Vivie&#8208;Riedle, Robert Wolf et&#8197;al. present an alternative approach using readily available complexes with earth&#8208;abundant 3d metals. Despite their short excited&#8208;state lifetimes, photocatalysis is made possible by dispersive preassembly in the ground state, opening exciting opportunities for new catalytic applications in organic synthesis.

A photostable and environment&#8208;sensitive probe for imaging inner mitochondrial membranes is presented by Masayasu Taki, Shigehiro Yamaguchi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404328). The probe can visualize the lipid properties of the membranes as it alters spatiotemporally in living cells. Peroxidation of unsaturated lipids in the inner membrane results in membrane remodeling, which leads to an increase in membrane order.

         <title>Recent Progress in Using Covalent Organic Frameworks to Stabilize Metal Anodes for Highly&#8208;Efficient Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a comprehensive discussion of the advantages and challenges of alkali metals and multivalent metals as anodes, this minireview summarizes the latest progress on the application of COFs in electrode engineering, electrolyte optimization, and separator modification. Emphasis is placed on new insights into the synthesis, design, and characterization analysis of COFs to effectively improve metal anode performance.







Abstract
Alkali metals (e.g. Li, Na, and K) and multivalent metals (e.g. Zn, Mg, Ca, and Al) have become star anodes for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries due to their high theoretical capacity and excellent conductivity. However, the inevitable dendrites and unstable interfaces of metal anodes pose challenges to the safety and stability of batteries. To address these issues, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as emerging materials, have been widely investigated due to their regular porous structure, flexible molecular design, and high specific surface area. In this minireview, we summarize the research progress of COFs in stabilizing metal anodes. First, we present the research origins of metal anodes and delve into their advantages and challenges as anodes based on the physical/chemical properties of alkali and multivalent metals. Then, special attention has been paid to the application of COFs in the host design of metal anodes, artificial solid electrolyte interfaces, electrolyte additives, solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and separator modifications. Finally, a new perspective is provided for the research of metal anodes from the molecular design, pore modulation, and synthesis of COFs.

         <title>To DISP or Not? The Far&#8208;Reaching Reaction Mechanisms Underpinning Lithium&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

Views on the mechanism of metal&#8208;air batteries have seen a remarkable number of U&#8208;turns, which changed paradigms on how to improve performance. The latest findings show that the disproportionation (DISP) step in the (dis)charge mechanism emerges as the pivot point for explaining rate and capacity limitation as well as the origin of side reactions. Therefrom, directions emerge for materials design to enable high rate and high reversible capacity.







Abstract
The short history of research on Li&#8722;O2 batteries has seen a remarkable number of mechanistic U&#8208;turns over the years. From the initial use of carbonate electrolytes, that were then found to be entirely unsuitable, to the belief that (su)peroxide was solely responsible for degradation, before the more reactive singlet oxygen was found to form, to the hypothesis that capacity depends on a competing surface/solution mechanism before a practically exclusive solution mechanism was identified. Herein, we argue for an ever&#8208;fresh look at the reported data without bias towards supposedly established explanations. We explain how the latest findings on rate and capacity limits, as well as the origin of side reactions, are connected via the disproportionation (DISP) step in the (dis)charge mechanism. Therefrom, directions emerge for the design of electrolytes and mediators on how to suppress side reactions and to enable high rate and high reversible capacity.

         <title>An Unprecedented [BO2]&#8208;Based Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Crystal by Superhalogen Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first [BO2]&#8208;based deep&#8208;UV transparent NLO oxide K9[B4O5(OH)4]3(CO3)(BO2) has been synthesized by an ambient aqueous evaporation method. It possesses a strong phase&#8208;matchable SHG, a short UV absorption edge, and a significantly enlarged birefringence by a superhalogen substitution strategy.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state structures with the superhalogen [BO2]&#8722; have thus far only been observed with a few compounds whose syntheses require high reaction temperatures and complicated procedures, while their optical properties remain almost completely unexplored. Herein, we report a facile, energy&#8208;efficient synthesis of the first [BO2]&#8208;based deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) transparent oxide K9[B4O5(OH)4]3(CO3)(BO2)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H2O (KBCOB). Detailed structural characterization and analysis confirm that KBCOB possesses a rare four&#8208;in&#8208;one three&#8208;dimensional quasi&#8208;honeycomb framework, with three &#960;&#8208;conjugated anions ([BO2]&#8722;, [BO3]3&#8722;, and [CO3]2&#8722;) and one non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated anion ([BO4]5&#8722;) in the one crystal. The evolution from the traditional halogenated nonlinear optical (NLO) analogues to KBCOB by superhalogen [BO2]&#8722; substitution confers deep&#8208;UV transparency (&lt;190&#8197;nm), a large second&#8208;harmonic generation response (1.0&#215;KH2PO4 @&#8197;1064&#8197;nm), and a 15&#8208;fold increase in birefringence. This study affords a new route to the facile synthesis of functional [BO2]&#8208;based oxides, paving the way for the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performing deep&#8208;UV NLO materials.

         <title>Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Trisulfides from S&#8208;Substituted Sulphenylthiosulphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general and efficient approach for accessing unsymmetrical trisulfides through an I2&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of S&#8208;substituted sulphenylthiosulphates (RSSSO3Na), alkyl electrophiles and thiourea. This is the first report on utilizing RSSSO3Na as disulfurating reagent and provides a convenient method for converting bromides, chlorides, iodides and tosylates into trisulfides.







Abstract
Trisulfide unit is widely found in natural products and has garnered attention due to the unique pharmacological and physiochemical properties. However, despite limited progress, widely applicable approaches for constructing unsymmetrical trisulfides have so far remain scarce. In this work, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare, solid&#8208;state and scalable reagent, S&#8208;substituted sulphenylthiosulphate, has been developed for the divergent synthesis of unsymmetrical trisulfides. Alkyl electrophile substrates, including bromides, chlorides, iodides and tosylates, with diverse substituents are smoothly converted to the corresponding trisulfides with S&#8208;substituted sulphenylthiosulphates and thiourea as another sulfur source. Furthermore, the late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules was successfully achieved through this method.

         <title>Kinase Inhibition via Small Molecule&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Protein Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report ynamide&#8208;based, small&#8208;molecule inhibitors capable of inducing intramolecular cross&#8208;linking of kinases, leading to subsequent irreversible inhibition of kinase activity. This strategy exploits the close distance between highly conserved catalytic K and E/D residues present in almost all protein kinases, thus providing a conceptually general approach to achieve irreversible kinase inhibition with high specificity and cellular potency.







Abstract
Remarkable progress has been made in the development of cysteine&#8208;targeted covalent inhibitors. In kinase drug discovery, covalent inhibitors capable of targeting other nucleophilic residues (i.e. lysine, or K) have emerged in recent years. Besides a highly conserved catalytic lysine, almost all human protein kinases possess an equally conserved glutamate/aspartate (e.g. E/D) that forms a K&#8211;E/D salt bridge within the enzyme's active site. Electrophilic ynamides were previously used as effective peptide coupling reagents and to develop E/D&#8208;targeting covalent protein inhibitors/probes. In the present study, we report the first ynamide&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule inhibitors capable of inducing intramolecular cross&#8208;linking of various protein kinases, leading to subsequent irreversible inhibition of kinase activity. Our strategy took advantage of the close distance between the highly conserved catalytic K and E/D residues in a targeted kinase, thus providing a conceptually general approach to achieve irreversible kinase inhibition with high specificity and desirable cellular potency. Finally, this ynamide&#8208;facilitated, ligand&#8208;induced mechanism leading to intramolecular kinase cross&#8208;linking and inhibition was unequivocally established by using recombinant ABL kinase as a representative.

Cyclotetramerization of 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;pyrroles affords a novel class of C4&#8208;symmetric Caryl&#8722;C&#946; (C3, C8, C13, C18) axially chiral porphyrins in good yields. Both regioisomers of the Ir&#8208;complex catalyze efficiently the carbene C(sp3)&#8722;H insertion reaction.







Abstract
A hitherto unknown class of C4&#8208;symmetric Caryl&#8722;C&#946; (C3, C8, C13, C18) axially chiral porphyrins has been synthesized and the application of their iridium (Ir) complexes in catalytic asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization is documented. Cyclotetramerization of enantioenriched axially chiral 2&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;3&#8208;naphthyl pyrroles under mild acidic conditions affords, after oxidation with 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ), the C4&#8208;symmetric &#945;,&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;atropenantiomer as an only isolable diastereomer. Both regioisomeric Ir(Por*)(CO)(Cl) complexes catalyze the carbene C&#8722;H insertion reaction affording the same enantiomer, albeit with slight difference in enantioselectivity. With the optimum Ir&#8208;complex 3&#8201;e, the 2&#8208;substituted arylacetic acid derivatives were generated from diazo compounds and cyclohexadiene in excellent yields and enantioselectivities.

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed and Pnictogen Bond&#8208;Assisted Access to PIII&#8208;Stereogenic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic approach for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral PIII compounds by combining intramolecular PnB interactions and carbene catalysis was developed. The Lewis acidic P center simultaneously activate the bonded formyl group and stabilize the conformation of Breslow intermediates, it may help to achieve high stereo and regio&#8208;selectivities. Following the oxidation of the Breslow intermediate, nucleophile facilitates recycling of NHC to generate enantioenriched trivalent phosphorus compounds.







Abstract
Intermolecular pnictogen bonding (PnB) catalysis has received increased interest in non&#8208;covalent organocatalysis. It has been demonstrated that organic electron&#8208;deficient pnictogen atoms can act as prospective Lewis acids. Here, we present a catalytic approach for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral PIII compounds by combining intramolecular PnB interactions and carbene catalysis. Our design features a pre&#8208;chiral phosphorus molecule bearing two electron&#8208;withdrawing benzoyl groups, resulting in the formation of a &#963;&#8208;hole at the P atom. X&#8208;ray and non&#8208;covalent interaction (NCI) analysis indicate that the model substrates exhibit intrinsic PnB interaction between the oxygen atom of the formyl group and the phosphorus atom. This induces a conformational locking effect, leading to the crystallization of the phosphorus substrate in a preferred conformation (P212121 chiral group). Under the catalysis of N&#8211;heterocyclic carbene, the aldehyde moiety activated by the pnictogen bond selectively reacts with an alcohol to yield the corresponding chiral monoester/phosphorus product with excellent enantioselectivity. This Lewis acidic phosphorus center, aroused by the non&#8208;polarized intramolecular pnictogen bond interaction, assists in conformational and selective regulations, providing unique opportunities for catalysis and beyond.

         <title>Domain Swapping in Abiotic Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abiotic foldamers have been shown to reproduce some of the patterns of protein folding in organic solvents, including cooperative folding transition and the accommodation of conformational strain within tertiary folds. Here, we show that a foldamer initially designed to form a quaternary structure in fact leads to a domain&#8208;swapped dimer, another pattern well&#8208;known in proteins.







Abstract
Foldamer sequences that adopt tertiary helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix folds mediated by helix&#8208;helix hydrogen bonding in organic solvents have been previously reported. In an attempt to create genuine abiotic quaternary structures, i.e. assemblies of tertiary structures, new sequences were prepared that possess additional hydrogen bond donors at positions that may promote an association between the tertiary folds. However, a solid state structure and extensive solution state investigations by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Circular Dichroism (CD) show that, instead of forming a quaternary structure, the tertiary folds assemble into stable domain&#8208;swapped dimer motifs. Domain swapping entails a complete reorganization of the arrays of hydrogen bonds and changes in relative helix orientation and handedness that can all be rationalized.

         <title>Coupling Nano and Atomic Electric Field Confinement for Robust Alkaline Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergy of nano and atomic electric field confinement enrich OH&#8722; concentration around the surface of the catalyst and facilitates *O desorption. As such, the designed Mn single atom doped CoP nanoneedles exhibit an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 189&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stability over 100&#8197;h at around 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 during alkaline OER.







Abstract
The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a promising avenue for producing clean fuels and storing intermittent energy. However, challenges such as excessive OH&#8722; consumption and strong adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates hinder the development of alkaline OER. In this study, we propose a cooperative strategy by leveraging both nano&#8208;scale and atomically local electric fields for alkaline OER, demonstrated through the synthesis of Mn single atom doped CoP nanoneedles (Mn SA&#8208;CoP NNs). Finite element method simulations and density functional theory calculations predict that the nano&#8208;scale local electric field enriches OH&#8722; around the catalyst surface, while the atomically local electric field improves *O desorption. Experimental validation using in situ attenuated total reflection infrared and Raman spectroscopy confirms the effectiveness of the nano&#8208;scale and atomically electric fields. Mn SA&#8208;CoP NNs exhibit an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 189&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stable operation over 100&#8197;hours at ~100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 during alkaline OER. This innovative strategy provides new insights for enhancing catalyst performance in energy conversion reactions.

         <title>A New Family of High Oxidation State Antiperovskite Nitrides: La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn and Mo)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn, and Mo) are the first examples of ternary antiperovskite (Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type) nitrides containing [MN4]6&#8722; anions for M=Cr and Mo, but for M=Mn off&#8208;stoichiometry modelled by excess&#8208;nitride clusters gives La3MnN5.30 with Mn oxidised almost to the +7 state. This is the first report of excess&#8208;anion incorporation into Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type materials, and this or other mechanisms may enable many other high oxidation state transition metal nitrides to be prepared.







Abstract
Three new nitrides La3MN5 (M=Cr, Mn, and Mo) have been synthesized using a high pressure azide route. These are the first examples of ternary Cs3CoCl5&#8208;type nitrides, and show that this (MN4)NLa3 antiperovskite structure type may be used to stabilise high oxidation&#8208;state transition metals in tetrahedral molecular [MN4]n&#8722; nitridometallate anions.

         <title>Molecular Wiring of Electrocatalytic Nitrate reduction to Ammonia and Water Oxidation by Iron&#8208;Coordinated Macroporous Conductive Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach for synthesis of single&#8208;site active iron electrocatalysts is reported by integration of a solvated iron complex in conductive organic networks. Sufficient coordinatively unsaturated active sites can be created electrochemically for simultaneous NO3&#8722; reduction to NH3 and H2O oxidation to O2 in basic media.







Abstract
Developing stable electrocatalysts with accessible isolated sites is desirable but highly challenging due to metal agglomeration and low surface stability of host materials. Here we report a general approach for synthesis of single&#8208;site Fe electrocatalysts by integrating a solvated Fe complex in conductive macroporous organic networks through redox&#8208;active coordination linkages. Electrochemical activation of the electrode exposes high&#8208;density coordinately unsaturated Fe sites for efficient adsorption and conversion of reaction substrates such as NO3&#8722; and H2O. Using the electrode with isolated active Fe sites, electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction and H2O oxidation can be coupled in a single cell to produce NH3 and O2 at Faradaic efficiencies of 97&#8201;% and 100&#8201;%, respectively. The electrode exhibits excellent robustness in electrocatalysis for 200&#8197;hours with small decrease in catalytic efficiencies. Both the maximized Fe&#8208;site efficiency and the microscopic localization effect of the conductive organic matrix contribute to the high catalytic performances, which provides new understandings in tuning the efficiencies of metal catalysts for high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic cells.

         <title>Crystalline Olefin&#8208;Linked Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks as a Platform for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomeric olefin&#8208;linked covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) are synthesized with uniform chiral catalytic sites on the pore walls, exhibiting satisfactory catalytic performance in enantioselective electrophilic amination reactions with good stability and recyclability.







Abstract
The construction of olefin&#8208;linked chiral covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystallinity is highly desirable while remains great challenge due to the poor reversibility of the formation reaction for the olefin linkages during the in situ structural self&#8208;healing process. Herein, we successfully synthesized two sets of enantiomeric olefin&#8208;linked COFs. The chiral catalytic groups are uniformly distributed on the pore walls of COFs, resulting in the full exposure of catalytic sites to the reactants in asymmetric catalysis. The as&#8208;prepared (R)/(S)&#8208;CCOF8 exhibits excellent catalytic performance with exceeding 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess in the enantioselective electrophilic amination reaction. Moreover, the heterogeneous chiral catalysts are conveniently recycled and could maintain the performance after ten catalytic cycles. Our findings expand the scope to construct stable and crystalline chiral COFs for the asymmetric catalysis.

Type&#8197;I [4&#963;+4&#960;] and [4&#963;+4&#960;&#8722;1] cycloadditions were developed to access synthetically challenging seven/eight&#8208;membered fused carbocycles through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed coupling between 4&#963;&#8208;donor (benzocyclobutenones) and pendant diene (4&#960;) motifs in good yields (up to 90&#8201;%). A mechanism was proposed based on kinetic and 13C&#8208;labeling experiments. Notably, one product was found to be a potent and selective liver X receptor &#946; binding ligand (KD=0.64&#8197;&#956;M).







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [4+4] cycloaddition leading to cyclooctanoids has centered on dimerization between 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;type substrates. Herein, we describe a [4&#963;+4&#960;&#8722;1] and [4&#963;+4&#960;] cycloaddition strategy to access 7/8&#8208;membered fused carbocycles through rhodium&#8208;catalyzed coupling between the 4&#963;&#8208;donor (benzocyclobutenones) and pendant diene (4&#960;) motifs. The two pathways can be controlled by adjusting the solvated CO concentration. A broad range (&gt;40 examples) of 5&#8211;6&#8211;7 and 5&#8211;6&#8211;8 polyfused carbocycles was obtained in good yields (up to 90&#8201;%). DFT calculations, kinetic monitoring and 13C&#8208;labeling experiments were carried out, suggesting a plausible mechanism. Notably, one 5&#8211;6&#8211;7 tricycle was found to be a very rare, potent, and selective ligand for the liver X receptor &#946; (KD=0.64&#8197;&#956;M), which is a potential therapeutic target for cholesterol&#8208;metabolism&#8208;related fatal diseases.

         <title>Water and Air Stable Copper(I) Complexes of Tetracationic Catenane Ligands for Oxidative C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(I) molecular catalysts that are water soluble and stable against oxidative degradation are obtained by the strategic use of multiply charged catenane ligands. By using the new catalysts, oxidative C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling is realized in water using H2O2 as a green and convenient oxidant, highlighting the potential of ligand interlocking in leveraging transition metal catalysis under challenging conditions.







Abstract
Aqueous soluble and stable Cu(I) molecular catalysts featuring a catenane ligand composed of two dicationic, mutually repelling but mechanically interlocked macrocycles are reported. The ligand interlocking not only fine&#8208;tunes the coordination sphere and kinetically stabilizes the Cu(I) against air oxidation and disproportionation, but also buries the hydrophobic portions of the ligands and prevents their dissociation which are necessary for their good water solubility and a sustained activity. These catenane Cu(I) complexes can catalyze the oxidative C&#8722;C coupling of indoles and tetrahydroisoquinolines in water, using H2O2 as a green oxidant with a good substrate scope. The successful use of catenane ligands in exploiting aqueous Cu(I) catalysis thus highlights the many unexplored potential of mechanical bond as a design element for exploring transition metal catalysis under challenging conditions.

The ligand interlocking not only fine-tunes the coordination sphere and kinetically stabilizes the Cu(I) against air oxidation and disproportionation, but also buries the hydrophobic portions of the ligands and prevents their dissociation which are necessary for their good water solubility and a sustained activity. These catenane Cu(I) complexes can catalyze the oxidative C&#8722;C coupling of indoles and tetrahydroisoquinolines in water, using H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a green oxidant with a good substrate scope. The successful use of catenane ligands in exploiting aqueous Cu(I) catalysis thus highlights the many unexplored potential of mechanical bond as a design element for exploring transition metal catalysis under challenging conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer Enabled Catalytic Enantioselective Coupling to Chiral Trifluoromethylated Alkynes via Dual Nickel and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With halogen&#8208;atom transfer as an effective tool, a novel catalytic enantioselective protocol generating chiral trifluoromethylated alkynes with high yields and selectivities has been established. It uses a cooperative photoredox and nickel catalysis system, and expands the nickel&#8208;catalysed asymmetric reductive cross&#8208;coupling of organohalides from the traditional single&#8208;electron transfer to halogen&#8208;atom transfer.







Abstract
With halogen&#8208;atom transfer as an effective tool, a novel catalytic enantioselective protocol to generate chiral trifluoromethylated alkynes has been established by a cooperative photoredox and nickel catalysis system, providing a straightforward and modular route to access this type of product in good yields and enantioselectivities. The halogen&#8208;atom transfer process is essential for the reaction and this novel strategy offers another promising way to utilize alkyl halides with highly negative reduction potentials. It firstly expands nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross&#8208;couplings of organohalides from the traditional single&#8208;electron transfer to halogen&#8208;atom transfer.

         <title>Formation of Supernarrow Borophene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of supernarrow borophene nanoribbons has been experimentally realized. The ribbons have a uniform width of &#8764;10&#8197;&#197; and can be as long as 200&#8197;&#197;. They are embedded in the outermost layer of Au(111) and shielded on top by evacuated Au atoms. Distinct edge states are revealed from the ribbons, which are primarily attributed to the localized spin at their zigzag edges.







Abstract
Borophenes have sparked considerable interest owing to their fascinating physical characteristics and diverse polymorphism. However, borophene nanoribbons (BNRs) with widths less than 2&#8197;nm have not been achieved. Herein, we report the experimental realization of supernarrow BNRs. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy imaging with density functional theory modeling and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that, under the applied growth conditions, boron atoms can penetrate the outermost layer of Au(111) and form BNRs composed of a pair of zigzag (2,2) boron rows. The BNRs have a width self&#8208;contained to &#8764;1&#8197;nm and dipoles at the edges to keep them separated. They are embedded in the outermost Au layer and shielded on top by the evacuated Au atoms, free of the need for post&#8208;passivation. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals distinct edge states, primarily attributed to the localized spin at the BNRs&#8217; zigzag edges. This work adds a new member to the boron material family and introduces a new physical feature to borophenes.

         <title>Triaryl Carbenium Ion Pair Mediated Electrocatalytic Benzylic C&#8722;H Oxygenation in Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 28, July 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion&#8208;pair [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;&#8208;mediated electrocatalytic benzylic C&#8722;H oxidation is described. In the absence of expensive oxidants and external supporting electrolyte, the selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in air was achieved.







Abstract
The selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds is a pivotal transformation in organic synthesis. Undoubtedly, achieving efficient and highly selective aerobic oxidation of methylarenes to benzaldehydes has been highly challenging due to the propensity of benzaldehyde to undergo overoxidation under typical aerobic conditions. Herein, we propose an innovative approach to address this issue by leveraging electrocatalytic processes, facilitated by ion&#8208;pair mediators [Ph3C]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722;. By harnessing the power of electrochemistry, we successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy, which enables the selective oxidation of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in benzylic molecules and toluene derivatives. Notably, our approach exhibited high efficiency, excellent selectivity, and compatibility with various functional groups, underscoring the broad applicability of our methodology.
