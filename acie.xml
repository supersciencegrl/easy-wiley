      <title>Macrocycle Co&#8208;Crystals Showing Vapochromism to Haloalkanes</title>
      <dc:description>Organic co&#8208;crystal engineering has emerged as a promising method to make multifunctional materials. Here, we report that the marriage of macrocyclic chemistry and co&#8208;crystal engineering provides a smart strategy to build vapochromic materials. The macrocycle co&#8208;crystals (MCCs) have been constructed by &#960;&#8208;electron rich pillar[5]arene (P5) and an electron&#8208;deficient pyromellitic diimide derivative (PDI) on a ten&#8208;gram scale. MCCs of P5&#8208;PDI are in red color due to the formation of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex. After removing the solvent, a white crystalline solid with a new structure (P5&#8208;PDI&#945;) is yielded, which exhibits selective vapochromic responses to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of haloalkanes, accompanied by color changes from white to red or orange. Powder and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal that the color changes are attributed to the vapor&#8208;triggered solid&#8208;state structural transformation to form CT co&#8208;crystals. In particular, coating films of P5 and PDI on glass also showed a visible vapochromic behavior with good reversibility.</dc:description>

      <title>In&#8208;situ ligand bonding management of CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots enables high&#8208;performance photovoltaics and red light&#8208;emitting diodes</title>
      <dc:description>Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) are promising materials for the next generation optoelectronic devices.

To fine&#8208;tuning the surface ligand towards high&#8208;performance devices, we first developed an  in&#8208;situ  passivation process for all&#8208;inorganic cesium lead iodide (CsPbI  3  ) perovskite QDs by using a bi&#8208; functional ligand, namely L&#8208;phenylalanine (L&#8208;PHE). Through the addition of this ligand into the precursor solution during synthesis, the  in&#8208;situ  treated CsPbI  3  QDs display significantly reduced surface states, increased vacancy formation energy, higher photoluminescence quantum yields, and much improved stability. Consequently, the L&#8208;PHE passivated CsPbI  3  QDs enabled us to realize QD solar cells with an optimal efficiency of 14.62% and red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with a highest external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 10.21%, respectively, demonstrating the great potential of ligand bonding management in improving the optoelectronic properties of solution&#8208;processed perovskite QDs.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering Charge Transfer State to Facilitate Spin&#8208;orbit Charge Transfer Intersystem Crossing in Spirobis[anthracene]diones Solution</title>
      <dc:description>The potency of spiro&#8208;conjugation has been proposed to dictate the efficiency of charge transfer, which could directly affect spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process, as predicted by the El&#8208;Sayed rule. However, this process has yet to be exemplified.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The potency of spiro&#8208;conjugation has been proposed to dictate the efficiency of charge transfer, which could directly affect spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process, as predicted by the El&#8208;Sayed rule. However, this process has yet to be exemplified. Herein, we judiciously prepared three novel spirobis[anthracene]diones, in which two benzophenone moieties are locked in close proximity and differentially functionalized to fine&#8208;tune the charge transfer state. Its feasibility for SOCT&#8208;ISC was theoretically predicted, then experimentally evaluated.

      <dc:description>Modular construction of an autonomous and programmable multi&#8208;function heterogeneous biochemical circuit that can identify, transform, translate and amplify biological signals into physicochemical signals based on logic design principle can be a powerful capability for the development of diverse biotechnologies. To explore this conceptual validity, we design a CRISPR array mediated primer exchange reaction based biochemical circuit cascades, which probe a specific biomolecular input, transform the input into a structurally accessible form for circuit wiring, translate the input information into an arbitrary sequence and finally amplify the prescribed sequence through autonomous formation of a signaling concatemer. This upstream biochemical circuit is further wired with a downstream electrochemical interface, delivering an integrated bioanalytical platform.

      <title>Coverage&#8208;dependent Behaviors of Vanadium Oxides for Chemical Looping Oxidative Dehydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical looping provides an energy and cost effective route for alkane utilization.

The highly dispersed vanadia nanostructures on titanium dioxide support showed over 90% propylene selectivity at 500 &#176;C, exhibiting highest turnover frequency of 1.9&#215;10  &#8208;2  s  &#8208;1  , which is over 20 times greater than that of conventional crystalline V  2  O  5  oxygen carriers. Combining in situ spectroscopic characterizations and density functional theory calculation, we revealed the loading&#8211;reaction barrier relationship through the vanadia/titanium interfacial interaction.

      <dc:description>Operando  nuclear resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering (NRIXS) and X&#8208;ray absorption fine&#8208;structure spectroscopy (XAFS) measurements have been used to gain insight into the structure and surface composition of FeCu and FeAg nanoparticles (NPs) during the CO  2  electrochemical reduction (CO  2  RR) and to extract correlations with their catalytic activity and selectivity. The formation of a core&#8208;shell structure during CO  2  RR for FeAg NPs was inferred from the analysis of the  operando  NRIXS data (phonon density of states, PDOS) and XAFS measurements. Electrochemical analysis of the FeAg NPs revealed a faradaic selectivity of ~&#160;36 % for CO in 0.1&#160;M KHCO  3  at &#8208;1.1 V vs RHE, similar to that of pure Ag NPs. In contrast, a predominant selectivity towards H  2  evolution is obtained in the case of the FeCu NPs, analogous to the results obtained for pure Fe NPs, although small Cu NPs have also been shown to favor H  2  production. These results, together with the findings from NRIXS and XAFS, revealed that Ag is preferentially present on the surface of the FeAg NPs during CO  2  RR, while Cu is also likely to be mainly distributed on the surface of the FeCu NPs but with a larger degree of intermixing with Fe.</dc:description>

      <title>Toward replacing ethylene oxide in a sustainable world: Glycolaldehyde as bio&#8208;based C2 platform molecule</title>
      <dc:description>Nowadays, fossil&#8208;based platform molecules such as ethylene and ethylene oxide serve as primary feedstock for the C  2  &#8208;based chemical industry. However, in search for a more sustainable chemical industry, fossil&#8208;based resources may preferentially be replaced by renewable alternatives, provided realistic economic feasibility. This review compares and critically discusses several production routes toward&#160;bio&#8208;based structural analogs of ethylene oxide and the required adaptations for their implementation in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art C  2  &#8208;based chemical processes. For instance, glycolaldehyde, a structural analog obtainable from carbohydrates&#160;  via  &#160;atom&#8208;economic retro&#8208;aldol, may replace ethylene oxide's leading role. This alternative chemical route may not only accommodate to lower the carbon footprint of conventional chemicals production, but the introduction of a bio&#8208;based pathway may also contribute to safer production processes. Where possible, challenges, drawbacks, and prospects are highlighted.</dc:description>

This review compares and critically discusses several production routes toward&#160;bio&#8208;based structural analogs of ethylene oxide and the required adaptations for their implementation in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art C  2  &#8208;based chemical processes. For instance, glycolaldehyde, a structural analog obtainable from carbohydrates&#160;  via  &#160;atom&#8208;economic retro&#8208;aldol, may replace ethylene oxide's leading role. This alternative chemical route may not only accommodate to lower the carbon footprint of conventional chemicals production, but the introduction of a bio&#8208;based pathway may also contribute to safer production processes. Where possible, challenges, drawbacks, and prospects are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Flexible C&#8211;C Bond: Reversible Expansion, Contraction, Formation, and Scission of Extremely Elongated Single Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Since carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8211;C) covalent bonds are rigid and robust, the bond length is, in general, nearly constant and depends only on the bond order and hybrid orbitals. We report here direct visualization of the reversible expansion and contraction of a Csp3&#8211;Csp3 single bond by light and heat. This flexibility of a C&#8211;C bond was demonstrated by X&#8208;ray analyses and Raman spectroscopy of hexaphenylethane (HPE)&#8208;type hydrocarbons with two spiro&#8208;dibenzocycloheptatriene units, where intramolecular [2+2] photocyclization and thermal cleavage of the resulting cyclobutane ring both occur in a single&#8208;crystalline phase. The force constant of the contracted C&#8211;C bond is 1.6 times greater than that of the expanded bond. Since formation of the cyclobutane ring and contraction of the C&#8211;C bond lower the HOMO level by ca. 1 eV, the oxidative properties of these HPEs having a flexible C&#8211;C bond can be deactivated/activated by light/heat.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Mediated Cleavage of C&#8722;C Single Bonds: Making the Cut in Total Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>
Rapid remodeling of skeletal frameworks can be achieved by transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C single bonds and enable new retrosynthetic disconnections. In this Review, ten total syntheses from 2014&#8211;2019 are highlighted that illustrate how transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C single bonds can streamline synthetic efforts.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C single bonds can enable entirely new retrosynthetic disconnections in the total synthesis of natural products. Given that C&#8722;C bond cleavage inherently alters the carbon framework of a compound, and that, under transition&#8208;metal catalysis, the generated organometallic or radical intermediate is primed for further complexity&#8208;building reactivity, C&#8722;C bond&#8208;cleavage events have the potential to drastically and rapidly remodel skeletal frameworks. The recent acceleration of the use of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C single bonds in total synthesis can be ascribed to a communal recognition of this fact. In this Review, we highlight ten selected total syntheses from 2014 to 2019 that illustrate how transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated cleavage of C&#8722;C single bonds at either the core or the periphery of synthetic intermediates can streamline synthetic efforts.

      <title>Rechargeable Aluminum&#8208;Sulfur Battery with Improved Electrochemical Performance by Cobalt&#8208;Containing Electrocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>The rechargeable aluminum sulfur (Al&#8208;S) battery is regarded as a potential alternative beyond&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;battery system owing to its safety, promising energy density, and the high earth abundance of the constituent electrode materials, however, sluggish kinetic response and short life&#8208;span are the major issues that limit the battery&#8217;s development towards applications. In this article, we report Co(II, III) as an electrochemical catalyst in the sulfur cathode that renders a reduced discharge&#8208;charge voltage hysteresis and improved capacity retention and rate capability for Al&#8208;S batteries. The structural and electrochemical analysis suggest that the catalytic effect of Co(II, III) is closely associated with the formation of cobalt sulfides and the changes in the valence states of the Co(II,III) during the electrochemical reactions of the sulfur species, which lead to improved reaction kinetics and sulfur utilization in the cathode. The Al&#8208;S battery, assembled with the cathode consisting of Co(II,III) decorated carbon matrix, demonstrates a considerably reduced voltage hysteresis of 0.8 V, a reversible specific capacity of &#8764;500 mAh/g  &#160;  at 1 A/g  &#160;  after 200 discharge&#8208;charge cycles and of &#8764;300 mAh/g  &#160;  at 3 A/g  &#160;  .</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from All&#8208;Inorganic Cesium Zirconium Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is generally observed in solid&#8208;state organic molecules or metal&#8208;organic complexes. However, TADF in all&#8208;inorganic colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) is rare. Herein, we report the first colloidal synthesis of an air&#8208;stable all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free Cs  2  ZrCl  6  perovskite NCs. The Cs  2  ZrCl  6  NCs exhibit long&#8208;lived triplet excited state (138.2 &#956;s), featuring highly efficient photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiency (QY= 60.37%) due to TADF. The emission color can be easily tuned from blue to green by synthesizing the mixed&#8208;halide Cs  2  ZrBr  x  Cl  6&#8208;x  (0&#8804;x&#8804;1.5) NCs. Both femtosecond transient absorption and temperature dependent PL measurements are performed to clarify the emission mechanism. In addition, Bi  3+  ions are successfully doped into Cs  2  ZrCl  6  NCs, which further extends the PL properties. This work not only develops a new lead&#8208;free perovskite Cs  2  ZrCl  6  NCs for potential optoelectronic applications, but also offers unique strategies for developing new inorganic phosphors.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is generally observed in solid&#8208;state organic molecules or metal&#8208;organic complexes. However, TADF in all&#8208;inorganic colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) is rare. Herein, we report the first colloidal synthesis of an air&#8208;stable all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free Cs  2  ZrCl  6  perovskite NCs. The Cs  2  ZrCl  6  NCs exhibit long&#8208;lived triplet excited state (138.2 &#956;s), featuring highly efficient photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiency (QY= 60.37%) due to TADF. The emission color can be easily tuned from blue to green by synthesizing the mixed&#8208;halide Cs  2  ZrBr  x  Cl  6&#8208;x  (0&#8804;x&#8804;1.5) NCs. Both femtosecond transient absorption and temperature dependent PL measurements are performed to clarify the emission mechanism. In addition, Bi  3+  ions are successfully doped into Cs  2  ZrCl  6  NCs, which further extends the PL properties. This work not only develops a new lead&#8208;free perovskite Cs  2  ZrCl  6  NCs for potential optoelectronic applications, but also offers unique strategies for developing new inorganic phosphors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Efficient encounter complex formation and electron transfer to cytochrome c peroxidase with an additional, distant electrostatic binding site.</title>
      <dc:description>Electrostatic interactions can strongly increase the efficiency of protein complex formation. The charge distribution in redox proteins is often optimized to steer a redox partner to the electron transfer active binding site. To test whether the optimized distribution is more important than the strength of the electrostatic interactions, an additional negative patch was introduced on the surface of cytochrome c peroxidase, away from the stereospecific binding site, and its effect on the encounter complex as well as the rate of complex formation was determined. Monte Carlo simulations and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR experiments indicate that the partner, cytochrome c, interacts with the new patch. Unexpectedly, the rate of the active complex formation was not reduced, but rather slightly increased. The findings support the idea that for efficient protein complex formation the strength of the electrostatic interaction is more critical than an optimized charge distribution.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct Intermediate Regulation Enabled by Sulfur Containers in Working Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Polysulfide intermediates (PSs), the liquid&#8208;phase species of active materials in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, connect the electrochemical reactions between insulative solid sulfur and lithium sulfide and are regarded as the key to full exertion of the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S system.

Compared with the exploration of extrinsic regulations such as physical confinement and chemical catalysis, direct and intramolecular engineering of PSs has been less concerned. In this contribution, the concept of sulfur container additives is proposed for the direct modification on the PSs species. Through reversible storage and release of the sulfur species, the container molecule converts small PSs into large organosulfur species. The prototype di(tri)sulfide&#8208;polyethylene glycol sulfur container displays high efficiency in the reversible PS transformation to multiply affect the electrochemical behaviors of sulfur cathodes in terms of liquid&#8208;species clustering, reaction kinetics, and solid deposition.

      <title>A Universal Graphene Quantum Dot&#8208;Tethering Design Strategy to Synthesize Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesizing a wide variety of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) on different supports via a universal strategy is still challenging because of the high surface energy of single atoms which leads to serious aggregation. Here we report a general graphene quantum dot&#8208;tethering design strategy to synthesize SACs. The strategy is applicable to different metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) and supports (0D carbon nanosphere, 1D carbon nanotube, 2D graphene nanosheet, and 3D graphite foam) with the metal loading of 3.0&#8211;4.5 wt%. The direct transmission electron microscopy imaging and X&#8208;ray absorption spectra analyses confirm the atomic dispersed metal in carbon supports. Our study reveals that the abundant oxygenated groups for complexing metal ions and the rich defective sites for incorporating nitrogen are essential to realize the synthesis of SACs. Furthermore, the carbon nanotube supported Ni SACs exhibit high electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction with nearly 100% CO selectivity. This universal strategy is expected to open up new research avenues to produce SACs for diverse electrocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Accurate control of initial Coulombic efficiency for Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides by surface multicomponent integration</title>
      <dc:description>Low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) is one of the most obstacles for practical application of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides (LLOs), which is closely related with the irreversible oxygen evolution due to the overoxidized reaction of surface labile oxygen.

X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, refined X&#8208;ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy demonstrate the removed labile oxygen mainly comes from Li2MnO3&#8208;like structure. In addition, the multicomponent integrated structure greatly improves the surface stability of LLOs cathodes. Even operated at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 5 V, the capacity retention of integrated sample at 200 mA g&#8208;1 is still larger than 98% after 100 cycles.

      <title>183  W NMR Spectroscopy Guides the Search for Tungsten Alkylidyne Catalysts for Alkyne Metathesis</title>
      <dc:description>Triarylsilanolates are privileged ancillary ligands for molybdenum alkylidyne catalysts for alkyne metathesis but lead to disappointing results and poor stability in the tungsten series. 1H,183W Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation (HMBC) spectroscopy exploiting a favorable 5J&#8208;coupling between the 183W center and the peripheral protons on the alkylidyne cap revealed that these ligands upregulate the Lewis&#8208;acidity to an extent that the tungstenacyclobutadiene formed in the initial [2+2] cycloaddition step is over&#8208;stabilized and the catalytic turnover brought to a hold. The metallacycle itself does exist in two tautomeric forms and must not be mistaken for a mesomeric resonance extreme, as evident from spectroscopic and crystallographic data. Guided by the 183W NMR shifts as a proxy for the Lewis acidity of the central atom and an accompanying chemical shift tensor analysis of the alkylidyne unit, the ligand design was revisited and a more strongly &#960;&#8208;donating all&#8208;alkoxide ligand prepared. The new &#8220;expanded&#8221; chelate complex has a tempered Lewis&#8208;acidity and outperforms the classical Schrock catalyst carrying monodentate tert&#8208;butoxy ligands in terms of rate and functional group compatibility.</dc:description>

      <title>Local structure of glassy lithium phosphorus oxynitride thin films: a combined
experimental and ab initio approach</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) is an amorphous solid&#8208;state lithium ion conductor displaying exemplary cyclability against lithium metal anodes. There is no definitive explanation for this stability due to the limited understanding of the structure of LiPON. We provide a structural model of RF&#8208;sputtered LiPON via experimental and computational spectroscopic methods. Information about the short&#8208;range structure results from 1D and 2D solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments investigating chemical shift anisotropy and dipolar interactions. These results are compared with first principles chemical shielding calculations of Li&#8208;P&#8208;O/N crystals and ab initio molecular dynamics&#8208;generated amorphous LiPON models to unequivocally identify the glassy structure as primarily isolated phosphate monomers with N incorporated in both apical and as bridging sites in phosphate dimers. Structural results
suggest LiPON&#8217;s stability is a result of its glassy character. Free&#8208;standing LiPON films are produced that exhibit a high degree of flexibility highlighting the unique mechanical properties of glassy materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Miscibility&#8208;Controlled Phase Separation in Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers for Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells with Efficiencies over 8%</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, a record power conversion efficiency of 8.40% was obtained in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) based on double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers. This is realized based on the finding that exciton separation plays the same important role as charge transport in SCOSCs. Herein, we designed two double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers with almost the identical conjugated backbones and electron&#8208;withdrawing side units, but the extra chlorine (Cl) atoms had different positions on the conjugated backbones. We found that, when Cl atoms were positioned at the main chains, the polymer formed the twist backbones, enabling better miscibility with the naphthalene diimide side units. This could improve the interface contact between conjugated backbones and side units, resulting in efficient conversion of excitons into free charges. These observations were confirmed by systematical studies via several advanced measurements. These findings reveal the importance of charge generation process in SCOSCs and also suggest a strategy to improve this process, that is, controlling the miscibility between conjugated backbones and aromatic side units in double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

      <title>The Mystery of the Benzene Oxide &#8211; Oxepin Equilibrium &#8211; Heavy Atom Tunneling Reversed by Solvent Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>The equilibrium between benzene oxide  1  and oxepin  2  is of large importance for understanding the degradation of benzene in biological systems and in the troposphere. Our studies reveal that at cryogenic temperatures this equilibration is governed by rare heavy atom tunneling. In solid argon at 3 K,  1  rearranges to  2  via tunneling with a rate constant of approximately 5.3 x 10  &#8208;5  s  &#8208;1  . Thus, in a nonpolar environment,  2  is slightly more stable than  1  , in agreement with calculations at the CCSD(T) level of theory. However, if the argon is doped with 1% of H  2  O or CF  3  I, respectively, as typical hydrogen or halogen bond donors, weak complexes of  1  and  2  are formed, and now  2  is tunneling back to form  1  . Thus, by forming non&#8208;covalent complexes, benzene oxide  1  becomes slightly more stable than oxepin  2  , and the direction of the heavy atom tunneling is reversed.</dc:description>

      <title>Fragment Based Protein&#8208;Protein Interaction Stabilizers via Imine&#8208;Based Tethering</title>
      <dc:description>Small&#8208;molecule stabilization of protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPI) is a promising concept in drug discovery, however the question how to identify or design chemical starting points in a &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; approach is largely unanswered. Here we report a novel concept for identifying initial chemical matter for PPI stabilization based on covalent imine forming fragments. The imine bond offers a covalent anchor for site&#8208;directed fragment targeting, whereas its transient nature allows an efficient structure activity relationship analysis. This bond enables fragment identification and optimisation using protein crystallography. We report novel fragments which bind specifically to a lysine at the PPI interface of the p65 subunit&#8208;derived peptide of NF&#8208;&#954;B with the adapter protein 14&#8208;3&#8208;3. Those fragments that subsequently establish contacts with the p65&#8208;derived peptide, rather than with 14&#8208;3&#8208;3, efficiently stabilize the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/p65 complex and offer novel starting points for molecular glues.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Colloidal lead&#8208;free perovskite nanocrystals have recently received extensive attention because of their facile synthesis, the outstanding size&#8208;tunable optoelectronic properties, and less or no toxicity towards their commercial applications.

The partial replacement of Sn atoms by Ge atoms in the nanostructures effectively fills the high density of Sn vacancies, reducing the surface traps and leading to a longer excitonic lifetime and increased photoluminescence quantum yield. The resultant Sn&#8208;Ge nanocrystals&#8208;based devices show the highest efficiency of 4.9%, enhanced by nearly 60% compared to that of pure Sn nanocrystals&#8208;based devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Continuous Tuning of the Au&#8208;Cu2O Janus Nanostructures for Efficient Charge Separation</title>
      <dc:description>In photocatalysis, the Schottky barrier in metal&#8208;semiconductor hybrids is known to promote charge separation, but a core&#8208;shell structure always leads to charge build&#8208;up and eventually shuts off the photocurrent.

It is in contrast to the conventional systems where the hybrid configuration is mainly determined by the choice of materials. The distal separation of the Au&#8208;Cu2O domains in Janus nanostructures leads to enhanced charge separation and great improvement of the photocurrent. The activity of the Au&#8208;Cu2O Janus structures is 5 times higher than the core&#8208;shell structure, and 10 times higher than the neat Cu2O nanocubes. The continuous structural tuning allows study of the structure&#8208;property relationship, and optimization of the photocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Conventional carbonate solvents with low HOMO levels are theoretically compatible with the low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;voltage Zn/graphite battery chemistry. However, the anion nucleophilic attack on carbonates induces the oxidative breakdown at high potentials. Here, we restore the inherent anodic stability of carbonate electrolytes by designing a micro&#8208;heterogeneous anion solvation network. Based on the addition of a strongly electron&#8208;donating trimethyl phosphate (TMP) solvent, the oxidation&#8208;vulnerable anion&#8208;carbonate affinities are decoupled because of the preferential sequestration of anions into TMP solvating domains around metal cations. The hybridized electrolytes elevate the electrochemical window of carbonate electrolytes by 0.45 V and enable the operation of 2.80 V Zn/graphite dual&#8208;ion cells with a long cycle life (92% capacity retention after 1000 cycles). By inheriting the non&#8208;&#64258;ammability from TMP and high ion&#8208;transport kinetics from carbonate systems, this facile strategy provides cells with additional benefits of &#64257;re retardancy and high&#8208;power capability.</dc:description>

      <title>A two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic polymer enabled by robust nickel&#8208;nitrogen and hydrogen bonds for exceptional sodium&#8208;ion storage</title>
      <dc:description>Organic electrode materials are suffering from the low electronic conductivity and poor structure stability.

With both the conjugated benzoid carbonyls and imines as the redox centers for the insertion and extraction of Na  +  , the Ni&#8208;TABQ delivers high capacities of ~469.5 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 100 mA g  &#8208;1  and 345.4 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 8 A g  &#8208;1  . The large capacities are sustained for 100 cycles with almost 100% coulombic efficiencies. The exceptional electrochemical performance is attributed to the unique 2D electron conduction and Na  +  diffusion pathways enabled by the robust Ni&#8208;N and hydrogen bonds.

      <title>Highly Selective Olefin Production from CO2 Hydrogenation on Iron Catalysts: A Subtle Synergy between Manganese and Sodium Additives</title>
      <dc:description>Mn and Na additives have been widely studied for improving the efficiency of CO  2  hydrogenation to valuable olefins on Fe catalysts, but their effects on the catalytic properties and mechanism are still under vigorous debate. This study shows that Fe&#8208;based catalysts with moderate Mn and Na contents are highly selective for CO  2  hydrogenation to olefins, together with low selectivities both to CO and CH  4  and much improved space&#8208;time olefin yields compared to those state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Combined kinetic assessment and quasi in&#8208;situ characterizations further unveil the sole presence of Mn suppresses the activity of Fe catalysts due to the close contact between Fe and Mn, while the extra introduction of Na mediates the Fe&#8208;Mn interaction and brings strong basic sites. This subtle synergy between Na and Mn sheds light on the importance of the interplay of multiple additives that would bring an enabling strategy to improve catalytic activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Exotic compositional ordering in Mn&#8208;Ni&#8208;As intermetallics</title>
      <dc:description>In this work we benefited from recent advances in tools for crystal structure analysis that enabled us to describe an exotic nanoscale phenomenon in structural chemistry. The Mn0.60Ni0.40As sample of the Mn1&#8208;xNixAs solid solution, exhibits an incommensurate compositional modulation intimately coupled with positional modulations. The average structure is of the simple NiAs type, but in contrast to a normal solid solution, we observe that manganese and nickel segregate periodically at the nano&#8208;level into ordered MnAs and NiAs layers with thickness of 2&#8208;4 face&#8208;shared octahedra. The detailed description was obtained by combination of 3D electron diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy and neutron diffraction. The distribution of the manganese and nickel layers is perfectly described by a modulation vector q = 0.360(3) c*. Displacive modulations are observed for all elements as a consequence of the occupational modulation, and as a means to achieve acceptable Ni&#8208;As and Mn&#8208;As distances. This extraordinary modulated evolution of magnetic MnAs and non&#8208;magnetic NiAs&#8208;layers with periodicity at ~10&#160;&#197; level, may provide an avenue for spintronics.</dc:description>

The unique physical and chemical properties of fullerenes have offered new opportunities to tailor both the electronic structures and the catalytic activities of the nanohybrid structures. Here, we comprehensively review the synthetic approaches to prepare fullerene&#8208;based hybrids with LD (0D, 1D, and 2D) materials in addition to their resulting structural and catalytic properties. Recent advances in the design of fullerene&#8208;based LD nanomaterials for (photo)electrocatalytic applications are emphasized. The fundamental relationship between the electronic structures and the catalytic functions of the heterostructures, including the role of the fullerenes, is addressed to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of these emerging materials at the molecular level.</dc:description>

      <title>Suppressing Strong Exciton&#8208;Phonon Coupling in Blue Perovskite Nanoplatelet Solids by Binary Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites have been proved to be promising candidates for light generation owing to their high radiative rates. However, strong exciton&#8208;phonon interactions caused by mechanical softening of the surface act as a bottleneck in improving their suitability for a wide range of lighting and display applications. Moreover, it is not easily available to tune the phonon interactions in bulk films. Here, we adopt bottom&#8208;up fabricated blue emissive perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) as model systems to elucidate and as well as tune the phonon interactions via engineering of binary NPL solids. By optimizing component domains, the phonon coupling strength can be reduced by a factor of 2 driven by the delocalization of 2D excitons in out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientations. It shows the picosecond energy transfer originated from the F&#1255;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiently competes with the exciton&#8208;phonon interactions in the binary system. Explicit deciphering of the relationship between phonon interactions and energy transfer, and successful modulations of the phonon interactions in the binary system provide significant implications for developing high&#8208;performance excitonic optoelectronics.</dc:description>

      <title>Gas&#8208;Constructed Vesicles with Gas&#8208;Moldable Membrane Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>
Cooking with gas: CO2 gas and frustrated Lewis pair monomers can polymerize to form vesicles. Changing the gas used results in the formation of vesicles with distinct components, architectures, and morphologies. This introduces the use of gases to form nanomaterials and could be used to recycle industrial waste gases.







Abstract
Integrating gas as a main building block into nanomaterial construction is a challenging mission that remains elusive. Herein, we report a gas&#8208;constructed vesicular system formed by CO2 gas and frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). Two molecular triads bearing three bulky borane and phosphine groups are designed as trivalent disc&#8208;like FLP monomers. CO2, as a gas cross&#8208;linker, can drive the two&#8208;dimensional polymerization of these two FLP monomers, leading to the generation of planar FLP networks that further transform into a thermodynamically favored membranous vesicle structure. Gas&#8208;guided vesicle formation is also applicable to other inert but FLP&#8208;activatable gases. Different gas linkages can form vesicles with distinct architectures, sizes, and morphologies. We envisage that this study would suggest a new concept that exploits gases to fabricate tunable nanomaterials.

      <title>General Principles for the Design of Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Photoswitches: Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;Chloro&#8208;Azobenzenes</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular photoswitches enable the reversible external control of biological systems, nanomachines, and smart materials. Recently, their developments are driven by the need for low energy (green&#8208;red&#8208;NIR) light switching, to allow for non&#8208;invasive operation with deep tissue&#8208;penetration. The lack of clear design principles for the adaptation and optimization of such systems strongly limits further applications. Here we provide such design rulebook for tetra&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;chloroazobenzenes, an emerging class of visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photochromes, by elucidating the role that substituents play in defining their key characteristics: absorption spectra, band overlap, photoswitching efficiencies, and half&#8208;lives of the unstable  cis  isomer. This is achieved through joint photochemical and theoretical analyses of a representative library of molecules that feature substituents of varying electronic nature. A set of guidelines is presented that enables tuning of properties to the desired application through informed photochrome engineering.</dc:description>

Here we provide such design rulebook for tetra&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;chloroazobenzenes, an emerging class of visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photochromes, by elucidating the role that substituents play in defining their key characteristics: absorption spectra, band overlap, photoswitching efficiencies, and half&#8208;lives of the unstable  cis  isomer. This is achieved through joint photochemical and theoretical analyses of a representative library of molecules that feature substituents of varying electronic nature. A set of guidelines is presented that enables tuning of properties to the desired application through informed photochrome engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Compaction of RNA duplexes in the cell</title>
      <dc:description>The structure and flexibility of RNA depend sensitively on the microenvironment. Using pulsed electron&#8208;electron double&#8209;resonance (PELDOR) spectroscopy combined with advanced labeling techniques, we show that the structure of double&#8208;stranded RNA (dsRNA) changes upon internalization into  Xenopus l&#230;vis  oocytes. Compared to dilute solution, the dsRNA A&#8209;helix is more compact in cells. We recapitulate this compaction in a densely crowded protein solution.

      <title>Fluorescence Quenching Effects of Tetrazines and Their Diels&#8208;Alder Products: Mechanistic Insight Toward Fluorogenic Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>Inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (iedDA) reactions between  s  &#8208;tetrazines and strained dienophiles have numerous applications in chemical biology and materials science. Tetrazines most often quench the emission of pendant fluorophores. This effect, however, is diminished upon iedDA, leading to the formation of emissive products with important applications in fluorescence labelling of biomolecules. Herein we investigate the effect of the dienophile on the fluorescence enhancement obtained upon reaction with a tetrazine&#8208;quenched fluorophore and study the possible mechanisms of fluorescence quenching by both the tetrazine and its reaction products through a combination of linear and ultrabroadband two&#8208;dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D ES) experiments. The dihydropyridazine product obtained from reaction of the tetrazine with a strained cyclooctene shows a residual fluorescence quenching effect, greater than that exerted by the pyridazine arising from reaction of the tetrazine with the analogous alkyne. Ultrabroadband 2D ES measurements reveal that resonance energy transfer is the mechanism responsible for the fluorescence quenching effect of tetrazines, whereas a mechanism involving more intimate electronic coupling, most likely photoinduced electron transfer, is responsible for the quenching effect of the dihydropyridazine. These studies uncover parameters that can be tuned to maximize fluorogenic efficiency in bioconjugation reactions and they reveal that strained alkenes, though optimal for fast kinetics, are not the best reaction partners for achieving maximum contrast ratio in fluorescence labeling.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Polarized&#8208;light detection in solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region is indispensable for optoelectronic applications, whereas new 2D candidates targeted at solar&#8208;blind UV range remain extremely scarce. 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics that combine polarization and semiconducting properties have taken a booming position within this portfolio. Here, using the 3D&#8208;to&#8208;2D dimensional reduction of CH3NH3PbCl3, we successfully designed a multilayered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric, (CH3CH2NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3Cl10  , which shows notable spontaneous polarization and a high Curie temperature (390 K) comparable with that of BaTiO3  (393 K). Strikingly, the wide bandgap (~3.35 eV) and anisotropic absorbance stemming from its intrinsic 2D motif, greatly favor its polarization&#8208;sensitive activity in UV region. Consequently, the device displays excellent polarization&#8208;sensitive behaviours under 266 nm, along with a large dichroic ratio (~1.38) and high on/off current ratio (~2.3*103  ).
