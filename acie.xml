      <title>Inorganic&#8208;rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Advanced Lithium Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes</title>
      <dc:description>In carbonate electrolytes, the organic&#8208;inorganic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the lithium (Li) metal anode surface is strongly bonded to Li and experiences the same volume change as Li, thus it undergoes continuous cracking/reformation during plating/stripping cycles. Here, an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI is designed on a Li metal surface to reduce its bonding energy with Li metal by dissolving 4 M concentrated LiNO  3  in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an additive for a fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) based electrolyte. Due to the aggregate structure of NO  3  &#8208;  ions and its participation in the primary Li  +  solvation sheath, abundant Li  2  O, Li  3  N, and LiN  x  O  y  grains are formed in the resulting SEI, in addition to the uniform LiF distribution from the reduction of PF  6  &#8208;  ions. The inorganic&#8208;rich SEI&#8217;s weak bonding (high interface energy) to Li can effectively promote Li diffusion along the SEI/Li interface and prevent Li dendrite penetration into the SEI. As a result, our designed carbonate electrolyte enables a Li anode to achieve a high Li plating/stripping CE of 99.55% (1 mA cm  &#8208;2  , 1.0 mAh cm  &#8208;2  ) and the electrolyte also enables a Li||LiNi  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  O  2  (NMC811) full cell (2.5 mAh cm&#8208;2) to retain 75% of its initial capacity after 200 cycles with an outstanding CE of 99.83%. The concentrated additive strategy presented here provides a drop&#8208;in practical solution to further optimize carbonate electrolytes for beyond Li&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Dearomatization&#8211;Rearomatization Strategy for ortho&#8208;Selective Alkylation of Phenols with Primary Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>Phenols are common precursors and core structures of a variety of industrial chemicals, ranging from pharmaceuticals to polymers. However, the synthesis of site&#8208;specifically substituted phenols is challenging, and thus the development of new methods for this purpose would be highly desirable. Herein, we report a protocol for palladium&#8208;catalyzed  ortho  &#8208;selective alkylation reactions of phenols with primary alcohols via a dearomatization&#8211;rearomatization strategy, with water as the sole by&#8208;product. Various substituted phenols and primary alcohols were compatible with the standard reaction conditions. The detailed mechanism of this transformation was also investigated.</dc:description>

      <title>Quantification of Redox Sites during Catalytic Propane Oxychlorination by&#160;Operando&#160;EPR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Identification and quantification of redox&#8208;active centers at relevant conditions for catalysis is pivotal to understand reaction mechanisms and requires development of advanced&#160;operando&#160;methods. Herein, we demonstrate&#160;operando&#160;EPR spectroscopy as an important technique to quantify the oxidation state of representative CrPO4&#160;and EuOCl catalysts during propane oxychlorination, an attractive route for propylene production. In particular, we show for the first time that the space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of C3H6&#160;correlates with the amount of Cr2+&#160;and Eu2+&#160;ions generated over the catalysts during reaction. These results provide a&#160;powerful strategy to gather quantitative understanding of selective alkane oxidation, which could potentially be extrapolated to other functionalization approaches and operating conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Inside Back Cover: Multiexcitonic Triplet Pair Generation in Oligoacene Dendrimers as Amorphous Solid&#8208;State Miniatures (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 47/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
A multiexcitonic triplet pair state is generated via singlet fission (SF) in several classes of organic compounds. In their Research Article on page&#8197;20956, H. Kim, C. Chi, D. Kim, and co&#8208;workers introduce dendritic structures composed of oligoacene moieties as a strategic approach to reproduce heterogeneous couplings within amorphous solids. In the amorphous solid&#8208;state miniatures, heterogeneous couplings are clearly resolved dissecting the influence of through&#8208;space and bond interactions.

      <title>Boosted Hydrogen Evolution Kinetics over Particulate Lanthanum and Rhodium&#8208;Doped Strontium Titanate Photocatalysts Modified with Phosphonate Groups</title>
      <dc:description>Phosphonate groups loaded on the surface of the visible light responsive photocatalyst Ru&#8208;loaded La,Rh&#8208;doped SrTiO  3  (Ru/La,Rh:STO)  via  a silane coupling treatment enhance the photocatalytic activity of this material during the hydrogen evolution reaction. Surface modification with an alkylsilane phosphonate accelerates the supply of reactants to active sites and is much more effective at improving photocatalytic activity than the utilization of phosphate buffered electrolyte as a reaction solution. In contrast, the incorporation of amine, sulfonate, and propyl groups does not improve the activity of Ru/La,Rh:STO. The effects of these functional groups introduced  via  the silane coupling on the reaction kinetics of hydrogen evolution are evaluated separately from the oxidative reaction using electrochemical methods. It was also demonstrated that the present alkylsilane phosphonate modification increases photocatalytic activity even under a low photon flux. This study introduces a new approach to improving the reaction kinetics of particulate photocatalysts by actively accelerating the reactant mass transfer through the pre&#8208;anchored phosphonate groups as an alternative to the development of the photocatalyst material itself.</dc:description>

      <title>A Stable [4,3]Peri&#8208;acene Diradicaloid: Synthesis, Structure and Electronic Properties</title>
      <dc:description>Synthesis of peri&#8208;fused two or more rows of acenes (peri&#8208;acenes) is challenging due to their intrinsic open&#8208;shell diradical character. Herein, we report the isolation of a derivative (  4  ) of hitherto the largest peri&#8208;acene molecule, namely [4,3]peri&#8208;acene, in a crystal form. The parent [4,3]peri&#8208;acene containing three rows of tetracene has a large diradical character (y  0  = 94.8%) originated from aromatic stabilization. Due to kinetic blocking,  4  showed reasonable stability with a half&#8208;life time of ~157 hours under ambient conditions. Its structure was determined by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, and bond length analysis revealed eight localized Clar&#8217;s sextets.  4  exhibited open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a narrow electrochemical energy gap (1.13 eV) and a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#8208;0.57 kcal/mol from SQUID measurement). Its electronic properties are compared with previously reported peri&#8208;tetracene and teranthene derivatives.</dc:description>

      <title>Reaction Acceleration at Solid/Solution Interfaces: Katritzky Reaction Catalyzed by Glass Particles</title>
      <dc:description>The Katritzky reaction in bulk solution at room temperature is accelerated significantly by the surface of a glass container compared to a plastic container. Remarkably, the reaction rate is increased by more than two orders of magnitude upon the addition of glass particles with the rate increasing linearly with increasing amounts of glass. A similar phenomenon is observed when glass particles are added to levitated droplets, where large acceleration factors are seen. Evidence shows that glass acts as a catalyst: it participates as a base in the deprotonation step and is recovered unchanged from the reaction mixture. Reaction acceleration at two separate interfaces is recognized in this study: (i) air/solution phase acceleration, as is well known in microdroplets; (ii) solid/solution phase, where such acceleration appears to be a new phenomenon.</dc:description>

      <title>Formic Acid Electro&#8208;synthesis by Concurrent Cathodic CO2 Reduction and Anodic CH3OH Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into energy carrying compounds or value&#8208;added chemicals is of great significance for diminishing the greenhouse effect and the efficient utilization of carbon dioxide emissions, which, however, suffers from the kinetic&#8208;sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and its less value&#8208;added production of O  2  . Herein, we report a general strategy for efficient formic acid synthesis by concurrent cathodic    CO  2  reduction and anodic partial methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), using mesoporous SnO  2  grown on carbon cloth (mSnO  2  /CC) and CuO nanosheets grown on copper foam (CuONS/CF) as cathodic and anodic catalysts, respectively. Anodic CuONS/CF enables an extremely lowered potential of 1.47 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) to obtain 100 mA cm  &#8208;2  , featuring a significantly enhanced electro&#8208;activity in comparison to OER. Meanwhile, the cathodic mSnO  2  /CC shows a rather high Faraday efficiency of 81% at 0.7 V vs RHE for formic acid production from CO  2  . Moreover, the established electrolyzer equipped with CuONS/CF at the anode and mSnO  2  /CC at the cathode requires a considerably low cell voltage of 0.93 V at 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  for formic acid production at both sides.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing local electrostatics of glycine in aqueous solution by THz spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Based upon precise terahertz (THz) measurements of the solvated amino acid, glycine, and accompanying ab initio molecular dynamics simulations we show that the N&#8208;C&#8208;C&#8208;O open/close mode at 315 cm&#8722;1 serves as a sensitive, label&#8208;free probe for local protonation of the amide group. Experimentally, we can show that this holds not only for glycine but also for diglycine and valine. The approach is more general, since the changes due to protonation result in intensity changes which can be probed by THz time domain (0 &#8208; 50 cm&#8722;1) as well as by precise THz FT spectroscopy (50 &#8208; 400 cm&#8722;1). A detailed analysis allows us to directly correlate the titration spectra with pKa values. This demonstrates the potential of THz spectroscopy to probe the charge state of a natural amino acid in water in a label free manner.</dc:description>

      <title>High&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells with imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid for surface passivation and charge transport</title>
      <dc:description>Surface defects have been a key constraint for perovskite photovoltaics. Herein, 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;imidazolium hexafluorophosphate (DMIMPF  6  ) ionic liquid (IL) is adopted to passivate the perovskite surface and also reduce the energy barrier between the perovskite and hole transport layer. Theoretical simulation and experimental results demonstrate that Pb&#8208;cluster and Pb&#8208;I antisite defects can be effectively passivated by [DMIM]  +  bonding with the Pb  2+  on the perovskite surface, leading to significantly suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination. As a result, the solar cell efficiency is increased to 23.25% from 21.09% for the control device, mostly due to improvement of open&#8208;circuit voltage. Furthermore, the DMIMPF  6  &#8208;treated perovskite device shows better long term environmental stability because the DMIMPF  6  layer can efficiently block moisture permeation due to its hydrophobic nature. This work provides firm support to the understanding of the passivation effect and further promotes the development of surface engineering for enhancing the performance of perovskite photovoltaics.</dc:description>

While the human nose can distinguish the enantiomers of many chiral odors, the technical realization by an artificial sensor or an electronic nose, e&#8208;nose, remains a challenge. Here, we present an array of six sensors coated with nanoporous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) films of different homochiral and achiral structures, working as an enantioselective e&#8208;nose. While the achiral&#8208;MOF&#8208;film sensors show identical responses for both isomers of one chiral odor molecule, the responses of the homochiral MOF films differ for different enantiomers. By machine learning algorithms, the combined array data allow the stereoselective identification of all compounds, here tested for 5 pairs of chiral odor molecules. We foresee the chiral&#8208;MOF&#8208;e&#8208;nose, able to enantioselectively detect and discriminated chiral odors, to be a powerful approach towards advanced odor sensing.</dc:description>

      <title>An Ethacrynic Acid&#8208;Brominated BODIPY Photosensitizer
(EA&#8208;BPS) Construct Enhances the Lethality of Reactive Oxygen Species in Hypoxic Tumor&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Despite being a clinically approved intervention for cancer, photodynamic therapy (PDT) still suffers from limitations. Prime among these is a therapeutic response that is mostly oxygen dependent. This limits the utility of PDT in treating hypoxic tumors since lower levels of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in regions of low oxygen tension. Glutathione&#8208;pi (GST&#8208;pi) is a key enzyme that militates against ROS&#8208;mediated apoptosis. We report here a new construct, EA&#8208;BPS, that contains both a brominated BODIPY photosensitizer (BPS) and an ethacrynic acid (EA) GST&#8208;pi inhibitor. Photoirradiation of EA&#8208;BPS induces a synergistic antitumor effect that results from the combination of ROS production and GST&#8208;pi inhibition. Relative to BPS alone, an enhanced cell&#8208;killing effect is seen under hypoxic conditions both&#160;in vitro&#160;and&#160;in vivo. We conclude that by making better use of the available oxygen in tumor environments, improved therapeutic PDT outcomes should be achievable even under hypoxic conditions.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based (E&#8208;AB) sensors offer a powerful and general means for analyte detection in complex samples for various applications. Paper&#8208;based E&#8208;AB sensors could enable portable, low&#8208;cost, and rapid detection of a broad range of targets, but it has proven challenging to fabricate suitable three&#8208;electrode systems on paper.

We developed aptamer&#8208;modified PEDs that enable sensitive and specific detection of small molecules in minimally processed biosamples. The sensitivity and stability of the PEDs is comparable to E&#8208;AB sensors based on commercial gold electrodes.

      <title>Bioorthogonal Activation of Dual Catalytic and Anti&#8208;Cancer Activities of Organogold(I) Complexes in Living Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Controllably activating the bio&#8208;reactivity of metal complexes in living systems is challenging but highly desirable because it can minimize off&#8208;target bindings and improve spatiotemporal specificity. Herein we report a new bioorthogonal activation approach by employing Pd(II)&#8208;triggered transmetallation reactions to conditionally activate the bio&#8208;reactivity of NHC&#8208;Au(I)&#8208;phenylacetylide complexes (e.g.,  1a  ) in vitro and in vivo. A combination of  1  H NMR, LC&#8208;MS, DFT calculation and fluorescence screening assays reveals that  1a  displays a reasonable stability against biological thiols, but its phenylacetylide ligand can be efficiently transferred to Pd(II), leading to in situ formation of labile NHC&#8208;Au(I) species that is catalytically active inside living cells and zebrafish, and can meanwhile effectively suppress the activity of thioredoxin reductase, potently inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and efficiently suppress angiogenesis in zebrafish models. Of note, by introducing RGD&#8208;functionalized Pd(II) inducers,  1a  is endowed with highly selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells with minimal influence on the normal counterparts.</dc:description>

      <title>Insights in the topology and the formation of a genuine pps bond: Experimental and computed electron densities in mono anionic trichlorine [Cl3]&#8722;</title>
      <dc:description>So far, several publications have discussed the bonding concepts in polyhalides on a theoretical basis. In particular, the trichlorine monoanion is of great interest because its structure should be symmetrical and show two equidistant Cl&#8722;Cl bonds.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;So far, several publications have discussed the bonding concepts in polyhalides on a theoretical basis. In particular, the trichlorine monoanion is of great interest because its structure should be symmetrical and show two equidistant Cl&#8722;Cl bonds. However, apart from matrix&#8208;isolation studies, only asymmetric trichlorine anions have been reported so far. Herein, the trichlorine monoanions in 2&#8208;chloroethyltrimethylammonium trichloride [NMe  3  EtCl][Cl  3  ],  1  , tetra&#173;methylammonium trichloride [NMe  4  ][Cl  3  ],  2  , and tetrapropylammo&#173;nium trichloride [N  n  Pr  4  ][Cl  3  ],  3  , are analysed.

      <title>Rational Synthesis of 1D Hyperbranched Heterostructures with Enhanced Optoelectronic Performance</title>
      <dc:description>One&#8208;dimensional (1D) hyperbranched heterostructures (HBHSs) with abundant interfaces are rendered with various interfacial phenomena and functionalities. However, the rational synthesis of 1D HBHSs with desired spatial architecture and specific interface remains a great challenge. Here, we report a seeded growth method for controlled synthesis of two extraordinary types of HBHSs, in which high&#8208;intensity of CdS branches selectively grow on 1D nanowire (NW) trunks with different growth behaviors. The composition of the HBHSs can be further tuned by combining with cation exchange method, which enriches the variety of the HBHSs. The optoelectronic devices based on a single HBHS were fabricated and exhibit a better photoresponse performance compared with that of a single NW trunk. This advance provides a strategy for the controlled synthesis HBHSs with complex morphology and offers a platform for exploring their applications for photo harvesting and conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>Theoretical, Solid&#8208;State and Solution Quantification of the Hydrogen Bond Enhanced Halogen Bond</title>
      <dc:description>Proximal noncovalent forces are commonplace in natural systems and understanding the consequences of their juxtaposition is critical. This paper experimentally quantifies for the first time a Hydrogen Bond enhanced Halogen Bond (HBeXB) without the complexities of protein structure or preorganization. An HBeXB is a halogen bond that has been strengthened when the halogen donor simultaneously accepts a hydrogen bond. Our theoretical studies suggest that electron&#8208;rich halogen bond donors are strengthened most by an adjacent hydrogen bond. Furthermore, stronger hydrogen bond donors enhance the halogen bond the most. X&#8208;ray crystal structures of halide complexes (X&#8212; = Br&#8212;, I&#8212;) reveal that HBeXBs produce shorter halogen bonds than non&#8208;hydrogen bond analogues. 19F NMR titrations with chloride highlight that the HBeXB analogue exhibits stronger binding. Together, these results form the foundation for future studies concerning hydrogen bonds and halogen bonds in close proximity.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and two&#8208;dimensional chiral surface self&#8208;assembly of a novel &#960;&#8208;conjugated system with three&#8208;fold symmetry: Benzotri(7&#8208;azaindole)</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of a novel expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, namely benzotri(7&#8208;azaindole), BTAI, is reported. Its C  3h  symmetry along with the integration of six complementary donor and acceptor N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bonds in the conjugated structure promote the 2D self&#8208;assembly on Au(111) over extended areas. Besides, a perfect commensurability with the gold lattice endows the physisorbed molecular film with a remarkable stability. The structural features of BTAI result in two levels of surface chirality: Firstly, the molecules become chiral upon adsorption on the surface.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of a novel expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, namely benzotri(7&#8208;azaindole), BTAI, is reported. Its C  3h  symmetry along with the integration of six complementary donor and acceptor N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bonds in the conjugated structure promote the 2D self&#8208;assembly on Au(111) over extended areas. Besides, a perfect commensurability with the gold lattice endows the physisorbed molecular film with a remarkable stability. The structural features of BTAI result in two levels of surface chirality: Firstly, the molecules become chiral upon adsorption on the surface. Then, due to the favorable N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bond&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly, along with the relative molecular rotation with respect to the substrate, supramolecular chirality manifests in two mirror enantiomorphous domains.

      <title>Giant Optical Anisotropy in the UV&#8208;Transparent 2D Nonlinear Optical Material Sc(IO3)2(NO3)</title>
      <dc:description>Birefringence is a fundamental optical property for linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Thus far, it has proved to be very difficult to engineer large birefringence in optical crystals functioning in the UV region. Herein, we report the first 2D rare&#8208;earth iodate&#8208;nitrate crystal Sc(IO3)2(NO3) (SINO), which is shown to exhibit giant optical anisotropy. Air&#8208;stable SINO possesses a short UV absorption edge (298 nm), a strong NLO response (4.0 times that of benchmark KH2PO4) for the nitrate family, and the largest birefringence (&#916;n&#160;= 0.348 at 546 nm) of inorganic oxide optical crystals. The unusually large birefringence and NLO response can be attributed to an optimized 2D layered structure, combined with highly polarizable and anisotropic building units [IO3]&#8722;&#160;and [NO3]&#8722;. These findings will facilitate development of UV linear and NLO materials with giant optical anisotropy, and promote their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Reaction Mechanism of Pd&#8208;catalyzed "CO&#8208;free"&#160;Carbonylation Reaction Uncovered by In&#8209;situ Spectroscopy: The Formyl Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>&#8220;CO&#8208;free&#8221; carbonylation reactions, where synthesis gas (CO/H2) is substituted by C1 surrogate molecules like formaldehyde or formic acid, have received wide spread attention in homogeneous catalysis lately. Although a broad range of organics is available via this method, still relatively little is known about the precise reaction mechanism. In this work, we used in&#8208;situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to unravel the mechanism of the alkoxycarbonylation of alkenes using different surrogate molecules. In contrast to previous hypotheses no carbon monoxide could be found during the reaction. Instead the reaction proceeds via the C&#8209;H activation of in&#8209;situ generated methyl formate. On the basis of quantitative NMR experiments, a kinetic model involving all major intermediates is built which enables the knowledge&#8208;driven optimization of the reaction. Finally, a new reaction mechanism is proposed on the basis of in&#8208;situ observed Pd&#8208;hydride, Pd&#8208;formyl and Pd&#8208;acyl species.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The development of lead&#8208;free perovskite photoelectric materials has been extensively focused in recent years. Herein, a novel one&#8208;dimensional (1D) lead&#8208;free CsMnCl  3  (H  2  O)  2  single crystal is reported with solvatochromic photoluminescence properties. Interestingly, after contacting with the N, N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMAC) or N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), the crystal structure can transform from 1D CsMnCl  3  (H  2  O)  2  to 0D Cs  3  MnCl  5  and finally transformed into 0D Cs  2  MnCl  4  (H  2  O)  2  . The solvent&#8208;induced crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transformations are accompanied by loss and regaining of water of crystallization, leading to the change of the coordination number of Mn  2+  .

By fabricating a test paper containing CsMnCl  3  (H  2  O)  2  , DMAC and DMF can be detected quickly with the response time less than one minute. These results can expand potential applications for low&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free perovskites.</dc:description>

Furthermore, this result also supplies a smart visible light responsive&#160;Cl  &#8208;  &#160;transporter, which may have applications in&#160;natural photoelectric conversion and photo&#8208;controlled&#160;delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Novel High Yield Synthesis of an Octastannacubane and a Bis(silyl) Stannylene via Reductive Elimination of a Silane</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:  Thermolysis of tris(silyl) tin hydride  2  at 70 &#176;C for 3 hours results in elimination of tBu  2  MeSiH and generation of bis(silyl) stannylene  3  which dimerizes instantaneously yielding distannene  4  .  3  can be trapped by NHC  Me  yielding stannylene&#8208;NHC  Me  complex  5  . Upon heating (70 &#176;C, 24 hours)  4  yields stannyl radical  8  along with pentastannatricyclo[2.1.0.0  2,5  ]pentane  10  (ca. 30%) and traces (ca. 5%) of the novel octastannacubane  9  . Remarkably, octastannacubane  9  is produced in 70% yield by mild heating (50 &#176;C) of 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrasilyldistannane  11  , along with tBu  2  MeSiH.  9  was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy.

      <title>Vinyl and Alkynyl Triazenes: Synthesis, Reactivity, and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Vinyl and alkynyl triazenes have emerged as highly versatile reagents in organic synthesis. The electron&#8208;donating character of the triazene function activates the triple bond of alkynyl triazenes, thereby facilitating addition, cyclization, annulation and rearrangement reactions. Vinyl triazenes, on the other hand, are convenient precursors for vinyl cations, and they can be converted via addition reactions into alkyl triazenes.







Abstract
Aromatic compounds containing triazenyl groups (N3RR&#8242;) have a profound impact on synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry. In contrast, the chemistry of vinyl and alkynyl triazenes was a largely uncharted territory until recently. The situation has changed over the last five years, and it has become apparent that vinyl and alkynyl triazenes are highly interesting compounds with a unique reactivity. The electron&#8208;donating properties of the triazenyl group provide alkynyl triazenes with an ynamide&#8208;like reactivity, which can be exploited in reactions of the triple bond. Vinyl triazenes, on the other hand, can be used for electrophilic vinylation reactions. The foundation for this new triazene chemistry are synthetic pathways which allow preparing vinyl and alkynyl triazenes in few steps from readily available starting materials. In this Minireview, we summarize recent developments in this area.

      <title>The Network of Replication, Transcription, and Reverse Transcription of a Synthetic Genetic Cassette</title>
      <dc:description>Synthetic nucleic acids, with four non&#8208;canonical nucleobases, can function as genetic materials. A comprehensive analysis of PCR amplification, transcription, reverse transcription, and cloning was done to screen for alternative genetic monomers. A small library of six modified nucleobases was selected: the modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside (dZTPs) and ribonucleoside (rZTPs) triphosphates of 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;adenine, 5&#8208;chlorouracil, 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;guanine or inosine together with 5&#8208;fluorocytosine or 5&#8208;bromocytosine. The fragments composed of one to four modified nucleotides (denoted as DZA) have been successfully recognised and transcribed to natural or modified RNA (denoted as RZA) by T7 RNA polymerase. The fully modified RZA fragment could be reverse transcribed and then amplified in the presence of various dZTPs. Noticeably, modified fragments could function as genetic templates  in vivo  by encoding the 678 base pair gene of a fluorescent protein in bacteria. These results demonstrate the existence of a fully simulated genetic circuit that uses synthetic materials.</dc:description>

      <title>A 34&#8208;Electron Superatom Ag78 Cluster with Regioselective Ternary Ligands Shells and Its 2D Rhombic Superlattice Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>The coverage of surface ligands has important influence on the formation, structure and properties of atomically precise metal nanoclusters.  Herein, we report a 78&#8208;nuclei silver nanocluster [Ag  78  (  i  PrPhS)  30  (dppm)  10  Cl  10  ]  4+  (  SD/Ag78a  ; dppm = bis&#8208;(diphenyphosphino)methane) that is synthesized by one&#8208;pot reaction using [Ag(pz)]  n  as precursor (Hpz = pyrazole) and further characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography.  SD/Ag78a  shows a core&#8208;shell structure comprised of an all&#8208;metallic Ag  53  kernel surrounded by an Ag  25  discontinuous metal&#8208;organic shell. The Ag  53  kernel is an Ag  13  Inodecahedron encaged by an Ag  40  drum&#8208;like shell, while the Ag  25  shell consists of two Ag  10  S  10  P  10  Cl  5  rings and five S&#8208;Ag&#8208;S staples. Three types of ligands regioselectively cap on the surface of the Ag  78  nanocluster, forming diverse metal&#8208;ligand interfacial structures such as  S&#8208;Ag&#8208;S staples, Cl&#8208;capped Ag  3  trigons and S&#8208;capped Ag  4  tetragons.  This nanocluster is a closed&#8208;shell 34&#8208;electron superatom with +4 charge state and shows highly featured molecule&#8208;like absorption spectra in the ultraviolet&#8208;visible region with a maximum around 493 nm. The rhombic superlattice assembled from  SD/Ag78a  through intercluster C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions can be formed by a simple drop&#8208;casting treatment. This work not only reveals the complicated surface chemistry of silver nanocluster but also provides a promising ternary ligand strategy for the syntheses of them.</dc:description>

In the presence of phenylcarbinol, ACN exhibited excellent pure water&#8208;splitting ability (95.3 &#956;mol/h) and in the meanwhile phenylcarbinol was selectively oxidized to benzaldehyde (conversion of 90.9%, selectivity of 99.7%) under solar irradiation. For the concurrent reactions,  2  D isotope labeling, separation and detection were conducted to confirm that the proton source of released hydrogen is water.

      <title>Inverting the enantiopreference of nitrilase&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric hydrolysis of prochiral dinitriles by reshaping the binding pocket with a &#8220;mirror&#8208;image&#8221; strategy</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrilase&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric hydrolysis of prochiral dinitriles is an attractive method for the synthesis of chiral cyanocarboxylic acids, the precursors to pharmaceutically important g&#8208;amino acids. However, the tested nitrilases towards 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208; or aryl substituted glutaronitriles mostly generate ( S  )&#8208;configurated cyanocarboxylic acids. Herein a &#8220;mirror&#8208;image&#8221; strategy, i.e. symmetry analysis of substrate&#8208;binding pocket, was applied to identify two key amino acid residues W170 and V198 that possibly modulate the enantiopreference of a nitrilase from Synechocystis  sp. PCC6803 towards 3&#8208;isobutyl glutaronitrile ( 1a  ). Exchange of these two residues resulted in the enantiopreference inversion ( S  , 90% ee  to R  , 47% ee  ). By further reshaping the substrate&#8208;binding pocket via routine site&#8208;saturation and combinatorial mutagenesis, variant E8 with higher activity and stereoselectivity (99% ee  , R  ) was obtained. The mutant enzyme was applied in the preparation of optically pure ( R  )&#8208;3&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;4&#8208;cyanobutanoic acid (( R  )&#8208; 2a  ), and showed similar stereopreference inversion towards a series of 3&#8208;substituted glutaronitriles. This study may offer a general strategy to switch the stereopreference of other nitrilases and other classes of enzymes toward the desymmetric reactions of prochiral substrates with two identical reactive functional groups, that are often desirable in asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

This study may offer a general strategy to switch the stereopreference of other nitrilases and other classes of enzymes toward the desymmetric reactions of prochiral substrates with two identical reactive functional groups, that are often desirable in asymmetric synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Discovery and Design of Family VIII Carboxylesterases as Highly Efficient Acyltransferases</title>
      <dc:description>Promiscuous acyltransferase activity is the ability of certain hydrolases to preferentially catalyze acyl transfer over hydrolysis, even in bulk water. However, poor enantioselectivity, low transfer efficiency, significant product hydrolysis, and limited substrate scope represent considerable drawbacks for their application. By activity&#8208;based screening of several hydrolases, we identified the family VIII carboxylesterase, EstCE1, as an unprecedentedly efficient acyltransferase. EstCE1 catalyzes the irreversible amidation and carbamoylation of amines in water, which enabled the synthesis of the drug moclobemide&#160;from methyl 4&#8208;chlorobenzoate and 4&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)morpholine (~20% conversion). We solved the crystal structure of EstCE1 and detailed structure&#8208;function analysis revealed a three&#8208;amino acid motif important for promiscuous acyltransferase activity.

      <title>Evidence of Highly Anharmonic Soft Lattice Vibrations in Zintl Rattler</title>
      <dc:description>Phonons are collective excitations from a periodic lattice and are the primary carriers of heat in an insulating crystalline solid. The extent of periodicity in a crystalline lattice is ensured by local chemical bonding, thereby, understanding the correlation between local structure and lattice dynamics is crucial in realizing intrinsically low thermal conductivity. Here, we present lattice dynamics associated with the local chemical bonding hierarchy in Zintl compound TlInTe  2  , which cause intriguing phonon excitations and strongly suppress the lattice thermal conductivity to an ultralow value (0.46 &#8208; 0.31 W/mK) in the 300&#8208;673 K. We established an intrinsic rattling nature in TlInTe  2  by studying the local structure and phonon vibrations using synchrotron X&#8208;ray Pair Distribution Function (PDF) (100 &#8211; 503 K) and Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS) (5 &#8211; 450 K), respectively. We showed that while 1D chain of covalently bonded [InTe2](&#8208;n) (n)&#160; transport heat with Debye type phonon excitation, ionically bonded Tl rattles with a frequency ~30 cm  &#8208;1  inside distorted Thompson cage formed by&#160;[InTe2](&#8208;n) (n) . This highly anharmonic Tl rattling causes strong phonon scattering and consequently phonon lifetime reduces to ultralow value ~0.66(6) ps, which resulted ultralow thermal conductivity in TlInTe  2  .</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrogen Bond Donor&#8208;Catalyzed Cationic Polymerization of Vinyl Ethers</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of high molecular weight poly(vinyl ethers) under mild conditions is a significant challenge since cationic polymerizations are highly sensitivity to chain transfer and termination events. We identified a novel and highly effective hydrogen bond donor (HBD)&#8208;organic acid pair that can facilitate controlled cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers under ambient conditions with excellent monomer compatibility. Poly(vinyl ethers) of molar masses exceeding 50 kg/mol can be produced within one hour without elaborate reagent purification. Modification of the HBD structure allowed tuning of the polymerization rate while density functional theory (DFT) calculations helped elucidate crucial intermolecular interactions between the HBD, organic acid, and polymer chain end.</dc:description>

      <title>Phosphine Carboxylate &#8211; Probing the Edge of Stability of a Carbon Dioxide Adduct with Dihydrogenphosphide</title>
      <dc:description>We present a new adduct of carbon dioxide with dihydrogenphosphide, that may be prepared either by direct reaction of NaPH  2  with carbon dioxide or by hydrolysis of the phosphaethynolate ion (PCO  &#8211;  ). In this latter transformation, a new mechanism is proposed for the electrophilic reactivity of the phosphaethynolate ion. The resulting anion is shown to be a weak but stable adduct of carbon dioxide, reminiscent of transition&#8208;metal carbon dioxide complexes. Protonation to form phosphine carboxylic acid (PH  2  COOH) and functionalization to form esters is shown to increase the strength of the P&#8211;C interaction, allowing for comparisons to be drawn between this species and the analogous carbamic (NH  2  COOH) and carbonic acids (H  2  CO  3  ). Functionalization of the oxygen atom is found to stabilize the phosphine carboxylate while also allowing solubility in organic solvents whereas phosphorus functionalization is shown to facilitate decarboxylation. Substituent migration occurs in some cases.</dc:description>

      <title>Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) Functionalized with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene as Robust and Conductive Ligands to Stabilize Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>Due to their excellent stability and conductivity,  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have attracted great attention as versatile ligands for the functionalization of macroscopic gold surfaces. Recently, NHCs are explored as anchor groups to bind organic ligands to colloidal gold (i.e. gold nanoparticles, Au NPs), yet these efforts are confined to non&#8208;conjugated ligands so far &#8211; i.e. focused solely on exploiting the stability aspect. Using NHCs to link Au NPs and electronically active organic components, e.g. conjugated polymers (CPs), will allow capitalizing on both the stability as well as the inherent conductivity of the NHC anchors. Here, we report three types of Br&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au&#8208;X (X = Cl, Br) complexes, which, when used as starting points for Kumada polymerizations, yield regioregular poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophenes)&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au (P3HTs&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au) with narrow molecular weight distributions. The corresponding NPs are obtained  via  direct reduction, and show excellent thermal as well as redox stability. The NHC anchors enable electron delocalization over the gold/CP interface, resulting in an improved electrochromic response behavior in comparison with P3HT&#8208;NHC&#8208;Au. This work demonstrates for the first time that CPs functionalized with NHCs can serve as ligands for the stabilization of Au NPs, paving a way for potential (opto&#8208;)electronical applications of CP&#8208;NHC@Au NP nanomaterials.</dc:description>

      <title>Pairwise Proximity&#8208;differentiated Visualization of Single&#8208;cell DNA Epigenetic Marks</title>
      <dc:description>Spatial positioning and proximity of DNA epigenetic marks are fundamental to a deeper understanding of gene regulation and chromatin architecture. However, it remains poorly explored and technically challenging. Here we report pairwise proximity&#8208;differentiated visualization of single&#8208;cell 5&#8208;formylcytosine (5fC) and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). These two marks on chromatin in fixed cells are successively labeled and crosslinked with their DNA primer probes via click chemistry. Based on a pairwise proximity&#8208;differentiated mechanism, proximal 5fC/5hmC sites firstly and residual 5fC or 5hmC sites then are encoded with respective circularized barcodes. These barcodes are simultaneously amplified for multiplexed single&#8208;molecule imaging. Thus we demonstrate differentiated visualization of 5fC or 5hmC spatial positioning and their pairwise proximity in single cells. Such multi&#8208;level subcellular information may provide insights into regulation functions and mechanisms of chromatin modifications, and the spatial proximity can expose the potential crosstalk or interaction between their reader proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>Platinum(II) Complexes with Bis(pyrazolyl)borate Ligands: Increased Molecular Rigidity for Bidentate Ligand Systems</title>
      <dc:description>The structural motif of platinum(II) complexes bearing cyclometalating  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands can be used to design deep&#8208;blue phosphors for application in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, the photophysical properties of the resulting molecules are also highly dependent on the auxiliary ligand. These often allow molecular deformations in the excited state which contribute to non&#8208;radiative decay processes that diminish the attainable quantum yield. The use of bis(pyrazolyl)borate based auxiliary ligands enforces a high molecular rigidity due to their unique geometry. The steric crowding in the coordination sphere inhibits deformation processes and results in highly efficient deep&#8208;blue platinum(II) emitters with CIE coordinates below (0.15; 0,15).</dc:description>
