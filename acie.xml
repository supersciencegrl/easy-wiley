         <title>Hybrid Acid/alkali All Covalent Organic Frameworks Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery was developed by coupling pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone based COF cathode with anthraquinone based COF anode, presenting excellent electrochemical performances with wide voltage window, high capacity and good cyclic stability.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), thanks to their adjustable porous structure and abundant build&#8208;in functional motifs, have been recently regarded as promising electrode materials for a variety of batteries. There still remain grand opportunities to further utilizing their merits for developing advanced COFs&#8208;based batteries. In this paper, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery by coupling pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone based COF cathode with anthraquinone based COF anode. In such a hybrid acid/alkali all&#8208;COFs battery, the cathodic COF favorably works in acid with a relatively positive potential, while the anodic COF preferably runs in alkali with a relatively negative potential. It thus can deliver a decently high discharge capacity of 92.97&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a wide voltage window of 2.0&#8197;V, and exhibit high energy density of 74.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 along with a considerable cyclic stability over 300 cycles. The development of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept all&#8208;COFs battery may drive forward the improvement of newly cost&#8208;effective and performance&#8208;reliable energy storage devices.

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination of Iridium Single&#8208;atom IrN3O Boosting Formic Acid Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated a rational catalyst design process by integrating theoretical prediction and experimental realization. Asymmetrically coordinated iridium single atoms IrN3O embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon frameworks are unambiguously revealed for the optimum formic acid electro&#8208;oxidation catalysis, which reaches a peak current of 20.04&#8197;A&#8201;mgIr&#8722;1, 167&#8197;times superior to that of the Ir/C nanocatalyst.







Abstract
Rational design of the proximal coordination of an active site to achieve its optimum catalytic activity is the ultimate goal in single&#8208;atom catalysis, but still challenging. Here, we report theoretical prediction and experimental realization of an asymmetrically coordinated iridium single&#8208;atom catalyst (IrN3O) for the formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR). Theoretical calculations reveal that the substitution of one or two nitrogen with more electronegative oxygen in the symmetric IrN4 motif splits and downshifts the Ir 5d orbitals with respect to the Fermi level, moderating the binding strength of key intermediates on IrN4&#8722;xOx (x=1, 2) sites, especially that the IrN3O motif shows ideal activity for FAOR with a near&#8208;zero overpotential. The as&#8208;designed asymmetric Ir motifs were realized by pyrolyzing Ir precursor with oxygen&#8208;rich glucose and nitrogen&#8208;rich melamine, exhibiting a mass activity of 25 and 87 times greater than those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pd/C and Pt/C, respectively.

         <title>Polymerization Strategies to Construct a 3D Polymer Passivation Network toward High Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional polymer passivation network was constructed by combining the bulk in situ polymerization and surface pre&#8208;polymerization/secondary polymerization strategies. The all&#8208;rounded passivation structure increased carrier diffusion length, promoted energy level alignment and carrier injection. Corresponding devices achieve a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.194&#8197;V with an efficiency over 24&#8201;%, and module also achieves an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;%.







Abstract
The spontaneously formed uncoordinated Pb2+ defects usually make the perovskite films demonstrate strong n&#8208;type with relatively lower carrier diffusion length and serious non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss. In this work, we adopt different polymerization strategies to construct three&#8208;dimensional passivation frameworks in the perovskite layer. Thanks to the strong C&#8801;N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pb coordination bonding and the penetrating passivation structure, the defect state density is obviously reduced, accompanied by a significant increase in the carrier diffusion length. Additionally, the reduction of iodine vacancies also changed the Fermi level of the perovskite layer from strong n&#8208;type to weak n&#8208;type, which substantially promotes the energy level alignment and carrier injection efficiency. As a result, the optimized device achieved an efficiency exceeded 24&#8201;% (the certified efficiency is 24.16&#8201;%) with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.194&#8197;V, and the corresponding module achieved an efficiency of 21.55&#8201;%.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of AIEgen&#8208;based Porous Organic Polymer Films by Interfacial Amino&#8208;yne Click Polymerization for Efficient Light&#8208;Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a catalyst&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economical interfacial amino&#8208;yne click polymerization to in situ synthesize new AIEgen&#8208;based free&#8208;standing POP films at room temperature. These POP films show bright luminescence with high PLQY up to 37.8&#8201;% and can encapsulate the organic dyes to form efficient artificial light&#8208;harvesting thin films.







Abstract
We developed a catalyst&#8208;free, atom&#8208;economical interfacial amino&#8208;yne click polymerization to in situ synthesize new aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based free&#8208;standing porous organic polymer films at room temperature. The crystalline properties of POP films were confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. The good porosity of these POP films was proved by their N2 uptake experiments. The thickness of POP films can be easily regulated from 16&#8197;nm to &#8776;1&#8197;&#956;m by adjusting monomer concentration. More importantly, these AIEgen&#8208;based POP films show bright luminescence with high absolute photoluminescent quantum yields up to 37.8&#8201;% and good chemical and thermal stability. The AIEgen&#8208;based POP film can encapsulate an organic dye (e.g., Nile red) to further form an artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with a large red&#8208;shift (&#916;&#955;=141&#8197;nm), highly efficient energy&#8208;transfer ability (&#934;ET=91&#8201;%), and high antenna effect (11.3).

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly Induced Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence of Copper Nanoclusters Using DNA Nanoribbon Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) are attractive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emitters as Cu is comparatively inexpensive, nontoxic, and highly abundant. However, their ECL yield is relatively low. Herein, we report that orderly self&#8208;assembly of CuNCs using DNA nanoribbon as the template (DNR/CuNCs) conferred the CuNCs with improved ECL properties compared with individual CuNCs in both annihilation and co&#8208;reactant processes. The DNR/CuNCs resulted in a high ECL yield of 46.8% in K2S2O8, which was ~ 68 times higher than that of individual CuNCs. This strategy was successfully extended to other ECL emitters, such as gold nanoclusters and the Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA system. Furthermore, as an application of DNR/CuNCs, a DNR/CuNC&#8208;based ECL biosensor with higher sensitivity was constructed for dopamine determination (two orders of magnitude lower than that previously reported), showing that DNR/CuNCs have a potential for application in ECL bioanalysis as a new type of superior luminophore candidate.</dc:description>

Herein, we report that orderly self-assembly of CuNCs using DNA nanoribbon as the template (DNR/CuNCs) conferred the CuNCs with improved ECL properties compared with individual CuNCs in both annihilation and co-reactant processes. The DNR/CuNCs resulted in a high ECL yield of 46.8% in K2S2O8, which was ~ 68 times higher than that of individual CuNCs. This strategy was successfully extended to other ECL emitters, such as gold nanoclusters and the Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA system. Furthermore, as an application of DNR/CuNCs, a DNR/CuNC-based ECL biosensor with higher sensitivity was constructed for dopamine determination (two orders of magnitude lower than that previously reported), showing that DNR/CuNCs have a potential for application in ECL bioanalysis as a new type of superior luminophore candidate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Small Data Can Play a Big Role in Chemical Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry community is currently witnessing a surge of scientific discoveries in organic chemistry supported by machine learning (ML) techniques. Whereas many of these techniques were developed for big data applications, the nature of experimental organic chemistry often confines practitioners to small datasets. Herein, we touch upon the limitations associated with small data in ML and emphasize the impact of bias and variance on constructing reliable predictive models. We aim to raise awareness to these possible pitfalls, and thus, provide an introductory guideline for good practice. Ultimately, we stress the great value associated with statistical analysis of small data, which can be further boosted by adopting a holistic data&#8208;centric approach in chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Carrier Diffusion Enables Efficient Back&#8208;Contact Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Back&#8208;contact architectures offer a promising route to improve record efficiencies of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by eliminating parasitic light absorption. However, the performance of back&#8208;contact PSCs is limited by inadequate carrier diffusion in perovskite. Here, we report that perovskite films with a preferred out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation show improved carrier dynamic properties. With the addition of guanidine thiocyanate, the films exhibit carrier lifetimes and mobilities increased by 3 &#8208; 5 times, leading to diffusion lengths exceeding 7 mm. The enhanced carrier diffusion results from substantial suppression of nonradiative recombination and improves charge collection. Devices using such films achieve reproducible efficiencies reaching 11.2%, among the best performances for back&#8208;contact PSCs. Our findings demonstrate the impact of carrier dynamics on back&#8208;contact PSCs and provide the basis for a new route to high&#8208;performance back&#8208;contact perovskite optoelectronic devices at low cost.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Breakthrough Separation of 2&#8208;Butene Isomers with High Dynamic Selectivity and Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing porous sorbents&#160;represents a potential energy&#8208;efficient way for industrial gas separation.&#160;However, a bottleneck for reducing the energy penalty is the trade&#8208;off between dynamic adsorption capacity and selectivity. Herein, we showed this problem can be overcome by modulating the kinetic and thermodynamic separation behaviours in metal&#8208;organic frameworks for sieving 2&#8208;butene geometric isomers, which are desired for upgrading the raffinates to higher value&#8208;added end products. We found that the iron&#8208;triazolate framework can realize the selective shape screening of 2&#8208;butene isomers assisted by electrostatic interactions at the pore apertures. Further introducing uncoordinated N binding sites by ligand substitution lowered the gas diffusion barrier and greatly boosted the dynamic separation&#160;performance. In breakthrough tests under ambient conditions, trans&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 can be efficiently separated from cis&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 with a record capacity of 2.10 mmol/g with high dynamic selectivity of 2.39.</dc:description>

         <title>Driving Polymer Brushes from Synthesis to Functioning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The great success of controlled radical polymerizations has encouraged researchers to develop more facile and robust approaches for surface&#8208;initiated polymerizations (SIPs) to fabricate polymer brushes, even for non&#8208;experts. In recent years, external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;mediated radical polymerization methods have come to the fore as SIPs because of their less rigorous synthetic procedures and high controllability, which expand the opportunities for synthesizing macromolecules with desired chemical compositions and structures, as well as tailor&#8208;made polymers and bioconjugates that show broad applicability and physiological compatibility. This review discusses the latest developments in surface&#8208;initiated polymerization methods, in particular, external&#8208;stimuli mediated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), photo&#8208;induced polymerizations, and reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, as well as other methods and their combination for the application in surface grafting. The implementation of these methods is of great interest due to their unique possibilities to temporally control a polymerization process, fast and straightforward polymerization, and environmentally benign features, which lead to established and emerging applications in biolubrication, antifouling, and biosensing.</dc:description>

         <title>A Facile Strategy for the Development of Recyclable Multifunctional Liquid Crystal Polymers via Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification and Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) offers a versatile approach for engineering multifunctional polymers, but this advantage has not been fully exploited to fabricate multifunctional liquid crystal polymers (LCPs). Here, we design a facile synthetic approach towards multifunctional LCP by combining the ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) with PPM, in which ROMP helps to prepare a reactive LCP precursor with high molecular weight, and PPM provides a facilitation to introduce functional groups into the precursor. Consequently, a photo&#8208; and humidity&#8208;responsive linear LCP (LLCP) is demonstrated to show the potential of this synthetic strategy to diversify functions of the LCPs. Under light irradiation and humidity changes, the deformation modes of the LLCP films are converted to complex shapes (bending, twisting, and curling). The obtained dual&#8208;responsive LLCP with high molecular weight possesses excellent processability and recyclability, making it possible to construct 3D shape actuators with programmable deformation behaviors under light/humidity.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Organic&#8208;Cation Defects on Optoelectronic Properties of ASnI3 Perovskites A=HC(NH2)2, CH3NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve higher power conversion efficiency for tin organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites the critical role of organic defects in nonradiative recombination should be better understood. Random rotation of organic cation can suppress nonradiative carrier trapping owing to organic defects in FASnI3 [FA=HC(NH2)2], rendering the organic contributions for defect tolerance. In contrast, organic defects in MASnI3 (MA=CH3NH3) are strong and active trapping centers.







Abstract
Tin organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskites (tin OIHPs) possess a desirable band gap and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached 14&#8201;%. A commonly held view is that the organic cations in tin OIHPs would have little impact on the optoelectronic properties. Herein, we show that the defective organic cations with randomly dynamic characteristics can have marked effect on optoelectronic properties of the tin OIHPs. Hydrogen vacancies originated from the proton dissociation from FA [HC(NH2)2] in FASnI3 can induce deep transition levels in the band gap but yield relatively small nonradiative recombination coefficients of 10&#8722;15&#8197;cm3&#8201;s&#8722;1, whereas those from MA (CH3NH3) in MASnI3 can yield much larger nonradiative recombination coefficients of 10&#8722;11&#8197;cm3&#8201;s&#8722;1. Additional insight into the &#8220;defect tolerance&#8221; is gained by disentangling the correlations between dynamic rotation of organic cations and charge&#8208;carrier dynamics.

         <title>Computational Evolution Of New Catalysts For The Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Reaction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalyst of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman was discovered using a graph&#8208;based genetic algorithm. The catalytic activity was experimentally verified by a kinetic study and the newly discovered catalysts outcompetes a widely used catalyst for this reaction.







Abstract
We present a de novo discovery of an efficient catalyst of the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction by searching chemical space for molecules that lower the estimated barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step using a genetic algorithm (GA) starting from randomly selected tertiary amines. We identify 435 candidates, virtually all of which contain an azetidine N as the catalytically active site, which is discovered by the GA. Two molecules are selected for further study based on their predicted synthetic accessibility and have predicted rate&#8208;determining barriers that are lower than that of a known catalyst. Azetidines have not been used as catalysts for the MBH reaction. One suggested azetidine is successfully synthesized and showed an eightfold increase in activity over a commonly used catalyst. We believe this is the first experimentally verified de novo discovery of an efficient catalyst using a generative model.

         <title>Practical and General Alcohol Deoxygenation Protocol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for alcohol deoxygenation that functions across a wide range of alcohol structures is reported. This approach combines the reductive potency of carbon dioxide radical anion with acidic additives to promote the kinetically slow C(sp3)&#8722;O bond cleavage.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a practical protocol for the removal of alcohol functional groups through reductive cleavage of their benzoate ester analogs. This transformation requires a strong single electron transfer (SET) reductant and a means to accelerate slow fragmentation following substrate reduction. To accomplish this, we developed a photocatalytic system that generates a potent reductant from formate salts alongside Br&#248;nsted or Lewis acids that promote fragmentation of the reduced intermediate. This deoxygenation procedure is effective across structurally and electronically diverse alcohols and enables a variety of difficult net transformations. This protocol requires no precautions to exclude air or moisture and remains efficient on multigram scale. Finally, the system can be adapted to a one&#8208;pot benzoylation&#8208;deoxygenation sequence to enable direct alcohol deletion. Mechanistic studies validate that the role of acidic additives is to promote the key C(sp3)&#8722;O bond fragmentation step.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Adsorbed Polymer&#8208;Electrolyte Interphases for Stabilizing Metal Anodes in Aqueous Zn and Non&#8208;Aqueous Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optimized PEG adsorption interphases realize highly reversible Zn/Li anodes. The organic/inorganic SEI layer induced by the adsorbed PEG interphases plays a key role in the stability of the metal anode and the low N/P ratio full cells.







Abstract
Polymers are known to adsorb spontaneously from liquid solutions in contact with high&#8208;energy substrates to form configurationally complex, but robust phases that often exhibit higher durability than might be expected from the individual physical bonds formed with the substrate. Rational control of the physical, chemical, and transport properties of such interphases has emerged as a fundamental opportunity for scientific and technological advances in energy storage technology but requires in&#8208;depth understanding of the conformation states and electrochemical effect of the adsorbed polymers. Here, we analyze the interfacial adsorption of oligomeric polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains of moderate sizes dissolved in protic and aprotic liquid electrolytes and find that there is an optimum polymer molecular weight of approximately 400&#8197;Da at which the highest columbic efficiency is achieved for both Zn and Li deposition. These findings point to a simple, versatile approach for extending the lifetime of batteries.

         <title>Cationic Tetrylene&#8208;Iron(0) Complexes: Access Points for Cooperative, Reversible Bond Activation and Open&#8208;Shell Iron(&#8722;I) Ferrato&#8208;Tetrylenes
</title>

         <dc:description>
Cationic tetrylene centres, built into a chelating ligand framework, allow for the formation of reactive CO&#8208;free iron(0) complexes. For Sn, a highly reactive high&#8208;spin, open&#8208;shell d8 complex is formed, capable of the cooperative, reversible activation of H2 at the Sn&#8722;Fe interface. Both EII&#8722;Fe0 complexes (E=Ge, Sn) also undergo one&#8208;electron reduction to form unique iron(&#8722;I) ferrato&#8208;tetrylenes, a compound class which was previously unknown.







Abstract
The open&#8208;shell cationic stannylene&#8208;iron(0) complex 4 (4=[PhiPDippSn&#8901;Fe&#8901;IPr]+; PhiPDipp={[Ph2PCH2Si(iPr)2](Dipp)N}; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; IPr=[(Dipp)NC(H)]2C:) cooperatively and reversibly cleaves dihydrogen at the Sn&#8722;Fe interface under mild conditions (1.5&#8197;bar, 298&#8197;K), in forming bridging hydrido&#8208;complex 6. The One&#8208;electron oreduction of the related GeII&#8722;Fe0 complex 3 leads to oxidative addition of one C&#8722;P linkage of the PhiPDipp ligand in an intermediary Fe&#8722;I complex, leading to FeI phosphide species 7. One&#8208;electron reduction reaction of 4 gives access to the iron(&#8722;I) ferrato&#8208;stannylene, 8, giving evidence for the transient formation of such a species in the reduction of 3. The covalently bound tin(II)&#8208;iron(&#8722;I) compound 8 has been characterised through EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry, and supporting computational analysis, which strongly indicate a high localization of electron spin density at Fe&#8722;I in this unique d9&#8208;iron complex.

         <title>Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;Extended Double [9]Helicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented &#960;&#8208;extended double [9]helicene D9H with D2 symmetry has been synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. D9H exhibits a high photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;=18&#8201;%) in the near&#8208;infrared region and notable dissymmetry factor (gCD=0.019) in the visible region.







Abstract
Double helicenes are appealing chiral frameworks. Their &#960;&#8208;extension is desirable to achieve (chir)optical response in the visible and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, but access to higher double [n]helicenes (n&#8805;8) has remained challenging. Herein, we report an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;extended double [9]helicene (D9H), unambiguously revealing its structure by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. D9H shows remarkable NIR emission from 750 to 1100&#8197;nm with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 18&#8201;%. In addition, optically pure D9H exhibits panchromatic circular dichroism with a notable dissymmetry factor (gCD) of 0.019 at 590&#8197;nm, which is among the highest in the visible region for reported helicenes.

         <title>A Multiresponsive Functional AIEgen for Spatiotemporal Pattern Control and All&#8208;round Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chromone&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorogen called CPVCM which can undergo a specific amination with primary amines and photoarrangement under UV irradiation at the same active site were reported, along with its applications of developing multiple&#8208;colored images, a quick response code with dynamic colors and an all&#8208;round information encryption system which indicated the properties of multiple controls and responses.







Abstract
Functional materials with multi&#8208;responsive properties and good controllability are highly desired for developing bioinspired and intelligent multifunctional systems. Although some chromic molecules have been developed, it is still challenging to realize in situ multicolor fluorescence changes based on a single luminogen. Herein, we reported an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogen called CPVCM, which can undergo a specific amination with primary amines to trigger luminescence change and photoarrangement under UV irradiation at the same active site. Detailed mechanistic insights were carried out to illustrate the reactivity and reaction pathways. Accordingly, multiple&#8208;colored images, a quick response code with dynamic colors, and an all&#8208;round information encryption system were demonstrated to show the properties of multiple controls and responses. It is believed that this work not only provides a strategy to develop multiresponsive luminogens but also develops an information encryption system based on luminescent materials.

         <title>Contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis for Direct Synthesis of H2O2 under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an indispensable basic reagent in various industries, such as textile bleach, chemical synthesis, and environmental protection. However, it is challenging to prepare H2O2 in a green, safe, simple and efficient way under ambient conditions. Here, we found that H2O2 could be synthesized using a catalytic pathway only by contact charging a two&#8208;phase interface at room temperature and normal pressure. Particularly, under the action of mechanical force, electron transfer occurs during physical contact between polytetrafluoroethylene particles and deionized water/O2 interfaces, inducing the generation of reactive free radicals (&#183;OH and &#183;O2&#8208;), and the free radicals could react to form H2O2, yielding as high as 313 &#956;mol L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. In addition, the new reaction device could show long&#8208;term stable H2O2 production. This work provides a novel method for the efficient preparation of H2O2, which may also stimulate further explorations on contact&#8208;electrification&#8208;induced chemistry process.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic pH Buffer for Dendrite&#8208;Free and Shuttle&#8208;Free Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;iodine (I2) batteries are attractive for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, drawbacks include, Zn dendrites, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), corrosion and, cathode &#8216;shuttle&#8217; of polyiodines. Here we report a class of N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds as organic pH buffers to obviate these. We evidence that addition of pyridine /imidazole regulates electrolyte pH, and inhibits HER and anode corrosion. In addition, pyridine and imidazole preferentially absorb on Zn metal, regulating non&#8208;dendritic Zn plating /stripping, and achieving a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% and long&#8208;term cycling stability of 3,200 h at 2 mA cm&#8208;2, 2 mAh cm&#8208;2. It is also confirmed that pyridine inhibits polyiodines shuttling and boosts conversion kinetics for I&#8208;/I2. As a result, the Zn&#8208;I2 full battery exhibits long cycle stability of &gt; 25,000 cycles and high specific capacity of 105.5 mAh g&#8208;1 at 10 A g&#8208;1. We conclude organic pH buffer engineering is practical for dendrite&#8208;free and shuttle&#8208;free Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Intermolecular Coupling of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Allenes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new protocols for regiodivergent and enantioselective coupling of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes and aldehydes promoted by easily accessible Co complexes were developed. These processes represent the first example of transformations through enantioselective oxidative cyclization of allenes and aldehydes with diverse regioselectivities accurately controlled by chiral ligands.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective coupling of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes and aldehydes through regiodivergent oxidative cyclization followed by stereoselective protonation or reductive elimination promoted by chiral phosphine&#8208;Co complexes is presented. Such processes represent unprecedented and unique reaction pathways for Co catalysis that enable catalytic enantioselective generation of metallacycles with divergent regioselectivity accurately controlled by chiral ligands, affording a wide range of allylic alcohols and homoallylic alcohols that are otherwise difficult to access without the need of pre&#8208;formation of stoichiometric amounts of alkenyl&#8208; and allyl&#8208;metal reagents in up to 92&#8201;% yield, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 regioselectivity, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er.

         <title>Exciton Localization for Highly Luminescent Two&#8208;Dimensional Tin&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskites through Tin Vacancy Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal and efficient Sn2+ vacancy tuning strategy is proposed to achieve strongly localized excitons in two&#8208;dimensional (OA)2SnI4 (OA=octylammonium) perovskite nanosheets by separating corner&#8208;sharing [SnI6]4&#8722; octahedra, thereby promoting their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to &#8776;64&#8201;%, which is among the highest values reported thus far for tin iodide perovskites.







Abstract
Exciton localization is an approach for preparing highly luminescent semiconductors. However, realizing strongly localized excitonic recombination in low&#8208;dimensional materials such as two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites remains challenging. Herein, we first propose a simple and efficient Sn2+ vacancy (VSn) tuning strategy to enhance excitonic localization in 2D (OA)2SnI4 (OA=octylammonium) perovskite nanosheets (PNSs), increasing their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to &#8776;64&#8201;%, which is among the highest values reported for tin iodide perovskites. Combining experimental with first&#8208;principles calculation results, we confirm that the significantly increased PLQY of (OA)2SnI4 PNSs is primarily due to self&#8208;trapped excitons with highly localized energy states induced by VSn. Moreover, this universal strategy can be applied for improving other 2D Sn&#8208;based perovskites, thereby paving a new way to fabricate diverse 2D lead&#8208;free perovskites with desirable PL properties.

         <title>Tailoring the Asymmetric Structure of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Light&#8208;promoted Selective and Efficient Gold Extraction and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely controlling the MOF structure, the electronic structure of the amino group was optimized to act as a double donor of electrons and protons in the process of gold reduction and desorption, thus realizing the selective adsorption, rapid reduction and efficient recovery of gold ions in electronic waste.







Abstract
Designing adsorption materials with high adsorption capacities and selectivities is highly desirable for precious metal recovery. Desorption performance is also particularly crucial for subsequent precious metal recovery and adsorbent regeneration. Herein, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) material (NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) with an asymmetric electronic structure of the central zirconium oxygen cluster has an exceptional gold extraction capacity of 2.04&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 under light irradiation. The selectivity of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 for gold ions is up to 98.8&#8201;% in the presence of interfering ions. Interestingly, the gold ions adsorbed on the surface of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 spontaneously reduce in situ, undergo nucleation and growth and finally achieve the phase separation of high&#8208;purity gold particles from NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66. The desorption and separation efficiency of gold particles from the adsorbent surface reaches 89&#8201;%. Theoretical calculations indicate that &#8208;NH2 functions as a dual donor of electrons and protons, and the asymmetric structure of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 leads to energetically advantageous multinuclear gold capture and desorption. This adsorption material can greatly facilitate the recovery of gold from wastewater and can easily realize the recycling of the adsorbent.

&lt;p&gt;By precisely controlling the MOF structure, the electronic structure of the amino group was optimized to act as a double donor of electrons and protons in the process of gold reduction and desorption, thus realizing the selective adsorption, rapid reduction and efficient recovery of gold ions in electronic waste.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing adsorption materials with high adsorption capacities and selectivities is highly desirable for precious metal recovery. Desorption performance is also particularly crucial for subsequent precious metal recovery and adsorbent regeneration. Herein, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) material (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-UiO-66) with an asymmetric electronic structure of the central zirconium oxygen cluster has an exceptional gold extraction capacity of 2.04&#8197;g&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under light irradiation. The selectivity of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-UiO-66 for gold ions is up to 98.8&#8201;% in the presence of interfering ions. Interestingly, the gold ions adsorbed on the surface of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-UiO-66 spontaneously reduce in situ, undergo nucleation and growth and finally achieve the phase separation of high-purity gold particles from NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-UiO-66. The desorption and separation efficiency of gold particles from the adsorbent surface reaches 89&#8201;%. Theoretical calculations indicate that -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; functions as a dual donor of electrons and protons, and the asymmetric structure of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-UiO-66 leads to energetically advantageous multinuclear gold capture and desorption. This adsorption material can greatly facilitate the recovery of gold from wastewater and can easily realize the recycling of the adsorbent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking a (Pseudo)&#8208;Mechanically Interlocked Molecule with a Coronene &#8220;Shoehorn&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM) comprising a tetragold metallobox and a tetraoctynyl&#8208;pyrene guest that can be regarded as a pseudo&#8208;metallosuit[4]ane is described. In contrast to other MIMs, the tetrasubstituted guest can be released from this molecule by the addition of coronene through a &#8220;shoehorning&#8221; mechanism.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) have gained increasing interest during the last decades, not only because of their aesthetic appeal, but also because their unique properties have allowed them to find applications in nanotechnology, catalysis, chemosensing and biomedicine. Herein we describe how a pyrene molecule with four octynyl substituents can be easily encapsulated within the cavity of a tetragold(I) rectangle&#8208;like metallobox, by template formation of the metallo&#8208;assembly in the presence of the guest. The resulting assembly behaves as a mechanically interlocked molecule (MIM), in which the four long limbs of the guest protrude from the entrances of the metallobox, thus locking the guest inside the cavity of the metallobox. The new assembly resembles a metallo&#8208;suit[4]ane, given the number of protruding long limbs and the presence of the metal atoms in the host molecule. However, unlike normal MIMs, this molecule can release the tetra&#8208;substituted pyrene guest by the addition of coronene, which can smoothly replace the guest in the cavity of the metallobox. Combined experimental and computational studies allowed the role of the coronene molecule in facilitating the release of the tetrasubstituted pyrene guest to be explained, through a process that we named &#8220;shoehorning&#8221;, as the coronene compresses the flexible limbs of the guest so that it can reduce its size to slide in and out the metallobox.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring promising electrolyte&#8208;system with high reversible Mg plating/stripping and excellent stability is essential for rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs). Fluoride alkyl magnesium salts (Mg(ORF)2) not only possess high solubility in ether solvents but also compatible with Mg metal anode, thus hold a vast application prospect. Herein, a series of diverse Mg(ORF)2 were synthesized, among them, perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butanol magnesium (Mg(PFTB)2)/AlCl3/MgCl2 based electrolyte demonstrates highest oxidation stability, and promotes the in&#8208;situ formation of robust solid electrolyte interface. Consequently, the fabricated symmetric cell sustains a long&#8208;term cycling over 2000 h, and asymmetric cell exhibits a stable Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% over 3000 cycles. Furthermore, the Mg||Mo6S8 full cell maintains a stable cycling over 500 cycles. This work presents guidance for understanding structure&#8208;property relationships and electrolyte applications of fluoride alkyl magnesium salts.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;(Morpholine&#8208;4&#8208;dithio)phthalimide: A Shelf&#8208;Stable, Bilateral Platform Molecule Enabling Access to Diverse Unsymmetrical Disulfides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shelf&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare disulfurating reagent with chemoselectively displaceable amino and imide leaving groups is described. Protonation of this reagent promotes exclusive displacement of the amino group with various neutral carbon nucleophiles. The resulting dithiophthalimides are amenable to diverse substitution reactions under basic or neutral conditions, thus enabling expedient access to structurally diverse unsymmetrical disulfides.







Abstract
Synthetic methods for unsymmetrical disulfides are greatly needed owing to their applications in drug discovery, linker chemistry, and materials sciences. In this study, a new shelf&#8208;stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare bilateral disulfurating platform molecule, N&#8208;(morpholine&#8208;4&#8208;dithio)phthalimide, has been developed for the divergent synthesis of unsymmetrical disulfides. The amino and imide leaving groups of this reagent can be orthogonally transformed. Under acidic conditions, the amino moiety undergoes selective protonation and thus can be displaced by various carbon nucleophiles, such as allyl trimethylsilanes, alkynyl silanes, and electron&#8208;rich arenes, leaving the phthalimide moiety untouched. Meanwhile, the phthalimide leaving group is amenable to substitution under basic or neutral conditions. The combination of these transformations provides rapid access to diverse unsymmetrical disulfides through two C&#8722;S bond&#8208;forming reactions.

         <title>Facile Synthesis and Chiral Resolution of Expanded Helicenes with up to 35 cata&#8208;Fused Benzene Rings
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanded helicenes with up to 35 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings can be synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;coupling&#8208;mediated oligomerization followed by bismuth(III)&#8208;triflate&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of vinyl ethers. Their chiroptical properties were also studied.







Abstract
Expanded helicenes are expected to show enhanced chiroptical properties as compared to the classical helicenes but the synthesis is very challenging. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a series of expanded helicenes Hn (n=1&#8211;4) containing 11, 19, 27 and 35 cata&#8208;fused benzene rings through Suzuki coupling&#8208;based oligomerization followed by Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated regioselective cyclization of vinyl ethers. Their structures were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Enantiopure H2, H3, and H4 can be isolated by chiral HPLC and they all exhibit strong chiroptical responses with high absorption dissymmetry factor (|gabs|) values (0.020 for H2, 0.021 for H3, and 0.021&#8211;0.024 for H4).

         <title>Modular Synthesis of a Tridecasaccharide Motif of Bacteroides vulgatus Lipopolysaccharides against Inflammatory Bowel Diseases through an Orthogonal One&#8208;Pot Glycosylation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tridecasaccharide from Bacteroides vulgatus mpk lipopolysaccharides has been synthesized for the first time by a strategy involving orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation reactions based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which precluded issues such as aglycone transfer and the unpleasant odor of thioglycoside&#8208;based orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation.







Abstract
Lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides vulgatus represent interesting targets for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.

&lt;p&gt;A tridecasaccharide from &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides vulgatus&lt;/i&gt; mpk lipopolysaccharides has been synthesized for the first time by a strategy involving orthogonal one-pot glycosylation reactions based on glycosyl &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-(1-phenylvinyl)benzoates, which precluded issues such as aglycone transfer and the unpleasant odor of thioglycoside-based orthogonal one-pot glycosylation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipopolysaccharides from &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides vulgatus&lt;/i&gt; represent interesting targets for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. However, efficient access to long, branched and complex lipopolysaccharides remains challenging.

         <title>An n&#8208;Type Polythiophene Derivative with Excellent Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring conjugated polymer is developed by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing imide or cyano groups to each thiophene unit of polythiophene backbone. The resultant polymer shows low LUMO/HOMO energy levels and highly ordered crystallite structure, leading to excellent thermoelectric performance after n&#8208;doping.







Abstract
Typical n&#8208;type conjugated polymers are based on fused&#8208;ring electron&#8208;accepting building blocks. Herein, we report a non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring strategy to design n&#8208;type conjugated polymers, i.e. introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing imide or cyano groups to each thiophene unit of a non&#8208;fused&#8208;ring polythiophene backbone. The resulting polymer, n&#8208;PT1, shows low LUMO/HOMO energy levels of &#8722;3.91&#8197;eV/&#8722;6.22&#8197;eV, high electron mobility of 0.39&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and high crystallinity in thin film. After n&#8208;doping, n&#8208;PT1 exhibits excellent thermoelectric performance with an electrical conductivity of 61.2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a power factor (PF) of 141.7&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. This PF is the highest value reported so far for n&#8208;type conjugated polymers and this is the first time for polythiophene derivatives to be used in n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics. The excellent thermoelectric performance of n&#8208;PT1 is due to its superior tolerance to doping. This work indicates that polythiophene derivatives without fused rings are low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responsive Luminescence and Domino Phase Transition of Hybrid Copper Halides with Nonlinear Optical Switching Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;stimuli responsive luminescent material has been developed that not only exhibits reversible photoluminescence conversion and nonlinear optical switching in response to thermal stimulus, but also observes peculiar crystal&#8208;phase&#8208;recognition induced domino&#8208;type single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transition and mechanical force induced phase transition under concomitant emission&#8208;color change.







Abstract
Although phase transition materials (PTMs) under external stimuli are of great research interest duo to their rich potential applications, it is still challenging to explore multi&#8208;responsive PTMs. Herein, two different phases of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid copper&#8208;based halides, &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Gua3Cu2I5 (Gua+=CN3H6+), were synthesized by solvent evaporation method, which they crystalize in the noncentrosymmetric space group Fdd2 with zero&#8208;dimensional structure and centrosymmetric space group C2/c with one&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halogen framework, respectively. Interestingly, it is firstly demonstrated that Gua3Cu2I5 simultaneously possesses reversible PL conversion and NLO switching properties in response to thermal stimulus. Strikingly, apart from heat, its structural phase transition can also be triggered by crystalline&#8208;phase&#8208;recognition (CPR) and mechanical force. These new findings may pave a path for future exploration of PTMs with multiple physical properties.

         <title>Cyclopentylmethyl Ether, a Non&#8208;Fluorinated, Weakly Solvating and Wide Temperature Solvent for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While recent work demonstrates the advantages of weakly solvating solvents in enhancing the cyclability of LMBs, both new designs and design strategies for high performance weakly solvating solvent, especially physicochemical properties, are still lacking. Here, we propose a molecular design to tune the solvating power and physicochemical properties of non&#8208;fluorinated ether solvent. The resulting cyclopentylmethyl ether (CPME) have a weak solvating power and wide liquid&#8208;phase temperature range. By optimizing the salt concentration, the CE is further promoted to 99.4%. Besides, the improved electrochemical performance of Li&#8211;S battery in CPME&#8208;based electrolytes is obtained at &#8722;20 &#176;C. The Li||LFP (17.6 mg cm&#8211;2) battery with developed electrolyte maintains &gt;90% of the original capacity over 400 cycles. Our design concept for solvent molecule provides a promising pathway to non&#8208;fluorinated electrolytes with weakly solvating power and wide temperature window for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective ring&#8208;opening reaction of cyclic diaryliodoniums, NaOCN and phenols was reported. The reaction chemoselectively afforded axially chiral carbamates by sequential coupling of cyclic diaryliodonium and NaOCN, followed by phenol. Mechanistic investigation revealed phenol is not only a reagent to trap highly active intermediate isocyanates, but activate the copper catalyst as a standby ligand.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) of clinical biomarkers is critical to health monitoring and timely treatment, yet biosensing assays capable of detecting biomarkers without the need for costly external equipment and reagents are limited. Blood&#8208;based assays are, specifically, challenging as blood collection is invasive while pre&#8208;processing is required. Here, we report a versatile assay that employs hydrogel microneedles (HMNs) to extract interstitial fluid (ISF), in a minimally invasive manner integrated with graphene oxide&#8208;nucleic acid (GO.NA)&#8208;based fluorescence biosensor to sense the biomarkers of interest in situ. The HMN&#8208;GO.NA assay is supplemented with a portable detector, enabling a complete POCT procedure. Our system could successfully measure four clinically important biomarkers (glucose, uric acid (UA), insulin, and serotonin) ex&#8208;vivo, in addition, to accurately detecting glucose and UA in&#8208;vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Utilizing Nitroarenes and HCHO to Directly Construct Functional N&#8208;Heterocycles by Supported Cobalt/Amino Acid Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the generation of multiple intermediates during the nitroarene reduction, precise interception of single one to develop tandem reactions involving both C&#8211;C and C&#8211;N bond formations still remains a significant challenge. Herein, the relay catalysis of a supported bifunctional cobalt catalyst with L&#8208;proline has been successfully applied to establish a bran&#8208;new reductive annulation reaction of nitroarenes and formaldehyde, which enables direct and diverse construction of both symmetrical and unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diaryl imidazolines. It proceeds with operational simplicity, good substrate and functionality compatibility, and excellent step and atom&#8208;efficiency. Mechanistic studies reveal that the Co&#8208;catalyst exhibits a synergistic effect on the formation of key N&#8208;hydroxy imine, and the L&#8208;proline subsequently facilitates the key C&#8211;C bond formation. The current work opens a door to develop useful transformations with nitroarenes by reduction&#8208;interrupted strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimer Acceptor Adopting a Flexible Linker for Efficient and Durable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) have advanced rapidly due to the development of new photovoltaic materials. However, the long&#8208;term stability of OSCs still poses a severe challenge for their commercial deployment. To address this issue, a dimer acceptor (dT9TBO) with flexible linker is developed for incorporation into small&#8208;molecule acceptors to form molecular alloy with enhanced intermolecular packing and suppressed molecular diffusion to stabilize active layer morphology. Consequently, the PM6:Y6:dT9TBO&#8208;based device displays an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.41% with excellent thermal stability and negligible decay after being aged at 65 &#176;C for 1800 h. Moreover, the PM6:Y6:dT9TBO&#8208;based flexible OSC also exhibits excellent mechanical durability, maintaining 95% of its initial PCE after being bended repetitively for 1500 cycles. This work provides a simple and effective way to fine&#8208;tune the molecular packing with stabilized morphology to overcome the trade&#8208;off between OSC efficiency and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>A Direct Formaldehyde Fuel Cell for CO2&#8208;Emission Free Co&#8208;generation of Electrical Energy and Valuable Chemical/Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Challenges lie in converting carbon&#8208;based molecular fuels into electricity efficiently and cleanly without emitting CO2. Conventional fuel cells that use noble metals as anode catalysts often suffer performance degradation due to CO poisoning and a host of problems associated with CO2 production. This study provides a CO2&#8208;emission&#8208;free direct formaldehyde fuel cell. It enables a flow of electricity while producing H2 and valuable formate. Unlike conventional carbon&#8208;based molecules electrooxidation, formaldehyde 1&#8208;electron oxidation is performed on the Cu anode with high selectivity, thus generating formate and H2 without undergoing CO2 pathway. In addition, the fuel cell produces 0.62 Nm3 H2 and 53 mol formate per 1 kWh of electricity generated, with an open circuit voltage of up to 1 V and a peak power density of 350 mW/cm2. This study puts forward a zero&#8208;carbon solution for the efficient utilization of carbon&#8208;based molecule fuels that generates electricity, hydrogen and valuable chemicals in synchronization.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;CPL from chiral complexes of lanthanides and d&#8208;metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared circularly polarised luminescence (NIR&#8208;CPL) has many interesting and potential applications ranging from CPL&#8208;microscopy to the telecommunication industry. In recent years, a surge of visible&#8208;emissive CPL systems has occurred, due to the increased popularity of CPL as a spectroscopic technique and greater accessibility to CPL instrumentation. Despite the increased interest, few reports on complexes which emit in the NIR are available, and mostly limited to lanthanide and Cr(III) complexes due to their large pseudo&#8208;Stokes shift and magnetic dipole (MD) allowed, electric dipole (ED) forbidden nature. In the following, we aim to give an overview of the recent technological improvements, which allow NIR&#8208;CPL to be measured, and describe the chiroptical properties of metal complexes which achieve this feat.</dc:description>

         <title>Approaching theoretical performances of electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide generation by cobalt&#8208;nitrogen moieties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been intensively studied for efficient and environmentally benign energy conversion processes. However, insufficient understanding of ORR 2e&#8208;&#8208;pathway mechanism at the atomic level inhibits rational design of electrocatalysts with both high activity and selectivity, causing concerns including catalyst degradation due to Fenton reaction or poor efficiency of H2O2 electrosynthesis. Herein we show that the generally accepted ORR electrocatalyst design based on a Sabatier volcano plot argument optimises activity but is unable to account for the 2e&#8208;&#8208;pathway selectivity; an extended &#8220;dynamic active site saturation&#8221; model that examines in addition the hydrogenation kinetics linked to the OOH* adsorption energy enables us to resolve the activity&#8208;selectivity compromise. Through electrochemical and operando spectroscopic studies on the ORR process governed by a series of Co&#8208;N x /carbon nanotube hybrids, a construction&#8208;driven approach that aims to create the maximum number of 2e&#8208; ORR sites by directing the secondary ORR electron transfer step towards the 2e&#8208; intermediate is proven to be attainable by manipulating O2 hydrogenation kinetics. Control experiments reveal the O2 hydrogenation chemistry is related to a catalyst reconstruction with lower symmetry around the Co active centre induced by the application of a cathodic potential. The optimised catalyst exhibits a ~100% H2O2 selectivity and an outstanding activity with an ORR potential of 0.82 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode to reach the ring current density of 1 mA cm&#8208;2 by using rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode measurement, which is the best&#8208;performing 2e&#8208; ORR electrocatalyst reported to date, and approaches the thermodynamic limit.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Approach for Air&#8208;Tolerant and Extremely Fast Lithium&#8208;Based Birch Reductions in Minutes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birch reduction has been widely used in organic synthesis for over half a century as a powerful method to dearomatize arenes into 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene derivatives. However, the conventional Birch reduction reaction using liquid ammonia requires laborious procedures to ensure inert conditions and low temperatures. Although several ammonia&#8208;free modifications have been reported, the development of an operationally simple, efficient, and scalable protocol remains a challenge. Herein, we report an ammonia&#8208;free lithium&#8208;based Birch reduction in air at room temperature without special operating conditions using a ball&#8208;milling technique. This method is characterized by its operational simplicity and an extremely short reaction time (within 1 min), probably owing to the in&#8208;situ mechanical activation of lithium metal,&#160;broad substrate scope, and no requirement for dry bulk solvents. The potential of our flash Birch reaction is also demonstrated by the efficient reduction of bioactive target molecules and gram&#8208;scale synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoupling Redox Hopping and Catalysis in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks &#8208;based Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional MOF e&#8208;CRR, constructed from catalytic linkers, manifest a kinetic bottleneck during their multi&#8208;electron activation. Decoupling catalysis and charge transport can address such issues. Here, we build two MOF/e&#8208;CRR systems, CoPc@NU&#8208;1000 and TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000, by installing cobalt metalated phthalocyanine and tetraphenylporphyrin electrocatalysts within the redox active NU&#8208;1000 MOF.

Efficient charge delivery, defined by a higher diffusion (Dhop =4.1&#215;10&#8208;12 cm2 s&#8254;1) and low charge&#8208;transport resistance ( = 59.5 &#937;) in CoPC@NU&#8208;1000 led FECO = 80%.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traditional MOF e-CRR, constructed from catalytic linkers, manifest a kinetic bottleneck during their multi-electron activation. Decoupling catalysis and charge transport can address such issues. Here, we build two MOF/e-CRR systems, CoPc@NU-1000 and TPP(Co)@NU-1000, by installing cobalt metalated phthalocyanine and tetraphenylporphyrin electrocatalysts within the redox active NU-1000 MOF. For CoPc@NU-1000, the e-CRR responsive CoI/0 potential is close to that of NU-1000 reduction compared to the TPP(Co)@NU-1000. Efficient charge delivery, defined by a higher diffusion (Dhop =4.1&#215;10-12 cm2 s&#8254;1) and low charge-transport resistance ( = 59.5 &#937;) in CoPC@NU-1000 led FECO = 80%. In contrast, TPP(Co)@NU-1000 fared a poor FECO = 24% (Dhop = 1.4&#215;10-12 cm2 s&#8254;1 and = 91.4 &#937;).

         <title>Heptagon&#8208;Containing Nanographene Embedded into [10]Cycloparaphenylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of a novel type of nanohoop, consisting of a cycloparaphenylene derivative incorporating a curved heptagon&#8208;containing p&#8208;extended polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon unit. We demonstrate that this new macrocycle behaves as a supramolecular receptor of curved p&#8208;systems such as fullerenes C60 and C70, with remarkably large binding constants (ca. 107 M&#8211;1), as estimated by fluorescence measurements. Nanosecond and femtosecond spectroscopic analysis show that these host&#8208;guest complexes are capable of quasi&#8208;instantaneous charge separation upon photoexcitation, due to the ultrafast charge transfer from the macrocycle to the complexed fullerene. These results demonstrate saddle&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with dibenzocycloheptatrienone motifs as structural components for new macrocycles displaying molecular receptor abilities and versatile photochemical responses with promising electron&#8208;donor properties in host&#8208;guest complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;H Functionalization and Allylic Amination for Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification of Polynorbornenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) via direct C&#8208;H functionalization is a powerful synthetic strategy to convert polymer feed&#8208;stocks into value&#8208;added products. We found that a metal&#8208;free, Se&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8208;H amination provided an efficient method for PPM of polynorbornenes (PNBs) produced via ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization. Inherent to the mechanism of the allylic amination, PPM on PNBs preserved the alkene functional groups along the polymer backbone, while also avoiding transposition of the double bonds. Amination using a series of aryl sulfonamides led to good control over the degree of functionalization, access to a range of functionalities, and tunable thermal properties from the resulting polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Singlet Oxygen Induced Site&#8208;Specific Etching Boosts Nitrogen&#8208;Carbon Sites for High&#8208;Efficiency Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted construction of carbon defects near the N dopants is an intriguing but challenging way to boost the electrocatalytic activity of N&#8208;doped carbon toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report a novel site&#8208;specific etching strategy that features targeted anchoring of singlet oxygen (1O2) on the N&#8208;adjacent atoms to directionally construct topological carbon defects neighboring the N dopants in N&#8208;doped carbon (1O2&#8208;N/C). This 1O2&#8208;N/C exhibits the highest ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.915 VRHE among all the reported metal&#8208;free carbon catalysts. Pyridinic&#8208;N bonded with a carbon pentagon of the neighboring topological carbon defects is identified as the primary active configuration, rendering enhanced adsorption of O2, optimized adsorption energy of the ORR intermediates, and a significantly decreased total energy barrier for ORR. This 1O2&#8208;induced site&#8208;specific etching strategy is also applicable to different precursors, showing a tremendous potential for targeted construction of high&#8208;efficiency active sites in carbon&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly&#8208;Efficient Ion Gating through Self&#8208;Assembled Two&#8208;Dimensional Photothermal Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological ion channels regulate the ion flow across cell membrane via opening or closing of the pores in response to various external stimuli. Replicating the function of high ion gating effects with artificial porous materials has been challenging. Herein, we report that the self&#8208;assembled two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membrane can serve as an excellent nanofluidic platform for smart regulation of ion transport. The MOF membrane with good photothermal performance exhibits extremely high ion gating ratio (up to 104), which is among the highest values in MOF membrane nanochannels for light&#8208;controlled ion gating reported so far. By repeatedly turning on and off the light, the nanofluidic device shows outstanding stability and reversibility that can be applied in the remote light&#8208;switching system. This work may spark promising applications of MOF membrane with variety of stimuli responsive properties in ion sieving, biosensing, and energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Catalytic Asymmetric and Regiodivergent N1&#8208; and C3&#8208; Allenylic Alkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allenylic alkylation strategy for the direct functionalization of 1H&#8208;indoles by employing P&#8208;chiral BIBOP&#8208;type ligands. The regioselectivity (N1/C3) of this process can be switched efficiently. Using Cs2CO3 at elevated temperatures in MeCN, N1&#8208;alkylated indoles bearing axial chirality with a stereocenter non&#8208;adjacent (&#946;) to the nitrogen are produced in good yields with high enantioselectivity and complete N1&#8208;regioselectivity regardless of the electronic properties and substitution patterns of diverse indoles. Using K2CO3 at room temperature in DCM, chiral C3&#8208;alkylated indoles can be obtained as well. Notably, we introduce a new class of tri&#8208;substituted allenylic electrophiles that proceeded through different pathways from di&#8208;substituted allenylic electrophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Nanographenes with Joined Nonhexagons via a Ring Expansion Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic methodology is considered a holy grail in both organic chemistry and materials science. Over the past few decades, researchers have explored graphene&#8208;type molecules (or nanographenes) through classic Scholl oxidative cyclodehydrogenation. Despite the successes achieved with various nanographenes, the development of new methods to synthesize these highly desired molecules lags behind. Herein, we developed a facile and effective method to produce a series of nanographenes bearing nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs in acceptable yields. Modification of the heptagonal ring endowed the resultant nanographenes with tunable physicochemical properties; for instance, M9 exhibited both aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior. Most strikingly, novel nanographenes containing N&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;octagon pairs were also obtained using the same synthetic strategy, demonstrating the superior versatility and efficiency of the proposed ring expansion method.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic polymers have recently received considerable interest, especially those whose architectures are held together via supramolecular engineering. However, current approaches toward supramolecular 2D structures usually suffer from mutual interference of noncovalent interactions and lack of intrinsic functions. Herein, we report well&#8208;regulated 2D supramolecular polymers (2DSPs) through an aromatics&#8208;selective recognition strategy of cation&#8211;&#960; and donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) motifs, which are derived from C4&#8208;symmetric cationic monomers and electron&#8208;withdrawing molecules. By subtly designing the strength and direction of noncovalent driving forces, the mutual interference between cation&#8211;&#960; and D&#8211;A interactions is effectively avoided, enabling the construction of 2DSPs in aqueous solution. On this basis, the resultant 2DSPs possess boosted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity at a rate of 600 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, which is mainly ascribed to the specific stacking mode of cation&#8211;&#960;/D&#8211;A motifs and the ordered 2D structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating Lattice Oxygen in Spinel ZnCo2O4 through Filling the Oxygen Vacancies with Fluorine for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of productive catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a major challenge that requires significant progress in both mechanism and material design. Conventionally, the thermodynamic barrier of the lattice oxidation mechanism (LOM) is lower than that of absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) because the former could bypass certain limitations. However, it remains a challenging task to control the OER pathway from the AEM to the LOM by taking advantage of the intrinsic properties of catalyst. Herein, we incorporate F anion into oxygen vacancies of spinel ZnCo2O4 and establish the link between electronic structure and the OER catalytic mechanism. Density theoretical calculation reveals that F upshifts O 2p center and activate the redox capability of the lattice O, successfully triggering the LOM pathway, achieving a low overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, the large electronegativity of F anion is favorable for the balance of residual protonation, which can stabilize the structure and locally trigger LOM without surface reconstruction during OER reaction. This finding provides a feasible strategy to concurrently enhance the activity and stability of OER, and demonstrates the significance of considering lattice oxygen participation for understanding the OER trend of highly active spinel.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Reversing the conventional site&#8208;selectivity of C&#8722;H activation provides efficient retrosynthetic disconnections to otherwise unreactive bonds. Described herein is the Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction that selectively performs meta&#8208;amination of anisidines with aliphatic&#8208;, heterocyclic&#8208; and aromatic amines in a one&#8208;pot procedure. In addition to dramatically simplifying the synthesis of meta&#8208;substituted anilines, our approach has the advantage of the scalability and remarkable functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceutical compounds and natural products. The control experiments and detailed computational analysis provide insight into the reaction mechanism and the origin of meta&#8208;selectivity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) attracts extensive attentions, but still faces the challenge of achieving both high RTP efficiencies (&#951;RTP) and long lifetimes (&#964;RTP), due to the intrinsic contradiction between triplet radiation and stabilization. In this work, we developed three carbazole&#8208;triphenylphosphine hybrids named xCzTPP, in which phosphine groups provide nonbonding electrons and steric hindrance to modulate intermolecular p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. With the rational orientations and spatial positions of functional groups, para&#8208;substituted pCzTPP achieves high &#951;RTP over 10% and more than twofold increased &#964;RTP (&gt; 600 ms), compared to ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208; isomers. Theoretical simulation and photophysical investigation indicate that the strongest intermolecular p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; electronic interplays of pCzTPP harmonize high transition probability of 3p&#960; state and triplet stability of 3&#960;&#960; state, reflecting the p&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; synergy in RTP process.</dc:description>

         <title>A Systematic Study on the Effects of Solvating Solvents and Additives in Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes over Electrochemical Performance of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of microscopic solvation structure, solvating solvent and additive of localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) over the electrolyte properties, the electrode/electrolyte interphases and the cycling stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) were systematically studied. The synergetic decomposition of anion, proper solvent and additive in LHCEs is the key to forming effective interphases and achieving long cycle life of LIBs.







Abstract
Localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) based on five different types of solvents were systematically studied and compared in lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The unique solvation structure of LHCEs promotes the participation of Li salt in forming solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite (Gr) anode, which enables solvents previously considered incompatible with Gr to achieve reversible lithiation/delithiation. However, the long cyclability of LIBs is still subject to the intrinsic properties of the solvent species in LHCEs. Such issue can be readily resolved by introducing a small amount of additive into LHCEs. The synergetic decompositions of Li salt, solvating solvent and additive yield effective SEIs and cathode electrolyte interphases (CEIs) in most of the studied LHCEs. This study reveals that both the structure and the composition of solvation sheaths in LHCEs have significant effect on SEI and CEI, and consequently, the cycle life of energetically dense LIBs.

         <title>Type &#921; Photosensitizer Targeting G&#8208;Quadruplex RNA Elicits Augmented Immunity for Cancer Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared (NIR) type&#8197;&#921; photosensitizer (PS), BAMA, was developed using an acridinium scaffold that enables efficient O2&#8901;&#8722; production upon targeting G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s). It was employed for imaging and effective photodynamic therapy (PDT) of an immunogenic cold tumor with bolstered antitumor immunity, raising the possibility of developing efficient PDT through ablation of functional RNAs for cancer therapy.







Abstract
Type&#8197;&#921; photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents a promising treatment modality for tumors with intrinsic hypoxia. However, type&#8197;&#921; photosensitizers (PSs), especially ones with near infrared (NIR) absorption, are limited and their efficacy needs improvement via new targeting tactics. We develop a NIR type&#8197;&#921; PS by engineering acridinium derived donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor systems. The PS exhibits an exclusive type&#8197;&#921; PDT mechanism due to effective intersystem crossing and disfavored energy transfer to O2, and shows selective binding to G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) via hydrogen bonds identified by a molecular docking study. Moreover, it enables fluorogenic detection of G4s and efficient O2&#8901;&#8722; production in hypoxic conditions, leading to immunogenic cell death and substantial variations of gene expression in RNA sequencing. Our strategy demonstrates augmented antitumor immunity for effective ablation of immunogenic cold tumor, highlighting its potential of RNA&#8208;targeted type&#8197;&#921; PDT in precision cancer therapy.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Preparation of Large&#8208;Area Graphdiyne&#8208;Based Membranes via Alkynylated Surface&#8208;Modification for Nanofiltration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY)&#8208;based membranes are prepared on alkynylated commercial ceramic tubes, overcoming the limitation that such layers could be synthesized only on a limited number of metal surfaces. The prepared HsGDY layers are strongly attached to the ceramic surface and exhibit excellent molecular permselectivity and ultra&#8208;high water permeance due to the unique surface properties and unusual conjugated structure.







Abstract
Graphdiynes (GDYs), two&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;like carbon systems, are considered as potential advanced membrane material due to their unique physicochemical features. Nevertheless, the scale&#8208;up of integrated GDY membranes is technologically challenging, and most studies remain at the theoretical stage. Herein, we report a simple and efficient alkynylated surface&#8208;mediated strategy to prepare hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) membranes on commercial alumina tubes. Surface alkynylation initiates an accelerated surface&#8208;confined coupling reaction in the presence of a copper catalyst and facilitates the nanoscale epitaxial lateral growth of HsGDY. A continuous and ultra&#8208;thin HsGDY membrane (&#8764;100&#8197;nm) can be produced within 15&#8197;min. The resulting membranes exhibit outstanding molecular sieving together with excellent water permeances (ca. 1100&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 MPa&#8722;1), and show a long&#8208;term durability in cross&#8208;flow nanofiltration, owing to the superhydrophilic surface and hydrophobic pore walls.

         <title>Chemoproteomic and Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals that O&#8208;GlcNAc Regulates Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell Fate through the Pluripotency Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many pluripotency transcription factors (PTFs) were found to be O&#8208;GlcNAcylated in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and the O&#8208;GlcNAcylation stoichiometry at various modification sites suppressed during differentiation. Mechanistically, O&#8208;GlcNAc acts at the PTF network level and inhibition of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation enhances the expression of neuronal lineage&#8208;specific genes, promoting mESC&#8208;derived neuronal differentiation.







Abstract
Self&#8208;renewal and differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are influenced by protein O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) modification, but the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Herein, we report the identification of 979 O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins and 1340 modification sites in mouse ESCs (mESCs) by using a chemoproteomics method. In addition to OCT4 and SOX2, the third core pluripotency transcription factor (PTF) NANOG was found to be modified and functionally regulated by O&#8208;GlcNAc. Upon differentiation along the neuronal lineage, the O&#8208;GlcNAc stoichiometry at 123 sites of 83 proteins&#8212;several of which were PTFs&#8212;was found to decline. Transcriptomic profiling reveals 2456 differentially expressed genes responsive to OGT inhibition during differentiation, of which 901 are target genes of core PTFs. By acting on the core PTF network, suppression of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation upregulates neuron&#8208;related genes, thus contributing to mESC fate determination.

         <title>Phase Instability in van der Waals In2Se3 Determined by Surface Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Description: A mixture of experimental and theoretical approaches reveals that the ambient stability of 2D In2Se3 strongly depends on the surface coordination. Tetrahedral&#8208;coordinated surfaces were found to be more stable and suitable for device applications.







Abstract
van der Waals In2Se3 has attracted significant attention for its room&#8208;temperature 2D ferroelectricity/antiferroelectricity down to monolayer thickness. However, instability and potential degradation pathway in 2D In2Se3 have not yet been adequately addressed. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we here unravel the phase instability in both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8242;&#8208;In2Se3 originating from the relatively unstable octahedral coordination. Together with the broken bonds at the edge steps, it leads to moisture&#8208;facilitated oxidation of In2Se3 in air to form amorphous In2Se3&#8722;3xO3x layers and Se hemisphere particles. Both O2 and H2O are required for such surface oxidation, which can be further promoted by light illumination. In addition, the self&#8208;passivation effect from the In2Se3&#8722;3xO3x layer can effectively limit such oxidation to only a few nanometer thickness. The achieved insight paves way for better understanding and optimizing 2D In2Se3 performance for device applications.

         <title>Direct Oxygen&#8208;Oxygen Cleavage through Optimizing Interatomic Distances in Dual Single&#8208;atom Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual single&#8208;atom carbon electrocatalysts are rationally optimized for the interatomic distance, which fulfills an effective oxygen reduction reaction via the direct oxygen&#8208;oxygen bond cleavage mechanism in acid electrolyte. The specific distance of dual&#8208;hetero single&#8208;atom pairs weakens and destabilizes the bond energy of the oxygen&#8208;oxygen bond through the strong and evenly bilateral electron and charge transfer capabilities.







Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on transition single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is sustainable in energy&#8208;conversion devices. However, the atomically controllable fabrication of single&#8208;atom sites and the sluggish kinetics of ORR have remained challenging. Here, we accelerate the kinetics of acid ORR through a direct O&#8722;O cleavage pathway through using a bi&#8208;functional ligand&#8208;assisted strategy to pre&#8208;control the distance of hetero&#8208;metal atoms. Concretely, the as&#8208;synthesized Fe&#8722;Zn diatomic pairs on carbon substrates exhibited an outstanding ORR performance with the ultrahigh half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#8197;V vs. RHE in acid electrolyte. Experimental evidence and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the Fe&#8722;Zn diatomic pairs with a specific distance range of around 3&#8197;&#197;, which is the key to their ultrahigh activity, average the interaction between hetero&#8208;diatomic active sites and oxygen molecules. This work offers new insight into atomically controllable SACs synthesis and addresses the limitations of the ORR dissociative mechanism.

         <title>Electronic Structure Manipulation of the Mott Insulator RuCl3 via Single&#8208;Crystal to Single&#8208;Crystal Topotactic Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structures of the honeycomb Mott&#8208;insulator RuCl3 are tailored by employing a facile and reversible single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal intercalation strategy. The resulting product forms a new hybrid superlattice of alternating RuCl3 monolayers, displaying distinct optical and electronic properties and dramatically boosted charge carrier transport characteristics.







Abstract
The core task for Mott insulators includes how rigid distributions of electrons evolve and how these induce exotic physical phenomena. However, it is highly challenging to chemically dope Mott insulators to tune properties. Herein, we report how to tailor electronic structures of the honeycomb Mott insulator RuCl3 employing a facile and reversible single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal intercalation process. The resulting product (NH4)0.5RuCl3&#8901;1.5&#8201;H2O forms a new hybrid superlattice of alternating RuCl3 monolayers with NH4+ and H2O molecules. Its manipulated electronic structure markedly shrinks the Mott&#8211;Hubbard gap from 1.2 to 0.7&#8197;eV. Its electrical conductivity increases by more than 103 folds. This arises from concurrently enhanced carrier concentration and mobility in contrary to the general physics rule of their inverse proportionality. We show topotactic and topochemical intercalation chemistry to control Mott insulators, escalating the prospect of discovering exotic physical phenomena.

The resulting product (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;RuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;1.5&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O forms a new hybrid superlattice of alternating RuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; monolayers with NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules. Its manipulated electronic structure markedly shrinks the Mott&#8211;Hubbard gap from 1.2 to 0.7&#8197;eV. Its electrical conductivity increases by more than 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; folds. This arises from concurrently enhanced carrier concentration and mobility in contrary to the general physics rule of their inverse proportionality. We show topotactic and topochemical intercalation chemistry to control Mott insulators, escalating the prospect of discovering exotic physical phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the Cellular Uptake and Retention of Rhodamine Dyes by Molecular Engineering for High&#8208;Contrast Imaging of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work reports a strategy involving the introduction of a polar aminoalkyl group into asymmetric rhodamine, which aids in regulating the cellular uptake, intracellular retention, and brightness of dyes to efficiently discriminate cancer cells from normal cells. The novel NYL2 dye can serve as an effective platform to engineer various activatable fluorescent probes for high&#8208;contrast imaging of cancer cells.







Abstract
Probes allowing high&#8208;contrast discrimination of cancer cells and effective retention are powerful tools for the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer. However, conventional small&#8208;molecule probes often show limited performance in both aspects. Herein, we report an ingenious molecular engineering strategy for tuning the cellular uptake and retention of rhodamine dyes. Introduction of polar aminoethyl leads to the increased brightness and reduced cellular uptake of dyes, and this change can be reversed by amino acetylation. Moreover, these modifications allow cancer cells to take up more dyes than normal cells (16&#8208;fold) through active transport. Specifically, we further improve the signal contrast (56&#8208;fold) between cancer and normal cells by constructing activatable probes and confirm that the released fluorophore can remain in cancer cells with extended time, enabling long&#8208;term and specific tumor imaging.

         <title>Decoupled Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decoupled artificial photosynthesis (DAP) strides one step closer to natural photosynthesis (NP) thanks to a photoelectrochemical energy transduction process. In this review, we elaborate how DAP evolves from NP and traditional artificial photosynthesis (AP), summarize recent advances of AP and DAP, and discuss current challenges and future developments of DAP.







Abstract
Natural photosynthesis (NP) generates oxygen and carbohydrates from water and CO2 utilizing solar energy to nourish lives and balance CO2 levels. Following nature, artificial photosynthesis (AP), typically, overall water or CO2 splitting, produces fuels and chemicals from renewable energy. However, hydrogen evolution or CO2 reduction is inherently coupled with kinetically sluggish water oxidation, lowering efficiencies and raising safety concerns. Decoupled systems have thus emerged. In this review, we elaborate how decoupled artificial photosynthesis (DAP) evolves from NP and AP and unveil their distinct photoelectrochemical mechanisms in energy capture, transduction and conversion. Advances of AP and DAP are summarized in terms of photochemical (PC), photoelectrochemical (PEC), and photovoltaic&#8208;electrochemical (PV&#8208;EC) catalysis based on material and device design. The energy transduction process of DAP is emphasized. Challenges and perspectives on future researches are also presented.

         <title>A Heptacene Analogue Entailing a Quinoidal Benzodi[7]annulene (7/6/7 Ring) Core with a Tunable Configuration and Multiple Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Varying the substituents linked to the heptagons of a heptacene analogue containing a quinoidal benzodi[7]annulene core allows modulation of the configuration of this acene. When Mes groups are attached to the heptagons, the resulting acene displays polymorphism, with a tunable configuration ranging from a curved to a wavy one. This acene can also be oxidized or reduced by NOSbF6 or KC8 to the respective radical cation or radical anion.







Abstract
Non&#8208;benzenoid acenes containing heptagons have received increasing attention. We herein report a heptacene analogue containing a quinoidal benzodi[7]annulene core. Derivatives of this new non&#8208;benzenoid acene were obtained through an efficient synthetic strategy involving an Aldol condensation and a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction as key steps. The configuration of this heptacene analogue can be modulated from a wavy to a curved one by just varying the substituents from a (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl group to a 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl (Trip) group. When mesityl (Mes) groups are linked to the heptagons, the resulting non&#8208;benzenoid acene displays polymorphism with a tunable configuration from a curved to a wavy one upon varying the crystallization conditions. In addition, this new non&#8208;benzenoid acene can be oxidized or reduced by NOSbF6 or KC8 to the respective radical cation or radical anion. Compared with the neutral acene, the radical anion shows a wavy configuration and the central hexagon becomes aromatic.

         <title>Ir Nanoparticles Anchored on Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Overall Water Splitting under pH&#8208;Universal Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient electrocatalyst was prepared by anchoring well&#8208;dispersed Ir nanoparticles on nickel metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets. The strong interaction of Ir and MOF through the formation of interfacial Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ir bonds optimized the adsorption energies of H2O, OH* and H*, thus leading to the improved performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and water electrolysis under pH&#8208;universal conditions.







Abstract
The construction of high&#8208;activity and low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts is critical for efficient hydrogen production by water electrolysis. Herein, we developed an advanced electrocatalyst by anchoring well&#8208;dispersed Ir nanoparticles on nickel metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Ni&#8208;NDC (NDC: 2,6&#8208;naphthalenedicarboxylic) nanosheets. Benefiting from the strong synergy between Ir and MOF through interfacial Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ir bonds, the synthesized Ir@Ni&#8208;NDC showed exceptional electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall water splitting in a wide pH range, superior to commercial benchmarks and most reported electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations revealed that the charge redistribution of Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ir bridge induced the optimization of H2O, OH* and H* adsorption, thus leading to the accelerated electrochemical kinetics for HER and OER. This work provides a new clue to exploit bifunctional electrocatalysts for pH&#8208;universal overall water splitting.

         <title>Haloboration of o&#8208;Alkynyl Phenols Generates Halogenated Bicyclic&#8208;Boronates
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
O&#8208;directed alkyne trans&#8208;haloboration using BX3 (X=Cl or Br) leads to C4&#8208;halogenated benzoxaborinines that are useful intermediates for accessing the core structure found in bicyclic boronate based &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitors. A computational study identified two viable mechanisms to furnish the trans&#8208;haloboration products.







Abstract
Benzoxaborinines are intermediates en&#8208;route to bicyclic boronates that are important active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Herein, the haloboration of o&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;phenols using BX3 (X=Cl or Br) is disclosed as a route to form C4&#8208;X&#8208;benzoxaborinines with good functional group tolerance. Computational studies indicated that there are two similar in barrier mechanisms: (i) double alkyne haloboration followed by retro&#8208;haloboration; (ii) concerted trans&#8208;haloboration involving an exogenous chloride source. The C4&#8208;halide in these benzoxaborinines is useful, with a one&#8208;pot haloboration&#8208;Negishi cross coupling protocol effective to form benzoxaborinines with an alkyl or an aryl at C4. Therefore this method is a useful addition to the toolbox for synthesising bicyclic&#8208;boronates that are attracting increasing attention as APIs.

         <title>Safer Polyurethane Foams with Cyclic Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent work to produce polyurethane (PU) foams without the safety concerns of current commercial PU monomers is highlighted. The new chemistry utilizes cyclic carbonates which undergo hydrolysis to produce the blowing gas for the foaming process.







Abstract
Polyurethanes (PUs) are a class of materials usually synthesized from isocyanates, diols, and water. Water is essential for producing carbon dioxide (CO2) which is used for the self&#8208;blowing of the foams. Due to safety concerns with the production of isocyanates, alternative chemistries have been evaluated and cyclic carbonate systems have shown great promise. In a recent advancement by Bourguignon, Grignard, and Detrembleur, a cyclic carbonate and diamine system is capable of generating CO2 for self&#8208;blowing through hydrolysis of the carbonate&#8208;based monomer. The authors demonstrate that with a simple variation of the diamine monomer a wide range of physical and thermo&#8208;mechanical properties were achievable. This work represents a significant step towards safer and more environmentally friendly PUs.

         <title>Lessons Learned from the Grouping of Chemicals to Assess Risks to Human Health</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grouping chemicals for risk assessment can consider the similarity of their intrinsic properties (e.g. structure), extrinsic properties, (e.g. persistence), and toxicological properties (e.g. genotoxicity). Based on the lessons learned on several substance classes, we derive principles of grouping, and differentiate between the prioritization of chemicals in groups of the same initial concern versus the definitive groups for justified read&#8208;across.







Abstract
In analogy to the periodic system that groups elements by their similarity in structure and chemical properties, the hazard of chemicals can be assessed in groups having similar structures and similar toxicological properties. Here we review case studies of chemical grouping strategies that supported the assessment of hazard, exposure, and risk to human health. By the EU&#8208;REACH and the US&#8208;TSCA New Chemicals Program, structural similarity is commonly used as the basis for grouping, but that criterion is not always adequate and sufficient. Based on the lessons learned, we derive ten principles for grouping, including: transparency of the purpose, criteria, and boundaries of the group; adequacy of methods used to justify the group; and inclusion or exclusion of substances in the group by toxicological properties. These principles apply to initial grouping to prioritize further actions as well as to definitive grouping to generate data for risk assessment. Both can expedite effective risk management.

         <title>Designing Solvated Double&#8208;Layer Polymer Electrolytes with Molecular Interactions Mediated Stable Interfaces for Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvated double&#8208;layer quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte is rationally designed for two purposes: enhance the interfacial stability and Na ion conductance. The double&#8208;layer structure is laminated by cathode&#8208; and anode&#8208;facing polymer electrolytes to meet the different interfacial requirements. Meanwhile, different functional fillers are solvated with plasticizer to improve the Na+ conductivity and thermal stability.







Abstract
Unstable cathode&#8208;electrolyte and/or anode&#8208;electrolyte interface in polymer&#8208;based sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) will deteriorate their cycle performance. Herein, a unique solvated double&#8208;layer quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (SDL&#8208;QSPE) with high Na+ ion conductivity is designed to simultaneously improve stability on both cathode and anode sides. Different functional fillers are solvated with plasticizers to improve Na+ conductivity and thermal stability. The SDL&#8208;QSPE is laminated by cathode&#8208; and anode&#8208;facing polymer electrolyte to meet the independent interfacial requirements of the two electrodes. The interfacial evolution is elucidated by theoretical calculations and 3D X&#8208;ray microtomography analysis. The Na0.67Mn2/3Ni1/3O2|SDL&#8208;QSPE|Na batteries exhibit 80.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 400&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C with the Coulombic efficiency close to 100&#8201;%, which significantly outperforms those batteries using the monolayer&#8208;structured QSPE.

         <title>Giving Gold Wings: Ultrabright and Fragmentation Free Mass Spectrometry Reporters for Barcoding, Bioconjugation Monitoring, and Data Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are highly tunable and bright mass spectrometry reporters. NHC ligands fragment less and achieve higher ion yield than conventional thiol systems, which enables bioconjugation monitoring, mass spectrometry imaging, and data storage applications.







Abstract
The widespread application of laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS) highlights the need for a bright and multiplexable labeling platform. While ligand&#8208;capped Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as a promising LDI&#8208;MS contrast agent, the predominant thiol ligands suffer from low ion yields and extensive fragmentation. In this work, we develop a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand platform that enhances AuNP LDI&#8208;MS performance. NHC scaffolds are tuned to generate barcoded AuNPs which, when benchmarked against thiol&#8208;AuNPs, are bright mass tags and form unfragmented ions in high yield. To illustrate the transformative potential of NHC ligands, the mass tags were employed in three orthogonal applications: monitoring a bioconjugation reaction, performing multiplexed imaging, and storing and reading encoded information. These results demonstrate that NHC&#8208;nanoparticle systems are an ideal platform for LDI&#8208;MS and greatly broaden the scope of nanoparticle contrast agents.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of the Orthorhombic Sn3O4 Polymorph</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unreported orthorhombic Sn3O4 polymorph was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method and characterized carefully by empirical and calculational methods.







Abstract
An unexplored tin oxide crystal phase (Sn3O4) was experimentally synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. After tuning the often&#8208;neglected parameters for the hydrothermal synthesis, namely the degree of filling of the precursor solution and the gas composition in the reactor head space, an unreported X&#8208;ray diffraction pattern was discovered. Through various characterization studies, such as Rietveld analysis, energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations, this novel material was characterized as orthorhombic mixed&#8208;valence tin oxide with the composition SnII2SnIVO4. This orthorhombic tin oxide is a new polymorph of Sn3O4, which differs from the reported conventional monoclinic structure. Computational and experimental analyses showed that orthorhombic Sn3O4 has a smaller band gap (2.0&#8197;eV), enabling greater absorption of visible light. This study is expected to improve the accuracy of hydrothermal synthesis and aid the discovery of new oxide materials.

         <title>Structure Regulation of MOF Nanosheet Membrane for Accurate H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular scale chemical decoration on MOF molecular sieve nanosheets was developed. CO2 impurities physisorbed on the artificially introduced low dose amino side groups served as interlayer &#8220;bridges&#8221;, elegantly regulated interlayer spacing and retarded CO2 subsequent transports, bringing an unrivalled H2/CO2 separation accuracy which favored a high&#8208;purity H2 production. It enlightens multiple mechanism operation in future separation process.







Abstract
High&#8208;purity H2 production accompanied with a precise decarbonization opens an avenue to approach a carbon&#8208;neutral society. Metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheet membranes provide great opportunities for an accurate and fast H2/CO2 separation, CO2 leakage through the membrane interlayer galleries decided the ultimate separation accuracy. Here we introduce low dose amino side groups into the Zn2(benzimidazolate)4 conformation. Physisorbed CO2 served as interlayer linkers, gently regulated and stabilized the interlayer spacing. These evoked a synergistic effect of CO2 adsorption&#8208;assisted molecular sieving and steric hinderance, whilst exquisitely preserving apertures for high&#8208;speed H2 transport. The optimized amino membranes set a new record for ultrathin nanosheet membranes in H2/CO2 separation (mixture separation factor: 1158, H2 permeance: 1417 gas permeation unit). This strategy provides an effective way to customize ultrathin nanosheet membranes with desirable molecular sieving ability.

&lt;p&gt;Molecular scale chemical decoration on MOF molecular sieve nanosheets was developed. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; impurities physisorbed on the artificially introduced low dose amino side groups served as interlayer &#8220;bridges&#8221;, elegantly regulated interlayer spacing and retarded CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; subsequent transports, bringing an unrivalled H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation accuracy which favored a high-purity H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. It enlightens multiple mechanism operation in future separation process.

         <title>Preferential Pyrolysis Construction of Carbon Anodes with 8400&#8197;h Lifespan for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density K&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A durable carbon anode has been constructed for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density K&#8208;ion batteries by a preferential pyrolysis strategy, in which the low&#8208;potential active sites of sp2 hybridized C and vacancies were generated utilizing S and N volatilization from a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked supermolecule.







Abstract
Carbonaceous materials are promising anodes for practical potassium&#8208;ion batteries, but fail to meet the requirements for durability and high capacities at low potentials. Herein, we constructed a durable carbon anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density K&#8208;ion full cells by a preferential pyrolysis strategy. Utilizing S and N volatilization from a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked supermolecule, the preferential pyrolysis process introduces low&#8208;potential active sites of sp2 hybridized carbon and carbon vacancies, endowing a low&#8208;potential &#8220;vacancy&#8208;adsorption/intercalation&#8221; mechanism. The as&#8208;prepared carbon anode exhibits a high capacity of 384.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (90&#8201;% capacity locates below 1&#8197;V vs. K/K+), which contributes to a high energy density of 163&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 of K&#8208;ion full battery. Moreover, abundant vacancies of carbon alleviate volume variation, boosting the cycling stability over 14&#8201;000&#8197;cycles (8400&#8197;h). Our work provides a new synthesis approach for durable carbon anodes of K&#8208;ion full cells with high energy densities.

         <title>Synthesis of Erythrocyte Nanodiscs for Bacterial Toxin Neutralization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanodiscs are small discoidal lipid bilayer assemblies and represent an attractive nanomedicine platform. While most nanodiscs are made with synthetic lipid bilayers, this work reports on a nanodisc formulation made with natural human red blood cell membrane and demonstrates their robust application for bacterial toxin neutralization.







Abstract
Nanodiscs are a compelling nanomedicine platform due to their ultrasmall size and distinct disc shape. Current nanodisc formulations are made primarily with synthetic lipid bilayers and proteins. Here, we report a cellular nanodisc made with human red blood cell (RBC) membrane (denoted &#8220;RBC&#8208;ND&#8221;) and show its effective neutralization against bacterial toxins. In vitro, RBC&#8208;ND neutralizes the hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity caused by purified &#945;&#8208;toxin or complex whole secreted proteins (wSP) from methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. In vivo, RBC&#8208;ND confers significant survival benefits for mice intoxicated with &#945;&#8208;toxin or wSP in both therapeutic and prevention regimens. Moreover, RBC&#8208;ND shows good biocompatibility and biosafety in vivo. Overall, RBC&#8208;ND distinguishes itself by inheriting the biological functions of the source cell membrane for bioactivity. The design strategy of RBC&#8208;ND can be generalized to other types of cell membranes for broad applications.

         <title>Using Biological Photophysics to Map the Excited&#8208;State Topology of Molecular Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodology to investigate the excited&#8208;state dynamics of phototoxic compounds in&#8197;cellulo using transient absorption spectroscopy is established and exemplified by two RuII photosensitizers (PSs) showing relevancy in photodynamic therapy. The kinetic signatures recorded for the PSs in&#8197;cellulo are distinct from those in water, indicating a complex interplay of either PS&#8208;biomolecular interaction or interaction between PSs or both.







Abstract
This study employs TLD1433, a RuII&#8208;based photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent in human clinical trials, as a benchmark to establish protocols for studying the excited&#8208;state dynamics of photosensitizers (PSs) in cellulo, in the local environment provided by human cancer cells. Very little is known about the excited&#8208;state properties of any PS in live cells, and for TLD1433, it is terra incognita. This contribution targets a general problem in phototherapy, which is how to interrogate the light&#8208;triggered, function&#8208;determining processes of the PSs in the relevant biological environment, and establishes methodological advances to study the ultrafast photoinduced processes for TLD1433 when taken up by MCF7 cells. We generalize the methodological developments and results in terms of molecular physics by applying them to TLD1433&#8217;s analogue TLD1633, making this study a benchmark to investigate the excited&#8208;state dynamics of phototoxic compounds in the complex biological environment.

         <title>A Universal Formation Mechanism of Hollow Multi&#8208;Shelled Structures Dominated by Concentration Waves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMS), a new family of hierarchical nano/micro&#8208;structured materials, have evoked intensive studies to discover their unique temporal&#8208;spatial ordering features. The theoretical understanding of the general synthetic methods of HoMS, i. e. the sequential templating approach (STA), makes it possible to understand, predict, and control the shell formation process. Herein, a mathematical model is established based on the experiment results, which reveal the appearance of concentration waves in the STA. The numerical simulation results not only correspond well to the experimental observations but also explain the regulation methods. Whereby, the underlying physical essence of STA is elucidated, suggesting that HoMS is the concrete representation of the concentration waves. Thereafter the formation of HoMS is not limited to the solid&#8208;state reactions through high&#8208;temperature calcination, but could be extended to synthetic systems under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Janus Separator based on Cation Exchange Resin and Fe Nanoparticles&#8208;decorated Single&#8208;wall Carbon Nanotubes with Triply Synergistic Effects for High&#8208;areal Capacity Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn&#8208;I2 batteries stand out in the family of aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) due to their low&#8208;cost and immanent safety. However, Zn dendrite growth, polyiodide shuttle effect and sluggish I2 redox kinetics result in dramatically capacity decay of Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. Herein, a Janus separator composed of functional layers on anode/cathode sides is designed to resolve these issues simultaneously. The cathode layer of Fe nanoparticles&#8208;decorated single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes can effectively anchor polyiodide and catalyze the redox kinetics of iodine species, while the anode layer of cation exchange resin rich in &#8208;SO3&#8208; groups is beneficial to attract Zn2+ ions and repel detrimental SO42&#8208;/polyiodide, improving the stability of cathode/anode interfaces synergistically. Consequently, the Janus separator endows outstanding cycling stability of symmetrical cells and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn&#8208;I2 batteries with a lifespan over 2500 h and a high&#8208;areal capacity of 3.6 mAh cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zn-I2 batteries stand out in the family of aqueous Zn-metal batteries (AZMBs) due to their low-cost and immanent safety. However, Zn dendrite growth, polyiodide shuttle effect and sluggish I2 redox kinetics result in dramatically capacity decay of Zn-I2 batteries. Herein, a Janus separator composed of functional layers on anode/cathode sides is designed to resolve these issues simultaneously. The cathode layer of Fe nanoparticles-decorated single-wall carbon nanotubes can effectively anchor polyiodide and catalyze the redox kinetics of iodine species, while the anode layer of cation exchange resin rich in -SO3- groups is beneficial to attract Zn2+ ions and repel detrimental SO42-/polyiodide, improving the stability of cathode/anode interfaces synergistically. Consequently, the Janus separator endows outstanding cycling stability of symmetrical cells and high-areal-capacity Zn-I2 batteries with a lifespan over 2500 h and a high-areal capacity of 3.6 mAh cm-2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;driven Orderly Assembly of Ir&#8208;atomic Chains to Integrate a Dynamic Reaction Pathway for Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work suggests an intriguing light&#8208;driven atomic assembly proposal to orderly configure the distribution of reactive sites to optimize the spin&#8208;entropy&#8208;related orbital interaction and charge transfer from electrocatalysts to intermediates. Herein, the introduced fluorine (F) atoms acting as photo&#8208;corrosion centers in MnO1.9F0.1 effectively soften the bonding interaction of Mn&#8208;O bonds in IrCl3 solution. Therefore, partial Mn atoms can be successively replaced to form orderly atomic&#8208;hybridized catalysts with a spin&#8208;related low entropy due to the coexistence of Ir&#8208;atomic chains and clusters. Time&#8208;related elemental analysis demonstrates that the dynamic dissolution/redeposition of Ir clusters in acidic oxygen evolution leads to a reintegration of the reaction pathway to seek the switchable rate&#8208;limiting step with a lower activation energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of N&#8208;N Atropisomers by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Functionalization of Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic asymmetric construction of N&#8208;N atropisomeric biaryls remains a formidable challenge. Studies of them lag far behind studies of the more classical carbon&#8208;carbon biaryl atropisomers, hampering meaningful development. Herein, the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation of pyrroles for the synthesis of N&#8208;N atropisomers is presented. Structurally diverse indole&#8208;pyrrole atropisomers possessing a chiral N&#8208;N axis were produced with good yields and high enantioselectivities by alkenylation, alkynylation, allylation, or arylation reactions. Furthermore, the kinetic resolution of trisubstituted N&#8208;N heterobiaryls with more sterically demanding substituents was also achieved. Importantly, this versatile C&#8208;H functionalization strategy enables iterative functionalization of pyrroles with exquisite selectivity, expediting the formation of valuable, complex, N&#8208;N atropisomers.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Diversification of Complex Bioactive Molecules by Accelerated Synthesis in Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Late&#8208;stage diversification of drug molecules is an important strategy in drug discovery that can be facilitated by reaction screening using high&#8208;throughput experimentation. Here we present a rapid method for functionalizing bioactive molecules based on accelerated reactions in microdroplets. Reaction mixtures are nebulized at throughputs better than 1 reaction/second and the accelerated reactions occurring in the microdroplets are followed by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI&#8208;MS). Because the accelerated reactions occur on the millisecond timescale, they allow an overall screening throughput of 1 Hz working at the low nanogram scale. Using this approach, an opioid agonist (PZM21) and an antagonist (naloxone) were diversified using three reactions important in medicinal chemistry: sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click reactions, imine formation reactions, and ene&#8208;type click reactions. Some 269 functionalized analogs of naloxone and PZM21 were generated and characterized by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) after screening over 500 reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinyl Halide&#8208;Modified Unsaturated Cyclitols are Mechanism&#8208;Based Glycosidase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Suitably configured allyl ethers of unsaturated cyclitols act as substrates of &#946;&#8208;glycosidases, reacting via allylic cation transition states. Incorporation of halogens at the vinylic position of these carbasugars, along with an activated leaving group, generates potent inactivators of &#946;&#8208;glycosidases. Enzymatic turnover of these halogenated cyclitols (F, Cl, Br) displayed a counter&#8208;intuitive trend wherein the most electronegative substituents yielded the most labile pseudo&#8208;glycosidic linkages. Structures of complexes with the Sulfolobus &#946;&#8208;glucosidase revealed similar enzyme&#8208;ligand interactions to those seen in complexes with a 2&#8208;fluorosugar inhibitor, the lone exception being displacement of tyrosine 322 from the active site by the halogen. Mutation of Y322 to Y322F largely abolished glycosidase activity, consistent with lost interactions at O5, but minimally affected (7&#8208;fold) rates of carbasugar hydrolysis, yielding a more selective enzyme for unsaturated cyclitol ether hydrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Microporous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Unique Aromatic Pore Surfaces for High Performance C2H6/C2H4 Separation</title>

         <dc:description>Developing&#160;adsorptive separation processes&#160;based on&#160;C2H6&#8208;selective sorbents to replace&#160;energy&#8208;intensive&#160;cryogenic distillation is a promising alternative for C2H4&#160;purification from&#160;C2H4/C2H6&#160;mixtures, which however remains challenging. During our studies on two isostructural&#160;metal&#8208;organic frameworks&#160;(Ni&#8208;MOF 1&#160;and&#160;Ni&#8208;MOF 2), we found that&#160;Ni&#8208;MOF 2&#160;exhibited significantly higher performance for C2H6/C2H4&#160;separation than&#160;Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1, as clearly established by gas sorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments. Density&#8208;Functional Theory (DFT) studies showed that the unblocked unique aromatic pore surfaces within&#160;Ni&#8208;MOF 2&#160;induce more and stronger&#160;C&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;&#160;with C2H6&#160;over C2H4&#160;while the suitable pore spaces enforce its high C2H6&#160;uptake capacity, featuring&#160;Ni&#8208;MOF 2&#160;as one of the best porous materials for this very important gas separation.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Supramolecular Polymerization of DNA Amphiphiles is Driven by Sequence&#8208;Dependent DNA&#8208;Chromophore Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) assemblies of water&#8208;soluble block copolymers have been limited by a dearth of systematic studies that relate polymer structure to pathway mechanism and supramolecular morphology. Here, we employ sequence&#8208;defined triblock DNA amphiphiles for the supramolecular polymerization of free&#8208;standing DNA nanosheets in water. Our systematic modulation of amphiphile sequence shows the alkyl chain core forming a cell membrane&#8208;like structure and the distal &#960;&#8208;stacking chromophore block folding back to interact with the hydrophilic DNA block on the nanosheet surface. This interaction is crucial to sheet formation, marked by a chiral &#8216;signature&#8217;, and sensitive to DNA sequence, where nanosheets form with a mixed sequence, but not with a homogenous poly(thymine) sequence. This work opens the possibility of forming well&#8208;ordered, bilayer&#8208;like assemblies using a single DNA amphiphile for applications in cell sensing, nucleic acid therapeutic delivery and enzyme arrays.</dc:description>

         <title>Decoding the Fucose Migration Product during Mass&#8208;Spectrometric Analysis of Blood Group Epitopes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fucose is a signaling carbohydrate that is attached at the end of glycan processing. It is involved in a range of processes, such as the selectin&#8208;dependent leukocyte adhesion or pathogen&#8208;receptor interactions. Mass&#8208;spectrometric techniques, which are commonly used to determine the structure of glycans, frequently show fucose&#8208;containing chimeric fragments that obfuscate the analysis. The rearrangement leading to these fragments &#8211; often referred to as fucose migration &#8211; has been known for more than 25 years, but the chemical identity of the rearrangement product remains unclear. In this work, we combine ion&#8208;mobility spectrometry, radical&#8208;directed dissociation mass spectrometry, cryogenic&#8208;ion IR spectroscopy, and density&#8208;functional theory calculations to deduce the product of the rearrangement in the model trisaccharides Lewis x and blood group H2. The structural search yields the fucose moiety attached to the galactose with an &#945;(1 &#8594; 6) glycosidic bond as the most likely product.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Induced Planar Chirality of Soft&#8208;Bridged Binuclear Platinum(II) Complexes: 100% Phosphorescence Quantum Yields, Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting, and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pt(II) complexes have attracted a great deal of interest due to their rich phosphorescent properties. However, these square&#8208;planar Pt(II) complexes are far more likely to encounter the problems of lack of metal&#8208;induced chirality and emission &#8220;aggregation&#8208;caused quenching&#8221;. Herein, soft&#8208;bridged binuclear Pt(II) complexes bearing metal&#8208;induced planar chirality were synthesized and characterized. These soft bridging ligands with smaller conjugated system would help to not only improve solubility for synthesis and enantioseparation but also introduce point chirality from amino acid for highly efficient diastereoselectivity. Furthermore, the intramolecular Pt&#8211;Pt distances could be well regulated by soft bridging ligands, and consequently the phosphorescence quantum yield up to 100% could be achieved by shortening intramolecular Pt&#8211;Pt distance for first time. These complexes can be used as emitters in highly efficient solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Fluorescence Switching in Molecular Aggregates via Topological [2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical modulation of fluorescence characteristics in molecular aggregates, which mainly involves diverse molecular stacking and the consequent intermolecular interactions, remains a significant challenge for the potential applications in optical anticounterfeiting, data storage and imaging. Here we successfully realize in situ fluorescence switching in molecular aggregates of thianaphthene&#8208;dioxide derivatives via topological [2+2] photocycloaddition, which represents a promising way to regulate the molecular stacking and alter photophysical processes. Notably, the 2&#8208;(3,5&#8208;Bis&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;phenyl)benzo[b]thiophene&#8208;dioxide (BTO&#8208;TF) in both crystal and powder forms exhibits a unique switching from an initial non&#8208;fluorescent state to a highly fluorescent state (&#934;PL = 0.46) upon UV irradiation, because the destruction of [2+2] cycloaddition process by the volume expansion of the dimer. Furthermore, we demonstrate such [2+2] photocycloaddition can occur when 2&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxypheny)ben&#8208;zo[b]thiophene&#8208;dioxide (BTO&#8208;OH) are doped within the selective polymer matrixes, which can be utilized for the visualization of macrophase separation in polymer blends.</dc:description>

         <title>Hemin as a General Static Dark Quencher for Constructing Heme Oxygenase&#8208;1 Fluorescent Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of small&#8208;molecule probes suitable for live&#8208;cell applications remains challenging yet highly desirable. We report the first fluorescent probe, RBH, for imaging the heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1) activity in live cells after discovering hemin as a universal dark quencher. Hemin works via a static quenching mechanism and shows high quenching efficiency (&gt;97%) with fluorophores across a broad spectrum (&#955;ex=400&#8208;700 nm). The favorable properties of RBH (e.g. long excitation/emission wavelengths, fast response rate and high magnitude of signal increase) enable its use for determining HO&#8208;1 activity in complex biological samples. As HO&#8208;1 is involved in regulating antioxidant defence, iron homeostasis and gasotransmitter carbon monoxide production, we expect RBH to be a powerful tool for dissecting its functions. Also, the discovery of hemin as a general static dark quencher provides a straightforward strategy for constructing novel fluorescent probes for diverse biological species.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Isomerization Before Isomerization&#8208;Hydroformylation: Probing the Neglected Period with A Novel Microfluidic Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By combining the concept of flash chemistry and radial synthesis, a novel microreactor (Flashstop reactor) was designed to study isomerization process of hydroformylation by a Rh/tetraphosphite catalyst in a time scale of seconds. It was found that in the initial 313 seconds, 60~99% of 1&#8208;octene was isomerized to 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;octenes before the formation of aldehydes. Within this period, two different types of isomerization reactions were observed. It was proposed that a monohydride complex without CO ligand accounts for the ultrafast isomerization in the initial 30 seconds. The isomerization rate with such monohydride species was calculated much faster than that with the well&#8208;known H(CO)Rh(P&#8208;P) species. Both experimental and DFT computational studies were carried out to support this assumption. Fast transformations early on in catalytic cycles have been rarely studied due to the lack of proper tools. We believe that the Flashstop reactor is a powerful tool for analysis of kinetics in gas&#8208;liquid biphasic reactions within a time scale of seconds to minutes</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metalla&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H oxygenation represents one of the most straightforward and sustainable approaches to access valuable oxygenated molecules. Despite the significant advances, the development of enantioselective electrochemical C&#8722;H oxygenation reaction is very challenging and remains elusive. Herein, we described the first electrochemical Co(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H alkoxylation. A broad range of enantioenriched alkoxylated phosphinamides were obtained in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to&#160;98% yield and &gt;99% ee). An unusual cobalt(III) alcohol complex was prepared and fully characterized, which was proved to be a key intermediate of this C&#8208;H alkoxylation reaction. Mechanistic studies revealed that the oxidation of Co(III) to Co(IV) was facilitated by a base and the whole process proceeded through a cobalt(III/IV/II) catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Interaction between Divalent Copper Fluoride and Carboxamide Group Enabling Stereoretentive Fluorination of Tertiary Alkyl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report Cu&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific fluorination involving CsF and &#945;&#8208;bromocarboxamides as tertiary alkyl sources that, unlike traditional stereospecific routes involving stereoinversive SN2 reactions, proceeds with retention of stereochemistry. The developed stereospecific Cu&#8208;catalyzed reaction is among the most efficient methods for synthesizing fluorinated molecules that possess highly congested stereogenic carbon centers.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report Cu-catalyzed stereospecific fluorination involving CsF and &#945;-bromocarboxamides as tertiary alkyl sources that, unlike traditional stereospecific routes involving stereoinversive SN2 reactions, proceeds with retention of stereochemistry. The developed stereospecific Cu-catalyzed reaction is among the most efficient methods for synthesizing fluorinated molecules that possess highly congested stereogenic carbon centers.

         <title>Complete Depolymerization of PET Wastes by an Evolved PET Hydrolase from Directed Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iterative rounds of directed evolution of PETase were performed employing a novel high&#8208;throughput fluorescence screening assay with a newly designed substrate BHET&#8208;OH. The generated DepoPETase enabled complete depolymerization of untreated PET wastes at mild temperature. The identified substitutions stabilized the loops around the active sites and transmitted the stabilization effect to the active sites through enhancing inter&#8208;loop interactions network.







Abstract
PETase displays great potential in PET depolymerization. Directed evolution has been limited to engineer PETase due to the lack of high&#8208;throughput screening assay. In this study, a novel fluorescence&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screening assay employing a newly designed substrate, bis (2&#8208;hydroxyethyl) 2&#8208;hydroxyterephthalate (termed BHET&#8208;OH), was developed for PET hydrolases. The best variant DepoPETase produced 1407&#8208;fold more products towards amorphous PET film at 50&#8201;&#176;C and showed a 23.3&#8201;&#176;C higher Tm value than the PETase WT. DepoPETase enabled complete depolymerization of seven untreated PET wastes and 19.1&#8197;g PET waste (0.4&#8201;% Wenzyme/WPET) in liter&#8208;scale reactor, suggesting that it is a potential candidate for industrial PET depolymerization processes. The molecular dynamic simulations revealed that the distal substitutions stabilized the loops around the active sites and transmitted the stabilization effect to the active sites through enhancing inter&#8208;loop interactions network.

         <title>Stable Crystalline Nanohoop Radical and Its Self&#8208;Association Promoted by van der Waals Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable nanohoop radical combining an olympicenyl radical and cycloparaphenylene structures has been synthesized. Unlike other olympicenyl radicals that favor &#960;&#8208;dimerization, this nanohoop radical dimerizes and aggregates by virtue of van der Waals interaction in the solid state.







Abstract
A stable nanohoop radical (OR3) combining the structures of cycloparaphenylene and an olympicenyl radical is synthesized and isolated in the crystalline state. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals that OR3 forms a unique head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimer that further aggregates into a one&#8208;dimensional chain in the solid state. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR and concentration&#8208;dependent absorption measurements indicate that the &#960;&#8208;dimer is not formed in solution. An energy decomposition analysis indicates that van der Waals interactions are the driving force for the self&#8208;association process, in contrast with other olympicenyl derivatives that favor &#960;&#8208;dimerization. The physical properties in solution phase have been studied, and the stable cationic species obtained by one&#8208;electron chemical oxidation. This study offers a new molecular design to modulate the self&#8208;association of organic radicals for overcoming the spin&#8208;Peierls transition, and to prepare novel nanohoop compounds with spin&#8208;related properties.

         <title>Reversible Single Electron Redox Steps Convert Polycycles with a C3P3 Core to a Planar Triphosphinine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of the biradicaloid IDP with trityl phosphaalkyne affords polycyclic compounds with a formally dianionic C3P3 core, which are in a dynamic equilibrium. The reversible, stepwise oxidation by two electrons leads to a planar triphosphinine with an aromatic 6&#960;&#8208;electron system. A monocyclic 7&#960;&#8208;electron radical cation could be isolated as intermediate.







Abstract
Reaction of the imidazolium&#8208;stabilized diphosphete&#8208;diide IDP with trityl phosphaalkyne affords a mixture which contains the molecules 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b with a central C3P3 core, which formally carries a two&#8208;fold negative charge. In order to avoid the formation of an antiaromatic 8&#960; electron system within a conjugated dianionic six&#8208;membered [C3P3]2&#8722; ring, 1&#8201;a adopts a bicyclic [3.1.0] and 1&#8201;b a tricyclic [2.2.0.0] structure which are in a dynamic equilibrium. 1&#8201;a,&#8201;b can be reversibly oxidized to a triphosphinine dication [5]2+ with a central flat aromatic six&#8208;membered C3P3 ring. This two&#8208;electron redox reaction occurs in two single&#8208;electron transfer steps via the 7&#960;&#8208;radical cation [4]&#8901;+, which could also be isolated and fully characterized. The profound reversible structural change observed for the two&#8208;electron redox couple [5]2+/1&#8201;a,&#8201;b is in sharp contrast to the C6H6/[C6H6]2&#8722; couple, which undergoes only a modest structural deformation.

         <title>Supramolecular Capsule Catalysis Enables the Exploration of Terpenoid Chemical Space Untapped by Nature</title>

         <dc:description>
The chemical space of terpene natural products can be increased dramatically by expanding the highly conserved substrate scope. Such an expansion based on C3&#8208;phenyl, benzyl, and homoprenyl derivatives of farnesol provided access to novel skeletons related to the presilphiperfolane core structure, as well as novel neoclovene derivatives.







Abstract
Terpenes represent the largest and the most diverse class of natural compounds. This is remarkable as the whole variety is accessed from just a handful of highly conserved linear precursors. Modification of the cyclization precursors would enable a dramatic expansion of the accessible chemical space. However, natural enzymes do not enable us to tap into this potential, as they do not tolerate larger deviations from the prototypical substrate structure. Herein we report that supramolecular capsule catalysis enables facile access to diverse and novel terpenoid skeletons that formally can be traced back to C3&#8208;phenyl, benzyl, and homoprenyl derivatives of farnesol. Novel skeletons related to the presilphiperfolane core structure, as well as novel neoclovene derivatives were accessed efficiently in only four synthetic steps. Importantly, the products obtained carry functional groups that may be readily derivatized further.

The efficient conversion of &#8220;non&#8208;polymerizable&#8221; &#947;&#8208;valerolactone and its derivatives is presented. The abundant but unexploited renewable feedstocks give new sustainable polythioesters with tunable materials properties through the establishment of the first isomerization&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerizations of corresponding thionolactone intermediates via the development of a new simple and robust [Et3O]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; cationic initiator.







Abstract
This contribution reports the efficient conversion of &#947;&#8208;valerolactone and its derivatives, abundant but unexplored renewable feedstocks, into sustainable and degradable polythioesters via the establishment of the first isomerization&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerizations (IROPs) of corresponding thionolactone intermediates. The key to this success relies on the development of a new simple and robust [Et3O]+[B(C6F5)4]&#8722; cationic initiator which possesses high activity, exclusive selectivity, living nature, and broad scope of thionolactones. A complete inversion of configuration during IROP of enantiopure &#947;&#8208;thionovalerolactone is also disclosed, affording isotactic semicrystalline polythioesters (Tm=87.0&#8201;&#176;C) with mechanical property compared well to the representative commodity polyolefins. The formation of a highly crystalline supramolecular stereocomplex with enhanced thermal property (Tm=117.6&#8201;&#176;C) has also been revealed.

         <title>A Covalent Organic Framework as a Long&#8208;life and High&#8208;Rate Anode Suitable for Both Aqueous Acidic and Alkaline Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared a covalent organic framework containing pyrazine (C=N) and phenylimino (&#8722;NH&#8722;) groups (HPP&#8208;COF) as an anode. The robust covalent linkage and the hydrogen bond network between &#8722;NH&#8722; and H2O collectively improve the acid&#8208;alkaline co&#8208;tolerance and promote the rapid conduction of H+/OH&#8722; by the Grotthuss mechanism. Thus the HPP&#8208;COF exhibits superior cycle stability and rate performance in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes.







Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable batteries are prospective candidates for large&#8208;scale grid energy storage. However, traditional anode materials applied lack acid&#8208;alkali co&#8208;tolerance. Herein, we report a covalent organic framework containing pyrazine (C=N) and phenylimino (&#8722;NH&#8722;) groups (HPP&#8208;COF) as a long&#8208;cycle and high&#8208;rate anode for both acidic and alkaline batteries. The HPP&#8208;COF&#8242;s robust covalent linkage and the hydrogen bond network between &#8722;NH&#8722; and water molecules collectively improve the acid&#8208;alkaline co&#8208;tolerance. More importantly, the hydrogen bond network promotes the rapid transport of H+/OH&#8722; by the Grotthuss mechanism. As a result, the HPP&#8208;COF delivers a superior capacity and cycle stability (66.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1@ 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, over 40000 cycles in 1&#8197;M H2SO4 electrolyte; 91.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1@ 100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, over 30000 cycles @ 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M NaOH electrolyte). The work opens a new direction for the structural design and application of COF materials in acidic and alkaline batteries.

         <title>Electrophilically Trapping Water for Preventing Polymerization of Cyclic Ether Towards Low&#8208;Temperature Li Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ring&#8208;opening polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) initiated by protons is inhibited by eliminating the trace water in the electrolyte through a water scavenger, which ensures promising low&#8208;temperature performances for LiCoO2 cathode. These findings demonstrate the high feasibility of water scavenger for unexplored design of cyclic ether based low&#8208;temperature electrolytes.







Abstract
Cyclic ether, such as 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL), are promising solvent for low&#8208;temperature electrolytes because of the low freezing point. Their use in electrolytes, however, is severely limited since it easily polymerizes in the presence of lithium inorganic salts. The trace water plays a key role via providing the source (proton) for chain initiation, which has, unfortunately, been neglected in most cases. In this work, we present an electrophile, trimethylsilyl isocyanate (Si&#8722;NCO), as the water scavenger, which eliminates moisture by a nucleophilic addition reaction. Si&#8722;NCO allows DOL to maintain liquid over a wide temperature range even in high&#8208;concentration electrolyte. Electrolyte with Si&#8722;NCO additive shows promising low&#8208;temperature performance. Our finding expands the use of cyclic ether solvents in the presence of inorganic salts and highlights a large space for unexplored design of water scavenger with electrophilic feature for low&#8208;temperature electrolytes.

         <title>Solvent Induced Conversion of a Self&#8208;Assembled Gyrobifastigium to a Barrel and Encapsulation of Zinc&#8208;Phthalocyanine within the Barrel for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare gyrobifastigium structure was constructed and converted to its isomeric Pd8 tetragonal barrel by simple treatment with water. The water&#8208;soluble barrel was used as a host to encapsulate hydrophobic photosensitizer zinc&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc) for enhanced PDT activity in the aqueous medium under red light irradiation.







Abstract
A rare gyrobifastigium architecture (GB) was constructed by self&#8208;assembly of a tetradentate donor (L) with PdII acceptor in DMSO. The GB was converted to its isomeric tetragonal barrel (MB) upon treatment with water. The hydrophobic cavity of MB has been explored for the encapsulation of zinc&#8208;phthalocyanine (ZnPc), which is an excellent photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, the poor water&#8208;solubility and aggregation tendency are the main reasons for the suboptimal PDT performance of free ZnPc in the aqueous medium. Effective solubilization of ZnPc in an aqueous medium was achieved by encapsulating it in the cavity of MB. The inclusion complex (ZnPc&#8834;MB) showed enhanced singlet oxygen generation in water. Higher cellular uptake and anticancer activity of the ZnPc&#8834;MB compared to free ZnPc on HeLa cells indicate that encapsulation of ZnPc in an aqueous host is a potential strategy for enhancement of its PDT activity in water.

         <title>An Isotope&#8208;Labeled Single&#8208;Cell Raman Spectroscopy Approach for Tracking the Physiological Evolution Trajectory of Bacteria toward Antibiotic Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;cell approach integrating D2O&#8208;labeled Raman spectroscopy, advanced multivariate analysis and genotypic profiling was developed to in situ track the highly heterogeneous and dynamic physiological evolution trajectory of bacteria toward antibiotic resistance. The physiological diversification of single cells into four subpopulations preceding resistance from an isogeneic population was sensitively captured and their dynamic shift was tracked.







Abstract
Understanding evolution of antibiotic resistance is vital for containing its global spread. Yet our ability to in situ track highly heterogeneous and dynamic evolution is very limited. Here, we present a new single&#8208;cell approach integrating D2O&#8208;labeled Raman spectroscopy, advanced multivariate analysis, and genotypic profiling to in situ track physiological evolution trajectory toward resistance. Physiological diversification of individual cells from isogenic population with cyclic ampicillin treatment is captured. Advanced multivariate analysis of spectral changes classifies all individual cells into four subsets of sensitive, intrinsic tolerant, evolved tolerant and resistant. Remarkably, their dynamic shifts with evolution are depicted and spectral markers of each state are identified. Genotypic analysis validates the phenotypic shift and provides insights into the underlying genetic basis. The new platform advances rapid phenotyping resistance evolution and guides evolution control.

         <title>Enzymatic Electrosynthesis of Glycine from CO2 and NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic electrocatalytic system was developed for the simultaneous conversion of CO2 and NH3 for glycine synthesis. This system was inspired by the reductive glycine pathway in vivo and involves an in vitro multienzymatic cascade reaction. It shows the potential of enzymatic CO2 electroreduction for the synthesis of nitrogenous value&#8208;added chemicals.







Abstract
Enzymatic electrosynthesis has gained more and more interest as an emerging green synthesis platform, particularly for the fixation of CO2. However, the simultaneous utilization of CO2 and a nitrogenous molecule for the enzymatic electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added products has never been reported. In this study, we constructed an in vitro multienzymatic cascade based on the reductive glycine pathway and demonstrated an enzymatic electrocatalytic system that allowed the simultaneous conversion of CO2 and NH3 as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources to synthesize glycine. Through effective coupling and the optimization of electrochemical cofactor regeneration and the multienzymatic cascade reaction, 0.81&#8197;mM glycine was yielded with a highest reaction rate of 8.69&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and faradaic efficiency of 96.8&#8201;%. These results imply a promising alternative for enzymatic CO2 electroreduction and expand its products to nitrogenous chemicals.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Controlled Quadruple Catenation of Giant Chiral [8+12] Salicylimine Cubes Driven by Weak Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quadruply interlocked catenane has been formed from giant chiral [8+12] salicylimine cubes in a reaction that can be controlled by the reaction solvent. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed hydrogen bonding to be a central driving force for the catenation. Furthermore, scrambling experiments with partially deuterated cages allowed mechanistic insights into the interlocking process.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked structures are fascinating synthetic targets and the topological complexity achieved through catenation offers numerous possibilities for the construction of new molecules with exciting properties. In the structural space of catenated organic cage molecules, only few examples have been realized so far, and control over the catenation process in solution is still barely achieved. Herein, we describe the formation of a quadruply interlocked catenane of giant chiral [8+12] salicylimine cubes. The formation could be controlled by the choice of solvent used in the reaction. The interlocked structure was unambiguously characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and weak hydrogen bonding was identified as a central driving force for the catenation. Furthermore, scrambling experiments using partially deuterated cages were performed, revealing that the catenane formation occurs through mechanical interlocking of preformed single cages.

         <title>Ester Reduction with H2 on Bifunctional Metal&#8208;Acid Catalysts: Implications of Metal Identity on Rates and Selectivities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabling sustainable and continuous processes for ether production from bioderived esters on bifunctional solid catalysts: esters hydrogenate to hemiacetals on Pd, Rh, and Pt nanoparticles and diffuse to nearby Br&#248;nsted acids sites to form ethers or alcohols. Ester reduction rates are determined by H* addition to the C=O bond on metal sites and cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds on acid sites.







Abstract
Esters reduce to form ethers and alcohols on contact with metal nanoparticles supported on Br&#248;nsted acidic faujasite (M&#8208;FAU) that cleave C&#8722;O bonds by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis pathways. Rates and selectivities for each pathway depend on the metal identity (M=Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt). Pt&#8208;FAU gives propyl acetate consumption rates up to 100 times greater than other M&#8208;FAU catalysts and provides an ethyl propyl ether selectivity of 34&#8201;%. Measured formation rates, kinetic isotope effects, and site titrations suggest that ester reduction involves a bifunctional mechanism that implicates the stepwise addition of H* atoms to the carbonyl to form hemiacetals on the metal sites, followed by hemiacetal diffusion to a nearby Br&#248;nsted acid site to dehydrate to ethers or decompose to alcohol and aldehyde. The rates of reduction of propyl acetate appear to be determined by the H* addition to the carbonyl and by the C&#8722;O cleavage of hemiacetal.

         <title>Modular Metal&#8208;Quinone Networks with Tunable Architecture and Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of tubes, particles, capsules, and thin films has been developed using the modular coordination&#8208;driven assembly of metal&#8208;quinone networks (MQNs). The MQNs show versatile adhesion to diverse substrates and bidirectional pH&#8208;responsive disassembly with ligand&#8208;mediated kinetics. The incorporated medicinal properties of quinones enable their potential use as prodrugs in specific areas (e.g., cancer and Mpro inhibition in coronaviruses).







Abstract
Nanostructured materials with tunable structures and functionality are of interest in diverse areas. Herein, metal ions are coordinated with quinones through metal&#8208;acetylacetone coordination bonds to generate a class of structurally tunable, universally adhesive, hydrophilic, and pH&#8208;degradable materials. A library of metal&#8208;quinone networks (MQNs) is produced from five model quinone ligands paired with nine metal ions, leading to the assembly of particles, tubes, capsules, and films. Importantly, MQNs show bidirectional pH&#8208;responsive disassembly in acidic and alkaline solutions, where the quinone ligands mediate the disassembly kinetics, enabling temporal and spatial control over the release of multiple components using multilayered MQNs. Leveraging this tunable release and the inherent medicinal properties of quinones, MQN prodrugs with a high drug loading (&gt;89&#8197;wt&#8201;%) are engineered using doxorubicin for anti&#8208;cancer therapy and shikonin for the inhibition of the main protease in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile route using a two&#8208;component flux of LiOH/LiCl enables synthesis of new direct band gap semiconductors of the Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 series. Precise control of synthetic variables such as temperature and LiOH/LiCl ratio allows the fine&#8208;tuning of the Li substitution (x). This gives direct correlation between material properties and synthesis parameters, as the band gap increases with increasing x.







Abstract
Synthesizing solids in molten fluxes enables the rapid diffusion of soluble species at temperatures lower than in solid&#8208;state reactions, leading to crystal formation of kinetically stable compounds. In this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of mixed hydroxide and halide fluxes in synthesizing complex Sr/Ag/Se in mixed LiOH/LiCl. We have accessed a series of two&#8208;dimensional Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 layered phases. With increased LiOH/LiCl ratio or reaction temperature, Li partially substituted Ag to form solid solutions of Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 with x up to 0.45. In addition, a new type of intergrowth compound [Sr3Se2][(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2] was synthesized upon further reaction of Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 with SrSe. Both Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 and [Sr3Se2][(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2] exhibit a direct band gap, which increases with increasing Li substitution (x). Therefore, the band gap of Sr(Ag1&#8722;xLix)2Se2 can be precisely tuned via fine&#8208;tuning x that is controlled by only the flux ratio and temperature.

Solid&#8208;state NMR at fast magic&#8208;angle spinning (100&#8197;kHz) and high static magnetic field (28.2&#8197;T) has been employed in combination with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations to study a trapped water molecule in the cavity of a calix[4]arene lanthanide complex. The study illustrates the high sensitivity of proton NMR chemical&#8208;shift values for non&#8208;covalent interactions driving a whole branch of molecular&#8208;recognition events.







Abstract
The detection and characterization of trapped water molecules in chemical entities and biomacromolecules remains a challenging task for solid materials. We herein present proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments at 100&#8197;kHz magic&#8208;angle spinning and at high static magnetic&#8208;field strengths (28.2&#8197;T) enabling the detection of a single water molecule fixed in the calix[4]arene cavity of a lanthanide complex by a combination of three types of non&#8208;covalent interactions. The water proton resonances are detected at a chemical&#8208;shift value close to zero ppm, which we further confirm by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Density Functional Theory calculations pinpoint to the sensitivity of the proton chemical&#8208;shift value for hydrogen&#8208;&#960; interactions. Our study highlights how proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR is turning into the method&#8208;of&#8208;choice in probing weak non&#8208;covalent interactions driving a whole branch of molecular&#8208;recognition events in chemistry and biology.

         <title>CO2 Aggregation on Monoethanolamine: Observations from Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
How does CO2 interact with an alkanolamine in the gas phase? Using rotational spectroscopy, non&#8208;reactive complexes monoethanolamine&#8208;(CO2)n (where n=1&#8211;4) were characterized. It was discovered that CO2 has a binding priority to the hydroxyl group over the amine group. This is in sharp contrast to the general results observed in the solution phase.







Abstract
The initial stages of the gas&#8208;phase nucleation between CO2 and monoethanolamine were investigated via broadband rotational spectroscopy with the aid of extensive theoretical structure sampling. Sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;scale aggregation patterns of monoethanolamine&#8208;(CO2)n, n=1&#8211;4, were identified. An interesting competition between the monoethanolamine intramolecular hydrogen bond and the intermolecular interactions between monoethanolamine and CO2 upon cluster growth was discovered, revealing an intriguing CO2 binding priority to the hydroxyl group over the amine group. These findings are in sharp contrast to the general results for aqueous solutions. In the quinary complex, a cap&#8208;like CO2 tetramer was observed cooperatively surrounding the monoethanolamine. As the cluster approaches the critical size of new particle formation, the contribution of CO2 self&#8208;assembly to the overall stability increases.

         <title>The Directional Crystallization Process of Poly (triazine imide) Single Crystals in Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers the molecular conjugation and directional precipitation processes of poly (triazine imide) single crystals in molten salts from mesoscopic to nanoscale. Controllable regulation of the dispersity of PTI crystals was achieved towards enhanced photocatalytic performance by manipulating the PTI/salt crystallization fronts.







Abstract
Poly (triazine imide) photocatalysts prepared via molten salt methods emerge as promising polymer semiconductors with one&#8208;step excitation capacity of overall water splitting. Unveiling the molecular conjugation, nucleation, and crystallization processes of PTI crystals is crucial for their controllable structure design. Herein, microscopy characterization was conducted at the PTI crystallization front from meso to nano scales. The heptazine&#8208;based precursor was found to depolymerize to triazine monomers within molten salts and KCl cubes precipitate as the leading cores that guide the directional stacking of PTI molecular units to form aggregated crystals. Upon this discovery, PTI crystals with improved dispersibility and enhanced photocatalytic performance were obtained by tailoring the crystallization fronts. This study advances insights into the directional assembling of PTI monomers on salt templates, placing a theoretical foundation for the ordered condensation of polymer crystals.

         <title>Electrostatic Shielding Boosts Electrochemical Performance of Alloy&#8208;Type Anode Materials of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

K+ ions are introduced as an electrolyte additive to achieve electrostatic shielding on &#956;&#8208;Sn, thereby achieving uniform sodiation and enhanced electrode stability.







Abstract
The applications of alloy&#8208;type anode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries are always obstructed by enormous volume variation upon cycles. Here, K+ ions are introduced as an electrolyte additive to improve the electrochemical performance via electrostatic shielding, using Sn microparticles (&#956;&#8208;Sn) as a model. Theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that K+ ions are not incorporated in the electrode, but accumulate on some sites. This accumulation slows down the local sodiation at the &#8220;hot spots&#8221;, promotes the uniform sodiation and enhances the electrode stability. Therefore, the electrode maintains a high specific capacity of 565&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, much better than the case without K+. The electrode also remains an areal capacity of &#8776;3.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 100 cycles. This method does not involve time&#8208;consuming preparation, sophisticated instruments and expensive reagents, exhibiting the promising potential for other anode materials.

&lt;p&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are introduced as an electrolyte additive to achieve electrostatic shielding on &#956;-Sn, thereby achieving uniform sodiation and enhanced electrode stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The applications of alloy-type anode materials for Na-ion batteries are always obstructed by enormous volume variation upon cycles. Here, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are introduced as an electrolyte additive to improve the electrochemical performance via electrostatic shielding, using Sn microparticles (&#956;-Sn) as a model. Theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are not incorporated in the electrode, but accumulate on some sites. This accumulation slows down the local sodiation at the &#8220;hot spots&#8221;, promotes the uniform sodiation and enhances the electrode stability. Therefore, the electrode maintains a high specific capacity of 565&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 3000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, much better than the case without K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The electrode also remains an areal capacity of &#8776;3.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; after 100 cycles.

         <title>Tailorable and Biocompatible Supramolecular&#8208;Based Hydrogels Featuring two Dynamic Covalent Chemistries</title>

Here we report functionalized peptides that can participate in disulfide and acyl&#8208;hydrazone chemistry. DCLs of such molecules yield self&#8208;assembling fibres. We incorporated cell adhesion&#8208;promoting sequences into the scaffold that can undergo hydrogelation to obtain materials that present biologically relevant ligands. The importance of this work lies in the methodology for fabricating tailor&#8208;made materials through a modular approach.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) has proven to be a valuable tool in creating fascinating molecules, structures, and emergent properties in fully synthetic systems. Here we report a system that uses two dynamic covalent bonds in tandem, namely disulfides and hydrazones, for the formation of hydrogels containing biologically relevant ligands. The reversibility of disulfide bonds allows fiber formation upon oxidation of dithiol&#8208;peptide building block, while the reaction between NH&#8722;NH2 functionalized C&#8208;terminus and aldehyde cross&#8208;linkers results in a gel. The same bond&#8208;forming reaction was exploited for the &#8220;decoration&#8221; of the supramolecular assemblies by cell&#8208;adhesion&#8208;promoting sequences (RGD and LDV). Fast triggered gelation, cytocompatibility and ability to &#8220;on&#8208;demand&#8221; chemically customize fibrillar scaffold offer potential for applying these systems as a bioactive platform for cell culture and tissue engineering.

         <title>Programming Super DNA&#8208;Enzyme Molecules for On&#8208;Demand Enzyme Activity Modulation

Enzyme cascades in the free state are random and uncontrolled. We constructed a super DNA&#8208;enzymes molecule (SDEM) to make programmable and controlled cascades by toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement. The SDEMs can be made sensitive to different substrates on demand via an entropically driven catalytic assembly.







Abstract
Dynamic interactions of enzymes, including programmable configuration and cycling of enzymes, play important roles in the regulation of cellular metabolism. Here, we constructed a super DNA&#8208;enzymes molecule (SDEM) that comprises at least two cascade enzymes and multiple linked DNA strands to control and detect metabolism. We found that the programmable SDEM, which comprises glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP), has a 20&#8208;fold lower detection limit and a 1.6&#8208;fold higher reaction rate than free enzymes. An SDEM can be assembled and disassembled using a hairpin structure and a displacement DNA strand to complete multiple cycles. An entropically driven catalytic assembly (catassembly) enables different SDEMs to switch from an SDEM with GOx and HRP cascades to an SDEM with sarcosine oxidase (SOX) and HRP cascades in over six orders of magnitude less time than without the catassembly to detect different metabolisms (GO and sarcosine) on demand.

Na3.2MnTi0.8V0.2(PO4)3, can realize a reversible 3.2&#8208;electron redox reaction with five redox couples V5+/4+, Mn4+/3+, Mn3+/2+, V4+/3+, and Ti4+/3+, enabling a high discharge capacity and an ultrahigh energy density. In addition, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction results reveal the highly reversible structural evolution of Na3.2MnTi0.8V0.2(PO4)3 with separate solid&#8208;solution and two&#8208;phase reaction during sodiation/de&#8208;sodiation.







Abstract
Na superionic conductor (NASICON) structured cathode materials with robust structural stability and large Na+ diffusion channels have aroused great interest in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, most of NASICON&#8208;type cathode materials exhibit redox reaction of no more than three electrons per formula, which strictly limits capacity and energy density. Herein, a series of NASICON&#8208;type Na3+xMnTi1&#8722;xVx(PO4)3 cathode materials are designed, which demonstrate not only a multi&#8208;electron reaction but also high voltage platform. With five redox couples from V5+/4+ (&#8776;4.1&#8197;V), Mn4+/3+ (&#8776;4.0&#8197;V), Mn3+/2+ (&#8776;3.6&#8197;V), V4+/3+ (&#8776;3.4&#8197;V), and Ti4+/3+ (&#8776;2.1&#8197;V), the optimized material, Na3.2MnTi0.8V0.2(PO4)3, realizes a reversible 3.2&#8208;electron redox reaction, enabling a high discharge capacity (172.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and an ultrahigh energy density (527.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1). This work sheds light on the rational construction of NASICON&#8208;type cathode materials with multi&#8208;electron redox reaction for high&#8208;energy SIBs.

         <title>Designing Heteroatom&#8208;Codoped Iron Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Promotional Photoreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of new active sites with beneficial defects in Fe&#8208;MOF MIL&#8208;88B catalysts gives enhanced photoreduction of CO2 to C2H4 under visible light. The modified structure promotes the migration and separation of the photoelectrons to produce the pivotal C&#8722;C coupling intermediate for the generation of C2H4, a result supported by in situ FT&#8208;IR analysis.







Abstract
Rational engineering active sites and vantage defects of catalysts are promising but grand challenging task to enhance photoreduction CO2 to high value&#8208;added C2 products. In this study, we designed an N,S&#8208;codoped Fe&#8208;based MIL&#8208;88B catalyst with well&#8208;defined bipyramidal hexagonal prism morphology via a facile and effective process, which was synthesized by addition of appropriate 1,2&#8208;benzisothiazolin&#8208;3&#8208;one (BIT) and acetic acid to the reaction solution. Under simulated solar irradiation, the designed catalyst exhibits high C2H4 evolution yield of 17.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8901;h, which has been rarely achieved in photocatalytic CO2 reduction process. The synergistic effect of Fe&#8208;N coordinated sites and reasonable defects in the N,S&#8208;codoped photocatalyst can accelerate the migration of photogenerated carriers, resulting in high electron density, and this in turn helps to facilitate the formation and dimerization of C&#8722;C coupling intermediates for C2H4 effectively.

&lt;p&gt;The integration of new active sites with beneficial defects in Fe-MOF MIL-88B catalysts gives enhanced photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; under visible light. The modified structure promotes the migration and separation of the photoelectrons to produce the pivotal C&#8722;C coupling intermediate for the generation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, a result supported by in situ FT-IR analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational engineering active sites and vantage defects of catalysts are promising but grand challenging task to enhance photoreduction CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to high value-added C2 products. In this study, we designed an N,S-codoped Fe-based MIL-88B catalyst with well-defined bipyramidal hexagonal prism morphology via a facile and effective process, which was synthesized by addition of appropriate 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one (BIT) and acetic acid to the reaction solution. Under simulated solar irradiation, the designed catalyst exhibits high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; evolution yield of 17.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;h, which has been rarely achieved in photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction process. The synergistic effect of Fe-N coordinated sites and reasonable defects in the N,S-codoped photocatalyst can accelerate the migration of photogenerated carriers, resulting in high electron density, and this in turn helps to facilitate the formation and dimerization of C&#8722;C coupling intermediates for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multistate Structural Switching of [3]Catenanes with Cyclic Porphyrin Dimers by Complexation with Amine Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;controlled switching method has been developed for the multistate switching of catenanes. To verify this concept, a [3]catenane composed of three macrocyclic metalloporphyrin dimers with a rigid &#960;&#8208;backbone was synthesized. Multistate switching of the [3]catenane was achieved by complexation with various amine ligands, with the multistate switching behavior arising from the tunable optical properties of the [3]catenane.







Abstract
Catenanes with multistate switchable properties are promising components for next&#8208;generation molecular machines and supramolecular materials. Herein, we report a ligand&#8208;controlled switching method, a novel method for the multistate switching of catenanes controlled by complexation with added amine ligands. To verify this method, a [3]catenane comprising cyclic porphyrin dimers with a rigid &#960;&#8208;system has been synthesized. Owing to the rigidity, the relative positions among the cyclic components of the [3]catenane can be precisely controlled by complexation with various amine ligands. Moreover, ligand&#8208;controlled multistate switching affects the optical properties of the [3]catenanes: the emission intensity can be tuned by modulating the sizes and coordination numbers of integrated amine ligands. This work shows the utility of using organic ligands for the structural switching of catenanes, and will contribute to the further development of multistate switchable mechanically interlocked molecules.

         <title>Engineered Binding Microenvironments in Halogen Bonding Polymers for Enhanced Anion Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen&#8208;bonding (XB), redox&#8208;active copolymeric hosts are demonstrated to enhance anion binding and sensing performance with respect to their discrete receptive monomers. Through judicious choice of co&#8208;monomers, the local dielectric environment within the polymeric hosts can be modulated, resulting in up to a 50&#8208;fold improvement in binding constant with a XB polymeric host with I&#8722; compared to its monomer.







Abstract
Mimicking Nature's polymeric protein architectures by designing hosts with binding cavities screened from bulk solvent is a promising approach to achieving anion recognition in competitive media. Accomplishing this, however, can be synthetically demanding. Herein we present a synthetically tractable approach, by directly incorporating potent supramolecular anion&#8208;receptive motifs into a polymeric scaffold, tuneable through a judicious selection of the co&#8208;monomer. A comprehensive analysis of anion recognition and sensing is demonstrated with redox&#8208;active, halogen bonding polymeric hosts. Notably, the polymeric hosts consistently outperform their monomeric analogues, with especially large halide binding enhancements of ca. 50&#8208;fold observed in aqueous&#8208;organic solvent mixtures. These binding enhancements are rationalised by the generation and presentation of low dielectric constant binding microenvironments from which there is appreciable solvent exclusion.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Fueled Transient Breathing Nanogels that Couple Nonequilibrium Catalytic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer nanogel can perform polymerization with every breath it takes. CO2 binding to the nanogel activates its catalytic capacity and initiates a CO2&#8208;involved nonequilibrium polymerization that reversely depletes the fuel. This transient system can function as a gas&#8208;powered nanosynthesizer for automatic production of polymer on&#8208;demand.







Abstract
Here we present a &#8220;breathing&#8221; nanogel that is fueled by CO2 gas to perform temporally programmable catalytic polymerization. The nanogel is composed of common frustrated Lewis pair polymers (FLPs). Dynamic CO2&#8208;FLP gas&#8208;bridging bonds endow the nanogel with a transient volume contraction, and the resulting proximal effect of bound FLPs unlocks its catalytic capacity toward CO2. Reverse gas depletion via a CO2&#8208;participated polymerization can induce a reverse nanogel expansion, which shuts down the catalytic activity. Control of external factors (fuel level, temperature or additives) can regulate the breathing period, amplitude and lifecycle, so as to affect the catalytic polymerization. Moreover, editing the nanogel breathing procedure can sequentially evoke the copolymerization of CO2 with different epoxide monomers preloaded therein, which allows to obtain block&#8208;tunable copolycarbonates that are unachievable by other methods. This synthetic dissipative system would be function as a prototype of gas&#8208;driven nanosynthesizer.

The self&#8208;assembly of N&#8208;annulated perylene bisimides (N&#8208;PBIs) has demonstrated that the ability of these units to generate different polymorphs upon supramolecular polymerization decreases as the length of the alkyl bridge separating the peripheral side chains and the central aromatic backbones decreases. The kinetically controlled supramolecular polymerization of these N&#8208;PBIs has also been investigated.







Abstract
The synthesis and self&#8208;assembling features of N&#8208;annulated perylenebisimides (N&#8208;PBIs) 2&#8211;4 are reported and compared with the complex self&#8208;assembly of N&#8208;PBI 1. The studies presented herein demonstrate that increasing the length of the alkyl spacer separating the central aromatic core of the dye and the peripheral side chains cancels the differentiation on the corresponding supramolecular polymerization. Thus, only 2 is able to form two different supramolecular polymorphs. The formation of kinetically trapped monomeric species is observed for all the N&#8208;PBIs 2&#8211;4. These metastable species, constituted by intramolecularly H&#8208;bonded pseudocycles of 7, 8, 9, or 10 members for compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, provoke kinetically controlled supramolecular polymerizations that can be accelerated by the addition of seeds. The results presented herein shed light on the intricate process of differentiation in self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Elucidation of the Alternating Copolymerization Mechanism of Epoxides or Aziridines with Cyclic Anhydrides in the Presence of Halide Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chain&#8208;end coordination processes have been reported to promote highly active and selective ROCOP. The complex behavior of salts in the copolymerizations have led to the elucidation of the alternating copolymerization mechanism.







Abstract
Organic halide salts in combination with metal or organic compound are the most common and essential catalysts in ring&#8208;opening copolymerizations (ROCOP). However, the role of organic halide salts was neglected. Here, we have uncovered the complex behavior of organic halides in ROCOP of epoxides or aziridine with cyclic anhydride. Coordination of the chain&#8208;ends to cations, electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, leaving ability of halide atoms, chain&#8208;end basicity/nucleophilicity, and terminal steric hindrance cause three types of side reactions: single&#8208;site transesterification, substitution, and elimination. Understanding the complex functions of organic halide salts in ROCOP led us to develop highly active and selective aminocyclopropenium chlorides as catalysts/initiators. Adjustable H&#8208;bonding interactions of aminocyclopropenium with propagating anions and epoxides create chain&#8208;end coordination process that generate highly reactive carboxylate and highly selective alkoxide chain&#8208;ends.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalysed Rearrangement of Cyclic Ethynylethylene Carbonates: Synthetic Applications and Mechanistic Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented copper&#8208;catalysed rearrangement of cyclic ethynylethylene carbonates has been discovered, and the in situ&#8208;formed allenal intermediates could react with a range of nucleophiles to furnish synthetically useful and highly functionalised products through the addition pathways. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds through the base&#8208;mediated deprotonation as the key step to induce the rearrangement.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed reactions of cyclic ethynylethylene carbonates have been intensively studied because of their robustness in new bond formation and diversified molecule construction. Known reaction modes usually involve a substitution step occurring at either the propargylic or terminal alkyne positions. Here, we report an unprecedented reaction pattern in which cyclic ethynylethylene carbonates first undergo a rearrangement to release allenal intermediates, which subsequently react with diverse nucleophiles to furnish synthetically useful allylic and propargylic allenols, phosphorus ylides, and cyclopropylidene ketones through an addition process rather than a substitution pathway. The products enable various further transformations, and mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the reaction does not proceed via a semipinacol type [1,2]&#8208;hydride shift, but through base&#8208;mediated deprotonation as the key step to induce the rearrangement.

         <title>Fabrication of Super&#8208;Sized Metal Inorganic&#8208;Organic Hybrid Glass with Supramolecular Network via Crystallization&#8208;Suppressing Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal inorganic&#8208;organic complex glass with supramolecular network was synthesized by the crystallization&#8208;suppressing strategy. The prepared glass possesses interesting optical and structural properties such as high transparency, shaping capability, and anisotropic structure. The dyes&#8208;doped hybrid glass exhibits polarized light with a polarization ratio up to 47&#8201;%.







Abstract
Metal coordination compound (MCC) glasses [e.g., metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glass, coordination polymer glass, and metal inorganic&#8208;organic complex (MIOC) glass] are emerging members of the hybrid glass family. So far, a limited number of crystalline MCCs can be converted into glasses by melt&#8208;quenching. Here, we report a universal wet&#8208;chemistry method, by which the super&#8208;sized supramolecular MIOC glasses can be synthesized from non&#8208;meltable MOFs. Alcohol and acid were used as agents to inhibit crystallization. The MIOC glasses demonstrate unique features including high transparency, shaping capability, and anisotropic network. Directional photoluminescence with a large polarization ratio (&#8776;47&#8201;%) was observed from samples doped with organic dyes. This crystallization&#8208;suppressing approach enables fabrication of super&#8208;sized MCC glasses, which cannot be achieved by conventional vitrification methods, and thus allows for exploring new MCC glasses possessing photonic functionalities.

         <title>Orthogonal Trichromatic Upconversion with High Color Purity in Core&#8208;Shell Nanoparticles for a Full&#8208;Color Display</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current upconversion&#8208;based display systems generally require excitation pulse modulation or multiple near&#8208;infrared pumping for full&#8208;color tuning, which may cause deleterious effects associated with complex procedure and low color purity. To this end, we present a dual&#8208;channel pump scheme to fine&#8208;control emission in the full color range from core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured upconversion nanoparticles.







Abstract
Materials with tunable emission colors has attracted increasing interest in both fundamental research and applications. As a key member of light&#8208;emitting materials family, lanthanide doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have been intensively demonstrated to emit light in any color upon near&#8208;infrared excitation. However, realizing the trichromatic emission in UCNPs with a fixed composition remains a great challenge. Here, without excitation pulsed modulation and three different near&#8208;infrared pumping, we report an experimental design to fine&#8208;control emission in the full color gamut from core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured UCNPs by manipulating the energy migration through dual&#8208;channel pump scheme. We also demonstrate their potential application in full&#8208;color display. These findings may benefit the future development of convenient and versatile optical methos for multicolor tuning and open up the possibility of constructing full&#8208;color volumetric display systems with high spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>A Photoisomerizable Zinc (II) Complex Inhibits Microtubule Polymerization for Photoactive Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights a photoisomerizable zinc(II) complex (Zn1), which has a promising application prospect in photoactive therapy through photoisomerization. Zn1 can release its trans ligand after light irradiation, undergo photoisomerization to produce toxic cis product and generate 1O2 in the meantime. The series of changes lead to photo&#8208;triggered toxicity against cancer cells and cause microtubule breakdown.







Abstract
The photoisomerization&#8208;induced cytotoxicity in photopharmacology provides a unique pathway for phototherapy because it is independent of endogenous oxygen. In this study, we developed a biosafe photoisomerizable zinc(II) complex (Zn1), which releases its trans ligand (trans&#8208;L1) after being irradiated with blue light. This causes the complex to undergo photoisomerization and produce the toxic cis product (cis&#8208;L1) and generate singlet oxygen (1O2). The resulting series of events caused impressive phototoxicity in hypoxic A431 skin cancer cells, as well as in a tumor model in vivo. Interestingly, Zn1 was able to inhibit tumor microtubule polymerization, while still showing good biocompatibility and biosafety in vivo. This photoisomerizable zinc(II) complex provides a novel strategy for addressing the oxygen&#8208;dependent limitation of traditional photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Hydroxylation with Unusual Stereoinversion Catalyzed by an FeII/2&#8208;OG Dependent Oxidase and 3,6&#8208;Diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine Formation in the Biosynthesis of Brevianamide&#8197;K</title>

         <dc:description>
Unlike the known biosynthetic pathways for the 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine substructure in bacteria, double&#8208;bond installation by heme&#8208;dependent AspF, unprecedented stereoinversion upon hydroxylation by FeII/2&#8208;OG&#8208;dependent AspE, and subsequent dehydration lead to the formation of the 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine substructure of brevianamide K in the fungus Aspergillus sp. SK&#8208;28.







Abstract
Natural products with the 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine core are widely distributed in nature; however, the biosynthetic mechanism of 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine in fungi remains to be further elucidated. Through heterologous expression and biochemical investigation of an FeII/2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent oxidase (AspE) and a heme&#8208;dependent P450 enzyme (AspF), we report that AspE, AspF and subsequent dehydration account for the formation of the 3,6&#8208;diene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine substructure of brevianamide K from Aspergillus sp. SK&#8208;28, a symbiotic fungus of mangrove plant Kandelia candel. More interestingly, in&#8208;depth investigation of the enzymatic mechanism showed that AspE promotes hydroxylation of brevianamide Q with unprecedented stereoinversion through hydrogen atom abstraction and water nucleophilic attack from the opposite face of the resultant iminium cation intermediate.

         <title>Engineered Artificial Membraneless Organelles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae To Enhance Chemical Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial membraneless organelle (MLO) was designed to increase the production efficiency of fine chemicals by S.&#8197;cerevisiae. The size and rigidity of the membraneless organelles were adjusted to decrease the concentration of toxic formaldehyde and to induce a switch from oxidative glycolysis to non&#8208;oxidative glycolysis. Consequently, the methanol assimilation efficiency and the n&#8208;butanol yield increased significantly.







Abstract
Microbial cell factories provide a green and sustainable opportunity to produce value&#8208;added products from renewable feedstock. However, the leakage of toxic or volatile intermediates decreases the efficiency of microbial cell factories. In this study, membraneless organelles (MLOs) were reconstructed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by the disordered protein sequence A&#8208;IDPs. A regulation system was designed to spatiotemporally regulate the size and rigidity of MLOs. Manipulating the MLO size of strain ZP03&#8208;FM, the amounts of assimilated methanol and malate were increased by 162&#8201;% and 61&#8201;%, respectively. Furthermore, manipulating the MLO rigidity in strain ZP04&#8208;RB made acetyl&#8208;coA synthesis from oxidative glycolysis change to non&#8208;oxidative glycolysis; consequently, CO2 release decreased by 35&#8201;% and the n&#8208;butanol yield increased by 20&#8201;%. This artificial MLO provides a strategy for the co&#8208;localization of enzymes to channel C1 starting materials into value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>NH4+ Deprotonation at Interfaces Induced Reversible H3O+/NH4+ Co&#8208;insertion/Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accumulation of NH4+ on the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface was probed by in situ ATR&#8208;FTIR. The formed NH4+&#8208;rich domain induces the formation of protons. Subsequently, proton co&#8208;insertion into VO2 happens, which achieved fast ion storage (charge/discharge in &lt;20&#8197;s) and high capacity (&gt;300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and was revealed by in situ XRD and DFT calculation.







Abstract
Ion insertions always involve electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface process, desolvation for instance, which determines the electrochemical kinetics. However, it&#8242;s still a challenge to achieve fast ion insertion and investigate ion transformation at interface. Herein, the interface deprotonation of NH4+ and the introduced dissociation of H2O molecules to provide sufficient H3O+ to insert into materials&#8242; structure for fast energy storages are revealed. Lewis acidic ion&#8208;NH4+ can, on one hand provide H3O+ itself via deprotonation, and on the other hand hydrolyze with H2O molecules to produce H3O+. In situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;Fourier transform infrared ray method probed the interface accumulation and deprotonation of NH4+, and density functional theory calculations manifested that NH4+ tend to thermodynamically adsorb on the surface of monoclinic VO2, and deprotonate to provide H3O+. In addition, the inserted NH4+ has a positive effect for stabilizing the VO2(B) structure. Therefore, high specific capacity (&gt;300&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and fast ionic insertion/extraction (&lt;20&#8197;s) can be realized in VO2(B) anode. This interface derivation proposes a new path for designing proton ion insertion/extraction in mild electrolyte.

         <title>On the Edge of the Known: Extremely Electron&#8208;Rich (Di)Carboranyl Phosphines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
B9&#8208;Phos: B9&#8208;functionalized carboranylphosphines with bulky electron&#8208;donating substituents display an extremely electron&#8208;releasing character surpassing the donor strength of alkyl phosphines and even commonly used N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. In addition, they exert a high steric demand which allows the mesityl derivatives to form stabilized phosphoniumyl radical cations. The dicarboranyl phosphine AuI complexes show superior catalytic performance in the hydroamination of alkynes compared to the monocarboranyl phosphine analogs.







Abstract
The syntheses of the first B9&#8208;connected carboranylphosphines (B9&#8208;Phos) featuring two carboranyl moieties as well as access to B9&#8208;Phos ligands with bulky electron&#8208;donating substituents, previously deemed unattainable, is reported. The electrochemical properties of the B9&#8208;Phos ligands were investigated, revealing the ability of the mesityl derivatives to form stabilized phosphoniumyl radical cations. The B9&#8208;Phos ligands display an extremely electron&#8208;releasing character surpassing that of alkyl phosphines and commonly used N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. This is demonstrated by their very small Tolman electronic parameters (TEPs) as well as extremely low P&#8722;Se coupling constants. Cone angles and buried volumes attest to the high steric demand exerted by the (di)carboranyl phosphines. The dicarboranyl phosphine AuI complexes show superior catalytic performance in the hydroamination of alkynes compared to the monocarboranyl phosphine analogs.

         <title>Enzyme Engineering for High&#8208;Yielding Amide Formation: Lipase&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of N&#8208;Acyl Glycines in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;acyl glycines are essential biosurfactants in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Their commercial production involves the use of neurotoxic phosgene. Aiming towards green synthesis of these amides, we developed a novel amide synthesis concept involving glycerol activation and evolved a hydrolytic enzyme by reshaping its catalytic pocket into a highly active amide bond&#8208;forming enzyme, displaying 400&#8208;fold higher catalytic efficiency for N&#8208;lauroylglycine synthesis with over 80&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Amide syntheses remain a key challenging green chemistry reaction. For instance, green synthesis of N&#8208;acyl glycines as biosurfactants and therapeutics is highly desirable to replace chemical pathways using toxic phosgene. Herein, we report a novel concept for enzymatic amidation in an aqueous system via glycerol activation of fatty acids and theirsubsequent aminolysis with glycine to synthesize N&#8208;acyl glycines. We then engineer an enzyme (proRML) by reshaping its catalytic pocket to enhance its aminolysis activity and catalytic efficiency by 103&#8208;fold and 465&#8208;fold, respectively. The evolved proRML (D156S/L258K/L267N/S83D/L58K/R86K/W88V) catalyzed the amidation of a fatty acid with glycine to give N&#8208;lauroylglycine with high yield (80&#8201;%). It accepts a broad range of medium&#8208; to long&#8208;chain fatty acids (C8&#8211;C18), giving high yields of N&#8208;decanoyl&#8208;, N&#8208;myristoyl&#8208;, and N&#8208;oleoylglycine. The developed amidation concept may be general, and the engineered enzyme is useful for the green synthesis of N&#8208;acyl glycines.

         <title>Peroxodicarbonate as a Green Oxidizer for the Selective Degradation of Kraft Lignin into Vanillin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidative conversion of technical Kraft lignin into vanillin is reported in high yields. Through the ex&#8208;cell electrolysis of aqueous carbonate, peroxodicarbonate is produced and serves as a &#8220;green&#8221; oxidizer for the degradation of lignin.







Abstract
Lignin, the world's largest resource of renewable aromatics, with annually roughly 50 million tons of accruing technical lignin, mainly Kraft lignin, is highly underdeveloped regarding the production of monoaromatics. We demonstrate the oxidative depolymerization of Kraft lignin at 180&#8201;&#176;C to produce vanillin 1 in yields up to 6.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% and 92&#8201;% referred to the maximum yield gained from the quantification reaction utilizing nitrobenzene. Using peroxodicarbonate (C2O62&#8722;) as &#8220;green&#8221; oxidizer for the degradation, toxic and/or harmful reagents are prevented. Also, the formed waste can serve as makeup chemical in the pulping process. Na2C2O6 is synthesized in an ex&#8208;cell electrolysis of aqueous Na2CO3 at BDD anodes, achieving a yield of Na2C2O6 with 41&#8201;%. At least, the oxidation and degradation of Kraft lignin is analysis via UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Wide&#8208;coverage and Efficient NIR Emission from Single&#8208;component Nanophosphors through Shaping Multiple Metal&#8208;halide Packages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widest&#8208;coverage single&#8208;component near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission (850&#8211;1650&#8197;nm) with the high NIR photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 20.3&#8201;% in Sm3+, Nd3+, Er3+ triple&#8208;doped Cs2K0.5Rb0.5(In0.95Sb0.05)Cl6 NCs is achieved. The remarkable results are attributed to the improved energy transfer efficiency between host and lanthanide (Ln3+) ions and reduced cation site symmetry of Ln3+ ions due to alkali metal substitution.







Abstract
Wide&#8208;coverage near infrared (NIR) phosphor&#8208;converted LEDs possess promising potential for practical applications, but little is developed towards the efficient and wide&#8208;coverage NIR phosphors. Here, we report the single&#8208;component lanthanide (Ln3+) ions doped Cs2M(In0.95Sb0.05)Cl6 (M=alkali metal) nanocrystals (NCs), exhibiting emission from 850 to 1650&#8197;nm with high photoluminescence quantum yield of 20.3&#8201;%, which is accomplished by shaping the multiple metal halide octahedra of double perovskite via the simple alkali metal substitution. From Judd&#8208;Ofelt theoretical calculation and spectroscopic investigations, the shaping of metal halide octahedra in Cs2M(In1&#8722;xSbx)Cl6 NCs can break the forbidden of f&#8208;f transition of Ln3+, thus increasing their radiative transition rates and simultaneously boosting the energy transfer efficiency from host to Ln3+. Finally, the wide&#8208;coverage NIR LEDs based on Sm3+, Nd3+, Er3+&#8208;tridoped Cs2K0.5Rb0.5(In0.95Sb0.05)Cl6 NCs are fabricated and employed in the multiplex gas sensing and night&#8208;vision application.

         <title>The Origin of Solvent Deprotonation in LiI&#8208;added Aprotic Electrolytes for Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fundamentals behind undesirable side reactions (solvent deprotonation) in LiI&#8208;added Li&#8208;O2 batteries have been controversial since LiI was reported to enable 4e&#8722; redox reactions in 2015. However, LiBr is free from such issues. Here, we predict and confirm that it is the side product (
 that triggers the solvent deprotonation.







Abstract
LiI and LiBr have been employed as soluble redox mediators (RMs) in electrolytes to address the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction kinetics during charging in aprotic Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentals behind undesirable side reactions (solvent deprotonation) in LiI-added Li-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries have been controversial since LiI was reported to enable 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; redox reactions in 2015. However, LiBr is free from such issues. Here, we predict and confirm that it is the side product (

         <title>Camouflaged Virus&#8208;Like&#8208;Nanocarrier with a Transformable Rough Surface for Boosting Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocarrier with variable surface roughness was designed. At physiological pH, the virus&#8208;like spikes are hidden by a polymer shell, which effectively inhibits the non&#8208;specific strong nano&#8211;bio interaction between the nanocarrier and protein/normal tissue induced by the rough surface. In the acidic tumor microenvironment, the nanocarrier sheds the polymer camouflage to re&#8208;expose its rough surface, thus promoting endocytosis of the nanocarrier by tumor cells.







Abstract
Due to non&#8208;specific strong nano&#8211;bio interactions, it is difficult for nanocarriers with permanent rough surface to cross multiple biological barriers to realize efficient drug delivery. Herein, a camouflaged virus&#8208;like&#8208;nanocarrier with a transformable rough surface is reported, which is composed by an interior virus&#8208;like mesoporous SiO2 nanoparticle with a rough surface (vSiO2) and an exterior acid&#8208;responsive polymer. Under normal physiological pH condition, the spikes on vSiO2 are hidden by the polymer shell, and the non&#8208;specific strong nano&#8211;bio interactions are effectively inhibited. While in the acidic tumor microenvironment, the nanocarrier sheds the polymer camouflage to re&#8208;expose its rough surface. So, the retention ability and endocytosis efficiency of the nanocarrier are great improved. Owing to it's the dynamically variable rough surface, the rationally designed nanocarrier exhibits extended blood&#8208;circulation&#8208;time and enhanced tumor accumulation.

         <title>Enzyme Translocation&#8208;Mediated Signal Amplification for Spatially Selective Aptasensing of ATP in Inflammatory Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatically triggerable, aptamer&#8208;based signal amplification approach is developed to achieve inflammatory cell&#8208;selective ATP imaging in vitro and in vivo. The system relies on enzyme translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm in inflammatory cells, which activate an aptasensor for ATP recognition and further initiate cascade reactions for signal amplification.







Abstract
Amplified ATP imaging in inflammatory cells is highly desirable. However, the spatial selectivity of current amplification methods is limited, that is, signal amplification is performed systemically and not in a disease site&#8208;specific manner. Here we present a versatile strategy, termed enzymatically triggerable, aptamer&#8208;based signal amplification (ETA&#8208;SA), that enables inflammatory cell&#8208;specific imaging of ATP through spatially&#8208;resolved signal amplification. The ETA&#8208;SA leverages a translocated enzyme in inflammatory cells to activate DNA aptamer probes and further drive cascade reactions through the consumption of hairpin fuels, which, however, exerts no ATP response activity in normal cells, leading to a significantly improved sensitivity and spatial specificity for the inflammation&#8208;specific ATP imaging in vivo. Benefiting from the improved spatial selectivity, enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios were achieved for ATP imaging during acute hepatitis.

         <title>Interface Design Enabling Stable Polymer/Thiophosphate Electrolyte Separators for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEGDME with a substituted terminal group not only stabilizes the polymer/thiophosphate interfaces but also extends the electrochemical window of the composite SE. A LiF&#8208;rich SEI studied by in situ XPS and time&#8208;dependent EIS protects the Li metal anode against the dendrite growth. The stable interfaces in the PEGDME/LPSCl composite SE enable homogeneous lithium plating/stripping for both Li symmetric cells and Li/LiNi0.85Co0.1Mn0.05O2 cells.







Abstract
Organic/inorganic interfaces greatly affect Li+ transport in composite solid electrolytes (SEs), while SE/electrode interfacial stability plays a critical role in the cycling performance of solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs). However, incomplete understanding of interfacial (in)stability hinders the practical application of composite SEs in SSBs. Herein, chemical degradation between Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is revealed. The high polarity of PEG changes the electronic state and structural bonding of the PS43&#8722; tetrahedra, thus triggering a series of side reactions. A substituted terminal group of PEG not only stabilizes the inner interfaces but also extends the electrochemical window of the composite SE. Moreover, a LiF&#8208;rich layer can effectively prevent side reactions at the Li/SE interface. The results provide insights into the chemical stability of polymer/sulfide composites and demonstrate an interface design to achieve dendrite&#8208;free lithium metal batteries.

These findings on the evolution of stabilized 1T&#8208;MoS2 will strengthen our comprehensive knowledge of electronic structure optimization strategy and pave the way for the design of other heterostructures materials for high&#8208;performance energy storage.







Abstract
Metallic conductive 1T phase molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) has been identified as promising anode for sodium ion (Na+) batteries, but its metastable feature makes it difficult to obtain and its restacking during the charge/discharge processing result in part capacity reversibility. Herein, a synergetic effect of atomic&#8208;interface engineering is employed for constructing 2H&#8208;MoS2 layers assembled on single atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C (SA Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C) anode material that boosts its reversible capacity. The work&#8208;function&#8208;driven&#8208;electron transfer occurs from SA Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C to 2H&#8208;MoS2 via the Fe&#8722;S bonds, which enhances the adsorption of Na+ by 2H&#8208;MoS2, and lays the foundation for the sodiation process. A phase transfer from 2H to 1T/2H MoS2 with the ferromagnetic spin&#8208;polarization of SA Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C occurs during the sodiation/desodiation process, which significantly enhances the Na+ storage kinetics, and thus the 1T/2H MoS2/SA Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C display a high electronic conductivity and a fast Na+ diffusion rate.

         <title>Cathode Electrolyte Interphase (CEI) Endows Mo6S8 with Fast Interfacial Magnesium&#8208;Ion Transfer Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) layer can be constructed on the surface of a Mo6S8 cathode through the oxidation of a boron&#8208;centered magnesium salt. This CEI layer is favorable for the desolvation of Mg2+, so that the chloride&#8208;free magnesium electrolyte can support the effective cycling of magnesium batteries.







Abstract
Magnesium (Mg) metal secondary batteries have attracted much attention for their high safety and high energy density characteristics. However, the significant issues of the cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) in Mg batteries are still being ignored. In this work, a significant CEI layer on the typical Mo6S8 cathode surface has been unprecedentedly constructed through the oxidation of the chloride&#8208;free magnesium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate (Mg[B(hfip)4]2) salt under a proper charge cut&#8208;off voltage condition. The CEI has been identified to contain BxOy effective species originating from the oxidation of [B(hfip)4]&#8722; anion. It is confirmed that the BxOy species is beneficial to the desolvation of solvated Mg2+, speeding up the interfacial Mg2+ transfer kinetics, thereby improving the Mg2+&#8208;storage capability of Mo6S8 host. The firstly reported CEI in Mg batteries will give deeper insights into the interface issues in multivalent electrochemical systems.

         <title>Revealing the Mechanism of Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission in Layered Silver&#8208;Bismuth Double Perovskites</title>

A pressure&#8208;driven self&#8208;trapping exciton transformation from dark to bright state was achieved in low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites, revealing the physicochemical mechanism of pressure&#8208;induced emission.







Abstract
Pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) associated with self&#8208;trapping excitons (STEs) in low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites has attracted great attention for better materials&#8208;by&#8208;design. Here, using 2D layered double perovskite (C6H5CH2CH2NH3+)4AgBiBr8 as a model system, we advance a fundamental physicochemical mechanism of the PIE from the perspective of carrier dynamics and excited&#8208;state behaviors of local lattice distortion. We observed a pressure&#8208;driven STE transformation from dark to bright states, corresponding a strong broadband Stokes&#8208;shifted emission. Further theoretical analysis demonstrated that the suppressed lattice distortion and enhanced electronic dimensionality in the excited&#8208;state play an important role in the formation of stabilized bright STEs, which could manipulate the self&#8208;trapping energy and lattice deformation energy to form an energy barrier between the potential energy curves of ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state, and enhance the electron&#8208;hole orbital overlap, respectively.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers through Enantioselective Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient enantioselective desymmetrization protocol is disclosed for the asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral diaryl ethers by using a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic aromatic amination. This method features broad substrate scope, high yields and high enantioselectivity. The facile derivatization of various products into a series of structurally novel azaarene&#8208;containing diaryl ether atropisomers was also demonstrated.







Abstract
Axially chiral diaryl ethers are a type of unique atropisomers bearing two potential axes, which have potential applications in a variety of research fields. However, the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of these diaryl ether atropisomers is largely underexplored when compared to the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of biaryl or other types of atropisomers. Herein, we report a highly efficient catalytic asymmetric synthesis of diaryl ether atropisomers through an organocatalyzed enantioselective desymmetrization protocol. The chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric electrophilic aromatic aminations of the symmetrical 1,3&#8208;benzenediamine type substrates afforded a series of diaryl ether atropisomers in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The facile construction of heterocycles by the utilizations of the 1,2&#8208;benzenediamine moiety in the products provided access to a variety of structurally diverse and novel azaarene&#8208;containing diaryl ether atropisomers.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;mediated Aqueous Synthesis of NIR&#8208;II Emitting Ag2S Quantum Dots for Rapid Photocatalytic Bacteria Disinfection</title>

         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emitting AgBP2&#8208;Ag2S QDs were successfully synthesized based on a silver&#8208;binding polypeptide AgBP2 under mild conditions and served as photothermal agents for antibacterial activity. Owing to the synergistic effects of photogenerated ROS and hyperthermia, the obtained AgBP2&#8208;Ag2S QDs exhibited an effective disinfection efficacy of 99.06&#8201;% against E.&#8197;coli within 25&#8197;min of NIR irradiation.







Abstract
Pathogenic microorganisms in the environment are a great threat to global human health. The development of disinfection method with rapid and effective antibacterial properties is urgently needed. In this study, a biomimetic silver binding peptide AgBP2 was introduced to develop a facile synthesis of biocompatible Ag2S quantum dots (QDs). The AgBP2 capped Ag2S QDs exhibited excellent fluorescent emission in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window, with physical stability and photostability in the aqueous phase. Under 808&#8197;nm NIR laser irradiation, AgBP2&#8208;Ag2S QDs can serve not only as a photothermal agent to realize NIR photothermal conversion but also as a photocatalyst to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The obtained AgBP2&#8208;Ag2S QDs achieved a highly effective disinfection efficacy of 99.06&#8201;% against Escherichia coli within 25&#8197;min of NIR irradiation, which was ascribed to the synergistic effects of photogenerated ROS during photocatalysis and hyperthermia. Our work demonstrated a promising strategy for efficient bacterial disinfection.

         <title>Tailor&#8208;Made PdnL2n Metal&#8208;Organic Cages through Covalent Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two PdnL2n (n=2, 12) type metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) decorated with anthracene groups have been successfully functionalized by a covalent post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) approach. This has led to the modified MOCs having new functions compared to the parent MOCs (e.g., concentration&#8208;dependent chirality, aggregation&#8208;induced emission, and chirality&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence).







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is an effective approach for the tailored functionalization of metal&#8208;organic architectures, but its generalizability remains challenging. Herein we report a general covalent PSM strategy to functionalize PdnL2n metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs, n=2, 12) through an efficient Diels&#8211;Alder cycloaddition between peripheral anthracene substituents and various functional motifs bearing a maleimide group. As expected, the solubility of functionalized Pd12L24 in common solvents can be greatly improved. Interestingly, concentration&#8208;dependent circular dichroism and aggregation&#8208;induced emission are achieved with chiral binaphthol (BINOL)&#8208; and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;modified Pd12L24, respectively. Furthermore, Pd12L24 can be introduced with two different functional groups (e.g., chiral BINOL and achiral pyrene) through a step&#8208;by&#8208;step PSM route to obtain chirality&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence. Moreover, similar results are readily observed with a smaller Pd2L4 system.

         <title>Microwave Synthesis of Pt Clusters on Black TiO2 with Abundant Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Acidic Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>

Black TiO2 supported sub&#8208;nanometer Pt clusters (Pt/TiO2&#8208;OV) are designed through solvent&#8208;free microwave and subsequent electroless approach. Pt/TiO2&#8208;OV presents remarkable electrocatalytic performance with 18&#8197;mV to achieve 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial Pt/C.







Abstract
Oxygen vacancies&#8208;enriched black TiO2 is one promising support for enhancing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, oxygen vacancies enriched black TiO2 supported sub&#8208;nanometer Pt clusters (Pt/TiO2&#8208;OV) with metal support interactions is designed through solvent&#8208;free microwave and following low&#8208;temperature electroless approach for the first time. High&#8208;temperature and strong reductants are not required and then can avoid the aggregation of decorated Pt species. Experimental and theoretical calculation verify that the created oxygen vacancies and Pt clusters exhibit synergistic effects for optimizing the reaction kinetics. Based on it, Pt/TiO2&#8208;OV presents remarkable electrocatalytic performance with 18&#8197;mV to achieve 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 coupled with small Tafel slope of 12&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. This work provides quick synthetic strategy for preparing black titanium dioxide based nanomaterials.

         <title>A Pair of Interconverting Cages Formed from Achiral Precursors Spontaneously Resolve into Homochiral Conformers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from achiral precursors homochirality can be achieved by first forming a pair of enantiomers without inversion center or mirror image (mathematical criterium), followed by their narcissistic self&#8208;sorting driven by multivalent intermolecular interactions that follow the helical trajectory of screw symmetry of the resulting enantiopure crystals (chemical criterium).







Abstract
Without chiral induction the emergence of homochirality from achiral molecules is rather serendipitous, as the rationale is somewhat ambiguous. We herein provide a plausible solution. From achiral precursors are formed a pair of interconverting cage conformers that exhibit a C3&#8208;axis as the only symmetry element. When their interconversion is impeded with intramolecular H&#8208;bonding, each conformer self&#8208;sorts into a homochiral crystal, which is driven by a helical network of multivalent intermolecular interactions during the self&#8208;assembly of homochiral cage conformers. As no chiral induction is involved throughout, we believe our study could enlighten the rational design for the emergence of homochirality with several criteria: 1) formation of a molecule without inversion center or mirror plane; 2) suppression of the enantiomeric interconversion, and introduction of multivalent interactions along the helical trajectory of screw symmetry within the resulting superstructure.

         <title>Supramolecular Shish Kebabs: Higher Order Dimeric Structures from Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Rings Complexes with Conformational Adaptivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple 2D H&#8208;bonded macrocycles are threaded onto a box&#8208;like cationic cyclophane, which further assembles into higher order dimeric shish&#8208;kebab&#8208;like structures. Such ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) superstructures maximize their stability through the conformational adaptivity of both host and guest.







Abstract
Use of abiotic chemical systems for understanding higher order superstructures is challenging. Here we report a ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) system comprising a hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycle and cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;o&#8208;phenylene) tetracation (o&#8208;Box) or cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) tetracation (CBPQT4+, p&#8208;Box) that assembles to construct discrete higher order structures with adaptive conformation. As indicated by mass spectrometry, computational modeling, NMR spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, this ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) system features the box&#8208;directed aggregation of multiple macrocycles, leading to generation of several stable species such as H4G (1&#8201;a/o&#8208;Box) and H5G (1&#8201;a/o&#8208;Box). Remarkably, a dimeric shish&#8208;kebab&#8208;like ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings superstructure H7G2 (1&#8201;a/o&#8208;Box) or H8G2 (1&#8201;a/p&#8208;Box) is formed from the coaxial stacking of two ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings units. The formation of such unique dimeric superstructures is attributed to the large &#960;&#8208;surface of this 2D planar macrocycle and the conformational variation of both host and guest.

         <title>Synthesis and Post&#8208;Processing of Chemically Homogeneous Nanothreads from 2,5&#8208;Furandicarboxylic Acid
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of ordered, functionalized carbon nanothreads remains a challenge. Herein we report the scalable solid&#8208;state polymerization of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid. The resulting nanothread is functionalized with a high density of pendant carboxyl groups, enabling new opportunities for post&#8208;synthetic modification. Several 3d metals are demonstrated to bind to the backbone, opening the door to the use of nanothreads in advanced applications.







Abstract
Compared with conventional, solution&#8208;phase approaches, solid&#8208;state reaction methods can provide unique access to novel synthetic targets. Nanothreads&#8212;one&#8208;dimensional diamondoid polymers formed through the compression of small molecules&#8212;represent a new class of materials produced via solid&#8208;state reactions, however, the formation of chemically homogeneous products with targeted functionalization represents a persistent challenge. Through careful consideration of molecular precursor stacking geometry and functionalization, we report here the scalable synthesis of chemically homogeneous, functionalized nanothreads through the solid&#8208;state polymerization of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid. The resulting product possesses high&#8208;density, pendant carboxyl functionalization along both sides of the backbone, enabling new opportunities for the post&#8208;synthetic processing and chemical modification of nanothread materials applicable to a broad range of potential applications.

The resulting nanothread is functionalized with a high density of pendant carboxyl groups, enabling new opportunities for post-synthetic modification. Several 3d metals are demonstrated to bind to the backbone, opening the door to the use of nanothreads in advanced applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with conventional, solution-phase approaches, solid-state reaction methods can provide unique access to novel synthetic targets. Nanothreads&#8212;one-dimensional diamondoid polymers formed through the compression of small molecules&#8212;represent a new class of materials produced via solid-state reactions, however, the formation of chemically homogeneous products with targeted functionalization represents a persistent challenge. Through careful consideration of molecular precursor stacking geometry and functionalization, we report here the scalable synthesis of chemically homogeneous, functionalized nanothreads through the solid-state polymerization of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid. The resulting product possesses high-density, pendant carboxyl functionalization along both sides of the backbone, enabling new opportunities for the post-synthetic processing and chemical modification of nanothread materials applicable to a broad range of potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Supramolecular A8Bn Miktoarm Star Copolymers by Host&#8208;Guest Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular A8Bn (n=1, 2, 4) miktoarm star copolymers have been fabricated by host&#8211;guest complexation between a resorcinarene&#8208;based coordination capsule possessing eight polystyrene chains and 4,4&#8208;diacetoxy biphenyl guest molecules with one, two, or four polymethyl acrylate chains. The stability of the A8B1, A8B2, and A8B4 miktoarm polymers was influenced by the number of polymethyl acrylate chains in the guest polymers.







Abstract
We report a new synthetic method to construct supramolecular A8Bn (n=1, 2, 4) miktoarm star copolymers by host&#8208;guest complexation between a resorcinarene&#8208;based coordination capsule possessing eight polystyrene chains and 4,4&#8208;diacetoxybiphenyl guest molecules that retain one, two or four polymethyl acrylate chains. The formation of the supramolecular A8Bn (n=1, 2, 4) miktoarm star copolymers was confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS), size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (SEC), and diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements revealed that the miktoarm copolymers were phase&#8208;separated in the bulk. The micro&#8208;Brownian motion of the A8B4 structure was markedly enhanced in the bulk due to a weak segregation interaction between the immiscible arms.

         <title>Thermally Activated Long Persistent Luminescence of Organic Inorganic Metal Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional afterglow of organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) is mostly attributed to the ultra&#8208;long phosphorescence. A new type of OIMH is demonstrated with long persistent luminescence (LPL) caused by the charge separation state. The stable LPL process is thermally activated and can be excited by low power standard LED light sources, offering potential in fire safety, information encryption, biological imaging and other fields.







Abstract
Long persistent luminescence (LPL) materials of SrAl2O4 doped with Eu2+ or Dy3+ can maintain emission over hours after ceasing the excitation but suffer from insolubility, high cost, and harsh preparation. Recently, organic LPL of guest&#8208;host exciplex systems has been demonstrated via an intermediate charge&#8208;separated state with flexible design but poor air&#8208;stability. Here, we synthesized a nontoxic two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic metal hybrid halides (OIMHs), called PBA2[ZnX4] with X=Br or Cl and PBA=4&#8208;phenylbenzylamine. These materials exhibit stable LPL emission over minutes at room&#8208;temperature, which is two orders of magnitude longer than those of previously reported OIMHs. The mechanism study shows that the LPL emission comes from thermally activated charge separation state rather than room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Moreover, the LPL of PBA2[ZnX4] can be excited by low power sources, representing an effective strategy for developing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;stability LPL systems.

         <title>The COVID19&#8208;NMR Consortium: A Public Report on the Impact of this New Global Collaboration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Viewpoint Article discusses how the global NMR community organized itself to rapidly contribute to combat SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. This new collaborative research might serve as model for future ways to address great societal needs, without competing with curiosity&#8208;driven research.







Abstract
The outbreak of COVID&#8208;19 in December 2019 required the formation of international consortia for a coordinated scientific effort to understand and combat the virus. In this Viewpoint Article, we discuss how the NMR community has gathered to investigate the genome and proteome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and tested them for binding to low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight binders. External factors including extended lockdowns due to the global pandemic character of the viral infection triggered the transition from locally focused collaborative research conducted within individual research groups to digital exchange formats for immediate discussion of unpublished results and data analysis, sample sharing, and coordinated research between more than 50 groups from 18 countries simultaneously. We discuss key lessons that might pertain after the end of the pandemic and challenges that we need to address.

         <title>Inside Cover: Synthesis of Supramolecular A8Bn Miktoarm Star Copolymers by Host&#8208;Guest Complexation (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 14/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular A8Bn miktoarm star copolymers were fabricated by host&#8211;guest complexation between a cavitand&#8208;based coordination capsule possessing eight polystyrene arms and biphenyl guest molecules with one, two, or four polymethyl acrylate arms, as reported by Takeharu Haino and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202219001).

         <title>Back Cover: Enzymatic Electrosynthesis of Glycine from CO2 and NH3 (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 14/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic electrocatalytic system was developed that allows the simultaneous conversion of CO2 and NH3 for glycine synthesis, as reported by Zhiguang Zhu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202218387). This system was inspired by the reductive glycine pathway in&#8197;vivo and is based on an in&#8197;vitro multienzymatic cascade reaction, representing a novel alternative for enzymatic CO2 electroreduction for synthesizing nitrogenous value&#8208;added chemicals.

Structural switching of [3]catenane was induced by fitting the puzzle pieces. In their Research Article (202217002), Jun Terao et&#8197;al. report a method for ligand&#8208;controlled structural switching of [3]catenane, which was realized by the complexation of metal ions on [3]catenane with added complementarily fitted organic ligands, like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. The high tailorability of organic ligands offers multiple pieces with various sizes and numbers of coordination sites, enabling multistate structural switching of [3]catenane.

Carboranes. B9&#8208;functionalized carboranylphosphines with bulky electron&#8208;donating substituents display an extremely electron&#8208;releasing character, as reported by Evamarie Hey&#8208;Hawkins et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202218648). The compounds exert a high steric demand, which allows the mesityl derivatives to form stabilized phosphoniumyl radical cations.

A covalent organic framework (COF) anode with acid&#8211;alkaline co&#8208;tolerance, long cycle life, and high rate performance was developed for aqueous batteries. In their Research Article (e202218745), Haiyan Zhang, Chunyi Zhi, Haiming Lv et&#8197;al. designed the robust covalent linkage (&#8208;NH&#8208;) and the hydrogen bond network between &#8208;NH&#8208; and H2O, which collectively improve the chemical stability and promote the rapid conduction of H+/OH&#8722; by the Grotthuss mechanism. Thus the COF displays superior stability and rate performance.

         <title>Active Separation of Water Isotopologues by Local Molecular Motion in Microporous Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a recent study, Su et al. demonstrated the creation of dynamic pore windows in a porous coordination polymer based on ligand flipping. Adsorption experiments show that the dynamic pore windows favor kinetic adsorption of H2O over D2O for unprecedented water isotopologue separation selectivity.







Abstract
Around 10&#8211;15&#8201;% of the world's energy consumption is accounted for by the separation and purification of chemicals. Among them is the enrichment and separation of isotopologues which are an essential aspect of modern chemistry. In their recent work, Su et&#8197;al. demonstrate the separation of water isotopologues by responsive dynamic pore windows in a microporous coordination polymer with unprecedented selectivity based on an elegant mechanism.

&lt;p&gt;In a recent study, Su et al. demonstrated the creation of dynamic pore windows in a porous coordination polymer based on ligand flipping. Adsorption experiments show that the dynamic pore windows favor kinetic adsorption of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O over D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O for unprecedented water isotopologue separation selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 10&#8211;15&#8201;% of the world's energy consumption is accounted for by the separation and purification of chemicals. Among them is the enrichment and separation of isotopologues which are an essential aspect of modern chemistry. In their recent work, Su &lt;i&gt;et&#8197;al&lt;/i&gt;. demonstrate the separation of water isotopologues by responsive dynamic pore windows in a microporous coordination polymer with unprecedented selectivity based on an elegant mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrochemical catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in acidic media is reviewed, with a focus on the mechanistic understanding of the active sites, elucidation of the structure&#8208;property relationships, the strategic improvement of the catalytic activity/durability, their applications in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, along with current challenges and future perspectives.







Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is vital for clean and renewable energy technologies, which require no fossil fuel but catalysts. Platinum (Pt) is the best&#8208;known catalyst for ORR. However, its high cost and scarcity have severely hindered renewable energy devices (e.g., fuel cells) for large&#8208;scale applications. Recent breakthroughs in carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrochemical catalysts (C&#8208;MFECs) show great potential for earth&#8208;abundant carbon materials as low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts towards ORR in acidic media. This article provides a focused, but critical review on C&#8208;MFECs for ORR in acidic media with an emphasis on advances in the structure design and synthesis, fundamental understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship and electrocatalytic mechanisms, and their applications in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Current challenges and future perspectives in this emerging field are also discussed.

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Crystalline Supramolecular Assemblies Built with Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the advancements in the field of macrocycle&#8208;based crystalline charge&#8208;transfer assemblies, including their preparation, structures, and diverse supramolecular functions and applications, such as vapochromic behavior and supramolecular tessellations, arising from the CT state. Future perspectives and challenges of this emerging research field are also presented.







Abstract
Synthetic macrocycles have served as principal tools for supramolecular chemistry, have greatly extended the scope of organic charge transfer (CT) complexes, and have proved to be of great practical value in the solid state during the past few years. In this Minireview, we summarize the research progress on the macrocycle&#8208;based crystalline supramolecular assemblies primarily driven by intermolecular CT interactions (a.k.a. macrocycle&#8208;based crystalline CT assemblies, MCCAs for short), which are classified by their donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) constituent elements, including simplex macrocyclic hosts, heterogeneous macrocyclic hosts, and host&#8211;guest D&#8208;A pairs. Particular attention will be focused on their diverse functions and applications, as well as the underlying CT mechanisms from the perspective of crystal engineering. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects are outlined.

         <title>Beyond Microporosity in Porous Organic Molecular Materials (POMMs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The level of porosity beyond the microporous regime in Porous Organic Molecular Materials (POMMs) will trigger a shift in porous materials, rendering fascinating and unique opportunities in many applications. In this minireview, we summarize the recent advances in the synthesis of meso&#8208; and/or macroporous and hierarchical POMMs, highlighting some of their current applications.







Abstract
Porous organic molecular materials (POMMs) are a novel class of porous materials that cover a wide range of organic&#8208;based molecular building blocks connected through weak supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. Despite of their diverse chemical and structural nature, common features to POMMs include solution processability, crystallinity and microporosity. Herein, we focus, for the first time, on the advance of the field of POMMs beyond the archetypical microporosity. In particular, we highlight relevant examples of meso&#8208; and macroporous POMMs, as well as hierchachical ones (micro&#8208;/meso&#8208;, micro&#8208;/macro&#8208; and meso&#8208;/macroporous). We also remark some of their unique properties, and how they can be key in many applications.

         <title>Third&#8208;Generation Sequencing of Epigenetic DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Third&#8208;generation sequencing platforms provide fast, convenient, and often inexpensive means of DNA sequencing; however, direct detection of epigenetic bases is yet to be routinely achieved. Here, derivatisation and labelling techniques that enable profiling of cytosine modifications on these platforms are reviewed.







Abstract
The discovery of epigenetic bases has revolutionised the understanding of disease and development. Among the most studied epigenetic marks are cytosines covalently modified at the 5 position. In order to gain insight into their biological significance, the ability to determine their spatiotemporal distribution within the genome is essential. Techniques for sequencing on &#8220;next&#8208;generation&#8221; platforms often involve harsh chemical treatments leading to sample degradation. Third&#8208;generation sequencing promises to further revolutionise the field by providing long reads, enabling coverage of highly repetitive regions of the genome or structural variants considered unmappable by next generation sequencing technology. While the ability of third&#8208;generation platforms to directly detect epigenetic modifications is continuously improving, at present chemical or enzymatic derivatisation presents the most convenient means of enhancing reliability. This Review presents techniques available for the detection of cytosine modifications on third&#8208;generation platforms.

         <title>Simple Ether&#8208;Directed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Borylation of Cyclopropanes Enabled by Iridium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple ether&#8208;directed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of cyclopropanes was accomplished by CBL/iridium catalysis for the first time. The reported method features tolerance of a broad range of functional groups (38 examples), excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee), and high turnover numbers (up to 335).







Abstract
Reported here is an efficient and simple ether&#8208;directed iridium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of cyclopropanes. Various functional groups were well&#8208;tolerated, affording a vast array of chiral cyclopropanes with high enantioselectivities. We also demonstrated that the turnover numbers of the current reaction could be up to 335.

         <title>Mechanism of Cations Suppressing Proton Diffusion Kinetics for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accumulating K+ cations break the water network connectivity, and confine protons in the cation hydration shell, thus slowing the proton diffusion kinetics.







Abstract
Proton transfer is crucial for electrocatalysis. Accumulating cations at electrochemical interfaces can alter the proton transfer rate and then tune electrocatalytic performance. However, the mechanism for regulating proton transfer remains ambiguous. Here, we quantify the cation effect on proton diffusion in solution by hydrogen evolution on microelectrodes, revealing the rate can be suppressed by more than 10 times. Different from the prevalent opinions that proton transport is slowed down by modified electric field, we found water structure imposes a more evident effect on kinetics. FTIR test and path integral molecular dynamics simulation indicate that proton prefers to wander within the hydration shell of cations rather than to hop rapidly along water wires. Low connectivity of water networks disrupted by cations corrupts the fast&#8208;moving path in bulk water. This study highlights the promising way for regulating proton kinetics via a modified water structure.

         <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Benzylamine Derivatives: Synthesis of a Precursor to Levocetirizine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deprotonation of N&#8242;&#8208;aryl urea derivatives with a chiral lithium amide base leads to an enantioselective C&#8208;arylation of benzylamines. An unusual stereoretentive substitution reaction followed by N&#8208;deprotection of the urea forms diarylmethylamine derivatives, including a synthetic intermediate en route to the drug levocetirizine.







Abstract
A practical, transition metal&#8208;free method allows the enantioselective synthesis of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diarylmethylamines by asymmetric &#945;&#8208;arylation of benzylamines. Enantioselective lithiation of N&#8242;&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;N&#8208;isopropyl ureas using a chiral lithium amide base generates a benzyllithium that undergoes an unactivated stereospecific intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution to generate an &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diarylmethylamine in the form of its urea derivative, in up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee. Treatment with acid induces an &#8220;azatropic shift&#8221; with retention of configuration, the product of which may be hydrolysed to the target amine.

         <title>Carboxylic Acid Salts as Dual&#8208;Function Reagents for Carboxylation and Carbon Isotope Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potassium salt of triphenylacetic acid is developed as a combined source of CO2 and base/metalating agent. This method avoids specialized equipment and is used in the carboxylation of a range of compound classes. This provides a mechanistically distinct approach to carboxylation that has also been applied in carbon isotope labeling.







Abstract
The potassium salts of carboxylic acids are developed as efficient carboxylating agents through CO2 exchange. We describe these carboxylates as dual&#8208;function reagents because they function as a combined source of CO2 and base/metalating agent. By using the salt of a commercially available carboxylic acid, this protocol overcomes difficulties when using CO2 gas or organometallic reagents, such as pressurized containers or strictly inert conditions. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, does not require transition metals or other additives, and shows broad substrate scope. Through the preparation of several biologically important molecules, we show how this strategy provides an opportunity for isotope labeling with low equivalents of labeled CO2.

         <title>Spiroborate&#8208;Based Host Materials with High Triplet Energies and Ambipolar Charge&#8208;Transport Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
Highly efficient spiroborate&#8208;based host materials are developed for use in blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The C,N&#8208;chelate spiroborate skeleton embedding O and N atoms effectively suppresses charge trapping and achieves a maximum EQE of 27.6&#8201;% with narrowband deep blue emission.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) receive considerable attention because of their commercial use in flat panel displays. Herein, highly efficient spiroborate&#8208;based host materials are reported for use in blue OLEDs. Our designed spiroborates (SBOX) were simple to synthesize and exhibited high triplet excitation energies, narrow S&#8208;T gaps, and balanced charge carrier mobilities. A blue OLED containing one of the designed spiroborates, SBON, as a host exhibited a high external quantum efficiency (27.6&#8201;%) and low turn&#8208;on voltage (3.7&#8197;V) compared to those observed using 3,3&#8242;&#8208;di(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl (17.6&#8201;% and 4.5&#8197;V, respectively), indicating their potential as host materials in OLEDs.

         <title>Development of a Non&#8208;Directed Petasis&#8208;Type Reaction by an Aromaticity&#8208;Disrupting Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Petasis&#8208;type coupling of &#945;&#8208;hydroxyindoles and trifluoroborate salts was accomplished. The combination of an aromaticity&#8208;disrupting iminium ion and preactivated trifluoroborate salts allowed for novel non&#8208;directed reactivity. The reaction's utility as a method for modifying complex molecules was featured with the facile preparation of dimers from bioactive molecule&#8208;derived monomers.







Abstract
The Petasis&#8208;type reaction, which couples an imine and boronic acid, is an important tool for C&#8722;C bond formation in organic synthesis. However, the generality of this transformation has been limited by the requirement for a directing heteroatom to enable reactivity. Herein, we report the development of a non&#8208;directed Petasis&#8208;type reaction that allows for the coupling of trifluoroborate salts with &#945;&#8208;hydroxyindoles. By disrupting aromaticity to generate a reactive iminium ion, in conjunction with using trifluoroborate nucleophiles, the method generates a new C&#8722;C bond without the need for a directing group. This reaction is operationally simple, providing &#945;&#8208;functionalized indoles in up to 99&#8201;% yield using sp, sp2, and sp3&#8208;hybridized trifluoroborate nucleophiles. Finally, this reaction is applied as a novel bioconjugation strategy to link biologically active molecules and toward the convergent synthesis of non&#8208;natural heterodimeric bisindole alkaloid analogs.

         <title>Akaike's Information Criterion for Stoichiometry Inference of Supramolecular Complexes</title>

An information&#8208;theoretic approach of Akaike's information criterion is introduced to infer the stoichiometry of host&#8211;guest complexes with weight of evidence for ranking. AIC may provide a versatile and superior method in place of the Job plot.







Abstract
&#8220;How do we decide the stoichiometry of host&#8211;guest complexes?&#8221; This question has long been answered by the Job plot since its first report in 1928. However, as the Job plot was claimed to be misleading in 2016, the question became an open question again and called for renewed investigations. An information&#8208;theoretic approach, called Akaike's information criterion, is introduced in this study to select the best model of host&#8211;guest complexes, which can rank the models with weight of evidence. A few test cases with unique cylindrical hosts were examined to demonstrate the applicability of the information&#8208;theoretic method. Consequently, reasonable views over the thermodynamic behaviors of dumbbell&#8208;and&#8208;cylinder complexes were obtained. Akaike's information criterion can be a useful and superior alternative to statistical null hypothesis testing, which was proposed as a remedy in place of the Job plot.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;free Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Module Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergence of the multi&#8208;module concept and solvent&#8208;free synthesis method has led to the synthesis of super&#8208;stable MOFs by a route free from additive, modulator, solvent, or activation. These MOFs combine the advantages of structural complexity and green chemistry and show good C2H2/CO2 separation performance.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;module design of framework materials with multiple distinct building blocks has attracted much attention because such materials are more amenable to compositional and geometrical tuning and thus offer more opportunities for property optimization. Few examples are known that use environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective solvent&#8208;free method to synthesize such materials. Here, we report the use of solvent&#8208;free method (also modulator&#8208;free) to synthesize a series of multi&#8208;module MOFs with high stability and separation property for C2H2/CO2. The synthesis only requires simple mixing of reactants and short reaction time (2&#8197;h). Highly porous and stable materials can be made without any post&#8208;synthetic activation. The success of solvent&#8208;free synthesis of multi&#8208;module MOFs reflects the synergy between different modules, resulting in stable pore&#8208;partitioned materials, despite the fact that other competitive crystallization pathways with simpler framework compositions also exist.

         <title>A Transformable and Bulky Methacrylate Monomer That Enables the Synthesis of an MMA&#8208;nBA Alternating Copolymer: Sequence&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Healing Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bulky and transformable methacrylate monomer was designed for the synthesis of a methyl methacrylate (MMA)&#8208;n&#8208;butyl acrylate (nBA) alternating copolymer. The keys to this achievement are the introduction of the adamantyl group to suppress homopolymerization of the MMA monomer and the transesterification for the selective and quantitative transformation into methyl ester pendants. The alternating copolymer exhibited superior self&#8208;healing properties compared to the statistical copolymer.







Abstract
In this study, we designed a methacrylate molecule with an alkyl&#8208;substituted trichloro salicylic acid pendant as a transformable bulky monomer to enable the synthesis of an alternating copolymer of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and n&#8208;butyl acrylate (nBA). The adamantyl&#8208;substituted methacrylate monomer (1&#8208;Ad) showed very low homopolymerization propensity in radical polymerizations, but afforded the alternating copolymer with nBA via copolymerization. The 1&#8208;Ad units in the resultant copolymer were quantitatively and selectively transformed into MMA via transesterification with methanol to yield the alternating copolymer of MMA and nBA. Its alternating sequence was clearly demonstrated by a structural analysis via 13C NMR spectroscopy as well as the low reactivity ratios for the 1&#8208;Ad and nBA pair. Finally, we verified the superior self&#8208;healing ability of the alternating copolymer compared to that of the corresponding 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 statistical copolymer.

         <title>Synthesis of Bioctacene&#8208;Incorporated Nanographene with Near&#8208;Infrared Chiroptical Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
Hexabenzoperihexacene (HBPH) with two incorporated octacene moieties has been synthesized. The two enantiomers of HPPH showed circular dichroism in the visible to NIR regions as well as an emission maximum at 798&#8197;nm with an absolute PLQY of 41&#8201;%. Analysis of the excited&#8208;state photophysical properties revealed an intriguing feature that was attributed to the rotational and/or conformational dynamics of HBPH after excitation.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a hexabenzoperihexacene (HBPH) with two incorporated octacene substructures, which was unambiguously characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The theoretical isomerization barrier of the (P,P)&#8208;/(P,M)&#8208;forms was estimated to be 38.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, and resolution was achieved by chiral HPLC. Notably, the enantiomers exhibited opposite circular dichroism responses up to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (830&#8197;nm) with a high gabs value of 0.017 at 616&#8197;nm. Moreover, HBPH demonstrated NIR emission with a maximum at 798&#8197;nm and an absolute PLQY of 41&#8201;%. The excited&#8208;state photophysical properties of HBPH were investigated by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, revealing an intriguing feature that was attributed to the rotational and/or conformational dynamics of HBPH after excitation. These results provide new insight into the design of chiral nanographene with NIR optical properties for potential chiroptical applications.

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for the 2e&#8722; Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 14, March 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction by a 2e&#8722; pathway has been achieved using two one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The imine linkages led to higher activity and selectivity than two&#8208;dimensional COFs, without the need to introduce other heteroatoms.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are often employed for electrocatalytic systems because of their structural diversity. However, the efficiency of atom utilization is still in need of improvement, because the catalytic centers are located in the basal layers and it is difficult for the electrolytes to access them. Herein, we demonstrate the use of 1D COFs for the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The use of different four&#8208;connectivity blocks resulted in the prepared 1D COFs displaying good crystallinity, high surface areas, and excellent chemical stability. The more exposed catalytic sites resulted in the 1D COFs showing large electrochemically active surface areas, 4.8&#8208;fold of that of a control 2D COF, and thus enabled catalysis of the ORR with a higher H2O2 selectivity of 85.8&#8201;% and activity, with a TOF value of 0.051&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;V, than a 2D COF (72.9&#8201;% and 0.032&#8197;s&#8722;1). This work paves the way for the development of COFs with low dimensions for electrocatalysis.

The more exposed catalytic sites resulted in the 1D COFs showing large electrochemically active surface areas, 4.8-fold of that of a control 2D COF, and thus enabled catalysis of the ORR with a higher H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 85.8&#8201;% and activity, with a TOF value of 0.051&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;V, than a 2D COF (72.9&#8201;% and 0.032&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work paves the way for the development of COFs with low dimensions for electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Artificial In Vitro Metabolism to Angiopterlactone B Inspired by Traditional Retrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature's way to construct highly complex molecular entities as part of biosynthetic pathways is unmatched by any chemical synthesis. Yet, relying on a cascade of native enzymatic transformations to achieve a certain target structure, biosynthesis is also significantly limited in its scope. In this work, non&#8208;natural biocatalytic modules, a peroxidase&#8208;mediated Achmatowicz rearrangement and a dehydrogenase&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen&#8208;type isomerization, are successfully implemented into an artificial metabolism, combining the benefits of traditional retrosynthesis with the elegance and efficacy of biosynthetic networks. In a highly streamlined process, the total synthesis of the tricyclic angiopterlactone B is achieved in two steps operating entirely in an aqueous environment while relying mainly on enzymes as key reaction mediators.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Optimization of Photochemical Reactions using Segmented&#8208;Flow Nanoelectrospray&#8208;Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within the realm of drug discovery, high&#8208;throughput experimentation techniques enable the rapid optimization of reactions and expedited generation of drug compound libraries for biological and pharmacokinetic evaluation.&#160; Herein we report the development of a segmented flow mass spectrometry&#8208;based platform to enable the rapid exploration of photoredox reactions for early&#8208;stage drug discovery.&#160; Specifically, microwell plate&#8208;based photochemical reaction screens were reformatted to segmented flow format to enable delivery to nanoelectrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry analysis. This approach was demonstrated for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex drug scaffolds, as well as the subsequent structure&#8208;activity relationship evaluation of synthesized analogs. This technology is anticipated to expand the robust capabilities of photoredox catalysis in drug discovery by enabling high&#8208;throughput library diversification.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing the Structure and Dynamics of the Squalene&#8208;Hopene Cyclase for (&#8208;)&#8208;Ambroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpene cyclases offer enormous synthetic potential, given their unique ability to forge complex hydrocarbon scaffolds from achiral precursors within a single cationic rearrangement cascade. Harnessing their synthetic power, however, proved to be challenging due to their generally low catalytic performance. In this study, we unveil the catalytic potential of the squalene&#8208;hopene cyclase (SHC) by harnessing its structure and dynamics. First, we synergistically tailored the enzyme&#8217;s active site and entrance tunnel to generate a 397&#8208;fold improved (&#8209;)&#8209;ambroxide synthase. Our computational investigations explain how the introduced mutations work in concert to improve substrate acquisition, flow, and chaperoning. Kinetics, however, disclosed a terpene&#8208;induced inactivation of the membrane&#8208;bound SHC as the major turnover limitation&#160;in vivo. Merging these insights with the improved and stereoselective catalysis of the enzyme, we applied a feeding strategy to exceed 105&#160;total turnovers. We believe that our results may bridge the gap for broader application of SHCs in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Inspired by Game Theory: Glutathione&#8208;induced in Situ Michael Addition between Nanoparticles for Pyroptosis and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As its complexity and genetic instability, most tumor treatments will fail when ignoring competition and cooperation between each cancer cell and its microenvironment. Inspired by game theory, therapeutic agents can be introduced to compete for intracellular molecules to disrupt the cooperation between molecules and cells. Here, we prepare biomineralized oxidized (&#8722;)&#8208;epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;o&#8208;gallate (EGCG)&#8208;molybdenum ion coordination nanoparticles for disrupting redox equilibrium and simultaneously reacting with intracellular GSH via Michael addition to form large aggregations that can mechanically disrupt endosomal and plasma membrane, stimulating pyroptosis and anti&#8208;tumor immunological responses for versatile inhibition of different types of tumors. This design disrupts the cooperation between molecules and between cancer and immune cells, gaining optimal payoff in competition and cooperation in cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalisation of Graphene Sensor Surfaces for the Specific Detection of Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a controllable and specific functionalisation route for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (GFETs) for the recognition of small physiologically active molecules. Key element is the noncovalent functionalisation of the graphene surface with perylene bisimide (PBI) molecules directly on the growth substrate. This Functional Layer Transfer enables the homogeneous self&#8208;assembly of PBI molecules on graphene, onto which antibodies are subsequently immobilised. The sensor surface was characterised by atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and electrical measurements, showing superior performance over conventional functionalisation after transfer. Specific sensing of small molecules was realised by monitoring the electrical property changes of functionalised GFET devices upon the application of methamphetamine and cortisol. The concentration dependent electrical response of our sensors was determined down to a concentration of 300 ng/ml for methamphetamine.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Enhanced O&#8208;H Cleavage in Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the vital role of spin polarization in proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated water oxidation over a magnetized catalyst. During the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over ferrimagnetic Fe3O4, the external magnetic field induced a remarkable increase in the OER current, however, this increment achieved in weakly alkaline pH (pH 9) was almost 20 times that under strongly alkaline conditions (pH 14). The results of the surface modification experiment and H/D kinetic isotope effect investigation confirm that, at weakly alkaline pH, during the nucleophilic attack of FeIV=O by molecular water, the magnetized Fe3O4 catalyst polarizes the spin states of the nucleophilic attacking intermediates. The spin&#8208;enhanced singlet O&#8208;H cleavage and triplet O&#8208;O bonding occur synergistically, which promotes the O2 generation more significantly than the strongly alkaline case involving only spin&#8208;enhanced O&#8208;O bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Colorimetric Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au Tip Sensor with a New Functional Nucleic Acid Probe for Food&#8208;borne Pathogen Salmonella typhimurium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An Au&#8208;on&#8208;Au tip sensor is developed for the detection of Salmonella typhimurium (Salmonella), using a new synthetic nucleic acid probe (NAP) as a linker for the immobilization of a DNA&#8208;conjugated Au nanoparticle (AuNP) onto a DNA&#8208;attached thin Au layer inside a pipette tip. In the presence of Salmonella, RNase H2 from Salmonella (STH2) cleaves the NAP and the freed DNA&#8208;conjugated AuNP can be visually detected by a paper strip. This portable biosensor does not require any electronic, electrochemical or optical equipment. It delivers a detection limit of 3.2 &#215; 103 CFU/mL for Salmonella in 1 h without cell&#8208;culturing or signal amplification and does not show cross&#8208;reactivity with several control bacteria. Further, the sensor reliably detects Salmonella spiked in food samples, such as ground beef and chicken, milk, and eggs. The sensor can be reused and is stable at ambient temperature, showing its potential as a point&#8208;of&#8208;need device for the prevention of food poisoning by Salmonella.</dc:description>

         <title>Lipophilicity modulations by fluorination correlate with membrane partitioning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioactive compounds generally need to cross membranes to arrive at their site of action. The octanol&#8208;water partition coefficient (lipophilicity, logPOW) has proven to be an excellent proxy for membrane permeability. In modern drug discovery, logPOW and bioactivity are optimized simultaneously, for which fluorination is one of the relevant strategies. The question arises to which extent the often subtle logP modifications resulting from different aliphatic fluorine&#8208;motif introductions also lead to concomitant membrane permeability changes, given the difference in molecular environment between octanol and (anisotropic) membranes. We find that for a given compound class, there is excellent correlation between logPOW values with the corresponding membrane molar partitioning coefficients (Kp); a study enabled by novel solid state 19F NMR MAS methodology using lipid vesicles. Our results show that the factors that cause modulation of octanol&#8208;water partition coefficients similarly affect membrane permeability.</dc:description>

         <title>Monitoring the Reversibility of GPCR Signaling by Combining Photochromic Ligands with Label&#8208;free Impedance Analysis.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G protein&#8208;coupled cell surface receptors (GPCR) trigger complex intracellular signaling cascades upon agonist binding. Classic pharmacological assays provide information about binding affinities, activation or blockade at different stages of the signaling cascade, but real time dynamics and reversibility of these processes remain often disguised. We show that combining photochromic NPY receptor ligands, which can be toggled in their receptor activation ability by irradiation with light of different wavelengths, with whole cell label&#8208;free impedance assays allows observing the cell response to receptor activation and its reversibility over time. The concept demonstrated on NPY receptors may be well applicable to many other GPCRs providing a deeper insight into the time course of intracellular signaling processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytically Activating and Reducing N2&#160;Molecule by Tuning Activity of Local Hydrogen Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Decarbonizing N2 conversion is particularly challenging, but essential for sustainable development of industry and agriculture. Herein, we achieve electrocatalytic activation/reduction of N2 on X/Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C (X=Pd, Ir and Pt) dual&#8208;atom catalysts under ambient condition. We provide solid experimental evidence that local hydrogen radical (H*) generated on the X site of the X/Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts can participate in the activation/reduction of N2 adsorbed on the Fe site. More importantly, we reveal that the reactivity of X/Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts for N2 activation/reduction can be well adjusted by the activity of H* generated on the X site, i.e., the interaction between the X&#8208;H bond. Specifically, X/Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst with the weakest X&#8208;H bonding exhibits the highest H* activity, which is beneficial to the subsequent cleavage of X&#8208;H bond for N2 hydrogenation. With the most active H*, the Pd/Fe dual&#8208;atom site promotes the turnover frequency of N2 reduction by up to 10 times compared with the pristine Fe site.Decarbonizing N2 conversion is particularly challenging, but essential for sustainable development of industry and agriculture.

         <title>A Physical Organic Approach towards Statistical Modeling of Tetrazole and Azide Decomposition
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrazoles and azides find broad application in pharmaceuticals, chemical biology, and high&#8208;energy materials. In this work multivariant linear regression and classification are leveraged to develop predictive statistical models for their decomposition temperature and impact sensitivity, which are key in evaluating the safety of a given molecule. Furthermore, interpretation of the statistical models provided rich insight into the decomposition mechanisms.







Abstract
Nitrogen atom&#8208;rich heterocycles and organic azides have found extensive use in many sectors of modern chemistry from drug discovery to energetic materials. The prediction and understanding of their energetic properties are thus key to the safe and effective application of these compounds. In this work, we disclose the use of multivariate linear regression modeling for the prediction of the decomposition temperature and impact sensitivity of structurally diverse tetrazoles and organic azides. We report a data&#8208;driven approach for property prediction featuring a collection of quantum mechanical parameters and computational workflows. The statistical models reported herein carry predictive accuracy as well as chemical interpretability. Model validation was successfully accomplished via tetrazole test sets with parameters generated exclusively in silico. Mechanistic analysis of the statistical models indicated distinct divergent pathways of thermal and impact&#8208;initiated decomposition.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen atom-rich heterocycles and organic azides have found extensive use in many sectors of modern chemistry from drug discovery to energetic materials. The prediction and understanding of their energetic properties are thus key to the safe and effective application of these compounds. In this work, we disclose the use of multivariate linear regression modeling for the prediction of the decomposition temperature and impact sensitivity of structurally diverse tetrazoles and organic azides. We report a data-driven approach for property prediction featuring a collection of quantum mechanical parameters and computational workflows. The statistical models reported herein carry predictive accuracy as well as chemical interpretability. Model validation was successfully accomplished via tetrazole test sets with parameters generated exclusively in silico. Mechanistic analysis of the statistical models indicated distinct divergent pathways of thermal and impact-initiated decomposition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical Microtubular Covalent Organic Frameworks Achieved by COF&#8208;to&#8208;COF Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically microtubular covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were achieved by a COF&#8208;to&#8208;COF transformation process, where the C3&#8208;symmetric guanidine units were decomposed into C2&#8208;symmetric hydrazine units. The mixed COFs with hierarchical architectures exhibited much&#8208;improved efficiency and selectivity in catalyzing CO2 reduction with phenylsilane and N&#8208;methylaniline due to enhanced mass transport ability.







Abstract
Pore environment and aggregated structure play a vital role in determining the properties of porous materials, especially regarding the mass transfer. Reticular chemistry imparts covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with well&#8208;aligned micro/mesopores, yet constructing hierarchical architectures remains a great challenge. Herein, we reported a COF&#8208;to&#8208;COF transformation methodology to prepare microtubular COFs. In this process, the C3&#8208;symmetric guanidine units decomposed into C2&#8208;symmetric hydrazine units, leading to the crystal transformation of COFs. Moreover, the aggregated structure and conversion degree varied with the reaction time, where the hollow tubular aggregates composed of mixed COF crystals could be obtained. Such hierarchical architecture leads to enhanced mass transfer properties, as proved by the adsorption measurement and chemical catalytic reactions. This self&#8208;template strategy was successfully applied to another four COFs with different building units.

         <title>Breaking the Size Limitation of Directly&#8208;Synthesized PbS Quantum Dot Inks Toward Efficient Short&#8208;wavelength Infrared Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost, scalable synthesis of short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) PbS quantum dot (QD) inks is realized after an extensive investigation of the reaction kinetics. Based on these PbS SWIR QD inks, SWIR solar cells and photodetector devices are fabricated, demonstrating record&#8208;high efficiency. The direct synthesis of low&#8208;cost and scalable SWIR QD inks may accelerate the industrialization of consumer SWIR technologies.







Abstract
PbS quantum dots (QDs) are promising building blocks for solution&#8208;processed short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) devices. The recently developed direct synthesis of semi&#8208;conductive PbS QD inks has substantially simplified the preparation processing and reduced the material cost, while facing the challenge to synthesize large&#8208;size QDs with absorption covering the SWIR region. Herein, we for the first time realize a low&#8208;cost, scalable synthesis of SWIR PbS QD inks after an extensive investigation of the reaction kinetics. Finally, based on these PbS SWIR QD inks, the solar cell demonstrates a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.44&#8201;% through an 1100&#8197;nm cutoff silicon filter and the photodetector device shows a low dark current density of 2&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V reverse bias with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 70&#8201;% at &#8776;1300&#8197;nm. Our results realize the direct synthesis of low&#8208;cost and scalable SWIR QD inks and may accelerate the industrialization of consumer SWIR technologies.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Vicinal Tetrasubstituted Diamines via Reductive Coupling of Ketimines Templated by Chiral Diborons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines are prepared with high ee values and good to excellent yields via an unprecedented chiral diboron&#8208;templated asymmetric homocoupling of aryl alkyl ketimines. The synthetic value of these chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines is demonstrated by the development of efficient organocatalysts for the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;bromination of aliphatic aldehydes.







Abstract
We herein describe the chiral diboron&#8208;templated asymmetric homocoupling of aryl alkyl ketimines, providing for the first time a series of chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines with excellent ee values and good to high yields. The powerful and efficient diboron&#8208;participated [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is successfully demonstrated by the homocoupling of a variety of ketimines thanks to the rational design and engineering of chiral diborons. Systematic DFT studies suggest that two chiral diborons adopt different conformational assembling strategies to couple the diboron template with ketimine substrates in their tight concerted transition states to ensure the excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic value of chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines is demonstrated by the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;bromination of aliphatic aldehydes by employing a chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamine&#8208;based organocatalyst.

         <title>Heterocyclic Chromophore Amphiphiles and their Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocycles have been introduced into the structure of the model perylene monoimide chromophore amphiphile to afford monomers that undergo supramolecular polymerization in water but have different conductivities. The heterocycles alter the monomeric molecular dipole moments, which impacts the internal order within the polymeric assemblies. The conductivity of the supramolecular polymers formed are seemingly dependent on short&#8208;range interactions.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymerization of &#960;&#8208;conjugated amphiphiles in water is an attractive approach to create functional nanostructures. Here, we report on the synthesis, optoelectronic and electrochemical properties, aqueous supramolecular polymerization, and conductivity of polycyclic aromatic dicarboximide amphiphiles. The chemical structure of the model perylene monoimide amphiphile was modified with heterocycles, essentially substituting one fused benzene ring with thiophene, pyridine or pyrrole rings. All the heterocycle&#8208;containing monomers investigated underwent supramolecular polymerization in water. Large changes to the monomeric molecular dipole moments led to nanostructures with low electrical conductivity due to diminished interactions. Although the substitution of benzene with thiophene did not notably change the monomer dipole moment, it led to crystalline nanoribbons with 20&#8208;fold higher electrical conductivity, due to enhanced dispersion interactions as a result of the presence of sulfur atoms.

         <title>Metastable Hexagonal Phase SnO2 Nanoribbons with Active Edge Sites for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208; ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a promising alternative to the energetically intensive anthraquinone process. However, there remain challenges in designing 2e&#8208; ORR catalysts that meet the application criteria. Here, we successfully adopt a microwave&#8208;assisted mechanochemical&#8208;thermal approach to synthesize hexagonal phase SnO2 (h&#8208;SnO2) nanoribbons with largely exposed edge structures. In 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, the h&#8208;SnO2 catalysts achieve the excellent H2O2 selectivity of 99.99%. Moreover, when employing as the catalyst in flow cell device, they exhibit a high yield of 3885.26 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1. The enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to the special crystal structure and morphology, resulting in abundantly exposed edge active sites to convert O2 to H2O2 as confirmed by density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomatization&#8208;Rearomatization Reaction of Metal&#8208;Polarized Aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;polarized aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methides (aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs) are a unique and efficient handle for azaheterocycle synthesis. Despite great achievements, the potential of these reactive intermediates has not yet been fully exploited, especially the new reaction modes. Herein, we disclosed an unprecedented dearomatization process of metal&#8208;polarized aza&#8208;o&#8208;QMs, affording transient dearomatized spiroaziridine intermediates. Based on this serendipity, we accomplished three sequential dearomatization&#8208;rearomatization reactions of benzimidazolines with aza&#8208;sulfur ylides, enabling the divergent synthesis of bis&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles with high efficiency and flexibility. Moreover, experimental and theoretical studies were performed to explain the proposed mechanisms and observed selectivity. Further cellular evaluation of the dibenzodiazepine products identified a hit compound for new antitumor drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Detachable Porous Organic Polymers Responsive to Light and Heat</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive porous materials have captured much attention due to the on&#8208;demand tunable properties. Most reported stimuli&#8208;responsive porous materials are based on molecule isomerism or host&#8208;guest interaction, and it is highly desired to develop new types based on different responsive mechanism. Herein, inspired by natural cells which have the ability to fuse and divide induced by external stimulation, we report a new type of stimuli&#8208;responsive porous material based on detachment mechanism. A detachable porous organic polymer, namely DT&#8208;POP&#8208;1, is fabricated from the polymerization of anthracene&#8208;containing monomer (AnMon) when irradiated by 365 nm UV light. DT&#8208;POP&#8208;1 can detach into the monomer AnMon when irradiated with 275 nm UV light or heat. Such polymerization/detachment is reversible. The detachment results in a big difference in porosity and adsorption capacity, making the present detachable porous polymer highly promising in adsorptive separation and drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel(II) Nitrate Hole&#8208;Transporting Layers for Single&#8208;Junction Bulk Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells with a Record 19.02% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile strategy was developed here to improve the film quality of nickel&#8208;based hole transporting layer (HTL) for efficient organic solar cell (OSC) applications. To prevent the agglomeration of Ni(NO3)2 during film deposition, acetylacetonate was added into the precursor solution, which led to the formation of an amorphous and glass&#8208;like state. After thermal annealing (TA) treatment, the film&#8208;forming ability could be further improved. The additional UV&#8208;ozone (UVO) treatment continuously improved the film quality and increased the work function and conductivity of such HTL. The resulting TA &amp; UVO modified Ni(NO3)2 &amp; Hacac HTL produced highly efficient organic solar cells with exciting power conversion efficiencies of 18.42% and 19.02% for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 and D18:BTP&#8208;Th devices, respectively, much higher than the control PEDOT:PSS devices.</dc:description>

         <title>X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Triggered Carbon Monoxide and Manganese Dioxide Generation based on Scintillating Nanoparticles for Cascade Cancer Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous signaling molecule with broad therapeutic effects. Here, a multifunctional X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered carbon monoxide (CO) and manganese dioxide (MnO2) generation nanoplatform based on metal carbonyl and scintillating nanoparticles (SCNPs) is reported. Attributed to the radioluminescent characteristic of SCNPs, UV&#8208;responsive Mn2(CO)10 is not only indirectly activated to release CO by X&#8208;ray but can also be degraded into MnO2. A high dose of CO can be used as a glycolytic inhibitor for tumor suppression; it will also sensitize tumor cells to radiotherapy. Meanwhile MnO2, as the photolytic byproduct of Mn2(CO)10, has both glutathione (GSH) depletion and Fenton&#8208;like Mn2+ delivery properties to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) in tumors. Thus, this strategy can realize X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated CO release, GSH depletion, and &#8226;OH generation for cascade cancer radiosensitization. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated Mn2+in vivo demonstrates an MRI contrast effect, making it a potential theranostic nanoplatform.</dc:description>

         <title>Amphibian&#8208;like Flexible Organic Crystal Optical Fibers for Underwater/Air Micro&#8208;Precision Lighting and Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible organic optical waveguides are good candidates for air/underwater dual&#8208;media compatible optical signal transduction. The passive signal transportation in an organic flexible waveguide was effectively channelized for high&#8208;precision nano/micro particle sensing in ambient/aquatic conditions.







Abstract
Visible light guiding optical fibers with underwater operational capability are highly desired for subaquatic communication and sensing technologies. Herein, we present mechanically flexible, blue&#8208;violet fluorescent (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;di(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)biphenyl) (BPP) crystal waveguides with high&#8208;aspect ratio. These milli&#8208;meter&#8208;long BPP crystals guide light actively and passively in ambient and underwater conditions demonstrating their amphibian&#8208;like character. Due to the crystal's high flexibility, the optical fiber's output light direction in submerged and ambient states can be altered mechanically for high&#8208;precision lighting and sensing applications. The development of such multi&#8208;environment&#8208;compatible and mechanically flexible organic optical fibers acting as sensing materials possess enormous potential for short&#8208;range underwater photonic technologies.

         <title>Highly Strong and Tough Supramolecular Polymer Networks Enabled by Cryptand&#8208;Based Host&#8722;Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) demonstrate great potential in the development of smart materials owing to their attractive dynamic properties. However, suffering from the inherent weak bonding of most noncovalent cross&#8208;links, it remains a significant challenge to construct SPNs with outstanding mechanical performance. Herein, we exploit the cryptand/paraquat&#8208;guest recognition motifs as cross&#8208;links to prepare a class of highly strong and tough SPNs. Unlike those supramolecular cross&#8208;links with relatively weak binding abilities, the cryptand&#8208;based host&#8208;guest interactions have a high association constant and steady complexing structure, which effectively stabilizes the network and resists mechanical deformation under external force. Such favorable structural stability endows our SPNs with greatly enhanced mechanical performance, compared with the control&#8208;1 cross&#8208;linked by the weakly complexed crown ether/secondary ammonium salt motif (Tensile strength: 21.1&#177; 0.5&#160;vs 2.8 &#177; 0.1 MPa; Young's modulus: 102.6&#177; 4.8&#160;vs 2.1 &#177; 0.3 MPa; Toughness: 90.4&#177; 2.0&#160;vs 10.8 &#177; 0.6 MJ/m3). Moreover, our SPNs also retain abundant dynamic properties including good abilities in energy dissipation, reprocessability and stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. These findings provide novel insights into the preparation of SPNs with enhanced mechanical properties, and promote the development of high&#8208;performance intelligent supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Molecular Switch Toward Texture&#8208;Regulated Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depending on the periodic pH evolution during Zn plating/stripping, a pH&#8208;triggered molecular switch with reversible transformation between &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone and &#947;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate is applied to dynamically modulate the Zn/electrolyte interface. This molecular switch strategy results in texture&#8208;regulated Zn plating, suppressive hydrogen evolution, and excellent Zn reversibility even under high depth of discharge.







Abstract
Zn electrodes in aqueous media exhibit an unstable Zn/electrolyte interface due to severe parasitic reactions and dendrite formation. Here, a dynamic Zn interface modulation based on the molecular switch strategy is reported by hiring &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (GBL) in ZnCl2/H2O electrolyte. During Zn plating, the increased interfacial alkalinity triggers molecular switch from GBL to &#947;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate (GHB). GHB strongly anchors on Zn surface via triple Zn&#8722;O bonding, leading to suppressive hydrogen evolution and texture&#8208;regulated Zn morphology. Upon Zn stripping, the fluctuant pH turns the molecular switch reaction off through the cyclization of GHB to GBL. This dynamic molecular switch strategy enables high Zn reversibility with Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% and Zn||iodine batteries with high&#8208;cyclability under high Zn depth of discharge (50&#8201;%). This study demonstrates the importance of dynamic modulation for Zn electrode and realizes the reversible molecular switch strategy to enhance its reversibility.

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Recovery of Organic Polymer Photocatalytic Particles for the Production of High Value Compounds and Enhanced Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic nanoparticles are presented that are active and well&#8208;dispersed under acidic conditions but aggregate instantly upon elevation of pH. These responsive photocatalytic polymers can be used in various photocatalytic transformations, including CrVI reduction and photoredox alkylation of an indole derivative. The particles could be readily recycled, allowing multiple successive photocatalytic reactions with no clear loss in activity.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;homogeneous polymeric photocatalysts are an emerging class of highly efficient and tunable photocatalytic materials, where the photocatalytic centers are easily accessible. The creation of highly efficient photocatalytic materials that can be rapidly separated and recovered is one of the critical challenges in photocatalytic chemistry. Here, we describe pH&#8208;responsive photocatalytic nanoparticles that are active and well&#8208;dispersed under acidic conditions but aggregate instantly upon elevation of pH, enabling easy recovery. These responsive photocatalytic polymers can be used in various photocatalytic transformations, including CrVI reduction and photoredox alkylation of indole derivative. Notably, the cationic nature of the photocatalyst accelerates reaction rate of an anionic substrate compared to uncharged species. These photocatalytic particles could be readily recycled allowing multiple successive photocatalytic reactions with no clear loss in activity.

         <title>Anticooperative Supramolecular Oligomerization Mediated by V&#8208;Shaped Monomer Design and Unconventional Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A V&#8208;shaped monomer derived from BODIPY has been shown to self&#8208;assemble in non&#8208;polar media into anticooperatively formed luminescent oligomers with ultrahigh thermal stability. The delicate balance between attractive interactions (unconventional C/N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722;B hydrogen bonds), steric side chain effects, and inefficient aromatic interactions associated with the non&#8208;preorganized V&#8208;shaped monomer geometry lead to a restricted growth into discrete oligomer stacks.







Abstract
After more than three decades of extensive investigations on supramolecular polymers, strategies for self&#8208;limiting growth still remain challenging. Herein, we exploit a new V&#8208;shaped monomer design to achieve anticooperatively formed oligomers with superior robustness and high luminescence. In toluene, the monomer&#8208;oligomer equilibrium is shifted to the monomer side, enabling the elucidation of the molecular packing modes and the resulting (weak) anticooperativity. Steric effects associated with an antiparallel staircase organization of the dyes are proposed to outcompete aromatic and unconventional B&#8722;F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;N/C interactions, restricting the growth at the stage of oligomers. In methylcyclohexane (MCH), the packing modes and the anticooperativity are preserved; however, pronounced solvophobic and chain&#8208;enwrapping effects lead to thermally ultrastable oligomers. Our results shed light on understanding anticooperative effects and restricted growth in self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Framework Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Nanotrap for the Precise Recognition and Separation of Gold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold recovery with exceptional uptake capacity, high selectivity, and excellent recyclability has been achieved in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through the regulation of hydrogen&#8208;bond nanotraps within the pore surfaces.







Abstract
Utilizing weak interactions to effectively recover and separate precious metals in solution is of great importance but the practice remains a challenge. Herein, we report a novel strategy to achieve precise recognition and separation of gold by regulating the hydrogen&#8208;bond (H&#8208;bond) nanotrap within the pore of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). It is found that both COF&#8208;HNU25 and COF&#8208;HNU26 can efficiently capture AuIII with fast kinetics, high selectivity, and uptake capacity. In particular, the COF&#8208;HNU25 with the high density of H&#8208;bond nanotraps exhibits an excellent gold uptake capacity of 1725&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is significantly higher than that (219&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) of its isostructural COF (COF&#8208;42) without H&#8208;bond nanostrap in the pores. Importantly, the uptake capacity is strongly correlated to the number of H&#8208;bonds between phenolic OH in the COF and [AuCl4]&#8722; in water, and multiple H&#8208;bond interactions are the key driving force for the excellent gold recovery and reusability of the adsorbent.

In particular, the COF-HNU25 with the high density of H-bond nanotraps exhibits an excellent gold uptake capacity of 1725&#8197;mg&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is significantly higher than that (219&#8197;mg&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of its isostructural COF (COF-42) without H-bond nanostrap in the pores. Importantly, the uptake capacity is strongly correlated to the number of H-bonds between phenolic OH in the COF and [AuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in water, and multiple H-bond interactions are the key driving force for the excellent gold recovery and reusability of the adsorbent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling Polymerization via C&#8722;H Activation for the Synthesis of Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) via C&#8722;H activation is the latest addition in the repertoire of synthetic strategies towards conjugated polymers. This article captures the development of this polymerization strategy in the light of background small molecule reactions with highlighting its greener approach than the previous methods. Arene&#8211;arene and arene&#8211;alkene couplings via transition metal catalysts have been explored for CDC polymerization.







Abstract
Owing to their versatile (opto)electronic properties, conjugated polymers have found application in several organic electronic devices. Cross&#8208;coupling reactions such as Stille, Suzuki, Kumada couplings, and direct arylation reactions have proved to be effective for their synthesis. More atom&#8208;efficient oxidative direct arylation polymerization has also been reported for making homopolymers. However, growing interest toward donor&#8208;acceptor polymers has led to the recent emergence of cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) polymerization to synthesize alternating copolymers without any prefunctionalization of monomers. Metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of two simple arenes via double C&#8722;H activation, or of an arene with an alkene via oxidative Heck&#8208;type reaction have been used so far for CDC polymerization. In this article, we discuss the development of CDC polymerization protocols along with the relevant small molecule CDC reactions for an improved understanding of these reactions.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Alkenylation of N&#8208;Heteroarenes by Ligand&#8208;Directed Co/Al and Co/Mg Cooperative Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co/Al&#8208; and Co/Mg bimetallic catalysts, supported by a phosphine/secondary phosphine oxide bifunctional ligand, have been developed for site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkenylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes with alkynes. Pyridines, pyridones, and imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines are efficiently alkenylated at the C&#8722;H site proximal to the Lewis basic nitrogen or oxygen. A ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer process is proposed as a general mechanism of these C&#8722;H activations.







Abstract
We report herein the design and development of Co/Al and Co/Mg bimetallic catalysts, supported by a phosphine/secondary phosphine oxide (PSPO) bifunctional ligand, for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkenylation of nitrogen&#8208;containing heteroarenes with alkynes. These catalysts enable the alkenylation of pyridine, pyridone, and imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives at the C&#8722;H site proximal to the Lewis basic nitrogen or oxygen atom, which represents a selectivity profile distinct from that of the previously developed cobalt&#8208;diphosphine/aluminum catalyst. The alkenylated products were obtained in moderate to good yields using various heterocycles and differently substituted internal alkynes. Kinetic isotope effect experiments suggest the irreversibility of the C&#8722;H activation step, the relevance of which to the rate&#8208;limiting step depends on the reaction conditions. Density functional theory calculations indicate that ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer is the common mechanism of C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Structural and Mechanistic Studies on Substrate and Stereoselectivity of the Indole Monooxygenase VpIndA1: New Avenues for Biocatalytic Epoxidations and Sulfoxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal structure analysis of a group E flavoprotein monooxygenase in complex with substrates and products reveals a confined hydrophobic binding pocket that controls the stereoselectivity of sulfoxidation or epoxidation reactions. Molecular mechanics force&#8208;field calculations and kinetic studies allowed structure&#8208;based redesign of this cavity, resulting in variants with greatly enhanced stereoselectivity or acceptance of novel substrates.







Abstract
Flavoprotein monooxygenases are a versatile group of enzymes for biocatalytic transformations. Among these, group E monooxygenases (GEMs) catalyze enantioselective epoxidation and sulfoxidation reactions. Here, we describe the crystal structure of an indole monooxygenase from the bacterium Variovorax paradoxus EPS, a GEM designated as VpIndA1. Complex structures with substrates reveal productive binding modes that, in conjunction with force&#8208;field calculations and rapid mixing kinetics, reveal the structural basis of substrate and stereoselectivity. Structure&#8208;based redesign of the substrate cavity yielded variants with new substrate selectivity (for sulfoxidation of benzyl phenyl sulfide) or with greatly enhanced stereoselectivity (from 35.1&#8201;% to 99.8&#8201;% ee for production of (1S,2R)&#8208;indene oxide). This first determination of the substrate binding mode of GEMs combined with structure&#8208;function relationships opens the door for structure&#8208;based design of these powerful biocatalysts.

         <title>Ionothermal Synthesis of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Using Low&#8208;Melting Metal Salt Precursors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using low&#8208;melting metal (hydrate) salts as both the precursor and the solvent for ionothermal synthesis, a range of stable metal&#8211;organic frameworks can be prepared with high crystallinity and porosity and minimal use of organic solvents.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous, crystalline materials constructed from organic linkers and inorganic nodes with myriad potential applications in chemical separations, catalysis, and drug delivery. A major barrier to the application of MOFs is their poor scalability, as most frameworks are prepared under highly dilute solvothermal conditions using toxic organic solvents. Herein, we demonstrate that combining a range of linkers with low&#8208;melting metal halide (hydrate) salts leads directly to high&#8208;quality MOFs without added solvent. Frameworks prepared under these ionothermal conditions possess porosities comparable to those prepared under traditional solvothermal conditions. In addition, we report the ionothermal syntheses of two frameworks that cannot be prepared directly under solvothermal conditions. Overall, the user&#8208;friendly method reported herein should be broadly applicable to the discovery and synthesis of stable metal&#8208;organic materials.

         <title>Gold Complexes in Anticancer Therapy: From New Design Principles to Particle&#8208;Based Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold compounds have attracted considerable interest as anticancer drugs. However, the clinical translation of this class of compounds is hampered by suboptimal pharmacological performance. To address this problem, strategies based on molecular design principles have been the primary focus. More recently, the use of nanoparticle&#8208;based delivery systems has emerged as a promising strategy to circumvent many limitations of these promising anticancer metallodrugs.







Abstract
The discovery of the medicinal properties of gold complexes has fuelled the design and synthesis of new anticancer metallodrugs, which have received special attention due to their unique modes of action. Current research in the development of gold compounds with therapeutic properties is predominantly focused on the molecular design of drug leads with superior pharmacological activities, e.g., by introducing targeting features.

&lt;p&gt;Gold compounds have attracted considerable interest as anticancer drugs. However, the clinical translation of this class of compounds is hampered by suboptimal pharmacological performance. To address this problem, strategies based on molecular design principles have been the primary focus. More recently, the use of nanoparticle-based delivery systems has emerged as a promising strategy to circumvent many limitations of these promising anticancer metallodrugs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the medicinal properties of gold complexes has fuelled the design and synthesis of new anticancer metallodrugs, which have received special attention due to their unique modes of action. Current research in the development of gold compounds with therapeutic properties is predominantly focused on the molecular design of drug leads with superior pharmacological activities, e.g., by introducing targeting features. Moreover, intensive research aims at improving the physicochemical properties of gold compounds, such as chemical stability and solubility in the physiological environment. In this regard, the encapsulation of gold compounds in nanocarriers or their chemical grafting onto targeted delivery vectors could lead to new nanomedicines that eventually reach clinical applications. Herein, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art progress of gold anticancer compounds, andmore importantly we thoroughly revise the development of nanoparticle-based delivery systems for gold chemotherapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
