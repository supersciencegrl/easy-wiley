         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Photoreduction of Carborane Phosphonium Salts: Efficient Synthesis of Carborane&#8208;Oxindole&#8208;Pharmaceutical Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoreaction of carboranes is an effective approach to prepare carborane&#8208;containing compounds. While several methods via boron&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals have been established, those via carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals are much underdeveloped, except for the UV&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photohomolysis. Herein, we describe a simple but effective approach to access carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals via photoreduction of carborane phosphonium salts under blue light irradiation without using transition metals and photocatalysts. The utility of the method was demonstrated by successfully preparing a range of carborane&#8208;oxindole&#8208;pharmaceutical hybrids via radical cascade reactions. Computational and experimental studies suggested that the carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals were generated via single electron transfer of the photoactive charge transfer complexes between the salts and the additive potassium acetate.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia over Cu Nanosheets via Facet Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into ammonia (NH3) represents a potential way for achieving carbon&#8722;free NH3 production while balancing the nitrogen cycle. Herein we report a high&#8722;performance Cu nanosheets catalyst which delivers a NH3 partial current density of 665 mA cm&#8722;2 and NH3 yield rate of 1.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell at &#8722;0.59 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. The catalyst showed a high stability for 700 h with NH3 Faradaic efficiency of ~88% at 365 mA cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy results verify that Cu nanosheets are in situ derived from the as&#8208;prepared CuO nanosheets under electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction conditions. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculations indicate that the high performance is attributed to the tandem interaction of Cu(100) and Cu(111) facets. The NO2&#8722; generated on the Cu(100) facets is subsequently hydrogenated on the Cu(111) facets, thus the tandem catalysis promotes the crucial hydrogenation of *NO to *NOH for NH3 production.</dc:description>

         <title>Layered Zeolite for Assembly of Two&#8208;Dimensional Separation Membranes for Hydrogen Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane separation is an energy&#8208;efficient and environmentally friendly process. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molecular sieving membranes featuring unique nanopores and low transport resistance have the potential to achieve highly permeable and selective mixture separation with low energy consumption. High&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio zeolite nanosheets with intrinsic molecular&#8208;sieving pores perpendicular to the layers are desirable building blocks for fabricating high&#8208;performance 2D zeolite membrane. However, a wider application of 2D zeolitic membranes is restricted by the limited number of recognized zeolite nanosheets. Herein, we report a swollen layered zeolite, ECNU&#8208;28, with SZR topology and eight&#8208;member ring (8&#8208;MR, 3.0 &#197; &#215; 4.8 &#197;) pores normal to the nanosheets. It can be easily exfoliated to construct 2D membrane, which shows a high hydrogen selectivity up to 130 from natural gas and is promising for hydrogen purification and greenhouse gas capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell&#8208;Type All&#8208;Inorganic Heterometallic Nanoclusters: Record High&#8208;Nuclearity Cobalt Polyoxoniobates for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Only rarely have polyoxometalates been found to form core&#8208;shell nanoclusters. Here, we succeeded in isolating a series of rare giant and all&#8208;inorganic core&#8208;shell cobalt polyoxoniobates (Co&#8208;PONbs) with diverse shapes, nuclearities and original topologies, including 50&#8208;nuclearity {Co12Nb38O132}, 54&#8208;nuclearity {Co20Nb34O128}, 62&#8208;nuclearity {Co26Nb36O140} and 87&#8208;nuclearity {Co33Nb54O128}. They are the largest Co&#8208;PONbs and also the polyoxometalates containing the greatest number of Co ions and the largest cobalt clusters known thus far. These molecular Co&#8208;PONbs have intriguing and atomically precise core&#8208;shell architectures comprising unique cobalt oxide cores and niobate oxide shells. In particular, the encapsulated cobalt oxide cores with different nuclearities have identical compositions, structures and mixed&#8208;valence Co3+/Co2+ states as the different sized Co&#8208;O moieties of the bulk cubic&#8208;spinel Co3O4, suggesting that they can serve as various molecular models of the cubic&#8208;spinel Co3O4. The successful construction of the series of the Co&#8208;PONbs reveals a feasible and versatile synthetic method for making rare core&#8208;shell heterometallic PONbs. Further, these new&#8208;type core&#8208;shell bimetal species are promising cluster molecular catalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Insertion of Chemical Handles into the Backbone of DNA during Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis by Oxidative Coupling of Amines to Phosphites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugation of molecules or proteins to oligonucleotides can improve their functional and therapeutic capacity. However, such modifications are often limited to the 5&#8217; and 3&#8217; end of oligonucleotides. Herein, we report the development of an inexpensive and simple method that allows for the insertion of chemical handles into the backbone of oligonucleotides. This method is compatible with standardized automated solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis, and relies on formation of phosphoramidates. A unique phosphoramidite is incorporated into a growing oligonucleotide, and oxidized to the desired phosphoramidate using iodine and an amine of choice. Azides, alkynes, amines, and alkanes have been linked to oligonucleotides via internally positioned phosphoramidates with oxidative coupling yields above 80%. We show the design of phosphoramidates from secondary amines that specifically hydrolyze to the phosphate only at decreased pH. Finally, we show the synthesis of an antibody&#8208;DNA conjugate, where the oligonucleotide can be selectively released in a pH 5.5 buffer.</dc:description>

         <title>Prussian Blue Analogues with Optimized Crystal Plane Orientation and Low Crystal Defects toward 450 Wh kg&#8208;1 Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been regarded as promising cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high theoretical energy density and low&#8208;cost. However, high water and vacancies content of PBAs lower their energy density and bring safety issues, impeding their large&#8208;scale application in SIBs. Herein, a facile &#8220;potassium&#8208;ions assisted&#8221; strategy is proposed to synthesize highly crystallized PBAs. By manipulating the dominant crystal plane and suppressing vacancies, the as&#8208;prepared PBAs exhibits increased redox potential resulting in high energy density up to ~450 Wh kg&#8208;1, which is at the same level of the well&#8208;known LiFePO4 cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Remarkably, unconventional highly&#8208;reversible phase evolution and redox&#8208;active pairs were identified by multiple in&#8208;situ techniques for the first time. The preferred guest&#8208;ion storage sites and migration mechanism were systematically analysed through theoretical calculations. We believe these results could inspire the designing of safe SIBs with high energy density.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Polymer as Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li)&#160;metal anodes have the highest theoretical capacity and lowest electrochemical potential making them ideal for Li metal batteries (LMBs). However, Li dendrite formation on the anode impedes the proper discharge capacity and practical cycle life of LMBs, particularly in carbonate electrolytes.&#160;Herein, we developed a reactive alternative polymer named&#160;P(St&#8208;MaI) containing carboxylic acid and cyclic ether moieties which would in&#8208;situ&#160;form artificial polymeric solid electrolyte interface (SEI) with Li. This SEI can accommodate volume changes and maintain good interfacial contact. The presence of carboxylic acid and cyclic ether pendant groups greatly contribute to the induction of uniform Li ion deposition. In addition, the presence of benzyl rings makes the polymer have a certain mechanical strength and plays a key role in inhibiting the growth of Li&#160;dendrites. As a result, the symmetric Li||Li cell with P(St&#8208;MaI)@Li layer can stably cycle for over 900 h under 1 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;without polarization voltage increasing, while their Li||LiFePO4&#160;full batteries maintain high capacity retention of 96% after 930 cycles at 1C in carbonate electrolytes.&#160;The innovative strategy of artificial&#160;SEI is broadly applicable in designing new materials to inhibit Li dendrite growth on Li metal anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Functionalisation of 5&#8208;Methylcytosine by Organic Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The epigenetic modification 5&#8208;methylcytosine plays a vital role in development, cell specific gene expression and disease states. The selective chemical modification of the 5&#8208;methylcytosine methyl group is challenging. Currently, no such chemistry exists. Direct functionalisation of 5&#8208;methylcytosine would improve the detection and study of this epigenetic feature. We report a xanthone&#8208;photosensitised process that introduces a 4&#8208;pyridine modification at a C(sp3)&#8208;H bond in the methyl group of 5&#8208;methylcytosine. We propose a reaction mechanism for this type of reaction based on density functional calculations and apply transition state analysis to rationalise differences in observed reaction efficiencies between cyanopyridine derivatives. The reaction is initiated by single electron oxidation of 5&#8208;methylcytosine followed by deprotonation to generate the methyl group radical. Cross coupling of the methyl radical with 4&#8208;cyanopyridine installs a 4&#8208;pyridine label at 5&#8208;methylcytosine. We demonstrate use of the pyridination reaction to enrich 5&#8208;methylcytosine&#8208;containing RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonance Building&#8208;Block&#8208;Based Electroluminescent Material: Lengthening Emission Maximum and Shortening Delayed Fluorescence Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are considered a class of organic materials with exceptional electronic and optical properties, which make them promising for the applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, we improved, synthesized, and characterized a multiple&#8208;resonance type emitter based on the assembly of MR&#8208;building blocks (MR&#8208;BBs). By optimizing the geometric arrangement of MR&#8208;BBs, we were able to generate narrowband emission in the longer wavelength region and shorten the delayed excited&#8208;state lifetime, resulting in improved emission efficiency compared to the parent molecule. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecule, m&#8208;DBCz, exhibited narrowband yellowish&#8208;green TADF emission with a full width at half&#8208;maximum of 32 nm and a small singlet&#8722;triplet energy gap of 0.04 eV. The OLED developed using m&#8208;DBCz as the emitter demonstrated electroluminescence at 548 nm and achieved a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 34.9%. Further optimization of the device resulted in a high external quantum efficiency of 36.3% and extremely low efficiency roll&#8208;off, with EQE values of 30.1% and 27.7% obtained even at high luminance levels of 50000 and 100000 cd m&#8722;2. These results demonstrate the full potential of MR&#8208;TADF materials for applications on ultrahigh&#8208;luminance OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Performance of Cobalt Oxide by Protic Ionic Liquid Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of nitrate to ammonia is an appealing way for small&#8208;scale and decentralized ammonia synthesis and waste nitrate treatment. Currently, strategies to enhance the reaction performance through elaborate catalyst design have been well developed, but it is still of challenge to realize the promotion of reactivity and selectivity at the same time. Instead, a facile method of catalyst modification with ionic liquid to modulate the electrode surface microenvironment that mimic the role of the natural MoFe protein environment is found effective for the simultaneous improvement of NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency (FE) at a low NaNO3 concentration of 500 ppm. Protic ionic liquid (PIL) N&#8208;butylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bim]NTf2) modified Co3O4&#8208;x is fabricated and affords the NH3 yield rate and FE of 30.23 &#177; 4.97 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat.&#8208;1 and 84.74 &#177; 3.43% at &#8208;1.71 and &#8208;1.41 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, outperforming the pristine Co3O4&#8208;x. Mechanistic and theoretical studies reveal that the PIL modification facilitates the adsorption and activation of NO3&#8208; as well as the NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion and inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction competition via enhancing the Lewis acidity of the Co center, shuttling protons, and constructing a hydrogen bonded and hydrophobic electrode surface microenvironment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Thioamide peptides were synthesized via a straightforward one&#8208;pot process via the linkage of diverse natural amino acids in the presence of thiolphosphonate and trichlorosilane, wherein carbonyl groups were replaced with thiono compounds with minimal racemization. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies demonstrated that trichlorosilane enabled the activation of carboxylic acids via intense interactions with the Si&#8211;O bond, followed by coupling of the carboxylic acids with thiolphosphonate to obtain the key intermediate S&#8208;acyl dithiophosphate. Silyl&#8208;activated quadrangular metathesis transition states afforded thioamide peptides. The potential applications for thioamide peptides were further highlighted via late&#8208;stage linkages of diverse natural products and pharmaceutical drugs and the thioamide moiety.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a new strategy in which a thiolate&#8208;protected Ag25 nanocluster can be doped with open d&#8208;shell group 8 (Ru, Os) and 9 (Ir) metals by forming metal hydride (RuH2, OsH2, IrH) superatoms with a closed d&#8208;shell. Structural analyses using various experimental and theoretical methods revealed that the Ag25 nanoclusters were co&#8208;doped with the open d&#8208;shell metal and hydride species to produce superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanoclusters, establishing a novel superatom doping phenomenon for open d&#8208;shell metals. The synthesized superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanoclusters exhibited dopant&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) properties. Comparative PL lifetime studies of the Ag25 nanoclusters doped with 8&#8211;10 group metals revealed that both radiative and nonradiative processes were significantly dependent on the dopant. The former is strongly correlated with the electron affinity of the metal dopant, whereas the latter is governed predominantly by the kernel structure changed upon the doping of the metal hydride(s).</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Local Charge Distribution in Multicomponent Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dramatically Enhanced Photocatalytic Uranium Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimizing the electronic structure of covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalysts is essential for maximizing photocatalytic activity. Herein, we report an isoreticular family of&#160;multivariate&#160;COFs&#160;containing chromenoquinoline rings in the COF structure and electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing groups in the pores.&#160;Intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interactions in the COFs allowed tuning of local charge distributions&#160;and charge carrier separation under visible light irradiation, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic performance. By optimizing the optoelectronic properties of the COFs, a photocatalytic uranium extraction efficiency of 8.02 mg/g/day was achieved using a nitro&#8208;functionalized multicomponent COF in natural seawater, exceeding the performance of all COFs reported to date.&#160;Results demonstrate an effective design strategy towards high&#8208;activity COF photocatalysts with intramolecular D&#8208;A structures not easily accessible using traditional synthetic approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Linkage Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been employed to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To achieve high activity and selectivity, various building blocks containing heteroatoms and groups linked by imine bonds were used to create catalytic COFs. However, the roles of linkages of COFs in ORR have not been investigated. In this work, catalytic linkage engineering has been employed to modulate the catalytic behaviors. To create single catalytic sites while avoiding other possible catalytic sites, we synthesized COFs from benzene units linked by various bonds, such as imine, amide, azine, and oxazole bonds. Among these COFs, the oxazole&#8208;linkage in COFs enables to catalyze the ORR with the highest activity, which achieved a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.75 V and a limited current density of 5.5 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, the oxazole&#8208;linked COF achieved a conversion frequency (TOF) value of 0.0133 S&#8722;1, which were 1.9, 1.3, and 7.4&#8208;times that of azine&#8208;, amide&#8208; and imine&#8208;COFs, respectively. The theoretical calculation showed that the carbon atoms in oxazole linkages facilitated the form of OOH* and promoted protonation of O* to form the OH*, thus advancing the catalytic activity. This work guides us on which linkages in COFs are suitable for ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO Mediated by Silver Single Atoms Anchored on Tubular Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial photosynthesis is a promising strategy for converting carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into fuels and value&#8208;added chemical products. However, a photocatalyst is usually suffered from low activity and product selectivity due to the sluggish dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers. Herein, we develop the Ag single atoms anchored hollow porous polygonal tubular C3N4 (PCN) photocatalyst Ag1@PCN with an Ag&#8208;N3coordination for CO2 photoreduction using H2O as the reductant. The as&#8208;synthesized Ag1@PCNexhibits a high CO production rate of 0.32 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 (mass of catalyst: 2 mg), a high selectivity (&gt;94%), and an excellent stability in the long term of photocatalytic reaction. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) analyses elucidate that the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (Ag&#8208;N3) not only favors *CO2 adsorption, *COOH generation and desorption, but also accelerates the dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers between C3N4 and Ag single atoms, thereby accounting for the enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity with a high CO selectivity. This work provides a deep insight into the important role of strong metal&#8208;support interaction in enhancing the photoactivity and CO selectivity of CO2 photoreduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Observing Confined Local Oxygen&#8208;induced Reversible Thiol/Disulfide Cycle with a Protein Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disulfide bonds play an important role in thiol&#8208;based redox regulation. However, owing to the lack of analytical tools, little is known about how local O2 mediates the reversible thiol/disulfide cycle under protein confinement. In this study, a protein nanopore reactor inside a glove box is developed for O2 confinement, as well as a single&#8208;molecule sensor for real&#8208;time monitoring of the reversible thiol/disulfide cycle. The results demonstrate that the presence of local O2 molecules in protein nanopores can facilitate the redox cycle of disulfide formation and cleavage by promoting a higher fraction of effective reactant collisions owing to nanoconfinement. Further kinetic calculations indicate that negatively charged residues near the reactive sites facilitate proton&#8208;involved, oxygen&#8208;induced disulfide cleavage under protein confinement. The unexpectedly strong oxidation ability of confined local O2 may play an essential role in cellular redox signaling and enzyme reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing Excited State Trajectories on Potential Energy Surfaces with Atomic Resolution in Real Time</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoexcited molecular trajectories on the potential energy surfaces prior to thermalization are intimately connected to the photochemical reaction outcome. The excited state trajectories of a diplatinum complex featuring photo&#8208;activated metal&#8208;metal &#120590;&#8208;bond formation and associated Pt&#8208;Pt stretching motions were detected in real time using femtosecond wide angle X&#8208;ray solution scattering. The observed motions correspond well with coherent vibrational wavepacket motions detected by femtosecond optical transient absorption. Two key coordinates for intersystem crossing have been identified, the Pt&#8208;Pt bond distance and the orientation of the ligands coordinated with the platinum centers, along which the excited state trajectories can be projected onto the calculated potential energy surfaces of the excited states. This investigation has gleaned novel insight into electronic transitions occurring on the time scales of vibrational motions measured in real time, revealing ultrafast nonadiabatic or non&#8208;equilibrium processes along excited state trajectories involving multiple excited state potential energy surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Apolipoprotein&#8197;E Recognizes Alzheimer's Disease Associated 3&#8208;O Sulfation of Heparan Sulfate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of Apolipoprotein&#8197;E (ApoE) with cell surface Heparan Sulfate (HS) is enhanced by a rare, Alzheimer's Disease linked 3&#8208;O&#8208;Sulfo group. This binding motif is shared with tau protein, suggesting a mechanism for ApoE/tau interactions in the association of certain ApoE isoforms with AD.







Abstract
Apolipoprotein&#8197;E (ApoE)&#8217;s &#1013;4 alle is the most important genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cell&#8208;surface heparan sulfate (HS) is a cofactor for ApoE/LRP1 interaction and the prion&#8208;like spread of tau pathology between cells. 3&#8208;O&#8208;sulfo (3&#8208;O&#8208;S) modification of HS has been linked to AD through its interaction with tau, and enhanced levels of 3&#8208;O&#8208;sulfated HS and 3&#8208;O&#8208;sulfotransferases in the AD brain. In this study, we characterized ApoE/HS interactions in wildtype ApoE3, AD&#8208;linked ApoE4, and AD&#8208;protective ApoE2 and ApoE3&#8208;Christchurch. Glycan microarray and SPR assays revealed that all ApoE isoforms recognized 3&#8208;O&#8208;S. NMR titration localized ApoE/3&#8208;O&#8208;S binding to the vicinity of the canonical HS binding motif. In cells, the knockout of HS3ST1&#8208;a major 3&#8208;O sulfotransferase&#8208;reduced cell surface binding and uptake of ApoE. 3&#8208;O&#8208;S is thus recognized by both tau and ApoE, suggesting that the interplay between 3&#8208;O&#8208;sulfated HS, tau and ApoE isoforms may modulate AD risk.

         <title>Formation and Loading of a (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;Ethylmalonamyl Starter Unit in the Assembly Line of Polyketide&#8208;Nonribosomal Peptide Hybrid Sanglifehrin A</title>

         <dc:description>
The process for forming and loading a (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl starter unit in the assembly line of sanglifehrin A is uncovered. This process involves two unusual enzymatic reactions that occur on a discrete acyl carrier protein (ACP): an amide synthetase catalyzes (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonyl amidation, and a homolog of &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase III transfers resultant (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl onto the assembly line to prime the biosynthesis of sanglifehrin A.







Abstract
Sanglifehrin A (SFA) is a spirolactam&#8208;conjugated, 22&#8208;membered macrolide with remarkable immunosuppressive and antiviral activities. This macrolide is a result of a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly line that utilizes (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl as a starter unit. Here, we report that the formation and loading of this starter unit in the SFA assembly line involve two unusual enzymatic reactions that occur on a discrete acyl carrier protein (ACP), SfaO. An amide synthetase, SfaP, catalyzes the amidation of (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonyl in a SfaO&#8208;dependent manner. Then, a &#946;&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase III&#8208;like protein, SfaN, transfers resultant (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl from SfaO onto the loading ACP domain of the hybrid PKS&#8208;NRPS assembly line to prime SFA biosynthesis. Both SfaP and SfaN display promiscuous activities. This study furthers the appreciation of assembly line chemistry, as a new paradigm for unusual building block formation and incorporation is provided.

         <title>Inducing Covalent Atomic Interaction in Intermetallic Pt Alloy Nanocatalysts for High&#8208;Performance Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing covalent interaction bonding between Pt and Ga atoms, the developed L10&#8722;Pt2CuGa/C ORR catalyst shows efficient and stable performance in practical fuel cells. This work may provide a new strategy to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts via tuning the type of chemical bonds for electrochemical energy conversion.







Abstract
The harsh working environments of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) pose huge challenges to the stability of Pt&#8208;based alloy catalysts. The widespread presence of metallic bonds with significantly delocalized electron distribution often lead to component segregation and rapid performance decay. Here we report L10&#8722;Pt2CuGa intermetallic nanoparticles with a unique covalent atomic interaction between Pt&#8722;Ga as high&#8208;performance PEMFC cathode catalysts. The L10&#8722;Pt2CuGa/C catalyst shows superb oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability in fuel cell cathode (mass activity=0.57&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V, peak power density=2.60/1.24&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in H2&#8208;O2/air, 28&#8197;mV voltage loss at 0.8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 30&#8201;000&#8197;cycles). Theoretical calculations reveal the optimized adsorption of oxygen intermediates via the formed biaxial strain on L10&#8722;Pt2CuGa surface, and the durability enhancement stems from the stronger Pt&#8722;M bonds than those in L11&#8722;PtCu resulted from Pt&#8722;Ga covalent interactions.

         <title>Molecule Saturation Boosts Acetylene Semihydrogenation Activity and Selectivity on a Core&#8208;Shell Ruthenium@Palladium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective catalyst for semihydrogenation of acetylene was created by layering Pd on large Ru nanoparticles with terrace sites and a smaller lattice constant. The catalyst stabilizes unsaturated acetylene as it undergoes semihydrogenation while promoting ethylene desorption, thereby achieving high activity and selectivity at the same time.







Abstract
Increasing selectivity without the expense of activity is desired but challenging in heterogeneous catalysis. By revealing the molecule saturation and adsorption sensitivity on overlayer thickness, strain, and coordination of Pd&#8208;based catalysts from first&#8208;principles calculations, we designed a stable Pd monolayer (ML) catalyst on a Ru terrace to boost both activity and selectivity of acetylene semihydrogenation. The least saturated molecule is most sensitive to the change in catalyst electronic and geometric properties. By simultaneously compressing the Pd ML and exposing the high coordination sites, the adsorption of more saturated ethylene is considerably weakened to facilitate the desorption for high selectivity. The even stronger weakening to the least saturated acetylene drives its hydrogenation such that it is more exothermic, thereby boosting the activity. Tailoring the molecule saturation and its sensitivity to structure and composition provides a tool for rational design of efficient catalysts.

         <title>A Fused [5]Helicene Dimer with a Figure&#8208;Eight Topology: Synthesis, Chiral Resolution, and Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Suzuki coupling&#8208;mediated macrocyclization followed by a Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of a vinyl ether has led to the synthesis of a fused [5]helicene dimer with a figure&#8208;eight geometry, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The fully conjugated electronic structure and D2 symmetry results in the isolated enantiomers showing persistent chirality and large dissymmetric factors.







Abstract
Chiral shape&#8208;persistent molecular nanocarbons are promising chiroptical materials; their synthesis, however, remains a big challenge. Herein, we report the facile synthesis and chiral resolution of a double&#8208;stranded figure&#8208;eight carbon nanobelt 1 in which two [5]helicene units are fused together. Two synthetic routes were developed, and, in particular, a strategy involving Suzuki coupling&#8208;mediated macrocyclization followed by Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of vinyl ether turned out to be the most efficient. The structure of 1 was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The isolated (P,P)&#8208; and (M,M)&#8208; enantiomers show persistent chiroptical properties with relatively large dissymmetric factors (|gabs|=5.4&#215;10&#8722;3 and |glum|=1.0&#215;10&#8722;2), which can be explained by the effective electron delocalization along the fully conjugated belt and the unique D2 symmetry. 1 exhibits local aromatic character with a dominant structure containing eight Clar's aromatic sextet rings.

         <title>X&#8208;Ray&#8208;triggered Carbon Monoxide and Manganese Dioxide Generation based on Scintillating Nanoparticles for Cascade Cancer Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered carbon monoxide and manganese dioxide generation nanocomposites were fabricated with UV&#8208;responsive manganese carbonyl and radioluminescent scintillating nanoparticles. The glycolytic inhibition of carbon monoxide, coupled with the Mn2+&#8208;mediated Fenton&#8208;like activity of manganese dioxide, greatly boost the effect of radiotherapy.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an endogenous signaling molecule with broad therapeutic effects. Here, a multifunctional X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered carbon monoxide (CO) and manganese dioxide (MnO2) generation nanoplatform based on metal carbonyl and scintillating nanoparticles (SCNPs) is reported. Attributed to the radioluminescent characteristic of SCNPs, UV&#8208;responsive Mn2(CO)10 is not only indirectly activated to release CO by X&#8208;ray but can also be degraded into MnO2. A high dose of CO can be used as a glycolytic inhibitor for tumor suppression; it will also sensitize tumor cells to radiotherapy. Meanwhile MnO2, as the photolytic byproduct of Mn2(CO)10, has both glutathione (GSH) depletion and Fenton&#8208;like Mn2+ delivery properties to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) in tumors. Thus, this strategy can realize X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated CO release, GSH depletion, and &#8901;OH generation for cascade cancer radiosensitization. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated Mn2+ in vivo demonstrates an MRI contrast effect, making it a potential theranostic nanoplatform.

Meanwhile MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as the photolytic byproduct of Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, has both glutathione (GSH) depletion and Fenton-like Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; delivery properties to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) in tumors. Thus, this strategy can realize X-ray-activated CO release, GSH depletion, and &#8901;OH generation for cascade cancer radiosensitization. Furthermore, X-ray-activated Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in vivo demonstrates an MRI contrast effect, making it a potential theranostic nanoplatform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Indenyl Effect: Accelerated C&#8722;H Amidation of Arenes via Ind*RhIII Nitrene Transfer Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acyl silane directed C&#8722;H amidation of benzoyl silanes via nitrene transfer catalysis using 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones as the N&#8208;donor source was significantly accelerated in the presence of a heptamethylindenyl&#8208;rhodium catalyst (Ind*RhIII).







Abstract
Investigations into C&#8722;H amidation reactions catalysed by cationic half&#8208;sandwich d6 metal complexes revealed that the indenyl&#8208;derived catalyst [Ind*RhCl2]2 significantly accelerated the directed ortho C&#8722;H amidation of benzoyl silanes using 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones. Ring slippage involving a haptotropic &#951;5 to &#951;3 rearrangement of the indenyl complex proposedly enables ligand substitution at the metal centre to proceed via associative, rather than dissociative pathways, leading to significant rate and yield enhancements. Intriguingly, this phenomenon appears specific for C&#8722;H amidation reactions involving weakly coordinating carbonyl&#8208;based directing groups with no acceleration observed for the corresponding reactions involving strongly coordinating nitrogen&#8208;based directing groups.

         <title>A Sustainable Wood&#8208;Based Iron Photocatalyst for Multiple Uses with Sunlight: Water Treatment and Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyst was made from demethylated lignin as sustainable source and Fe3O4. It can be used in environmental sciences to clean wastewater and in material sciences as a radical photoinitiator, resulting in crosslinking of vinyl monomers by radical photopolymerization. Films obtained showed good water repelling and no tackiness even in an aerobic surrounding.







Abstract
A sustainable photocatalyst for use with multiple purpose comprising demethylated lignin (Fe3O4@D&#8208;wood) was made by treatment of wood and iron oxide. Characterization followed by XRD, UV/Vis, photo&#8208;current studies, and electrochemical measurements. This material became subject of photocatalytic explorations for water treatment and material synthesis by radical photopolymerization. Exposure of Fe3O4@D&#8208;wood with artificial sunlight showed an improved activity considering photochemical oxidation of organic pollutants in the presence of H2O2. The efficient generation of reactive radicals brought this system also to photopolymerization. Here, radicals based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in the catalytic cycle can be seen as the dominating species to initiate radical polymerization. A mixture of UDMA and TPGDA showed good reactivity with cumene hydroperoxide (CHP). Photocatalyst used for water treatment facilitates reuse for photopolymerization.

         <title>Unveiling the Critical Role of Ion Coordination Configuration of Ether Electrolytes for High Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ether solvent (1,3&#8208;dimethoxypropane, DMP) is used for the configuration of the electrochemical behavior of electrolytes in lithium metal batteris. The six&#8208;membered Li+&#8208;chelating ring greatly improves the oxidation stability of the ether&#8208;based electrolyte compared to the conventional five&#8208;membered chelate ring. The cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase enriched in LiF effectively protects the nickel&#8208;rich cathode from corrosion by electrolyte side reactions.







Abstract
Albeit ethers are favorable electrolyte solvents for lithium (Li) metal anode, their inferior oxidation stability (&lt;4.0&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+) is problematic for high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Studies of ether electrolytes have been focusing on the archetype glyme structure with ethylene oxide moieties. Herein, we unveil the crucial effect of ion coordination configuration on oxidation stability by varying the ether backbone structure. The designed 1,3&#8208;dimethoxypropane (DMP, C3) forms a unique six&#8208;membered chelating complex with Li+, whose stronger solvating ability suppresses oxidation side reactions. In addition, the favored hydrogen transfer reaction between C3 and anion induces a dramatic enrichment of LiF (a total atomic ratio of 76.7&#8201;%) on the cathode surface. As a result, the C3&#8208;based electrolyte enables greatly improved cycling of nickel&#8208;rich cathodes under 4.7&#8197;V. This study offers fundamental insights into rational electrolyte design for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Crystallinity Regulation and Defects Passivation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Using Fully Conjugated Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) were constructed through Gilch reaction. The obtained PAFs have rigid conjugated backbones with high specific surface area and excellent stability. The PAFs were successfully applied in the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by doping into the perovskite layer, and the power conversion efficiencies and stability significantly increased.







Abstract
Fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) have been constructed through Gilch reaction. The obtained PAFs have rigid conjugated backbones, high specific surface area, and excellent stability. The prepared PAF&#8208;154 and PAF&#8208;155 have been successfully applied in the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by doping into the perovskite layer. The champion PSC devices afford a power conversion efficiency of 22.8&#8201;% and 22.4&#8201;%. It is found that the PAFs can be used as an efficient nucleation template, thus regulating the perovskite crystallinity. Meanwhile, PAFs can also passivate defects and promote carriers transporting in the perovskite film. By the comparative study with their linear counterpart, we unravel that the efficacy of PAFs is highly related to their porous structure and rigid fully conjugated networks. The unencapsulated devices with PAFs doping exhibit outstanding long&#8208;term stability, retaining 80&#8201;% of their initial efficiencies after half&#8208;year storage in ambient conditions.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Site Conformational Exchange in the Synthetic Neomycin&#8208;Sensing Riboswitch Studied by 19F NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular motions are tightly coupled with function. Here we use a unique combination of five different fluorine NMR relaxation methods to reveal the dynamics in three structurally similar riboswitch:ligand complexes. Our data displays unexpectedly complex exchange topologies with up to four structurally different states. Importantly, the associated kinetic and thermodynamics parameters could be accurately determined.







Abstract
The synthetic neomycin&#8208;sensing riboswitch interacts with its cognate ligand neomycin as well as with the related antibiotics ribostamycin and paromomycin. Binding of these aminoglycosides induces a very similar ground state structure in the RNA, however, only neomycin can efficiently repress translation initiation. The molecular origin of these differences has been traced back to differences in the dynamics of the ligand:riboswitch complexes. Here, we combine five complementary fluorine based NMR methods to accurately quantify seconds to microseconds dynamics in the three riboswitch complexes. Our data reveal complex exchange processes with up to four structurally different states. We interpret our findings in a model that shows an interplay between different chemical groups in the antibiotics and specific bases in the riboswitch. More generally, our data underscore the potential of 19F NMR methods to characterize complex exchange processes with multiple excited states.

The asymmetric total syntheses of (+)&#8208;vulgarisins&#8197;A&#8211;E, which share a rare [5&#8208;6&#8208;4&#8208;5] tetracyclic core structure, have been achieved for the first time in a divergent manner. Key features of the strategy involve a catalytic asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation, a one&#8208;pot borylation/conjugate addition process, a Wolff ring contraction and a stereocontrolled pinacol cyclization.







Abstract
The asymmetric total syntheses of (+)&#8208;vulgarisins&#8197;A&#8211;E, which share a rare and highly oxygenated [5&#8208;6&#8208;4&#8208;5] tetracyclic core structure that were isolated from P. vulgaris Linn., have been described for the first time in a divergent manner. Key transformations include: 1) a catalytic asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanation to forge the A ring bearing desired stereochemistry at C14; 2) a one&#8208;pot borylation/conjugate addition process for creation of the C1&#8722;C11 bond; 3) a Wolff ring contraction to assemble the bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane subunit (CD rings); and 4) a stereocontrolled pinacol cyclization for construction of the central B ring of the natural products.

         <title>Resolidified Chalcogen Precursors for High&#8208;Quality 2D Semiconductor Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen powder is pre&#8208;melted and resolidified to give a stable chalcogen precursor for the chemical vapor deposition growth of transition metal dichalcogenides. The obtained monolayer tungsten disulfide is uniform and shows high optical and structural quality.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have gained attention in optoelectronics for their extraordinary properties. However, the large amount and locally distributed lattice defects affect the optical properties of 2D TMDCs, and the defects originate from unstable factors in the synthesis process. In this work, we develop a method of pre&#8208;melting and resolidification of chalcogen precursors (sulfur and selenium), namely resolidified chalcogen, as precursor for the chemical vapor deposition growth of TMDCs with ultrahigh quality and uniformity. Taking WS2 as an example, the monolayer WS2 shows uniform fluorescence intensity and a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of photoluminescence peak at low temperatures with an average value of 13.6&#177;1.9&#8197;meV. The defect densities at the interior and edge region are both low and comparable, i.e., (9&#177;3)&#215;1012&#8197;cm&#8722;2 and (10&#177;4)&#215;1012&#8197;cm&#8722;2, indicating its high structural quality and uniformity. This method is universal in growing high quality monolayer MoS2, WSe2, MoSe2, and will benefit their applications.

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells by a Multifunctional Composite Photoanode to 14.13&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to fabricate a multifunctional composite photoanode containing TiO2 hollow spheres, Au nanoparticles and upconversion nanoparticles is presented. A champion power conversion efficiency of 14.13&#8201;% is obtained, which is a record for N719 dye&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells.







Abstract
We report a new strategy to fabricate a multifunctional composite photoanode containing TiO2 hollow spheres (TiO2&#8208;HSs), Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and novel NaYF4&#8201;:&#8201;Yb,Er@NaLuF4&#8201;:&#8201;Eu@SiO2 upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The AuNPs are grown on the photoanode film including TiO2&#8208;HSs and UCNPs by a simple in situ plasmonic treatment. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 14.13&#8201;% is obtained, which is a record for N719 dye&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells, demonstrating great potential for the solar cells toward commercialization. This obvious enhancement is ascribed to a collaborative mechanism of the TiO2&#8208;HSs exhibiting excellent light&#8208;scattering ability, of the UCNPs converting near&#8208;infrared photons into visible photons and of the AuNPs presenting outstanding surface plasmon resonance effect. Notably, a steady&#8208;state experiment further reveals that the champion cell exhibits 95.33&#8201;% retainment in efficiency even after 180&#8197;h of measurements, showing good device stability.

         <title>Construction of Axially Chiral Arylpyrroles via Atroposelective Diyne Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective diyne cyclization enables the efficient synthesis of a range of axially chiral arylpyrrole biaryls in good to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities via oxidation and X&#8722;H insertion of vinyl cations. This method gives the first synthesis of mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;arylpyrrole atropisomers and the first atroposelective diyne cyclization.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryls widely exist in natural products and pharmaceuticals and are used as chiral ligands and catalysts in asymmetric synthesis. Compared to the well&#8208;established axially chiral 6&#8208;membered biaryl skeletons, examples of 5&#8208;membered biaryls have been quite scarce, and mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;arylpyrrole atropisomers have not been reported. Here, we disclose a copper&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective diyne cyclization for the construction of a range of axially chiral arylpyrrole biaryls in good to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities via oxidation and X&#8722;H insertion of vinyl cations. Importantly, this protocol not only represents the first synthesis of mono&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;arylpyrrole atropisomers, but also constitutes the first example of atroposelective diyne cyclization and the first atropisomer construction via vinyl cations. Theoretical calculations further support the mechanism of vinyl cation&#8208;involved cyclization and elucidate the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Selective Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane via Regulating Methyl Intermediates over Metal/ZnO Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;loaded ZnO has been investigated for photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane, among which Au/ZnO exhibited a C2&#8208;C4 hydrocarbon production rate of 683&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 83&#8201;% selectivity. Photogenerated methyl active groups can be selectively coupled on Au but tend to be over&#8208;oxidized into CO2 on other transition metals mainly because of the deference in *CH3&#8208;metal interaction.







Abstract
Methane conversion to higher hydrocarbons requires harsh reaction conditions due to high energy barriers associated with C&#8722;H bond activation. Herein, we report a systematic investigation of photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) over transition&#8208;metal&#8208;loaded ZnO photocatalysts. A 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% Au/ZnO delivered a remarkable C2&#8208;C4 hydrocarbon production rate of 683&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (83&#8201;% C2&#8208;C4 selectivity) under light irradiation with excellent photostability over two days. The metal type and its interaction with ZnO strongly influence the selectivity toward C&#8722;C coupling products. Photogenerated Zn+&#8208;O&#8722; sites enable CH4 activation to methyl intermediates (*CH3) migrating onto adjacent metal nanoparticles. The nature of the *CH3&#8208;metal interaction controls the OCM products. In the case of Au, strong d&#8208;&#963; orbital hybridization reduces metal&#8208;C&#8722;H bond angles and steric hindrance, thereby enabling efficient methyl coupling. Findings indicate the d&#8208;&#963; center may be a suitable descriptor for predicting product selectivity during OCM over metal/ZnO photocatalysts.

Herein, we report a systematic investigation of photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) over transition-metal-loaded ZnO photocatalysts. A 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% Au/ZnO delivered a remarkable C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbon production rate of 683&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (83&#8201;% C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity) under light irradiation with excellent photostability over two days. The metal type and its interaction with ZnO strongly influence the selectivity toward C&#8722;C coupling products. Photogenerated Zn&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-O&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; sites enable CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; activation to methyl intermediates (*CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) migrating onto adjacent metal nanoparticles. The nature of the *CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-metal interaction controls the OCM products. In the case of Au, strong d-&#963; orbital hybridization reduces metal-C&#8722;H bond angles and steric hindrance, thereby enabling efficient methyl coupling. Findings indicate the d-&#963; center may be a suitable descriptor for predicting product selectivity during OCM over metal/ZnO photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Traffic Lights for Catalysis: Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Molecular and Extended Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just as flowers blooming in response to the sun attract bees to continue their natural life cycle, molecules which respond to external stimuli can be used to control catalytic cycles. Development of stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular and extended catalytic platforms is a pathway for precise tuning of reaction yield, rate, or enantioselectivity that could pave the way for the next era of sustainable chemistry.







Abstract
The advances made in the field of stimuli&#8208;responsive catalysis during the last five years with a focus on the novel recently&#8208;emerged directions and applications have been surveyed. Metal&#8208;free catalysts and organometallic complexes, as well as biomimetic systems and extended structures, which display switchable catalytic activity for a variety of organic transformations, are discussed. Light&#8208;activated systems comprised of photochromic molecules capable of modulating reaction rate, yield, or enantioselectivity based on geometric and electronic changes associated with photoisomerization are the focus of the detailed discussion. Alternative stimuli, including pH and temperature, which could be applied either alone or in combination with light, are also addressed. Recent advances clearly demonstrate that the capability to finely tune catalyst behavior via an external stimulus is a powerful tool that could alter the landscape of sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Highly Active Hydrogen&#8208;rich Photothermal Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction on Ni/LaInO3 Perovskite Catalysts with Near&#8208;unity Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni/LaInO3 was designed to obtain an efficient photothermal CO2 conversion with a high CO yield rate (1314&#8197;mmol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and &#8776;100&#8201;% selectivity, where LaInO3 was enriched extensive oxygen vacancies to roundly adsorbing CO2 and the strong interaction with Ni endowed the catalysts with powerful H2 activity. In situ characterizations demonstrated a COOH* pathway and the photoinduced charge transfer process to reduce the reaction active energy.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction is regarded green and promising in controlling the reaction gas ratio in Fischer Tropsch synthesis. But it is inclined to produce more byproducts in high H2 concentration condition. Herein, LaInO3 loaded with Ni&#8208;nanoparticles (Ni NPs) was designed to obtain an efficient photothermal RWGS reaction rate, where LaInO3 was enriched with oxygen vacancies to roundly adsorbing CO2 and the strong interaction with Ni NPs endowed the catalysts with powerful H2 activity. The optimized catalyst performed a large CO yield rate (1314&#8197;mmol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and &#8776;100&#8201;% selectivity. In situ characterizations demonstrated a COOH* pathway of the reaction and photoinduced charge transfer process for reducing the RWGS reaction active energy. Our work provides valuable insights on the construction of catalysts concerning products selectivity and photoelectronic activating mechanism on CO2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Enables Polymer Hydrogels with pH&#8208;Induced Reversible Dynamic Responsive Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Driven by pH&#8208;induced alteration of hydrogen bonds, when placed in an acid solution, the transparent PAN hydrogel quickly becomes opaque and then gradually regains its transparency; while after being switched into DI water, the same dynamic response of fast transparency drop followed by spontaneous slow recovery is recreated.







Abstract
Poly(acrylic acid&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam) (PAN) hydrogels containing multiple hydrogen bonds can exhibit pH&#8208;induced reversible dynamic responsive behaviors. When placing a transparent hydrogel in an acid bath, as hydrogen bonds between comonomer units involving protonated COOH groups are formed faster than water diffusion, a nonequilibrium light&#8208;scattering state is formed to turn the hydrogel opaque, while as the swelling equilibrium is reached over time, the hydrogel regains its transparency. Likewise, when the transparent, hydrogen&#8208;bonded hydrogel is subsequently immersed in DI water, faster water absorption occurs in where more COOH groups are deprotonated, which also generates a light&#8208;scattering state leading to opacity, while the transparency is slowly recovered after equilibrium. Using such two&#8208;way dynamic transparency evolution, a PAN&#8208;based hydrogel material is prepared to demonstrate a dynamic memory system for information memorizing&#8208;forgetting and recalling&#8208;forgetting.

         <title>Phenazine&#8208;based Compound Realizing Separate Hydrogen and Oxygen Production in Electrolytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Phenazine&#8208;based electrode is used as a solid&#8208;state redox mediator to decouple the H2 and O2 production in acidic water electrolysis, realizing a membrane&#8208;free hydrogen production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting powered by renewable energy is a sustainable approach for hydrogen production. However, conventional water electrolysis may suffer from gas mixing, and the different kinetics between hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) will limit the direct use of unstable renewable energies, leading to increased cost of H2 production. Herein, a novel phenazine&#8208;based compound is synthesized to develop the solid&#8208;state redox mediator associated water splititng process, and thus decoupling the H2 and O2 production in acid solution without the use of membrane. Excitingly, this organic redox mediator exhibits high specific capacity (290&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate performance (186&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle life (3000&#8197;cycles) due to its &#960;&#8208;conjugated aromatic structure and the fast kinetics of H+ storage/release process. Furthermore, a membrane&#8208;free decoupled water electrolysis architecture driven by solar energy is achieved, demonstrating high&#8208;purity H2 production at different times.

         <title>Self&#8208;Polarization Triggered Multiple Polar Units Toward Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Ethanol with High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to highly valuable ethanol has been considered a intriguring strategy for carbon neutruality. However, the slow kinetics of coupling carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8208;C) bonds, especially the low selectivity ethanol than ethylene in neutral conditions, is a significant challenge. Herein, the asymmetrical refinement structure with enhanced charge polarization is built in the vertically oriented bimetallic organic frameworks (NiCu&#8208;MOF) nanorod array with encapsulated Cu2O (Cu2O@MOF/CF), which can induce an intensive internal electric field to increase the C&#8208;C coupling for producing ethanol in neutral electrolyte. Particularly, when directly employed Cu2O@MOF/CF as the self&#8208;supporting electrode, the ethanol faradaic efficiency (FEethanol) could reach maximum 44.3% with an energy efficiency of 27% at a low working&#8208;potential of &#8208;0.615 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) using CO2&#8208;saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 as the electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the polarization of atomically localized electric fields derived from the asymmetric electron distribution can tune the moderate adsorption of *CO to assist the C&#8208;C coupling and reduce the formation energy of H2CCHO*&#8208;to&#8208;*OCHCH3 for the generation of ethanol. Our research offers a reference for the design of highly active and selective electrocatalysts for reducing CO2 to multicarbon chemicals.</dc:description>

Particularly, when directly employed Cu2O@MOF/CF as the self-supporting electrode, the ethanol faradaic efficiency (FEethanol) could reach maximum 44.3% with an energy efficiency of 27% at a low working-potential of -0.615 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) using CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 as the electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the polarization of atomically localized electric fields derived from the asymmetric electron distribution can tune the moderate adsorption of *CO to assist the C-C coupling and reduce the formation energy of H2CCHO*-to-*OCHCH3 for the generation of ethanol.

         <title>I3&#8722;/I&#8722; Redox Reaction&#8208;mediated Organic Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries with Accelerated Kinetics and Long Shelf Lives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The storage time of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) for practical implementation has been neglected long&#8208;lastingly. ZABs based on organic solvents promise long storage time but suffer from sluggish kinetics. Here, we report a longly storable ZAB with enhanced kinetics mediated by iodine&#8208;containing redox. In the charge process, the electrooxidation of Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#183;H2O is accelerated by I3&#8208; chemical oxidation. In the discharge process, I&#8208; adsorbed on the electrocatalyst changes the energy level of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Benefitting from these advantages, the prepared ZAB shows remarkably improved round&#8208;trip efficiency (56.03% vs. 30.97% without the mediator), and long&#8208;term cycling time (&gt;2600 h) in ambient air without replacing any components or applying any protective treatment to Zn anode and electrocatalyst. After resting for 30 days without any protection, it can still directly discharge continuously for 32.5 h and charge/discharge very stably for 2200 h (440 cycles), which is evidently superior to aqueous ZABs (only 0/0.25 h, and 50/25 h (10/5 cycles) by mild/alkaline electrolyte replenishment). This study provides a strategy to solve both storage and sluggish kinetics issues that have been plaguing ZABs for centuries, opening up a new avenue to the industrial application of ZABs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep learning is revolutionizing structural biology to an unprecedented extent. Spearheaded by DeepMind&#8217;s Alphafold2, structural models of often high quality can be generated, and are now available for most known proteins, as well as many protein interactions. The next challenge will be to leverage this rich structural corpus to learn about binding: which protein can contact which partners, and at what affinity? In a recent study, Chang and Perez have presented an elegant approach towards this challenging goal, for interactions that involve a short peptide binding to its receptor. The basic idea is straightforward: given a receptor that binds to two peptides, if the receptor sequence is presented with both peptides together at the same time, AlphaFold2 should model the tighter binding peptide into the binding site, while excluding the second. A simple idea that works!</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemistry provides an environmentally benign platform to develop more sustainable chemical processes by limiting raw materials, energy use, and waste generation while using physically smaller equipment. A continuously growing research community has been steadily showcasing examples of beneficial mechanochemistry applications at both laboratory and preparative scales. Given the yet unstandardised nature of mechanochemical processes compared to solution&#8208;based chemistry, scaling up is still a nascent discipline. The purpose of this review is to highlight similarities, differences and challenges of the various approaches that have been successfully applied for a range of chemical applications at various scales. We hope to provide a discussion starting point for those interested in further developing mechanochemical processes for commercial use and/or industrialisation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic groups are one of the key pillars of contemporary chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. For instance, the group of 3&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds &#8211; such as aziridines, azirines, and oxaziridines &#8211; possess unique electronic and structural properties which underlie their potential and applicability as covalent tools. The &#945;&#8208;lactams are also members of this group of compounds, however, their utility within the field remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate an &#945;&#8208;lactam reagent (AM2) that is tolerant to aqueous buffers while being reactive towards biologically relevant nucleophiles. Interestingly, carboxylesterases 1 and 2 (CES1/2), both serine hydrolases with key roles in endo&#8208; and xenobiotic metabolism, were found as primary covalent targets for AM2 in HepG2 liver cancer cells. All in all, our study constitutes the starting point for the further development and exploration of &#945;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based electrophilic probes in covalent chemical biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Trialkoxysilane Exchange: Scope, Mechanism, Cryptates and pH&#8208;Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) of the Si&#8722;O&#160;bond holds unique opportunities, but has rarely been employed to&#160;assemble discrete molecular architectures. This may be due to&#160;the harsh conditions required to initiate exchange reactions at&#160;silicon in aprotic solvents. Herein, we provide a comprehensive&#160;experimental and computational account on the reaction of&#160;trialkoxysilanes with alcohols and identify mild conditions for rapid&#160;exchange in aprotic solvents. Substituent, solvent and salt effects&#160;are uncovered, understood and exploited for the construction of&#160;sila&#8208;orthoester cryptates. A sharp, divergent pH&#8208;response of the&#160;obtained cages renders this substance class attractive for future&#160;applications well beyond host&#8208;guest chemistry, for instance, in&#160;drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Time Scale on the Reaction Mechanism of CO Oxidation over a Au/TiO2 Catalystt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Knowledge of the reaction mechanism is key for rational catalyst improvement. Traditionally mechanistic studies focus on structure and the reaction conditions like temperature, pH, pressure, etc, whereas the time dimension is often overlooked. Here, we demonstrate the influence of time on the mechanism of a catalytic reaction. A dual catalytic mechanism was identified for the CO oxidation over Au/TiO2 by time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy coupled with modulation excitation spectroscopy. During the first seconds CO on the gold particles is the only reactive species. As the reaction proceeds the redox properties of TiO2 dominate the catalytic activity through electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI). CO induces the reduction and reconstruction of TiO2 whereas oxygen leads to its oxidation. The activity of the catalyst follows the spectroscopic signature of the EMSI. These findings demonstrate the power of studying the short&#8208;time kinetics for mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Cihunamides, Macrocyclic Antibacterial RiPPs with a Unique C&#8208;N Linkage Formed by CYP450 Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cihunamides A&#8208;D (1&#8208;4), novel antibacterial RiPPs, were isolated from volcanic island&#8208;derived Streptomyces sp. The structures of 1&#8208;4 were elucidated by 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR, MS, and chemical derivatizations; they contain a tetrapeptide core composed of WNIW, cyclized by a unique C&#8208;N linkage between two Trp units. Genome mining of the producer strain revealed two biosynthetic genes encoding a cytochrome P450 enzyme and a precursor peptide. Heterologous co&#8208;expression of the core genes demonstrated the biosynthesis of cihunamides via a P450&#8208;mediated oxidative Trp&#8208;Trp crosslinking. Further bioinformatic analysis uncovered 252 homologous gene clusters, including that of tryptorubins, which possess a distinct Trp&#8208;Trp linkage. Cihunamides do not display non&#8208;canonical atropisomerism shown in tryptorubins, which are the founding members of the &#8220;atropitide&#8221; family. Therefore, we propose to use a new RiPP family name &#8220;bitryptides&#8221; for cihunamides, tryptorubins, and their congeners, wherein the Trp&#8208;Trp linkages define the structural class rather than non&#8208;canonical atropisomerism.</dc:description>

         <title>Organohydrogels with High&#8208;speed Lubrication via Confining Polymer Chain Mobility by Interpenetrated Heteronetwork</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels with pure hydrophilic network have received much attention due to their excellent low frictional behavior. However, the lubrication performance of hydrogels is not satisfied under high&#8208;speed condition due to the energy dissipation caused by adsorbed polymer chains as well as the failure of lubricating mechanisms accompanied by the transition of lubrication regime. In this work, interpenetrating double&#8208;network organohydrogels were constructed by combining hydrophilic and oleophilic polymer networks to modify the physiochemical properties of surface polymer chains, especially the chain mobility. The oleophilic polymer network spatially restricting the mobility of the swollen hydrophilic network in water, resulted in a low coefficient of friction (ca. 0.01) compared with conventional hydrogels at high speed (0.1m/s). Meanwhile, the organohydrogels had superior wear resistance, with almost no wear observed on the sliding track after 5k cycles of rubbing at high speed. The design concept of organohydrogels can be extended to a variety of low&#8208;wear, highly&#8208;lubricating materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Observation of Asymmetric Oxidation Catalysis with B20 Chiral Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous processes for enantiomeric processes based on inorganic crystals have been a topic of resurgent interest. However, it remains a challenge to answer the question of what the driving forces for the emergence of homochirality in nature and chemical reactions are. Here, we propose one possible driver of enantioselectivity, namely orbital angular momentum (OAM) polarization. Enantioselective recognition of 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) was achieved by using B20 group PdGa crystals. Orbital textures of PdGa enantiomers suggest large OAM polarization for the bands near the Fermi level and carrying opposite signs. A positive or a negative magnetization in the [111] direction is expected depending on the handedness of PdGa crystal. This leads to the difference in adsorption energy between PdGa chiral crystals and DOPA molecules, depending on the pairing ability between the O 2p (DOPA) and Pd 4d orbital (PdGa). These results provide a new route to achieving enantioselectivity with pure inorganic crystals and may hold an answer to the origin of chirality in nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Pore Size Modulation in Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enabling High Performance Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pore size plays a critical role in determining the performance of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in catalysis, sensing, and gas storage or separation. However, revealing the pore&#8208;size/property relationship remains extremely challenging because ideal structure models possessing different pore sizes but having the same components are lacking. In this work, a solvent&#8208;coordination directed structure swelling method was developed for modulating the ratio between the large and narrow pore phases of a flexible MOF, MIL&#8208;88B. Pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent gas sensitivity and selectivity were studied for the first time in the MIL&#8208;88B samples. The optimized MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;20% sample showed one of the best sensing performances among all the reported MOF&#8208;based H2S&#8208;sensing materials. This work not only provides a method to synthesize ideal structure models for revealing the relationship between pore&#8208;size and properties, but also may inspire the development of high&#8208;performance gas sensing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sodium Carbazolide and Derivatives as Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Replacing widely used organic liquid electrolytes with solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) could effectively solve the safety issues in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Efforts on seeking novel solid&#8208;state electrolytes have been continued for decades. However, issues about SSEs still exist, such as low ionic conductivity at ambient temperature, difficulty in manufacturing, low electrochemical stability, poor compatibility with electrodes, etc. Here, sodium carbazolide (Na&#8208;CZ) and its THF&#8208;coordinated derivatives are rationally fabricated as Na+ conductors, and two of their crystal structures are successfully solved. Among these materials, THF&#8208;coordinated complexes exhibit fast Na+ conductivities, i.e., 1.20&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 and 1.95&#215;10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1 at 90 &#176;C for Na&#8208;CZ&#8208;1THF and Na&#8208;CZ&#8208;2THF, respectively, which are among the top Na+ conductors under the same condition. Furthermore, stable Na plating/stripping is observed even over 400 h cycling, showing outstanding interfacial stability and compatibility against Na electrode. More advantages such as ease of synthesis, low&#8208;cost, and cold pressing for molding can be obtained. In situ NMR results revealed that the evaporation of THF may play an essential role in the Na+ migration, where the movement of THF creates defects/vacancies and facilitates the migration of Na+.</dc:description>

The development of catalyst&#8208;controlled methods for direct functionalization of two distinct C&#8722;H bonds represents an appealing approach for C&#8722;C formations in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we describe an organocatalytic approach for straightforward acylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds employing readily available aldehyde as &#8220;acyl source&#8221; involving dehydrogenative coupling of aldehydes with ether, amine, or benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds. The developed method affords a broad range of ketones under mild conditions. Mechanistically, simple ortho&#8208;cyanoiodobenzene is essential in the oxidative radical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis to give a ketyl radical and C(sp3) radical through a rarely explored intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer pathway, rendering the acylative C&#8722;C formations in high efficiency under a metal&#8208; and light&#8208;free catalytic conditions. Moreover, the prepared products show promising anti&#8208;bacterial activities that shall encourage further investigations on novel agrochemical development.

         <title>Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Recycling of FeX2/FeX3 for Efficient Halogenation of C&#8722;H Bonds Using NaX</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An FeX2 coupled semiconductor system accelerates oxygen reduction and halogen radical generation, resulting in efficient, selective, and continuous photocatalytic halogenation using NaX as the halogen source under mild conditions.







Abstract
Environmental&#8208;friendly halogenation of C&#8722;H bonds using abundant, non&#8208;toxic halogen salts is in high demand in various chemical industries, yet the efficiency and selectivity of laboratory available protocols are far behind the conventional photolytic halogenation process which uses hazardous halogen sources. Here we report an FeX2 (X=Br, Cl) coupled semiconductor system for efficient, selective, and continuous photocatalytic halogenation using NaX as halogen source under mild conditions. Herein, FeX2 catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen and the consumption of generated oxygen radicals, thus boosting the generation of halogen radicals and elemental halogen for direct halogenation and indirect halogenation via the formation of FeX3. Recycling of FeX2 and FeX3 during the photocatalytic process enables the halogenation of a wide range of hydrocarbons in a continuous flow, rendering it a promising method for applications.

         <dc:description>
A Pd0 complex can mediate dehydrogenative formation of 2,4&#8208;diene systems from &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls in the presence of 2,6&#8208;DMBQ (2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone), which undergo vinylogous addition to imines via auto&#8208;tandem Pd0&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Lewis base catalysis. Both chemically inverse &#948;&#8208;regioselective aza&#8208;Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts and &#945;&#8208;regioselective normal ones are obtained switchably and stereoselectively by tuning catalytic conditions.







Abstract
&#963;&#8208;Lewis base&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective aza&#8208;Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction of &#945;,&#946;,&#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated systems remains a challenge due to the intrinsic covalent activation mode. Here we demonstrate that a Pd0 complex can mediate the dehydrogenative reaction of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated compounds to give corresponding electron&#8208;poor dienes, which further undergo &#948;&#8208;regioselective umpolung Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type addition to imines via auto&#8208;tandem Pd0&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Lewis base catalysis. After &#946;&#8208;H elimination of in situ formed PdII&#8208;complexes, unprecedented and chemically inverse aza&#8208;MBH&#8208;type adducts are finally furnished with fair to outstanding enantioselectivity, and a diversity of functional groups and both ketimine and aldimine acceptors can be well tolerated. Moreover, switchable &#945;&#8208;regioselective normal aza&#8208;MBH&#8208;type reaction also can be realized by tuning catalytic conditions, whereas moderate to good enantioselectivity with low to excellent Z/E&#8208;selectivity is attained.

         <title>A Strong&#8208;Acid&#8208;Resistant [Th6] Cluster&#8208;Based Framework for Effectively and Size&#8208;Selectively Catalyzing Reductive Amination of Aldehydes with N,N&#8208;Dimethylformamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong&#8208;acid&#8208;resistant [Th6] cluster&#8208;based framework containing stacked nanocages was constructed and demonstrated excellent efficiency and stability in the reductive amination of various aldehydes with N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide as the amino source, reductant and solvent. In addition, this catalyst displayed a catalytic size&#8208;selectivity for aldehydes that has not been observed previously for this reaction.







Abstract
Utilization of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) as an amine source and reductant for synthesizing tertiary amines is a promising way to replace the substrates formaldehyde and dimethylamine, and it is desirable to seek porous acid&#8208;resistant catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis of this reaction. Herein, a robust metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) {[Th6O4(OH)4(H2O)6(BCP)3]&#8901;10&#8201;DMF}n (1) containing stacked nanocages with a diameter of 1.55&#8197;nm was constructed. Compound 1 can maintain its single&#8208;crystal structure even kept in air at 400&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;h, and in DMF or water at 200&#8201;&#176;C for 7&#8197;days. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the high interaction energy between the [Th6O4(OH)4(H2O)6]12+ clusters and ligands was responsible for the excellent stability of 1. Catalytic investigations revealed that 1 can effectively and size&#8208;selectively catalyze the reductive amination of aldehydes with DMF, and it can be reused at least five times without obvious loss in catalytic activity.

         <title>Photoenzymatic Hydrosulfonylation for the Stereoselective Synthesis of Chiral Sulfones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoenzymatic strategy for radical&#8208;mediated stereoselective hydrosulfonylation has been developed. An engineered OYE1 enzyme enabled the generation of a series of &#946;&#8208;chiral sulfonyl compounds in high yields (up to 92&#8201;%) with excellent e.r. values (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).







Abstract
Chiral sulfones are recurrent motifs in pharmaceuticals and bioactive molecules. Although chemical methods have been developed to afford &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208; chiral sulfones, these protocols rely heavily on the pre&#8208;synthesis of structurally complicated starting materials and chiral metal complexes. Herein, we described a photoenzymatic approach for the radical&#8208;mediated stereoselective hydrosulfonylation. Engineered variants of ene reductases provide efficient biocatalysts for this transformation, enabling to achieve a series of &#946;&#8208;chiral sulfonyl compounds with high yields (up to 92&#8201;%) and excellent e.r. values (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).

         <title>Photo&#8208;RAFT Polymerization for Hydrogel Synthesis through Barriers and Development of Light&#8208;Regulated Healable Hydrogels under NIR Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This photo&#8208;RAFT process enables the preparation of hydrogels under low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light without deoxygenation. Exploiting enhanced penetration of NIR light, photoinduced gelation is effectively performed through barriers. Notably, RAFT units, i.e., thiocarbonylthio groups, embedded in hydrogel networks facilitate the reactivation of polymer chains under NIR wavelengths, enabling the photoinduced healing of hydrogels through non&#8208;transparent barriers.







Abstract
We report an aqueous and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light mediated photoinduced reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (photo&#8208;RAFT) polymerization system catalyzed by tetrasulfonated zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPcS4&#8722;) in the presence of peroxides. Taking advantage of its fast polymerization rates and high oxygen tolerance, this system is successfully applied for the preparation of hydrogels. Exploiting the enhanced penetration of NIR light, photoinduced gelation is effectively performed through non&#8208;transparent biological barriers. Notably, the RAFT agents embedded in these hydrogel networks can be reactivated on&#8208;demand, enabling the hydrogel healing under NIR light irradiation. In contrast to the minimal healing capability (&lt;15&#8201;%) of hydrogels prepared by free radical polymerization (FRP), RAFT&#8208;mediated networks display more than 80&#8201;% recovery of tensile strength. Although healable polymer networks under UV and blue lights have already been established, this work is the first photochemistry system using NIR light, facilitating photoinduced healing of hydrogels through thick non&#8208;transparent barriers.

         <title>Tailoring *H Intermediate Coverage on the CuAl2O4/CuO Catalyst for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a *H&#8208;intermediate&#8208;mediating strategy for ethanol electroproduction from CO2RR. The findings reveal that the in situ generated CuAl2O4 in Cu&#8208;based catalyst could accelerate water dissociation and tailor *H intermediate coverage, which favors hydrogenation of the *HCCOH to ethanol. This study directs a feasible avenue for mediating *H intermediate coverage and tailoring *H&#8208;involved reduction reaction pathways on an efficient and durable Cu&#8208;based oxide catalyst.







Abstract
The direct electrochemical conversion of CO2 to multi&#8208;carbon products offers a promising pathway for producing value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable electricity. However, producing ethanol remains a challenge because of the competitive ethylene formation and hydrogen evolution reactions. Herein, we propose an active hydrogen (*H)&#8208;intermediate&#8208;mediating strategy for ethanol electroproduction on a layered precursor&#8208;derived CuAl2O4/CuO catalyst. The catalyst delivered a Faradaic efficiency of 70&#8201;% for multi&#8208;carbon products and 41&#8201;% for ethanol at current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibited a continuous 150&#8197;h durability in a flow cell. The intensive spectroscopic studies combined with theoretical calculations revealed that the in situ generated CuAl2O4 could tailor *H intermediate coverage and the elevated *H coverage favors the hydrogenation of the *HCCOH intermediate, accounting for the increased yield of ethanol. This work directs a pathway for enhancing ethanol electroproduction from CO2 reduction by tailoring *H intermediate coverage.

         <title>C&#8722;H Functionalization and Allylic Amination for Post&#8208;Polymerization Modification of Polynorbornenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a selenium catalyzed method for C&#8722;H activation and allylic amination of polynorbornene. Ultimately, our method achieves high and tunable degrees of functionalization, yielding materials with tunable thermal properties.







Abstract
Post&#8208;polymerization modification (PPM) via direct C&#8722;H functionalization is a powerful synthetic strategy to convert polymer feed&#8208;stocks into value&#8208;added products. We found that a metal&#8208;free, Se&#8208;catalyzed allylic C&#8722;H amination provided an efficient method for PPM of polynorbornenes (PNBs) produced via ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization. Inherent to the mechanism of the allylic amination, PPM on PNBs preserved the alkene functional groups along the polymer backbone, while also avoiding transposition of the double bonds. Amination using a series of aryl sulfonamides led to good control over the degree of functionalization, access to a range of functionalities, and tunable thermal properties from the resulting polymers.

         <title>Glass Formation in Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The glassy state of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) has recently been identified, exhibiting diverse properties complementary to the crystalline state. This mini review presents an overview of the structural chemistry of both two&#8208;dimensional and three&#8208;dimensional HOIPs, and a comprehensive discussion on their glass formation processes. Current advances in melt&#8208;quenched glasses formed from HOIPs are discussed, and an outlook for the future of this new family of materials is offered.







Abstract
Crystalline materials have governed the development of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), giving rise to a variety of fascinating applications such as solar cells and optoelectronic devices. With increasing interest in non&#8208;crystalline systems, the glassy state of HOIPs has recently been identified. Here, the basic building blocks of crystalline HOIPs appear to be retained, though their glasses lack long&#8208;range periodic order. The emerging family of glasses formed from HOIPs exhibits diverse properties, complementary to their crystalline state. This mini review describes the chemical diversity of both three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional crystalline HOIPs and demonstrates how glasses are produced from these materials. Specifically, current achievements in melt&#8208;quenched glasses formed from HOIPs are highlighted. We conclude with our perspective on the future of this new family of materials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Start CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a Reaction with Caged crRNA Enables Rapid and Sensitive Nucleic Acid Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust photocontrolled one&#8208;pot assay was developed by combining a light&#8208;start CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a reaction system and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) for nucleic acid detection. With this platform, the clinical samples of Epstein&#8208;Barr virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) samples can be effectively detected.







Abstract
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is a promising platform for nucleic acid detection. Regulating the CRISPR reaction would be extremely useful to improve the detection efficiency and speed of CRISPR diagnostic applications. Here, we have developed a light&#8208;start CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a reaction by employing caged CRISPR RNA (crRNA). When combined with recombinase polymerase amplification, a robust photocontrolled one&#8208;pot assay is achieved. The photocontrolled one&#8208;pot assay is simpler and is 50&#8208;fold more sensitive than the conventional assay. This improved detection efficiency also facilitates the development of a faster CRISPR diagnostic method. The detection of clinical samples demonstrated that 10&#8211;20&#8197;min is sufficient for effective detection, which is much faster than the current gold&#8208;standard technique PCR. We expect this advance in CRISPR diagnostics to promote its widespread detection applications in biomedicine, agriculture, and food safety.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve a circular polymer economy, it is desirable to convert polymers into monomers or useful building blocks. This Minireview summarizes recent developments on polymer degradation and recycling enabled by mechanochemistry.







Abstract
The accumulation of plastic waste, due to lack of recycling, has led to serious environmental pollution. Although mechanical recycling can alleviate this issue, it inevitably reduces the molecular weight and weakens the mechanical properties of materials and is not suitable for mixed materials. Chemical recycling, on the other hand, breaks the polymer into monomers or small&#8208;molecule constituents, allowing for the preparation of materials of quality comparable to that of the virgin polymers and can be applied to mixed materials. Mechanochemical degradation and recycling leverages the advantages of mechanical techniques, such as scalability and efficient energy use, to achieve chemical recycling. We summarize recent progress in mechanochemical degradation and recycling of synthetic polymers, including both commercial polymers and those designed for more efficient mechanochemical degradation. We also point out the limitations of mechanochemical degradation and present our perspectives on how the challenges can be mitigated for a circular polymer economy.

         <title>Towards Automated Microfluidic&#8208;based Platforms: Optimizing Hydrogenation Efficiency of Nitrobenzene through &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions in Pd Nanoparticles on Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Put&amp;Play Automated Microplatform(PPAM) was established herein to enhance the hydrogenation performance of palladium nanoparticles on the covalent organic frameworks (Pd/TP&#8208;COFs) as well as showing the unconventional superiority of coating over mixing in heterogeneous reactions.







Abstract
Microplatform with timed automata has been leveraged for guiding the preparation of molecules, whereas the requirement of handling expertise and sophisticated instrument is inevitable in combination with heterogeneous catalysis. Here we report a microfluidic&#8208;based autolab with open structures, called Put &amp; Play Automated Microplatform (PPAM). It shows the efficient hydrogenation performance of palladium nanoparticles on the triphenylene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (Pd/TP&#8208;COFs) in which the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions of TP rings in the vicinity of Pd is optimized by easy change&#8208;over of catalyst and simple tuning of reactor geometries in PPAM. Using experiment/simulation of the Pd/TP&#8208;COFs coating (PCC) and mixing (PCM) across PPAM with different channel sizes, the turnover frequencies are 60&#8197;times the commonly used batch reactor, and aniline productivity of 8.8&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 is achieved in 0.09&#8197;cm3. This work will raise awareness about the benefits of the catalyst&#8208;loaded microplatform in future materials performance campaigns.

         <title>Exclusive Co&#8208;N4 Sites Confined in Two&#8208;dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Layers Enabling Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction at Industrial&#8208;Level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Together with the exclusive Co&#8208;N4 sites, enlarged surface area, improved electrical conductivity and CO2 adsorption capacity, Co porphyrin&#8208;based porous organic layers exhibit optimal activity for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO due to the strong *COOH binding and moderate *CO adsorption. Moreover, industrial&#8208;level current above 200&#8197;mA can be achieved in a membrane electrode assembly device with near&#8208;unity CO selectivity over 20&#8197;h.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework catalysts bring new opportunities for CO2 electrocatalysis. Herein, we first conduct density&#8208;functional theory calculations and predict that Co&#8208;based porphyrin porous organic layers (Co&#8208;PPOLs) exhibit good activity for CO2 conversion because of the low *CO adsorption energy at Co&#8208;N4 sites, which facilitates *CO desorption and CO formation. Then, we prepare two&#8208;dimensional Co&#8208;PPOLs with exclusive Co&#8208;N4 sites through a facile surfactant&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up method. The ultrathin feature ensures the exposure of catalytic centers. Together with large specific area, high electrical conductivity and CO2 adsorption capability, Co&#8208;PPOLs achieve a peak faradaic efficiency for CO production (FECO=94.2&#8201;%) at a moderate potential in CO2 electroreduction, accompanied with good stability. Moreover, Co&#8208;PPOLs reach an industrial&#8208;level current above 200&#8197;mA in a membrane electrode assembly reactor, and maintain near&#8208;unity CO selectivity (FECO&gt;90&#8201;%) over 20&#8197;h in CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Chiral Control of Gas&#8208;Phase Molecules using Microwave Pulses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in the area of chiral control using rotational spectroscopy are highlighted. Microwave three&#8208;wave mixing is a phase&#8208;sensitive technique for enantiodifferentiation, it is discussed here together with its extension to create coherent enantiomer&#8208;selective population enrichment. This scheme results in enantioselective enrichment in a chosen rotational state that holds interesting promises for advanced chirality experiments.







Abstract
Microwave three&#8208;wave mixing has emerged as a novel approach for studying chiral molecules in the gas phase. This technique employs resonant microwave pulses and is a non&#8208;linear and coherent approach. It serves as a robust method to differentiate between the enantiomers of chiral molecules and to determine the enantiomeric excess, even in complex chiral mixtures. Besides such analytical applications, the use of tailored microwave pulses allows us to control and manipulate chirality at the molecular level. Here, an overview of some recent developments in the area of microwave three&#8208;wave mixing and its extension to enantiomer&#8208;selective population transfer is provided. The latter is an important step towards enantiomer separation&#8212;in energy and finally in space. In the last section, we present new experimental results on how to improve enantiomer&#8208;selective population transfer to achieve an enantiomeric excess of about 40&#8201;% in the rotational level of interest using microwave pulses alone.

         <title>Inherently Emissive Puromycin Analogues for Live Cell Labelling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inherently emissive puromycin analogues can fluorescently tag newly synthesized proteins in live&#8208;cells without the need for further chemical treatments.







Abstract
Puromycin derivatives containing an emissive thieno[3,4&#8208;d]&#8208;pyrimidine core, modified with azetidine and 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine as Me2N surrogates, exhibit translation inhibition and bactericidal activity similar to the natural antibiotic. The analogues are capable of cellular puromycylation of nascent peptides, generating emissive products without any follow&#8208;up chemistry. The 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine&#8208;containing analogue is shown to fluorescently label newly translated peptides and be visualized in both live and fixed HEK293T cells and rat hippocampal neurons.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Permeable Dual&#8208;Mechanism&#8208;Driven Graphene Oxide Framework Membranes for Precision Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;posterior&#8221; interfacial polymerization (p&#8208;IP) strategy is developed to fabricate a high&#8208;surface positively charged graphene oxide (GO) framework membrane for ion sieving. The generated electrostatic repulsion of ions from the positively charged surface, in conjunction with reinforced size exclusion from the p&#8208;IP&#8208;formed polyamide network, endows the membrane with outstanding performance for ion separation.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional graphene oxide (GO) membranes are gaining popularity as a promising means to address global water scarcity. However, current GO membranes fail to sufficiently exclude angstrom&#8208;sized ions from solution. Herein, a de novo &#8220;posterior&#8221; interfacial polymerization (p&#8208;IP) strategy is reported to construct a tailor&#8208;made polyamide (PA) network in situ in an ultrathin GO membrane to strengthen size exclusion while imparting a positively charged membrane surface to repel metal ions. The electrostatic repulsion toward metal ions, coupled with the reinforced size exclusion, synergistically drives the high&#8208;efficiency metal ion separation through the synthesized positively charged GO framework (PC&#8208;GOF) membrane. This dual&#8208;mechanism&#8208;driven PC&#8208;GOF membrane exhibits superior metal ion rejection, anti&#8208;fouling ability, good operational stability, and ultra&#8208;high permeance (five times that of pristine GO membranes), enabling a sound step towards a sustainable water&#8208;energy&#8208;food nexus.

&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;posterior&#8221; interfacial polymerization (p-IP) strategy is developed to fabricate a high-surface positively charged graphene oxide (GO) framework membrane for ion sieving. The generated electrostatic repulsion of ions from the positively charged surface, in conjunction with reinforced size exclusion from the p-IP-formed polyamide network, endows the membrane with outstanding performance for ion separation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional graphene oxide (GO) membranes are gaining popularity as a promising means to address global water scarcity. However, current GO membranes fail to sufficiently exclude angstrom-sized ions from solution. Herein, a de novo &#8220;posterior&#8221; interfacial polymerization (p-IP) strategy is reported to construct a tailor-made polyamide (PA) network in situ in an ultrathin GO membrane to strengthen size exclusion while imparting a positively charged membrane surface to repel metal ions. The electrostatic repulsion toward metal ions, coupled with the reinforced size exclusion, synergistically drives the high-efficiency metal ion separation through the synthesized positively charged GO framework (PC-GOF) membrane. This dual-mechanism-driven PC-GOF membrane exhibits superior metal ion rejection, anti-fouling ability, good operational stability, and ultra-high permeance (five times that of pristine GO membranes), enabling a sound step towards a sustainable water-energy-food nexus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Pairing&#8208;Induced Electrochemiluminescence Enhancement from Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diads Decorated with Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane as an Electrochemical Protector</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elaborate metal&#8208;free electrochemiluminescence (ECL) systems require highly robust organic emitters in the radical form. In their Research Article (e202301109), Keishiro Tahara, Masaaki Abe, and co&#8208;workers used a classical Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 as an electrochemical protector of donor&#8211;acceptor emitters, leading to the discovery of Lewis pairing&#8208;induced ECL enhancement. The Lewis acid also converted the molecular arrangements of the emitters, playing a unique role in crystalline film ECL.

         <title>Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of Enantiopure Bicyclic Ether&#8208;ester Monomers toward Closed&#8208;loop Recyclable and Crystalline Stereoregular Polyesters via Chemical Upcycling of Bioplastic</title>

         <dc:description>
Upcycling of P3HB into enantiopure bicyclic ether&#8208;ester monomers, and their ROP to produce crystalline stereoregular polyesters and their reversed depolymerization.







Abstract
Although great successes have been achieved, the preparation of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polyesters with high working temperatures still remains as a big challenge. Herein, we present the syntheses of a series of enantiopure bicyclic ether&#8208;ester monomers by upcycling of poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) bioplastic. The &#8220;living&#8221;/controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerizations of these enantiopure monomers to produce stereoregular polyesters with controlled molecular weights and well&#8208;defined chain ends were achieved. The effects of stereoconfiguration and substituent on polymerization kinetics and thermodynamics as well as the thermal properties of resultant polyesters were investigated. Of note, the stereoregular polyesters are semi&#8208;crystalline materials with melting temperatures up to 176&#8201;&#176;C, even higher than the commodity polyolefin plastics. These polyesters can be depolymerized back to recover pristine monomers, thus successfully establishing a closed&#8208;loop life cycle.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Based Artificial Receptors as Transmembrane Signal Transduction Systems for Protocellular Communication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;based dimers are designed as artificial membrane receptors for transmembrane signal transduction and amplification without physical mass exchange, which facilitates the establishment of a signalling network in protocell colonies.







Abstract
The ability to reproduce signal transduction and cellular communication in artificial cell systems is significant in synthetic protobiology. Here, we describe an artificial transmembrane signal transduction through low pH&#8208;mediated formation of the i&#8208;motif and dimerization of DNA&#8208;based artificial membrane receptors, which is coupled to the occurrence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer and the activation of G&#8208;quadruplex/hemin&#8208;mediated fluorescence amplification inside giant unilamellar vesicles. Moreover, an intercellular signal communication model is established when the extravesicular H+ input is replaced by coacervate microdroplets, which activate the dimerization of the artificial receptors, and subsequent fluorescence production or polymerization in giant unilamellar vesicles. This study represents a crucial step towards designing artificial signalling systems with environmental response, and provides an opportunity to establish signalling networks in protocell colonies.

         <title>Automated Solid&#8208;Phase Oligo(disulfide) Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for the automated synthesis of sequence&#8208;specific oligo(disulfides) on a solid support was developed. Six different dithiol monomer building blocks were prepared and applied in the synthesis of disulfide oligomers by extension of a T15 DNA strand. The disulfides were degraded in the presence of millmolar levels of glutathione, and a mechanism for cargo release upon reduction was also developed.







Abstract
A method for automated solid&#8208;phase synthesis of oligo(disulfide)s was developed. It is based on a synthetic cycle comprising removal of a protecting group from a resin&#8208;bound thiol followed by treatment with monomers containing a thiosulfonate as an activated precursor. For ease of purification and characterization, the disulfide oligomers were synthesized as extensions of oligonucleotides on an automated oligonucleotide synthesizer. Six different dithiol monomer building blocks were synthesized. Sequence&#8208;defined oligomers of up to seven disulfide units were synthesized and purified. The sequence of the oligomer was confirmed by tandem MS/MS analysis. One of the monomers contains a coumarin cargo that can be released by a thiol&#8208;mediated release mechanism. When the monomer was incorporated into an oligo(disulfide) and subjected to reducing conditions, the cargo was released under near&#8208;physiological conditions, which underlines the potential use of these molecules in drug delivery systems.

For ease of purification and characterization, the disulfide oligomers were synthesized as extensions of oligonucleotides on an automated oligonucleotide synthesizer. Six different dithiol monomer building blocks were synthesized. Sequence-defined oligomers of up to seven disulfide units were synthesized and purified. The sequence of the oligomer was confirmed by tandem MS/MS analysis. One of the monomers contains a coumarin cargo that can be released by a thiol-mediated release mechanism. When the monomer was incorporated into an oligo(disulfide) and subjected to reducing conditions, the cargo was released under near-physiological conditions, which underlines the potential use of these molecules in drug delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of the Lanthipeptide Curvocidin&#8197;and Structural Insights into its Trifunctional Synthetase CuvL</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Class&#8208;IV lanthipeptide synthetase CuvL forms a central reaction chamber by arranging its three catalytic domains in circular manner. The precursor peptide of curvocidin uses its N&#8208;terminal leader region to wrap around the kinase N&#8208;lobe of CuvL, while its C&#8208;terminal substrate region can shuttle within the chamber for iterative phosphorylation, &#946;&#8208;elimination and thioether&#8208;ring installment.







Abstract
Lanthipeptides are ribosomally&#8208;synthesized natural products from bacteria featuring stable thioether&#8208;crosslinks and various bioactivities. Herein, we report on a new clade of tricyclic class&#8208;IV lanthipeptides with curvocidin from Thermomonospora curvata as its first representative. We obtained crystal structures of the corresponding lanthipeptide synthetase CuvL that showed a circular arrangement of its kinase, lyase and cyclase domains, forming a central reaction chamber for the iterative substrate processing involving nine catalytic steps. The combination of experimental data and artificial intelligence&#8208;based structural models identified the N&#8208;terminal subdomain of the kinase domain as the primary site of substrate recruitment. The ribosomal precursor peptide of curvocidin employs an amphipathic &#945;&#8208;helix in its leader region as an anchor to CuvL, while its substrate core shuttles within the central reaction chamber. Our study thus reveals general principles of domain organization and substrate recruitment of class&#8208;IV and class&#8208;III lanthipeptide synthetases.

         <title>Enantioselective Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Pauson&#8211;Khand Reactions of 1,6&#8208;Chloroenynes with 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Olefins</title>

         <dc:description>
An enantioselective RhI&#8208;catalyzed Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction (PKR) using 1,6&#8208;chloroenynes with challenging 1,1&#8208;disubstituted olefins is described. DFT calculations reveal that the halide pre&#8208;polarizes the alkyne to lower the barrier for the metallacycle formation and provides the proper steric profile to permit a favorable enantiodetermining interaction between the 1,6&#8208;chloroenyne and the chiral diphosphine ligand in the rhodium complex.







Abstract
An enantioselective rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed Pauson&#8211;Khand reaction (PKR) using 1,6&#8208;chloroenynes that contain challenging 1,1&#8208;disubstituted olefins is described. In contrast to the previous studies with these types of substrates, which are only suitable for a single type of tether and alkyne substituent, the new approach results in a more expansive substrate scope, including carbon and heteroatom tethers with polar and non&#8208;polar substituents on the alkene. DFT calculations provide critical insight into the role of the halide, which pre&#8208;polarizes the alkyne to lower the barrier for metallacycle formation and provides the proper steric profile to promote a favorable enantiodetermining interaction between substrate and chiral diphosphine ligand. Hence, the chloroalkyne enables the efficient and enantioselective PKR with 1,6&#8208;enynes that contain challenging 1,1&#8208;disubstituted olefins, thereby representing a new paradigm for enantioselective reactions involving 1,6&#8208;enynes.

         <title>Manipulating Coulombic Efficiency of Cathodes in Aqueous Zinc Batteries by Anion Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically investigated how anions manipulate the coulombic efficiency of cathodes of zinc batteries for conversion and intercalation chemistry. It was found that the electronic properties of anions, including charge density and its distribution, can tune reactions of the conversion&#8208;type cathode (e.g. iodine, I2) and the intercalation&#8208;type cathode (e.g. vanadium pentoxide, V2O5), leading to significant coulombic efficiency differences.







Abstract
Electrolyte environments, including cations, anions, and solvents are critical for the performance delivery of cathodes of batteries. Most works focused on interactions between cations and cathode materials, in contrast, there is a lack of in&#8208;depth research on the correlation between anions and cathodes. Here, we systematically investigated how anions manipulate the coulombic efficiency (CE) of cathodes of zinc batteries. We take intercalation&#8208;type V2O5 and conversion&#8208;type I2 cathodes as typical cases for profound studies. It was found that electronic properties of anions, including charge density and its distribution, can tune conversion or intercalation reactions, leading to significant CE differences. Using operando visual Raman microscopy and theoretical simulations, we confirm that competitive coordination between anions and I&#8722; can regulate CEs by modulating polyiodide diffusion rates in Zn&#8722;I2 cells. In Zn&#8722;V2O5 cells, anion&#8208;tuned solvation structures vastly affect CEs through varying Zn2+ intercalation kinetics. Conversion I2 cathode achieves a 99&#8201;% CE with highly electron&#8208;donating anions, while anions with preferable charge structures that interact strongly with Zn2+ afford an intercalation V2O5 a nearly 100&#8201;% CE. Understanding the mechanism of anion&#8208;governed CEs will help us evaluate compatibility of electrolytes with electrodes, thus providing a guideline for anion selection and electrolyte design for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;cycling zinc batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The frequent mutation of KRAS oncogene in some of the most lethal human cancers has spurred incredible efforts to develop KRAS inhibitors, yet only one covalent inhibitor for the KRASG12C mutant has been approved to date. New venues to interfere with KRAS signaling are desperately needed. Here, we report a &#8220;localized oxidation&#8208;coupling&#8221; strategy to achieve protein&#8208;specific glycan editing on living cells for disrupting KRAS signaling. This glycan remodeling method exhibits excellent protein and sugar specificity and is applicable to different donor sugars and cell types. Attachment of mannotriose to the terminal galactose/N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine epitopes of integrin &#945;v&#946;3, a membrane receptor upstream of KRAS, blocks its binding to galectin&#8208;3, suppresses the activation of KRAS and downstream effectors, and mitigates KRAS&#8208;driven malignant phenotypes. Our work represents the first successful attempt to interfere with KRAS activity by manipulating membrane receptor glycosylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Defect pyrochlore&#8208;type Mott&#8208;Schottky photocatalysts for enhanced ammonia synthesis at low pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ambient ammonia synthesis coupled with distributed green hydrogen production technology can provide promising solutions for low&#8208;carbon NH3 production and H2 storage. Herein, we reported Ru&#8208;loaded defective pyrochlore K2Ta2O6&#8208;x with remarkable visible&#8208;light absorption and a very low work function, enabling effective visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven ammonia synthesis from N2 and H2 at low pressure down to 0.2 atm. The photocatalytic rate was 2.8 times higher than that of the best previously reported photocatalyst and the photo&#8208;thermal rate at 425K was similar to that of Ru&#8208;loaded black TiO2 at 633K. Compared to perovskite&#8208;type KTaO3&#8208;x with the same composition, the pyrochlore exhibited a 3.7&#8208;fold increase in intrinsic activity due to a higher photoexcited charge separation efficiency and a higher conduction band position. The interfacial Schottky barrier and spontaneous electron transfer between K2Ta2O6&#8208;x and Ru further improve photoexcited charge separation and accumulate energetic electrons to facilitate N2 activation.</dc:description>

The interfacial Schottky barrier and spontaneous electron transfer between K2Ta2O6-x and Ru further improve photoexcited charge separation and accumulate energetic electrons to facilitate N2 activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>C&#8212;H Activation of Unbiased C(sp3)&#8212;H Bonds: Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of 1&#8208;Bromoalkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective functionalization of non&#8208;activated C(sp3)&#8212;H bonds is a major challenge in chemistry, so functional groups are often used to enhance reactivity. Here, we present a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8212;H activation of 1&#8208;bromoalkynes without any sort of electronic, or conformational bias. The reaction proceeds regiospecifically and stereospecifically to the corresponding bromocyclopentene derivatives. The latter can be readily modified, comprising an excellent library of diverse 3D scaffolds for medicinal chemistry. In addition, a mechanistic study has shown that the reaction proceeds via a so far unknown mechanism: a concerted [1,5]&#8208;H shift / C&#8212;C bond formation involving a gold&#8208;stabilized vinylcation&#8208;like transition state.</dc:description>

         <title>Photosynthetic Fixation of CO2 in Alkenes by Heterogeneous Photoredox Catalysis with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven fixation of CO2 in organics has emerged as an appealing alternative for the synthesis of value&#8208;added fine chemicals. Challenges remain in the transformation of CO2 as well as product selectivity due to its thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. Here we develop a boron carbonitride (BCN) with the abundant terminal B/N defects around the mesoporous walls, which essentially enhances surface active sites as well as charge transfer kinetics, boosting the overall rate of CO2 adsorption and activation. In this protocol, anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrocarboxylation of alkenes with CO2 to an extended carbon chain is achieved with good functional group tolerance and specific regioselectivity under visible light irradiation. The mechanistic studies demonstrate the formation of CO2 radical anion intermediate on defective boron carbonitride, leading to the anti&#8208;Markovnikov carboxylation. Gram&#8208;scale reaction, late&#8208;stage carboxylation of natural products and synthesis of anti&#8208;diabetic GPR40 agonists reveal the utility of this method. This study sheds new insight on the design and application of metal&#8208;free semiconductors for the conversion of CO2 in an atom&#8208;economic and sustainable manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming the Ambient Manufacturability&#8208;Performance Bottleneck in Perovskite Nanocrystal Emitters for Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have risen rapidly in luminescence efficiency and color purity. However, their high performance requires careful and complex pre&#8208;treatment of precursors and precise regulation of the reaction atmosphere; otherwise, their emission will be weak and broad. To overcome these limitations, we develop a facile ligand exchange method using a new type of bidentate ligand, which is obtained by reacting cheap sulfur with tributylphosphine (S&#8208;TBP). During ligand exchange, the double bond between P and S atoms breaks and a single bond is formed between them, after which S&#8208;TBP switches into a bidentate ligand and binds to a perovskite NC at two points. With short&#8208;chain S&#8208;TBP ligands that have high spatial position resistance, both NC spacing and surface ligand density can be reduced, thereby improving carrier injection and transport. On the NC surface after ligand exchange, halogen vacancies were substantially filled, leading to a PbSP (Pb, S, and P elements) component&#8208;dominated shell that greatly decreases trap density and enhances material stability. The resulting perovskite NCs are stable and bright with a photoluminescence quantum yield of ~96%, and an external quantum&#160;efficiency of 22%. Note that our ligand&#8208;exchange strategy remains effective even when scaling up, which should accelerate commercialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyne Hydrocyanation toward Ligand&#8208;Controlled Stereodivergent Synthesis of (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;Trisubstituted Acrylonitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydrocyanation of propiolamides for the stereodivergent synthesis of trisubstituted acrylonitriles. This synthetic method tolerated various primary, secondary and tertiary propiolamides. The cautious selection of a suitable ligand is essential to the success of this stereodivergent process. Control experiments indicate the intermediacy of E&#8208;acrylonitriles, which lead to Z&#8208;acrylonitriles via isomerization. The density functional theory calculations suggests that the bidentate ligand L2 enables a feasible cyclometallation/isomerization pathway for the E to Z isomerization, while the monodentate ligand L1 inhibits the isomerization, leading to divergent stereoselectivity. The usefulness of this method can be demonstrated by the readily derivatization of products to give various E&#8208; and Z&#8208;trisubstituted alkenes. In addition, the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;acrylonitrile products have also been successfully employed in cycloaddition reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Recycling of Depolymerization Catalyst and Biodegradable Polyester that Markedly Outperforms Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemically recyclable, circular polymers continue to attract increasing attention, but rendering both catalysts for depolymerization and high&#8208;performance polymers recyclable is a more sustainable yet challenging goal. Here we introduce a dual catalyst/polymer recycling system in that recyclable inorganic phosphomolybdic acid catalyzes selective depolymerization of high&#8208;ceiling&#8208;temperature biodegradable poly(&#948;&#8208;valerolactone), which, upon reaching suitable molecular weight, exhibits outstanding mechanical performance with a high tensile strength of ~66.6 MPa, fracture strain of ~904%, and toughness of ~308 MJ m&#8208;3, and thus markedly outperforms commodity polyolefins, recovering its monomer in pure state and quantitative yield at only 100 &#176;C. In sharp contrast, the uncatalyzed depolymerization not only requires a high temperature of &gt;310 &#176;C but is also low yielding and non&#8208;selective. Importantly, the recovered monomer can be repolymerized as is to reproduce the same polymer, thereby closing the circular loop, and the recycled catalyst can be reused repeatedly for depolymerization runs without loss of its catalytic activity and efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>A Quencher&#8208;Based Blood Autofluorescence&#8208;Suppression&#160;Strategy Enables the Quantification of Trace Analyte in Whole Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise quantification of trace components in whole blood via fluorescence is of great significance. However, the applicability of current fluorescent probes in whole blood is largely hindered by the strong blood autofluorescence. Here, we proposed a blood autofluorescence&#8208;suppressed sensing strategy to develop an activable fluorescent probe for quantification of trace analyte in whole blood.&#160;Based on inner filter effect, by screening fluorophores whose absorption overlapped with the emission of blood, a redshift BODIPY&#160;quencher with an absorption wavelength ranging from 600&#8208;700 nm was selected for its superior quenching efficiency&#160;and high brightness. Two 7&#8208;nitrobenzo[c] [1,2,5] oxadiazole ether groups were introduced onto the BODIPY skeleton for quenching its fluorescence and the response of H2S, a gas signal molecule that can hardly be quantified because of its low concentration in whole blood. Such detection system shows a pretty low background signal and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;back ratio, the probe thus achieved the accurate quantification of endogenous H2S in 20&#8208;fold dilution of whole blood samples, which is the first attempt of quantifying endogenous H2S in whole blood. Moreover, this autofluorescence&#8208;suppressed sensing strategy could be expanded to other trace analytes detection in whole blood, which may accelerate the application of fluorescent probes in clinical blood test</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Salts Containing Cationic Al24&#8208;Hydroxide&#8208;Acetate Clusters from Scalable, Green and Aqueous Synthesis Routes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solution chemistry of aluminum is highly complex and various polyoxocations are known. Here we report on the facile synthesis of a cationic Al24 cluster that forms porous salts of composition [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12]X4, denoted CAU&#8208;55&#8208;X, with X = Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;, I&#8208;, HSO4&#8208;. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction was employed to determine the crystal structures. Various robust and mild synthesis routes for the chloride salt [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12]Cl4 in water were established resulting in high yields (&gt; 95%, 215 g per batch) within minutes. Specific surface areas and H2O capacities with maximum values of up to 930 m2/g and 430 mg/g are observed. The particle size of CAU&#8208;55&#8208;X can be tuned between 140 nm and 1250 nm, permitting its synthesis as stable dispersions or as highly crystalline powders. The positive surface charge of the particles, allow fast and effective adsorption of anionic dye molecules and adsorption of poly&#8208; and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Charge&#8208;Transfer Processes in a Covalently Linked [Ge9]&#8208;Cluster Imine Dyad</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C60 donor dyads in which the carbon cage is covalently linked to an electron&#8208;donating unit have been discussed as one possibility for an electron&#8208;transfer system, and it has been shown that spherical [Ge9] cluster anions show a close relation to fullerenes with respect to their electronic structure. However, the optical properties of these clusters and of functionalized cluster derivatives are almost unknown. We now report on the synthesis of the intensely red [Ge9] cluster linked to an extended &#960;&#8208;electron system. [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2{CH3C=N}&#8208;DAB(II)Dipp]&#8211;&#160; (1&#8211;)is formed upon the reaction of [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2]2&#8211; with bromo&#8208;diazaborole DAB(II)Dipp&#8208;Br in CH3CN (TMS = trimethylsilyl; DAB(II) = 1,3,2&#8208;diazaborole with an unsaturated backbone; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propylphenyl). Reversible protonation of the imine entity in 1&#8211; yields the deep green, zwitterionic cluster [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2{CH3C=N(H)}&#8208;DAB(II)Dipp] (1&#8208;H) and vice versa. Optical spectroscopy combined with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory suggests a charge&#8208;transfer excitation between the cluster and the antibonding &#960;* orbital of the imine moiety as the cause of the intense coloration. An absorption maximum of 1&#8208;H in the red region of the electromagnetic spectrum and the corresponding lowest&#8208;energy excited state at &#955;&#160;=&#160;669&#160;nm make the compound an interesting starting point for further investigations targeting the design of photo&#8208;active cluster compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Green, General and Low&#8208;cost Synthesis of Porous Organic Polymers in Sub&#8208;kilogram Scale for Catalysis and CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic polymers (POPs) with high porosity and tunable functionalities have been widely studied for use in gas separation, catalysis, energy conversion and energy storage. However, the high cost of organic monomers, and the use of toxic solvents and high temperatures during synthesis pose obstacles for large&#8208;scale production. Herein, we report the synthesis of imine and aminal&#8208;linked POPs using inexpensive diamine and dialdehyde monomer in green solvents. Theoretical calculations and control experiments show that using meta&#8208;diamines is crucial for forming aminal linkages and branching porous networks from [2 + 2] polycondensation reactions. The method demonstrates good generality in that 6 POPs were successfully synthesized from different monomers. Additionally, we scaled up the synthesis in ethanol at room temperature, resulting in the production of POPs in sub&#8208;kilogram quantities at a relatively low cost. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies demonstrate that the POPs can be used as high&#8208;performance sorbents for CO2 separation and as porous substrates for efficient heterogeneous catalysis. This method provides an environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective approach for large&#8208;scale synthesis of various POPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Photoprocessable Materials via Photopolymerization Using an Acid&#8208;Induced Photocleavable Platinum&#8208;Acetylide Crosslinker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photopolymerization and photoprocessing are core technologies for molding and tuning polymer materials. However, they are incompatible with single materials owing to their contradictory photoreactivity. Herein, an acid&#8208;induced photocleavable crosslinker, a platinum&#8211;acetylide complex covered by permethylated cyclodextrins, enables the fabrication of photoprocessable materials via photopolymerization with N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)acrylamide. The polymer networks are molded by 365 nm irradiation as well as softened and degraded by a cooperative reaction with HCl as an acidic additive under 365 nm UV light, or 470 nm visible light in the presence of a photosensitizer. Moreover, the crosslinker is applied to a photoadhesive triggered by 365 nm irradiation. The adhesion is detachable on&#8208;demand through acid&#8208;induced photodegradation with the same wavelength and intensity of irradiation. Thus, acid&#8208;induced photocleavage allows the integration of light&#8208;induced molding and processing under various lights of various wavelengths, opening up new strategies for polymer technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Pore Polarization to Boost Ethane/Ethylene Separation Performance in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) show great potential in energy&#8208;saving C2H6/C2H4 separation, but there are few examples of one&#8208;step acquisition of C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 because it is still difficult to achieve the reverse&#8208;order adsorption of C2H6 and C2H4. In this work, we boost the C2H6/C2H4 separation performance in two graphene&#8208;sheet&#8208;like HOFs by tuning pore polarization. Upon heating, an in situ solid phase transformation can be observed from HOF&#8208;NBDA(DMA) (DMA = dimethylamine cation) to HOF&#8208;NBDA, accompanied with transformation of the electronegative skeleton into neutral one. As a result, the pore surface of HOF&#8208;NBDA has become nonpolar, which is beneficial to selectively adsorbing C2H6. The difference in the capacities for C2H6 and C2H4 is 23.4 cm3&#8729;g&#8208;1 for HOF&#8208;NBDA, and the C2H6/C2H4 uptake ratio is 136%, which are much higher than those for HOF&#8208;NBDA(DMA) (5.0 cm3&#8729;g&#8208;1 and 108% respectively). Practical breakthrough experiments demonstrate HOF&#8208;NBDA could produce polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 from C2H6/C2H4 (1/99, v/v) mixture with a high productivity of 29.2 L&#8729;kg&#8208;1 at 298 K, which is about five times as high as HOF&#8208;NBDA(DMA) (5.4 L&#8729;kg&#8208;1). In addition, in situ breakthrough experiments and theoretical calculations indicate the pore surface of HOF&#8208;NBDA is beneficial to preferentially capture C2H6 and thus boosts selective separation of C2H6/C2H4.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorothioated DNA Engineered Liposomes as a General Platform for Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Cell&#8208;Specific Intracellular Delivery and Genome&#8208;Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intracellular protein delivery is highly desirable for protein drug&#8208;based cell therapy. Established technologies suffer from poor cell&#8208;specific cytosolic protein delivery, which hampers the targeting therapy of specific cell populations. Fusogenic liposome system enables cytosolic delivery, but its ability of cell&#8208;specific and controllable delivery is quite limited. Inspired by the kinetics of viral fusion, we designed a phosphorothioated DNA coatings&#8208;modified fusogenic liposome to mimic the function of viral hemagglutinin. The macromolecular fusion machine docks cargo&#8208;loaded liposomes at the membrane of target cells, triggers membrane fusion upon pH or UV light stimuli, and facilitates cytosolic protein delivery. Our results showed efficient cell&#8208;targeted delivery of proteins of various sizes and charges, indicating the phosphorothioated DNA plug&#8208;in unit on liposomes could be a general strategy for spatial&#8208;temporally controllable protein delivery both in vitro and in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Ring Contraction and Expansion Reaction: Electrosynthesis of Heterocycle&#8208;Fused Fulleroids and Photovoltaic Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous electrochemical ring contraction and expansion reactions remain unexplored to date. Herein, the reductive electrosynthesis of heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids from fullerotetrahydropyridazines and electrophiles in the presence of a trace amount of oxygen has been achieved with concurrent ring contraction and ring expansion. When trifluoroacetic acid and alkyl bromides are employed as electrophiles, heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids with a 1,1,2,6&#8208;configuration are regioselectively formed. In contrast, heterocycle&#8208;fused fulleroids with a 1,1,4,6&#8208;configuration are regioselectively produced as two separable stereoisomers if phthaloyl chloride is used as the electrophile. The reaction proceeds through multiple steps of electroreduction, heterocycle ring&#8208;opening, oxygen oxidation, heterocycle contraction, fullerene cage expansion, and nucleophilic addition. The structures of these fulleroids have been determined by spectroscopic data and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The observed high regioselectivities have been rationalized by theoretical calculations.&#160;&#160;Representative fulleroids have been applied in organic solar cells as the third component and exhibit good performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Molecule Acceptor Enables Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells Processed Using Non&#8208;halogenated Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) based on A&#8208;DA&#8217;D&#8208;A type small molecule acceptors (SMAs) were mostly fabricated by toxic halogenated solvent processing, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the non&#8208;halogenated solvent processed OSCs is mainly restricted by the excessive aggregation of the SMAs. To address this issue, we developed two vinyl &#960;&#8208;spacer linking&#8208;site isomerized giant molecule acceptors (GMAs) with the &#960;&#8208;spacer linking on the inner carbon (EV&#8208;i) or out carbon (EV&#8208;o) of benzene end group of the SMA with longer alkyl side chains (ECOD) for the capability of non&#8208;halogenated solvent&#8208;processing. Interestingly, EV&#8208;i possesses a twisted molecular structure but enhanced conjugation, while EV&#8208;o shows a better planar molecular structure but weakened conjugation. The OSC with EV&#8208;i as acceptor processed by the non&#8208;halogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) demonstrated a higher PCE of 18.27% than that of the devices based on the acceptor of ECOD (16.40%) or EV&#8208;o (2.50%). 18.27% is one of the highest PCEs among the OSCs fabricated from non&#8208;halogenated solvents so far, benefitted from the suitable twisted structure, stronger absorbance and high charge carrier mobility of EV&#8208;i. The results indicate that the GMAs with suitable linking site would be the excellent candidates for fabricating high performance OSCs processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>A Time&#8208;Resolved FRET Assay Identifies a Small Molecule that Inhibits the Essential Bacterial Cell Wall Polymerase FtsW</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The peptidoglycan cell wall is essential for bacterial survival. To form the cell wall, peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (PGTs) polymerize Lipid II to make glycan strands and then those strands are crosslinked by transpeptidases (TPs). Recently, the SEDS (for shape, elongation, division, and sporulation) proteins were identified as a new class of PGTs. The SEDS protein FtsW, which produces septal peptidoglycan during cell division, is an attractive target for novel antibiotics because it is essential in virtually all bacteria. Here, we developed a time&#8208;resolved F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TR&#8208;FRET) assay to monitor PGT activity and screened a Staphylococcus aureus lethal compound library for FtsW inhibitors. We identified a compound that inhibits S. aureus FtsW in vitro. Using a non&#8208;polymerizable Lipid II derivative, we showed that this compound competes with Lipid II for binding to FtsW. The assays described here will be useful for discovering and characterizing other PGT inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tandem&#8208;Locked Fluorescent NETosis Reporter for the Prognosis Assessment of Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NETosis, the peculiar type of neutrophil death, plays important roles in pro&#8208;tumorigenic functions and inhibits cancer im&#8208;munotherapy. Non&#8208;invasive real&#8208;time imaging is thus imperative for prognosis of cancer immunotherapy yet remains chal&#8208;lenging. Herein, we report a tandem&#8208;locked NETosis Reporter 1 (TNR1) that activates fluorescence signals only in the pres&#8208;ence of both neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G (CTSG) for specific imaging of NETosis. In the aspect of molecular design, the sequence of biomarker&#8208;specific tandem peptide blocks can largely affect the detection specificity towards NETosis. In live cell imaging, the tandem&#8208;locked design allows TNR1 to differentiate NETosis from neutrophil activation, while single&#8208;locked reporters fail to do so. The near&#8208;infrared signals from activated TNR1 in tumor from living mice were consistent with the intra&#8208;tumoral NETosis levels from histological results. Moreover, the near&#8208;infrared signals from activated TNR1 negatively correlated with tumor inhibition effect after immunotherapy, thereby providing prognosis for cancer immu&#8208;notherapy. Thus, our study not only demonstrates the first sensitive optical reporter for noninvasive monitoring of NETosis levels and evaluation of cancer immunotherapeutic efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing living mice, but also proposes a generic approach for tandem&#8208;locked probe design.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo (HVMO) are powerful non&#8208;radical reactive species that enhance advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) due to their long half&#8208;lives and high selectivity towards recalcitrant water pollutants with electron&#8208;donating groups.&#160; However, high&#8208;valent cobalt&#8208;oxo (CoIV=O) generation is challenging in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based AOPs because the high 3d&#8208;orbital occupancy of cobalt would disfavor its binding with a terminal oxygen ligand. Herein, we propose a strategy to construct isolated Co sites with unique N1O2 coordination on Mn3O4 surface. The asymmetric N1O2 configuration is able to accept electrons from Co 3d&#8208;orbital, resulting in significant electronic delocalization at Co sites for the promoted PMS adsorption, dissociation and subsequent generation of CoIV=O species. CoN1O2/Mn3O4 exhibits high intrinsic activity in PMS activation and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation, highly outperforming its counterpart with CoO3 configuration, carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts with CoN4 configuration, and commercial cobalt oxides. CoIV=O species effectively oxidize the target contaminants via oxygen atom transfer to produce low&#8208;toxicity intermediates. These findings could advance mechanistic understanding of PMS activation at the molecular level and guide the rational design of efficient environmental catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstruction of Solid Electrolyte Interphase with SrI2 Reactivates Dead Li for Durable Anode&#8208;Free Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dead Li in anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal battery is suppressed effectively through synergistic mechanisms. With SrI2 incorporation, reversible I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox reaction reactivates dead Li; electronic insulation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) surface with SrF2 and LiF prevents electrolyte decomposition; the inner layer of SEI with abundant LiI demonstrates high ionic conduction (3.488&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and enables efficient Li+ transfer and Li deposition inside the SEI.







Abstract
Without excess Li, anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal batteries (AFLMBs) have been proposed as the most likely solution to realizing highly&#8208;safe and cost&#8208;effective Li&#8208;metal batteries. Nevertheless, short cyclic life puzzles conventional AFLMBs due to anodic dead Li accumulation with a local current concentration induced by irreversible electrolyte depletion, insufficient active Li reservoir and slow Li+ transfer at the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, SrI2 is introduced into carbon paper (CP) current collector to effectively suppress dead Li through synergistic mechanisms including reversible I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox reaction to reactivate dead Li, dielectric SEI surface with SrF2 and LiF to prevent electrolyte decomposition and highly ionic conductive (3.488&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) inner layer of SEI with abundant LiI to enable efficient Li+ transfer inside. With the SrI2&#8208;modified current collector, the NCM532/CP cell delivers unprecedented cyclic performances with a capacity of 129.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles.

&lt;p&gt;Without excess Li, anode-free Li-metal batteries (AFLMBs) have been proposed as the most likely solution to realizing highly-safe and cost-effective Li-metal batteries. Nevertheless, short cyclic life puzzles conventional AFLMBs due to anodic dead Li accumulation with a local current concentration induced by irreversible electrolyte depletion, insufficient active Li reservoir and slow Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer at the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, SrI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is introduced into carbon paper (CP) current collector to effectively suppress dead Li through synergistic mechanisms including reversible I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; redox reaction to reactivate dead Li, dielectric SEI surface with SrF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and LiF to prevent electrolyte decomposition and highly ionic conductive (3.488&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) inner layer of SEI with abundant LiI to enable efficient Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer inside. With the SrI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-modified current collector, the NCM532/CP cell delivers unprecedented cyclic performances with a capacity of 129.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 200&#8197;cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diazabicyclic Electroactive Ionenes for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diazabicyclic electroactive ionenes with high density of interfacial dipoles are developed as interlayers in organic solar cells. Devices containing the optimal electroactive ionene interlayer give efficiency up to 18.43&#8201;% and excellent operational stability with exceptional interlayer thickness tolerance over 100&#8197;nm, correlating well with its superior optoelectronic and morphological characters, representing the best record reported so far.







Abstract
Electroactive ionenes combining caged&#8208;shaped diazabicyclic cations and aromatic diimides were developed as interlayers in organic solar cells (OSCs). These ionenes reduce the work&#8208;function of air&#8208;stable metal electrodes (e.g., Ag, Cu and Au) by generating strong interfacial dipoles, and their optoelectronic and morphological characters can be modulated by aromatic diimides, leading to high conductivity and good compatibility with active layers. The optimal ionene exhibits superior charge&#8208;transport, desirable crystallinity, and weak visible&#8208;absorption, boosting the efficiency of benchmark PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;based OSCs up to 17.44&#8201;%. The corresponding normal devices show excellent stability at maximum power point test under one sun illumination for 1000&#8197;h. Replacing Y6 with L8&#8208;BO promotes the efficiency to 18.43&#8201;%, one of the highest in binary OSCs. Notably, high efficiencies &gt;16&#8201;% are maintained as the interlayer thickness increasing to 105&#8197;nm, the best result with interlayer&#8208;thickness over 100&#8197;nm.

Abstract
A novel, selective and high&#8208;yielding palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative arylation of a variety of weakly acidic (pKa 25&#8211;35 in DMSO) benzylic and heterobenzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with aryl bromides has been achieved. This system is applicable to a range of pro&#8208;nucleophiles for access to sterically and electronically diverse &#945;&#8208;aryl or &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diaryl ketones, which are ubiquitous substructures in biologically active compounds. The Josiphos SL&#8208;J001&#8208;1&#8208;based palladium catalyst was identified as the most efficient and selective, enabling carbonylative arylation with aryl bromides under 1&#8197;atm CO to provide the ketone products without the formation of direct coupling byproducts. Additionally, (Josiphos)Pd(CO)2 was identified as the catalyst resting state. A kinetic study suggests that the oxidative addition of aryl bromides is the turnover&#8208;limiting step. Key catalytic intermediates were also isolated.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled L&#8211;DNA Linkers for Rapid Construction of Multi&#8208;Specific Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates Library</title>

A modular platform for rapid construction of multi&#8208;specific Antibody&#8208;Drug Conjugates (ADCs). The MADC platform offers the combinatorial flexibility to screen for optimal target and payload combinations, while having the potential of becoming viable therapeutic agents themselves.







Abstract
One of the key challenges of improving clinical outcomes of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) is overcoming cancer resistance to the antibody and/or drug components of ADCs, and hence the need for ADC platforms with high combinatory flexibility. Here, we introduce the use of self&#8208;assembled left&#8208;handed DNA (L&#8211;DNA) oligonucleotides to link combinatory single&#8208;domain antibodies and toxin payloads for tunable and adaptive delivery of ADCs. We demonstrate that the method allows convenient construction of a library of ADCs with multi&#8208;specific targeting, multi&#8208;specific payloads, and exact drug&#8208;antibody ratio. The newly constructed ADCs with L&#8211;DNA scaffold showed favorable properties of in vitro cell cytotoxicity and in vivo suppression and eradication of solid tumors. Collectively, our data suggest that the L&#8211;DNA based modular ADC (MADC) platform is a viable option for generating therapeutic ADCs and for potentially expanding ADC therapeutic window via multi&#8208;specificity.

         <title>Chemically Fueled Autonomous Sol&#8594;Gel&#8594;Sol&#8594;Gel&#8594;Sol Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reentrant phase transitions (sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol) are known to exist in natural and artificial chemical systems. In the past decade, chemical fuels have been used to tune reentrant phase transitions. Here a chemically fueled double reentrant phase transition is presented, where two distinct hydrogels (i.e. from aldehyde&#8208; and imine&#8208;based gelators) form transiently and in sequential order. This results in an autonomous sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol transition.







Abstract
Complex non&#8208;equilibrium phase behaviors are a hallmark of natural self&#8208;assembling systems. Here we show how intricate phase transitions can be achieved through a chemically fueled reaction cycle to yield autonomous sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol transitions. A relay of chemical transformations based on thiazinane metathesis leads to two consecutive transient gelations in a closed system. Within seconds of fuel addition to deactivated thiazinane monomers, an imine&#8208;based hydrogel forms that consists of fibrillar microspheres. This gel quickly loses its mechanical strength and forms a solution, from which a second aldehyde&#8208;based gel nucleates and remains stable for over one day. Overall, our reaction cycle gives rise to two consecutive re&#8208;entrant phase transitions without any experimental intervention.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Arylation of Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An evaluation of competitive bisphosphine/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N versus C&#8722;O cross&#8208;couplings involving model compounds enabled development of chemoselective, metal&#8208;catalyzed O&#8208; and N&#8208;arylation of amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles, without recourse to protection group chemistry.







Abstract
A systematic evaluation of competitive bisphosphine/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N versus C&#8722;O cross&#8208;couplings involving model compounds enabled development of hitherto unknown chemoselective O&#8208; and N&#8208;arylation of amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles, without recourse to protection group chemistry. Use of the CyPAd&#8208;DalPhos pre&#8208;catalyst C2 enabled particularly challenging O&#8208;arylation chemoselectivity in amino alcohols featuring branched primary and secondary alkylamine groups, while selective N&#8208;arylation was observed in substrates featuring less&#8208;hindered linear alkylamine and aniline reacting groups. Useful reaction scope in the (hetero)aryl chloride was achieved throughout, and the ability to conduct such transformations using benchtop handling of materials is demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;A systematic evaluation of competitive bisphosphine/Ni-catalyzed C&#8722;N versus C&#8722;O cross-couplings involving model compounds enabled development of hitherto unknown chemoselective &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-arylation of amino alcohols with (hetero)aryl chloride electrophiles, without recourse to protection group chemistry. Use of the CyPAd-DalPhos pre-catalyst &lt;b&gt;C2&lt;/b&gt; enabled particularly challenging &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-arylation chemoselectivity in amino alcohols featuring branched primary and secondary alkylamine groups, while selective &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-arylation was observed in substrates featuring less-hindered linear alkylamine and aniline reacting groups. Useful reaction scope in the (hetero)aryl chloride was achieved throughout, and the ability to conduct such transformations using benchtop handling of materials is demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Coordination Polymer of Vaska's Complex as a Heterogeneous Catalyst for the Reductive Formation of Enamines from Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a low&#8208;valent metal&#8208;organic material is synthesized using a tetratopic phosphine linker and Vaska's complex. This crystalline, IrI&#8208;containing material behaves similarly to Vaska's complex, binding dioxygen reversibly and can also be used as a recyclable, heterogeneous catalyst for the reductive formation of enamines from amides.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent metal&#8211;organic frameworks (LVMOFs) and related materials have gained interest due to their potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis. However, of the few LVMOFs that have been reported, none have shown catalytic activity. Herein, a low&#8208;valent metal&#8208;organic material constructed from phosphine linkers and IrI nodes is reported. This material is effectively a crystalline, insoluble analogue of Vaska's complex. As such, the material reversibly binds O2 and catalyzes the reductive formation of enamines from amides.

         <title>Passive Gate&#8208;Tunable Kinetic Photovoltage along Semiconductor&#8208;Water Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching on/off the kinetic photovoltage, an in&#8208;plane voltage in the semiconductor driven by the moving boundaries of electrical double layer between the irradiated and dark regions, is achieved by applying a bias across the solid&#8211;liquid interface. The study extends the principle of the solid&#8208;state field effect transistor to the solid&#8211;liquid system and may lead to novel design concepts for optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Moving boundaries of electric double layer at solid&#8211;liquid interface enables unprecedented persistent energy conversion and provokes a kinetic photovoltaic effect by moving an illumination region along the semiconductor&#8208;water interface. Here, we report a transistor&#8208;inspired gate modulation of kinetic photovoltage by applying a bias at the semiconductor&#8208;water interface. The kinetic photovoltage of both p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type silicon samples can be facilely switched on/off, stemming from the electrical&#8208;field&#8208;modulated surface band bending. In contrast to the function of solid&#8208;state transistors relying on external sources, passive gate modulation of the kinetic photovoltage is achieved simply by introducing a counter electrode with materials of desired electrochemical potential. This architecture provides the ability to modulate the kinetic photovoltage over three orders of magnitude and opens up a new way for self&#8208;powered optoelectronic logic devices.

         <title>Bimetallic Cooperativity and Hydrogen Bonding Allow Efficient Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, Halime, Aukauloo, and co&#8208;workers successfully implemented the key features of the natural enzyme CO dehydrogenase in an iron porphyrin architecture and designed a catalyst that allowed facile and selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Reducing CO2 selectively to one of the several C1 products is challenging, as the thermodynamic reduction potentials for the different n&#8201;e&#8722;/n&#8201;H+ reductions of CO2 are similar and so is the reduction potential for H+ reduction. Recently, Halime, Aukauloo, and co&#8208;workers have taken inspiration from the active site of nickel CO dehydrogenase (Ni&#8208;CODH) to design bimetallic iron porphyrins bridged by a urea moiety. These complexes show fast and selective reduction of CO2 to CO and the results suggest a Ni&#8208;CODH type mechanism at play where one of the two metals binds and reduces the CO2 while the other stabilizes the reduced species by forming a bridged complex, facilitating the C&#8722;O bond cleavage.

         <title>A Traceless Chiral Shift Reagent Based on Nonbonding Interactions with Single&#8208;Handed Helical Poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantifiable separation of the NMR signals of enantiomers of a broad range of chiral compounds including ethers, ketones, esters, haloalkanes, and alkanes, is possible by using a single&#8208;handed helical poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) bearing simple chiral alkoxymethyl side chains as a chiral shift reagent. The short spin&#8208;spin relaxation of the macromolecular scaffold enables the proton signals of the chiral shift reagent to be eliminated from the spectra.







Abstract
A single&#8208;handed poly(quinoxaline&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl) (PQX) has been found to serve as a new type of chiral shift reagent (CSR) for determining the enantiomeric ratio by NMR spectroscopy. Even though there is no specific binding site in the PQX, its nonbonding interaction with chiral analytes leads to a significant shift of the NMR chemical shift, allowing quantification of the enantiomeric ratio. The new type of CSR has the advantages of a wide scope of analytes including ethers, haloalkanes, and alkanes, easy tunability of the degree of chemical shifts by measurement temperature, and erasability of proton signals of CSR because of the short spin&#8208;spin (T2) relaxation of the macromolecular scaffold.

Divergent total syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphnezomines&#8197;A and B and (+)&#8208;dapholdhamine&#8197;B have been accomplished in 16&#8211;20 steps from a known epoxide via a rapid construction of a common core intermediate. The aza&#8208;adamantane backbone of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphnezomines&#8197;A and B was furnished via a tandem deprotection/reduction/keto amine&#8208;carbinolamine tautomerization, and the (+)&#8208;dapholdhamine&#8197;B backbone was assembled through an N&#8208;iodosuccinimide&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig aminocyclization from the same intermediate.







Abstract
The daphnezomine A&#8208;type subfamily of Daphniphyllum alkaloids structurally features a unique aza&#8208;adamantane core skeleton and anticipates efficient strategies for completing their syntheses to thoroughly investigate their biological activities. Herein, divergent total syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;daphnezomines&#8197;A and B and (+)&#8208;dapholdhamine&#8197;B have been accomplished in 16&#8211;20 steps from a known epoxide via rapid construction of a common core intermediate. The present work features a Ti&#8208;mediated radical cyclization to establish the azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ring system, an intramolecular Heck reaction to install the bridgehead all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter, a tandem deprotection/reduction/keto amine&#8208;carbinolamine tautomerization to furnish the aza&#8208;adamantane backbone, and an NIS&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig aminocyclization to assemble the (+)&#8208;dapholdhamine&#8197;B backbone.

         <title>An Artificial In Vitro Metabolism to Angiopterlactone B Inspired by Traditional Retrosynthesis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic cascades, combining the selectivity of biological systems with the elegance of chemical synthesis, offer an exceptional opportunity for the preparation of complex molecular structures. By integrating native and abiotic enzyme modules in a metabolism&#8208;like network, a five&#8208;enzyme cascade coupled with a carbonate&#8208;induced dimerization step yielded the tricyclic natural product angiopterlactone B in a two&#8208;step process.







Abstract
Nature's way to construct highly complex molecular entities as part of biosynthetic pathways is unmatched by any chemical synthesis. Yet, relying on a cascade of native enzymatic transformations to achieve a certain target structure, biosynthesis is also significantly limited in its scope. In this study, non&#8208;natural biocatalytic modules, a peroxidase&#8208;mediated Achmatowicz rearrangement and a dehydrogenase&#8208;catalyzed borrowing&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;type isomerization were successfully incorporated into an artificial metabolism, combining the benefits of traditional retrosynthesis with the elegance and efficacy of biosynthetic networks. In a highly streamlined process, the total synthesis of tricyclic angiopterlactone B was achieved in two steps operating entirely in an aqueous environment while relying mainly on enzymes as key reaction mediators.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of a Tridecasaccharide Motif of Bacteroides vulgatus Lipopolysaccharides against Inflammatory Bowel Diseases through an Orthogonal One&#8208;Pot Glycosylation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides vulgatus represent interesting targets for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. In their Research Article (e202301351), Guozhi Xiao and co&#8208;workers accomplished the first synthesis of a tridecasaccharide motif from&#160;Bacteroides vulgatus lipopolysaccharides by a strategy involving orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation reactions based on glycosyl&#160;ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which precluded issues such as aglycone transfer and the unpleasant odor of thioglycoside&#8208;based orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation.

         <title>Low Bandgap 2D Perovskite Single Crystal with Anomalous&#8208;large Charges/ions Collection Ratio for Ultra&#8208;sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Detectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the strategy of using Cu2+ ions cross&#8208;linking the layers of 2D perovskite can not only reduce the perovskite band gap, but can also selectively improve the charge carriers&#8217; transport along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction and suppress the ions migration effectively. The [Cu(O2C&#8722;(CH2)3&#8722;NH3)2]PbBr4 device can reach a record charges/ions collection ratio of 1.69&#215;1018&#177;4.7&#8201;%&#8197;&#956;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;s, and exhibit an excellent X&#8208;ray detection performances.







Abstract
The low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites have attracted increasing attention due to their improved moisture stability, reduced defects, and suppressed ions migration in many optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, X&#8208;ray detectors, and so on. However, they are still limited by their large band gap and short charge carriers&#8217; diffusion length. Here, we demonstrate that the introduction of metal ions into organic interlayers of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite by cross&#8208;linking the copper paddle&#8208;wheel cluster&#8208;based lead bromide ([Cu(O2C&#8722;(CH2)3&#8722;NH3)2]PbBr4) perovskite single crystals with coordination bonds can not only significantly reduce the perovskite band gap to 0.96&#8197;eV to boost the X&#8208;ray induced charge carriers, but can also selectively improve the charge carriers&#8217; transport along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction and blocking the ions motion paths. The [Cu(O2C&#8722;(CH2)3&#8722;NH3)2]PbBr4 single&#8208;crystal device can reach a record charges/ions collection ratio of 1.69&#215;1018&#177;4.7&#8201;%&#8197;&#956;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;s, and exhibit a large sensitivity of 1.14&#215;105&#177;7%&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with the lowest detectable dose rate of 56&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 under 120&#8197;keV X&#8208;rays irradiation. In addition, [Cu(O2C&#8722;(CH2)3&#8722;NH3)2]PbBr4 single&#8208;crystal detector exposed to the air without any encapsulation shows excellent X&#8208;ray imaging capability with long&#8208;term operational stability without any attenuation of 120&#8197;days.

         <title>Exploiting Interactions between Polyoxometalates and Proteins for Applications in (Bio)chemistry and Medicine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The specific interactions of anionic metal&#8208;oxo clusters, known as polyoxometalates (POMs) with proteins can be leveraged for a wide range of analytical and biomedical applications. For example, POMs have been developed as selective catalysts for protein modifications and have also been shown to facilitate protein crystallisation and their structural determination. POMs can also be used for the selective separation of proteins and have exhibited promising therapeutic activity due to effective inhibition of enzymes. Hence, understanding POM&#8208;protein interactions is essential for the development of POM&#8208;based materials and their implementation in several fields. Therefore, in this review we summarize in detail the key insights that have been gained so far on POM&#8208;protein interactions. Emphasis is also given to hybrid POMs functionalized with organic ligands to prompt further research in this direction due to the promising recent results on tuning POM&#8208;protein interactions through POM functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Acceptor Molecule Doping Induced &#960;&#8208;&#960; Interaction to Promote Charge Transport Kinetics for Efficient and Stable 2D/3D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the incorporation of 2D perovskite into 3D perovskite can greatly enhance intrinsic stability, power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2D/3D perovskite is still inferior to its 3D counterpart due to poor carrier transport kinetics resulted from the quantum and dielectric confinement of 2D component. To overcome this issue, the electron acceptor molecule 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) was introduced to trigger intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction in 2D perovskite along with the electronic doping of 2D/3D perovskite to improve charge transfer efficiency. By virtue of high electron affinity, TCNB can undergo electron transfer reaction and subsequently establish &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction with 1&#8208;naphthalenemethylammonium (NMA) cations, greatly strengthening lattice rigidity and reducing exciton binding energy. Transmission electron microscopy results demonstrate that 2D phases are mainly distributed at grain boundaries, reducing defect density and weakening nonradiative recombination. Meanwhile, the p&#8208;type doping of perovskite by TCNB optimizes energy level alignment at perovskite/hole transport layer interface. Consequently, PCE of champion device is significantly boosted to 24.01%. The unencapsulated device retains an initial efficiency close to 94% after exposure to ambient environment for over 1000 h. This work paves a novel path for designing new mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells with high PCE and superior stability.</dc:description>

         <title>A Single&#8208;Scan Ultraselective Heteronuclear Polarization Transfer Method for Unambiguous Complex Structure Assignment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complex nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals of organic compounds containing multiple analogous substructures or mixtures pose a significant challenge to structural identification, thus resulting in frequent misassignment of structures. The GEMSTONE method, a single&#8208;scan technique that selectively excites a specific proton signal among the crowded NMR signals, was recently proposed as a solution. However, its extension to the polarization transfer method for heteronuclear spin systems was unsuccessful. Here, we present an extension method that addresses the altered heteronuclear polarization transfer efficiency and enables the acquisition of ultraselective 13C and 1H&#8208;13C correlation NMR subspectra with hertz&#8208;level signal selectivity in both dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in the structural analysis of a chromopeptide pharmaceutical and a diastereomeric mixture fungicide.</dc:description>

         <title>Quadruple H&#8209;Bonding and Polyrotaxanes Dual Cross&#8208;linking Supramolecular Elastomer for High Toughness and Self&#8208;healing Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tough and self&#8208;healable substrates can enable stretchable electronics long service life. However, for substrates, it still remains a challenge to achieve both high toughness and autonomous self&#8208;healing ability at room temperature. Herein, a strategy by using the combined effects between quadruple H&#8208;bonding and slidable cross&#8208;links is proposed to solve the above issues in the elastomer. The elastomer exhibits high toughness (77.3 MJ/m3), fracture energy (~127.2 kJ/m2), and good healing efficiency (91%) at room temperature. The superior performance is ascribed to the inter and intra crosslinking structures of quadruple H&#8208;bonding and polyrotaxanes in the dual crosslinking system. Strain&#8208;induced crystallization of PEG in polyrotaxanes also contributes to the high fracture energy of the elastomers. Furthermore, based on the dual cross&#8208;linked supramolecular elastomer, a highly stretchable and self&#8208;healable electrode containing liquid metal is also fabricated, retaining resistance stability (0.16&#8208;0.26 &#937;) even at the strain of 1600%.</dc:description>

         <title>BN&#8208;Butafulvenes and Their Application in the Synthesis of Highly Substituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BN&#8208;butafulvenes, mono&#8208;BN isosteres of butafulvene and highly strained isomers of azaborines and B&#8208;amino boroles, have been synthesized via hydrolysis of the urana&#8208;borabicyclic complexes obtained from the reactions of bis(alkynyl)boranes with an uranacyclopropene complex. Their 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) adducts can further isomerize to 1,2,4,6&#8208;multisubstituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;naphthalenes. Both NMR reaction monitoring and theoretical calculations point to a reaction mechanism involving dearomative insertion of DMAP followed by two consecutive 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shifts. The photophysical studies of the highly substituted BN&#8208;9,1&#8208;naphthalenes reveal a notable redshift in both the UV&#8208;vis absorption and emission spectra. The (TD)&#8208;DFT calculations corroborate the experimental data, suggesting that the strong &#960;&#8208;donating amino substitution at the 1&#8208; and/or 6&#8208;positions destabilizes the HOMO, and thus leading to a notable decrease of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Arylation of Silicon Nanocrystals with Hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;Derived Benzynes&#8203;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal silicon nanocrystals (SiNCs) have garnered significant interest in optoelectronics and biomedical applications. Direct arylation provides pathways to enhance the solution processability of particles and manipulate the photophysical and electronic properties of SiNCs. Unfortunately, existent methods employed to prepare aryl&#8208;functionalized SiNCs are based on organometallic coupling or transition&#8208;metal catalytic strategies, which require metal&#8208;based reagents for preactivation or the precursors and complicated post&#8208;treatment processes for product purification. Herein, we demonstrate a metal&#8208;free method that directly functionalizes SiNCs with aryl&#8208;based ligands. We design a series of benzyne derivatives formed from the thermal cyclization of predesigned alkynes, allowing efficient arylation on hydride&#8208;terminated silicon surfaces under mild conditions. These aryl&#8208;functionalized SiNCs exhibit strong blue emission with nanosecond&#8208;scaled decay, suggesting the formation of new radiative recombination channel on SiNC surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinitiated Energy Transfer in Porous&#8208;Cage&#8208;Stabilised Silver Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new composite material consisting of silver nanoparticles decorated with three&#8208;dimensional molecular organic cages based on light absorbing porphyrins. The porphyrin cages serve to both stabilize the particles and allow diffusion and trapping of small molecules close to the metallic surface. Combining these two photoactive components results in a Fano resonant interaction between the porphyrin Soret band and the nanoparticle localised surface plasmon resonance. Time resolved spectroscopy revealed the silver nanoparticles transfer up to 37% of their excited state energy to the stabilising layer of porphyrin cages. These unusual photophysics cause a 2&#8208;fold current increase in photoelectrochemical water splitting measurements. The composite structure provides a compelling proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for advanced photosensitiser systems with intrinsic porosity for photocatalytic and sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly Mechanism and Chiral Transfer in CuO Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral inorganic superstructures have received considerable interest due to the chiral communication between inorganic compounds and chiral organic additives. However, the demanding fabrication and complex multilevel structure seriously hinder the understanding of chiral transfer and self&#8208;assembly mechanisms. Herein, we use chiral CuO superstructures as a model system to study the formation process of hierarchical chiral structures. Based on a simple and mild synthesis route, the time&#8208;resolved morphology and the in&#8208;situ chirality evolution could be easily followed. The morphology evolution of the chiral superstructure involves hierarchical assembly, including primary nanoparticles, intermediate bundles, and superstructure at different growth stages. Successive redshifts and enhancements of the CD signal support chiral transfer from the surface penicillamine ligands to the inorganic superstructure. Full&#8208;field electro&#8208;dynamical simulations reproduced the structural chirality and allowed us to predict its modulation. This work opens the door to a large family of chiral inorganic materials where chiral molecule&#8208;guided self&#8208;assembly can be specifically designed to follow a bottom&#8208;up chiral transfer pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereomer Resolution of M&#8324;L&#8326; Coordination Cages by Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Resolution Ion Mobility&#8208;Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination cages can be used for enantio&#8208; and regioselective catalysis and for the selective sensing and separation of isomeric guest molecules. Here, stereoisomers of a family of coordination cages are resolved using high&#8208;resolution cyclic ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (cIM&#8208;MS). The observed ratio of diastereomers is dependent on both the metal ion and counter ion. Moreover, the point groups can be assigned through complementary NMR experiments. This method enables the identification and interrogation of the individual isomers in complex mixtures of cages which cannot be performed in solution. Furthermore, these techniques allow the stability of individual isomers within the mixture to be probed, with the T&#8208;symmetric isomers in this case shown to be more robust than the C3 and S4 analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Induced Double Helix Based on Self&#8208;Assembly of a Small Planar Building Block</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a rule, helical structures at the molecular level are formed by non&#8208;planar units. This makes the design of helices, starting from planar building blocks via self&#8208;assembly, even more fascinating. Until now, however, this has only been achieved in rare cases, where hydrogen and halogen bonds were involved. Here, we show that the carbonyl&#8208;tellurium interaction motif is suitable to assemble even small planar units into helical structures in solid phase. We found two different types of helices: both single and double helices, depending on the substitution pattern. In the double helix, the strands are connected by additional Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te chalcogen bonds. In the case of the single helix, a spontaneous enantiomeric resolution occurs in the crystal. This underlines the potential of the carbonyl&#8208;tellurium chalcogen bond to generate complex three&#8208;dimensional patterns.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Channel Lanthanide Nanocomposites for Customized Synergistic Treatment of Orthotopic Multi&#8208;Tumor Cases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Simultaneous photothermal ablation of multiple tumors is limited by unpredictable photo&#8208;induced apoptosis, caused by individual intratumoral differences. Here, a multi&#8208;channel lanthanide nanocomposite was used to achieve tailored synergistic treatment of multiple subcutaneous orthotopic tumors under non&#8208;uniform whole&#8208;body infrared irradiation prescription. The nanocomposite reduces intratumoral glutathione by simultaneously activating the fluorescence and photothermal channels. The fluorescence provides individual information on different tumors, allowing customized prescriptions to be made. This enables optimal induction of hyperthermia and dosage of chemo drugs, to ensure treatment efficacy, while avoiding overtherapy. With an accessional therapeutic laser system, customized synergistic treatment of subcutaneous orthotopic cancer cases with multiple tumors is possible with both high efficacy and minimized side effects.</dc:description>

         <title>An Activatable NIR Fluorescent Probe for NAD(P)H and Its Application to the Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of p53 Abnormalities In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The level of NAD(P)H in mitochondria in living colorectal cancer cells (CRCs) was demonstrated to be highly co&#8208;related to p53 abnormality for the first time by employing a selective NIR fluorescent probe KC8 for NAD(P)H. Due to its NIR emission (745&#8197;nm) and excellent tumor&#8208;targeting character, KC8 was enriched in tumor region when administered intravenously, which was further utilized to discriminate the HCT&#8208;116 p53&#8722;/&#8722; from HCT&#8208;116 in vivo.







Abstract
NAD(P)H is crucial for biosynthetic reactions and antioxidant functions. However, the current probes developed for detecting NAD(P)H in vivo require intratumoral injection, which limited their application for animal imaging. To address this issue, we have developed a liposoluble cationic probe, KC8, which exhibits excellent tumor&#8208;targeting ability and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence after reaction with NAD(P)H. By using KC8, it was demonstrated for the first time that the level of NAD(P)H in the mitochondria of living colorectal cancer (CRC) cells was highly related to the abnormality of the p53. Furthermore, KC8 was successfully used to differentiate not only between tumor and normal tissue but also between tumors with p53 abnormality and normal tumors when administered intravenously. Finally, we evaluated tumor heterogeneity through two fluorescent channels after treating a tumor with 5&#8208;Fu. This study provides a new tool for real&#8208;time monitoring of the p53 abnormality of CRC cells.

         <title>Expanded Conformations of Monomeric Tau Initiate Its Amyloidogenesis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule analysis of tau shows that pro&#8208;amyloidogenic mutations and chemical environment shift the monomeric conformational landscape towards expanded conformers, exposing amyloidogenic hexapeptides. The chemical environment also originates structural rearrangements, which may be behind the polymorphic amyloid structures found across tauopathies. Conversely, anti&#8208;amyloidogenic factors promote the formation of collapsed conformers with a specific inert structure.







Abstract
Understanding early amyloidogenesis is key to rationally develop therapeutic strategies. Tau protein forms well&#8208;characterized pathological deposits but its aggregation mechanism is still poorly understood. Using single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy based on a mechanical protection strategy, we studied the conformational landscape of the monomeric tau repeat domain (tau&#8208;RD244&#8208;368). We found two sets of conformational states, whose frequency is influenced by mutations and the chemical context. While pathological mutations &#916;280K and P301L and a pro&#8208;amyloidogenic milieu favored expanded conformations and destabilized local structures, an anti&#8208;amyloidogenic environment promoted a compact ensemble, including a conformer whose topology might mask two amyloidogenic segments. Our results reveal that to initiate aggregation, monomeric tau&#8208;RD244&#8208;368 decreases its polymorphism adopting expanded conformations. This could account for the distinct structures found in vitro and across tauopathies.

         <title>Modulating Thermal Properties of Polymers through Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal engineering of multicomponent solids involving both small and polymeric molecules resulted in the preparation of cocrystals with melting points higher than the melting point of the pure polymer. At the same time, the high mechanical flexibility of the polymer is maintained even under harsh milling conditions, allowing the formation of toroidal nanoparticles with small inner radii and high curvatures.







Abstract
Crystal engineering has exclusively focused on the development of advanced materials based on small organic molecules. We now demonstrate how the cocrystallization of a polymer yields a material with significantly enhanced thermal stability but equivalent mechanical flexibility. Isomorphous replacement of one of the cocrystal components enables the formation of solid solutions with melting points that can be readily fine&#8208;tuned over a usefully wide temperature range. The results of this study credibly extend the scope of crystal engineering and cocrystallization from small molecules to polymers.

         <title>Mass Spectrometry Reveals High Levels of Hydrogen Peroxide in Pancreatic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using mass spectrometry and biological techniques, we found that H2O2 is dysregulated in PDAC, further validating that the main reasons for H2O2 enrichment in PDAC cells may be that oncogenic KRAS mutation promotes H2O2 production and silences CAT levels in PDAC. Furthermore, we identified that H2O2 affects the cells&#8217; metabolic profile and promotes the survival of PDAC cells.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for many cellular functions, and dysregulation of ROS involves the development of multiple types of tumors, including pancreatic cancer. However, ROS have been grouped into a single biochemical entity for a long time, and the specific roles of certain types of ROS in tumor cells (e.g., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)) have not been systematically investigated. In this work, a highly sensitive and accurate mass spectrometry&#8208;based method was applied to study PDAC cells of humans and of genetically modified animals. The results show that the oncogenic KRAS mutation promotes the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) rather than superoxide or hydroxyl radicals in pancreatic cancer cells. We further identified that the enriched H2O2 modifies cellular metabolites and promotes the survival of pancreatic cancer cells. These findings highlight the specific roles of H2O2 in pancreatic cancer development, which may provide new directions for pancreatic cancer therapy.

&lt;p&gt;By using mass spectrometry and biological techniques, we found that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is dysregulated in PDAC, further validating that the main reasons for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enrichment in PDAC cells may be that oncogenic &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; mutation promotes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and silences &lt;i&gt;CAT&lt;/i&gt; levels in PDAC. Furthermore, we identified that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affects the cells&#8217; metabolic profile and promotes the survival of PDAC cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical for many cellular functions, and dysregulation of ROS involves the development of multiple types of tumors, including pancreatic cancer. However, ROS have been grouped into a single biochemical entity for a long time, and the specific roles of certain types of ROS in tumor cells (e.g., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)) have not been systematically investigated. In this work, a highly sensitive and accurate mass spectrometry-based method was applied to study PDAC cells of humans and of genetically modified animals. The results show that the oncogenic &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; mutation promotes the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) rather than superoxide or hydroxyl radicals in pancreatic cancer cells. We further identified that the enriched H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; modifies cellular metabolites and promotes the survival of pancreatic cancer cells. These findings highlight the specific roles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in pancreatic cancer development, which may provide new directions for pancreatic cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Epitope Imprinting of Phospholipids by Oriented Assembly at the Oil/Water Interface for the Selective Recognition of Plasma Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imprinting strategy for targeting the polar epitope of phospholipids was developed based on reversed phase microemulsion oriented molecular imprinting. The prepared phospholipid&#8208;MIP can specifically recognize plasma membranes via a phospholipid exposed on the outer leaflet and thus differentiate physiological conditions of cells such as apoptosis, providing an alternative tool for targeted drug delivery and theranostics.







Abstract
Phospholipids, as fundamental building blocks of the cell membrane, play important roles for molecule transportation, cell recognition, etc. However, due to the structural diversity and amphipathic nature, there are few methods for the specific recognition of lipids as compared to other biomolecules such as proteins and glycans. Herein, we developed a molecular imprinting strategy for controllable imprinting toward the polar head of phospholipid exposed on the surface of cellular membranes for recognition. Phosphatidylserine, as unique lipid on the outer membrane leaflet of exosome and also hallmark for cell apoptosis, was imprinted with the developed method. The phosphatidylserine imprinted materials showed high efficiency and specific targeting capability not only for apoptotic cell imaging but also for the isolation of exosomes. Collectively, the synthesized molecularly imprinted materials have great potential for selective plasma membrane recognition for targeted drug delivery and biomarker discovery.

         <title>Isolation of an Annulated 1,4&#8208;Distibabenzene Diradicaloid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,4&#8208;distibabenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diide (cyclic bis&#8208;stibinidene) compound 5 is isolated as a crystalline solid. 5 undergoes 2e&#8208;oxidation to the dicationic compound (6)2+, which can be reduced back to 5. The broken&#8208;symmetry open&#8208;shell singlet solution for (6)2+ is calculated to be 2.13&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 more stable than the closed&#8208;shell singlet solution. (6)+2 is stabilized by the delocalization of unpaired electrons over the benzenoid C4Sb2 ring and has 39&#8201;% diradical character.







Abstract
The first 1,4&#8208;distibabenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diide compound [(ADC)Sb]2 (5) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADC) (ADC=PhC{N(Dipp)C}2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) is reported as a bordeaux&#8208;red solid. Compound 5, featuring a central six&#8208;membered C4Sb2 ring with formally SbI atoms may be regarded as a base&#8208;stabilized cyclic bis&#8208;stibinidene in which each of the Sb atoms bears two lone&#8208;pairs of electrons. 5 undergoes 2&#8201;e&#8208;oxidation with Ph3C[B(C6F5)4] to afford [(ADC)Sb]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (6) as a brick&#8208;red solid. Each of the Sb atoms of 6 has an unpaired electron and a lone&#8208;pair. The broken&#8208;symmetry open&#8208;shell singlet diradical solution for (6)2+ is calculated to be 2.13&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 more stable than the closed&#8208;shell singlet. The diradical character of (6)2+ according to SS&#8208;CASSCF (state&#8208;specific complete active space self&#8208;consistent field) and UHF (unrestricted Hartree&#8208;Fock) methods amounts to 36&#8201;% and 39&#8201;%, respectively. Treatments of 6 with (PhE)2 yield [(ADC)Sb(EPh)]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (7&#8208;E) (E=S or Se). Reaction of 5 with (cod)Mo(CO)4 affords [(ADC)Sb]2Mo(CO)4 (8).

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four highly porous pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were prepared for photocatalytic H2O2 generation. The reported findings highlight that the presence of pyrene active sites in very close proximity leads to unwanted H2O2 decomposition. Accordingly, a biphasic system (benzyl alcohol and water) was employed to inhibit H2O2 decomposition.







Abstract
Four highly porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) containing pyrene units were prepared and explored for photocatalytic H2O2 production. The experimental studies are complemented by density functional theory calculations, proving that the pyrene unit is more active for H2O2 production than the bipyridine and (diarylamino)benzene units reported previously. H2O2 decomposition experiments verified that the distribution of pyrene units over a large surface area of COFs plays an important role in catalytic performance. The Py&#8208;Py&#8208;COF though contains more pyrene units than other COFs which induces a high H2O2 decomposition due to a dense concentration of pyrene in close proximity over a limited surface area. Therefore, a two&#8208;phase reaction system (water&#8208;benzyl alcohol) was employed to inhibit H2O2 decomposition. This is the first report on applying pyrene&#8208;based COFs in a two&#8208;phase system for photocatalytic H2O2 generation.

         <title>Rational Utilization of Black Phosphorus Nanosheets to Enhance Palladium&#8208;Mediated Bioorthogonal Catalytic Activity for Activation of Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is applied to enhance palladium&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal catalytic activity by using a powerful partner: black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets, which can accelerate the transformation of Pd2+ to Pd0 to boost the reaction cycle, thus achieving a superior decaging efficiency of prodyes and prodrugs.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed chemistry has played a significant role in the growing subfield of bioorthogonal catalysis. However, rationally designing Pd nanocatalysts that show outstanding catalytic activity and good biocompatibility poses a great challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy through exploiting black phosphorous nanosheets (BPNSs) to enhance Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal catalytic activity. Firstly, the electron&#8208;donor properties of BPNSs enable in situ growth of Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) on it. Meanwhile, due to the superb capability of reducing PdII, BPNSs can act as hard nucleophiles to accelerate the transmetallation in the decaging reaction process. Secondly, the lone pair electrons of BPNSs can firmly anchor PdNPs on their surface via Pd&#8722;P bonds. This design endows Pd/BP with the capability to retard tumor growth by activating prodrugs. This work proposes new insights into the design of heterogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts (TMCs) for bioorthogonal catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;A novel strategy is applied to enhance palladium-mediated bioorthogonal catalytic activity by using a powerful partner: black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets, which can accelerate the transformation of Pd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to Pd&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to boost the reaction cycle, thus achieving a superior decaging efficiency of prodyes and prodrugs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pd-catalyzed chemistry has played a significant role in the growing subfield of bioorthogonal catalysis. However, rationally designing Pd nanocatalysts that show outstanding catalytic activity and good biocompatibility poses a great challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy through exploiting black phosphorous nanosheets (BPNSs) to enhance Pd-mediated bioorthogonal catalytic activity. Firstly, the electron-donor properties of BPNSs enable in situ growth of Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) on it. Meanwhile, due to the superb capability of reducing Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;, BPNSs can act as hard nucleophiles to accelerate the transmetallation in the decaging reaction process. Secondly, the lone pair electrons of BPNSs can firmly anchor PdNPs on their surface via Pd&#8722;P bonds. This design endows Pd/BP with the capability to retard tumor growth by activating prodrugs.

         <title>Supramolecular Enhancement of Charge Transport through Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A remarkable enhancement of charge transport at a molecular junction is realized in pillar[5]arene&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayers through host&#8211;guest interactions with cationic guest molecules. The improved charge transport is positively correlated with the strong binding affinity between pillar[5]arene and cationic guest molecules, which results in a delocalized structure in the supramolecular complex and a reduced energy offset.







Abstract
Intermolecular charge transport is one of the essential modes for modulating charge transport in molecular electronic devices. Supermolecules are highly promising candidates for molecular devices because of their abundant structures and easy functionalization. Herein, we report an efficient strategy to enhance charge transport through pillar[5]arene self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) by introducing cationic guests. The current density of pillar[5]arene SAMs can be raised up to about 2.1 orders of magnitude by inserting cationic molecules into the cavity of pillar[5]arenes in SAMs. Importantly, we have also observed a positive correlation between the charge transport of pillar[5]arene&#8208;based complex SAMs and the binding affinities of the pillar[5]arene&#8208;based complexation. Such an enhancement of charge transport is attributed to the efficient host&#8211;guest interactions that stabilize the supramolecular complexes and lower the energy gaps for charge transport. This work provides a predictive pattern for the regulation of intermolecular charge transport in guiding the design of next generation switches and functional sensors in supramolecular electronics.

         <title>Tuning the Microenvironment in Monolayer MgAl Layered Double Hydroxide for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Electrocatalysis in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolayered MgAl layered double hydroxide (MgAl&#8208;LDH) is used for the regulation of the local environment of Cu as catalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene electroreduction in neutral media. The catalyst benefits from the lower energy barrier of MgAl&#8208;LDH for water dissociation and an OH&#8722; enriched environment at the reaction interface, delivering a high C2H4 selectivity at a current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide provides a feasibility to achieve a carbon&#8208;neutral energy cycle. However, there are a number of bottleneck issues to be resolved before industrial application, such as the low conversion efficiency, selectivity and reaction rate, etc. Engineering local environment is a critical way to address these challenges. Here, a monolayer MgAl&#8208;LDH was proposed to optimize the local environment of Cu for stimulating industrial&#8208;current&#8208;density CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 electroreduction in neutral media. In situ spectroscopic results and theoretical study demonstrated that the Cu electrode modified by MgAl&#8208;LDH (MgAl&#8208;LDH/Cu) displayed a much higher surface pH value compared to the bare Cu, which could be attributed to the decreased energy barrier for hydrolysis on MgAl&#8208;LDH sites with more OH&#8722; ions on the surface of the electrode. As a result, MgAl&#8208;LDH/Cu achieved a C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 55.1&#8201;% at a current density up to 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#8197;M KHCO3 electrolyte.

         <title>Decrypting the Controlled Product Selectivity over Ag&#8722;Cu Bimetallic Surface Alloys for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8722;Cu surface alloys, as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, demonstrated controllable product selectivity when their surface compositions and the applied potentials were rationally tuned. The working mechanism of these catalysts was revealed by in situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations. A predominant region map describing the thermodynamic predominance of *CO involved subsequent reactions is provided as reliable guidance for the design of catalysts for CO2 reduction towards value&#8208;added products.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) with controlled product selectivity is realized on Ag&#8722;Cu bimetallic surface alloys, with high selectivity towards C2 hydrocarbons/alcohols (&#8776;60&#8201;% faradaic efficiency, FE), C1 hydrocarbons/alcohols (&#8776;41&#8201;% FE) and CO (&#8776;74&#8201;% FE) achieved by tuning surface compositions and applied potentials. In situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that surface&#8208;composition&#8208;dependent d&#8208;band center could tune *CO binding strengths, regulating the *CO subsequent reaction pathways and then the product selectivity. Further adjusting the applied potentials will alter the energy of participated electrons, which leads to controlled ECO2RR selectivity towards desired products. A predominant region map, with an indicator proposed to evaluate the thermodynamic predominance of the *CO subsequent reactions, is then provided as a reliable theoretical guidance for the controllable ECO2RR product selectivity over bimetallic alloys.

         <title>Suppressing Universal Cathode Crossover in High&#8208;Energy Lithium Metal Batteries via a Versatile Interlayer Design
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin versatile interlayer consisting of multifunctional adsorption sites is introduced to suppress the cathode crossover in high&#8208;energy lithium metal batteries using various high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Ni&#8208;rich layered metal oxide cathode, Li&#8208;/Mn&#8208;rich cathode, and sulfur cathode, while stabilizing the lithium stripping/plating process even under current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The universal cathode crossover such as chemical and oxygen has been significantly overlooked in lithium metal batteries using high&#8208;energy cathodes which leads to severe capacity degradation and raises serious safety concerns. Herein, a versatile and thin (&#8776;25&#8197;&#956;m) interlayer composed of multifunctional active sites was developed to simultaneously regulate the Li deposition process and suppress the cathode crossover. The as&#8208;induced dual&#8208;gradient solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase combined with abundant lithiophilic sites enable stable Li stripping/plating process even under high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron X&#8208;ray experiments revealed that N&#8208;rich framework and CoZn dual active sites can effectively mitigate the undesired cathode crossover, hence significantly minimizing Li corrosion. Therefore, assembled lithium metal cells using various high&#8208;energy cathode materials including LiNi0.7Mn0.2Co0.1O2, Li1.2Co0.1Mn0.55Ni0.15O2, and sulfur demonstrate significantly improved cycling stability with high cathode loading.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonylation of Aryl Bromides Enabled by Potassium Metabisulfite as a Uniquely Effective SO2 Surrogate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of aryl bromides has been developed utilizing an inexpensive, stench&#8208;free, inorganic sulfur salt (K2S2O5) as a uniquely effective SO2 surrogate. While initial mechanistic studies identified SO2 as a catalyst poison, later use of the isolated oxidative addition complex revealed that SO2 insertion occurs via dissolved SO2 slowly released upon thermal decomposition of K2S2O5.







Abstract
The development and mechanistic investigation of a nickel&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of aryl bromides is disclosed. The reaction proceeds in good yields for a variety of substrates and utilizes an inexpensive, stench&#8208;free, inorganic sulfur salt (K2S2O5) as a uniquely effective SO2 surrogate. The active oxidative addition complex was synthesized, isolated, and fully characterized by a combination of NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis. The use of the isolated oxidative addition complex in both stoichiometric and catalytic reactions revealed that SO2 insertion occurs via dissolved SO2, likely released upon thermal decomposition of K2S2O5. Key to the success of the reaction is the role of K2S2O5 as a reservoir of SO2 that is slowly released, thus preventing catalyst poisoning.

         <title>Laser Writing of Block&#8208;Copolymer Images into Mesopores Using SBDC&#8208;Initiated Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the iniferter N,N(diethylamino)dithiocarbamoylbenzyl(trimethoxy)silane (SBDC) under visible&#8208;light irradiation with and without additional photocatalyst is demonstrated for the first time. Through the transfer of the polymerization to a commercially available microscope, automated laser writing of different polymers in mesoporous silica films is realized.







Abstract
For miniaturization, as well as for improving artificial nanopore performance, precise local polymer functionalization and the combination of different functionalities are required. Imagining data driven nanopore design automated nanopore functionalization would be beneficial. Using direct laser writing as one option of automated nanopore polymer functionalization visible light induced polymerizations are beneficial. Here, we demonstrate the functionalization of mesoporous silicafilms with two different polymers using automated laser writing. For this we developed a visible light (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm and 405&#8197;nm) N,N(diethylamino)dithiocarbamoylbenzyl(trimethoxy)silane (SBDC) inifierter initiated polymerization. While transferring this visible light induced polymerization using SBDC to a commercially available microscope, direct, automated laser writing, as well as polymer re&#8208;initiation was demonstrated. Thereby, polymer spots of 37 and 40&#8197;&#956;m in diameter were achieved using 1&#8211;5&#8197;seconds for each irradiated spot.

         <title>Dynamic&#8208;to&#8208;Static Planar Chirality Conversion in Pillar[5]arenes Regulated by Guest Solvents or Amplified by Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pR and pS forms of pillar[5]arene regulated by short&#8208; and long&#8208;chain guest solvents, respectively, were both diastereomerically memorized by introducing bulky groups through click reactions. The diastereomeric excess was also amplified by crystallization of the pillar[5]arene. The subsequent introduction of bulky groups yielded a pillar[5]arene with excellent diastereomeric excess (95&#8201;%&#8197;de).







Abstract
Controlling dynamic chirality and memorizing the controlled chirality are important. Chirality memory has mainly been achieved using noncovalent interactions. However, in many cases, the memorized chirality arising from noncovalent interactions is erased by changing the conditions such as the solvent and temperature. In this study, the dynamic planar chirality of pillar[5]arenes was successfully converted into static planar chirality by introducing bulky groups through covalent bonds. Before introducing the bulky groups, pillar[5]arene with stereogenic carbon atoms at both rims existed as a pair of diastereomers, and thus showed planar chiral inversion that was dependent on the chain length of the guest solvent. The pS and pR forms, regulated by guest solvents, were both diastereomerically memorized by introducing bulky groups. Furthermore, the diastereomeric excess was amplified by crystallization of the pillar[5]arene. The subsequent introduction of bulky groups yielded pillar[5]arene with an excellent diastereomeric excess (95&#8201;%&#8201;de).

         <title>Missing&#8208;Linker&#8208;Confined Single&#8208;Atomic Pt Nanozymes for Enzymatic Theranostics of Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled single&#8208;atomic Pt nanozyme was developed using a facile missing&#8208;linker&#8208;confined coordination strategy. The nanozyme shows superior catalase&#8208;mimicking activity for the catalytic conversion of H2O2 overproduced in tumors into localized O2 for tumor hypoxia alleviation, which leads to enhanced ROS generation from loaded photosensitizers for apoptotic cancer cell death.







Abstract
Conventional nanozymes often possess low active site density. Pursuing effective strategies for constructing highly active single&#8208;atomic nanosystems with maximum atom utilization efficiency is exceptionally attractive. Herein, we develop a facile &#8220;missing&#8208;linker&#8208;confined coordination&#8221; strategy to fabricate two self&#8208;assembled nanozymes, i.e., conventional nanozyme (NE) and single&#8208;atomic nanozyme (SAE), which respectively consist of Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms as active catalytic sites anchored in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with encapsulated photosensitizers for catalase&#8208;mimicking enhanced photodynamic therapy. Compared to a Pt nanoparticle&#8208;based conventional nanozyme, a Pt single&#8208;atomic nanozyme shows enhanced catalase&#8208;mimicking activity in generating oxygen for overcoming tumor hypoxia, thus exhibiting a more efficient reactive oxygen species generation and high tumor inhibition rate.

Hierarchically structured high electroactive surface area gold electrodes were fabricated using a simple and inexpensive thermal wrinkling approach and a chronoamperometric pulsing nanoroughening method. The nanoroughened electrodes showed antifouling capabilities and could be used for the sensitive electrochemical detection of copper in tap&#8208;water and for the enzyme&#8208;free detection of glucose in human blood serum samples.







Abstract
A key challenge for sensor miniaturization is to create electrodes with smaller footprints, while maintaining or increasing sensitivity. In this work, the electroactive surface of gold electrodes was enhanced 30&#8208;fold by wrinkling followed by chronoamperometric (CA) pulsing. Electron microscopy showed increased surface roughness in response to an increased number of CA pulses. The nanoroughened electrodes also showed excellent fouling resistance when submerged in solutions containing bovine serum albumin. The nanoroughened electrodes were used for electrochemical detection of Cu2+ in tap water and of glucose in human blood plasma. In the latter case, the nanoroughened electrodes allowed highly sensitive enzyme&#8208;free sensing of glucose, with responses comparable to those of two commercial enzyme&#8208;based sensors. We anticipate that this methodology to fabricate nanostructured electrodes can accelerate the development of simple, cost&#8208;effective, and high sensitivity electrochemical platforms.

         <title>Toward Scalable Nanofluidic Osmotic Power Generation from Hypersaline Water Sources with a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a strategy toward scalable nanofluidic osmotic power generation by using PSS/HKUST&#8208;1 membrane with subnanometer pores and using hypersaline water sources. The hypersaline water sources provide high ionic conductivity and the subnanometer pores guarantee charge selectivity under high salinity. The power density stabilized at 1.7&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 when the membrane area increased to 7&#8197;mm2, the highest for macro&#8208;sized nanofluidic membranes.







Abstract
Nanofluidic membranes have shown great promise in harvesting osmotic energy but its scalablity remains challenging since most studies only tested with a membrane area of &#8776;10&#8722;2&#8197;mm2 or smaller. We demonstrate that metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework membranes with subnanometer pores can be used for scalable osmotic power generation from hypersaline water sources. Our membrane can be scaled up to a few mm2, and the power density can be stabilized at 1.7&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2. We reveal that the key is to improve the out&#8208;of&#8208;membrane conductance while keeping the membrane's charge selectivity, contradicting the previous conception that the ionic conductivity of the membrane plays the dominating role. We highlight that subnanometer pores are essential to ensure the charge selectivity in hypersaline water sources. Our results suggest the importance to engineer the interplay between the in&#8208;membrane and out&#8208;of&#8208;membrane ion transport properties for scalable osmotic power generation.

         <title>Cationic Tetrylene&#8208;Iron(0) Complexes: Access Points for Cooperative, Reversible Bond Activation and Open&#8208;Shell Iron(&#8722;I) Ferrato&#8208;Tetrylenes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic tetrylene centres, built into a chelating ligand framework, allow for the formation of reactive CO&#8208;free iron(0) complexes. For Sn, a highly reactive high&#8208;spin, open&#8208;shell d8 complex is formed, capable of the cooperative, reversible activation of H2 at the Sn&#8722;Fe interface. Both EII&#8722;Fe0 complexes (E=Ge, Sn) also undergo one&#8208;electron reduction to form unique iron(&#8722;I) ferrato&#8208;tetrylenes, a compound class which was previously unknown.







Abstract
The open&#8208;shell cationic stannylene&#8208;iron(0) complex 4 (4=[PhiPDippSn&#8901;Fe&#8901;IPr]+; PhiPDipp={[Ph2PCH2Si(iPr)2](Dipp)N}; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; IPr=[(Dipp)NC(H)]2C:) cooperatively and reversibly cleaves dihydrogen at the Sn&#8722;Fe interface under mild conditions (1.5&#8197;bar, 298&#8197;K), in forming bridging hydrido&#8208;complex 6. The One&#8208;electron oreduction of the related GeII&#8722;Fe0 complex 3 leads to oxidative addition of one C&#8722;P linkage of the PhiPDipp ligand in an intermediary Fe&#8722;I complex, leading to FeI phosphide species 7. One&#8208;electron reduction reaction of 4 gives access to the iron(&#8722;I) ferrato&#8208;stannylene, 8, giving evidence for the transient formation of such a species in the reduction of 3. The covalently bound tin(II)&#8208;iron(&#8722;I) compound 8 has been characterised through EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry, and supporting computational analysis, which strongly indicate a high localization of electron spin density at Fe&#8722;I in this unique d9&#8208;iron complex.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Polyphenylene Wires Comprising Rigid Aliphatic Bicyclo[1.1.1]Pentane Isolator Units</title>

         <dc:description>
Polyphenylene wires regularly substituted with rigid aliphatic bicyclopentane isolators were obtained by on&#8208;surface synthesis and characterized with submolecular precision.







Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) motifs are of growing importance to the pharmaceutical industry as sp3&#8208;rich bioisosteres of benzene rings and as molecular building blocks in materials science. Herein we explore the behavior of 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP moieties on metal surfaces by combining low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy / non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy studies with density functional theory modeling. We examine the configuration of individual BCP&#8208;containing precursors on Au(111), their supramolecular assembly and thermally activated dehalogenative coupling reactions, affording polymeric chains with incorporated electronically isolating units. Our studies not only provide the first sub&#8208;molecular insights of the BCP scaffold behavior on surfaces, but also extend the potential application of BCP derivatives towards integration in custom&#8208;designed surface architectures.

         <title>Chiral Iron Porphyrins Catalyze Enantioselective Intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Amination Upon Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method has been developed for the chiral iron porphyrin catalyzed transformation of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides into chiral indolines and sultams, respectively. The reaction proceeds upon visible light irradiation and with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric amination of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is appealing for synthetic applications due to the biocompatibility and high earth abundance of iron, but examples of such reactions are sparse. Herein we describe chiral iron complexes of meso&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;substituted&#8208;porphyrins that can catalyze asymmetric intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides to afford chiral indolines (29 examples) and benzofused cyclic sulfonamides (17 examples), respectively, with up to 93&#8201;% ee (yield: up to 99&#8201;%) using 410&#8197;nm light under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, for the reactions of arylsulfonyl azides reveal that the Fe(NSO2Ar) intermediate generated in situ under photochemical conditions reacts with the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond through a stepwise hydrogen atom transfer/radical rebound mechanism, with enantioselectivity arising from cooperative noncovalent interactions between the Fe(NSO2Ar) unit and the peripheral substituents of the chiral porphyrin scaffold.

&lt;p&gt;Iron-catalyzed asymmetric amination of C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds is appealing for synthetic applications due to the biocompatibility and high earth abundance of iron, but examples of such reactions are sparse. Herein we describe chiral iron complexes of &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-substituted-porphyrins that can catalyze asymmetric intramolecular C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H amination of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides to afford chiral indolines (29 examples) and benzofused cyclic sulfonamides (17 examples), respectively, with up to 93&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; (yield: up to 99&#8201;%) using 410&#8197;nm light under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, for the reactions of arylsulfonyl azides reveal that the Fe(NSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ar) intermediate generated in situ under photochemical conditions reacts with the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond through a stepwise hydrogen atom transfer/radical rebound mechanism, with enantioselectivity arising from cooperative noncovalent interactions between the Fe(NSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ar) unit and the peripheral substituents of the chiral porphyrin scaffold.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR Light&#8208;Mediated Mitochondrial RNA Modification for Cancer RNA Interference Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the well&#8208;known cyclization reaction between furan and nucleotides of nucleic acid triggered by 1O2, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated mitochondrial RNA modification (NIMiRM) strategy was herein developed for long&#8208;term NIR/PA dual&#8208;modality imaging and remarkable suppression of tumors in vivo.







Abstract
Mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) plays a critical role in synthesis of mitochondrial proteins. Interfering mtRNA is a highly effective way to induce cell apoptosis. Herein, we report a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated mitochondrial RNA modification approach for long&#8208;term imaging and effective suppression of tumors. A tumor&#8208;targetable NIR fluorescent probe f&#8208;CRI consisting of a cyclic RGD peptide, a NIR fluorophore IR780, and a singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;labile furan group for RNA modification was rationally designed and synthesized. This probe was demonstrated to dominantly accumulate in cellular mitochondria and could be covalently conjugated onto mtRNA upon 808&#8197;nm irradiation resulting in prolonged retention in tumors. More notably, this covalent modification of mtRNA by f&#8208;CRI could perturb the function of mitochondria leading to remarkable tumor suppression. We thus envision that our current approach would offer a potential approach for cancer RNA interference therapeutics.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of Two Light and Pressure Responsive Physisorbents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An emerging strategy to enable energy efficient gas storage and separation technologies is the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive physisorbents. Herein, we report two isostructural light&#8208;modulated adsorbents (LMAs) which undergo pressure&#8208;induced transformations from closed (non&#8208;porous) to open (porous) phases via adsorption of N2, CO2 and C2H2.







Abstract
An emerging strategy in the design of efficient gas storage technologies is the development of stimuli&#8208;responsive physisorbents which undergo transformations in response to a particular stimulus, such as pressure, heat or light. Herein, we report two isostructural light modulated adsorbents (LMAs) containing bis&#8208;3&#8208;thienylcyclopentene (BTCP), LMA&#8208;1 [Cd(BTCP)(DPT)2] (DPT=2,5&#8208;diphenylbenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate) and LMA&#8208;2 [Cd(BTCP)(FDPT)2] (FDPT=5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,diphenylbenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate). Both LMAs undergo pressure induced switching transformations from non&#8208;porous to porous via adsorption of N2, CO2 and C2H2. LMA&#8208;1 exhibited multi&#8208;step adsorption while LMA&#8208;2 showed a single&#8208;step adsorption isotherm. The light responsive nature of the BTPC ligand in both frameworks was exploited with irradiation of LMA&#8208;1 resulting in a 55&#8201;% maximum reduction of CO2 uptake at 298&#8197;K. This study reports the first example of a switching sorbent (closed to open) that can be further modulated by light.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent and Enantioselective Intermolecular Coupling of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Allenes and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new protocols for regiodivergent and enantioselective coupling of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes and aldehydes promoted by easily accessible Co complexes were developed. These processes represent the first example of transformations through enantioselective oxidative cyclization of allenes and aldehydes with diverse regioselectivities accurately controlled by chiral ligands.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective coupling of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes and aldehydes through regiodivergent oxidative cyclization followed by stereoselective protonation or reductive elimination promoted by chiral phosphine&#8208;Co complexes is presented. Such processes represent unprecedented and unique reaction pathways for Co catalysis that enable catalytic enantioselective generation of metallacycles with divergent regioselectivity accurately controlled by chiral ligands, affording a wide range of allylic alcohols and homoallylic alcohols that are otherwise difficult to access without the need of pre&#8208;formation of stoichiometric amounts of alkenyl&#8208; and allyl&#8208;metal reagents in up to 92&#8201;% yield, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 regioselectivity, &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2 dr and &gt;99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er.

         <title>An Efficient Opal&#8208;Suppressor Tryptophanyl Pair Creates New Routes for Simultaneously Incorporating up to Three Distinct Noncanonical Amino Acids into Proteins in Mammalian Cells
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study significantly expands the scope of multiple noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) mutagenesis in mammalian cells by developing a tryptophanyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair that efficiently decodes the TGA stop codon. It can be combined with three previously established pairs to create new ways to incorporate up to three distinct ncAAs into a protein in mammalian cells. Using this technology, two distinct cytotoxic drugs were site&#8208;specifically conjugated to a full&#8208;length humanized antibody.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific incorporation of multiple distinct noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins in mammalian cells is a promising technology, where each ncAA must be assigned to a different orthogonal aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA pair that reads a distinct nonsense codon. Available pairs suppress TGA or TAA codons at a considerably lower efficiency than TAG, limiting the scope of this technology. Here we show that the E. coli tryptophanyl (EcTrp) pair is an excellent TGA&#8208;suppressor in mammalian cells, which can be combined with the three other established pairs to develop three new routes for dual&#8208;ncAA incorporation. Using these platforms, we site&#8208;specifically incorporated two different bioconjugation handles into an antibody with excellent efficiency, and subsequently labeled it with two distinct cytotoxic payloads. Additionally, we combined the EcTrp pair with other pairs to site&#8208;specifically incorporate three distinct ncAAs into a reporter protein in mammalian cells.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of a Pyryne Precursor to Higher Pyrenylenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By palladium&#8208;catalyzed oligomerization reactions of pyrene&#8208;based o&#8208;trimethylsilyl triflates, larger cyclic pyrenylenes were formed with up to 10&#8208;membered rings as has been unambiguously characterized by SCXRD. Furthermore, the underlying reaction mechanism has been studied by quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The palladium catalyzed cyclotrimerization of ortho&#8208;silylaryl triflates as aryne precursors is meanwhile an established method to synthesize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with triphenylene cores. During the palladium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of a pyrene with an o&#8208;silylaryl triflate moiety in the K&#8208;region higher homologues with central eight&#8208; and ten&#8208;membered rings (the pyrenylenes) were found, besides the expected trimer and a protocol was developed to isolate all members of this series. This unprecedented new class of PAHs was fully investigated by all means, including X&#8208;ray diffraction of single&#8208;crystals, UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations, a mechanism of all higher cyclooligomers is proposed.

         <title>From Dinitrogen to N&#8208;Containing Organic Compounds: Using Li2CN2 as a Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the conversion of inert N2 into various nitrogen&#8208;containing organic compounds is presented. The activated N&#8208;containing species Li2CN2 is successfully prepared in high yields from N2 gas, C and LiH. Li2CN2 can be transformed into a range of N&#8208;containing organic compounds, including cyanamides, carbodiimides, N&#8208;aryl cyanamides and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives. 15N&#8208;labeled products, including oxazolidine derivatives, have also been prepared from 15N2 gas.







Abstract
Through the synergies of a heterogeneous synthetic approach and a homogeneous synthetic methodology, N&#8208;containing organic compounds can be synthesized via activated N&#8208;containing species prepared from N2 gas and suitable carbon sources. From N2, carbon, and LiH, we have previously succeeded in the high&#8208;yield preparation of Li2CN2 as the activated N&#8208;containing species. In this work, we applied Li2CN2 as a novel synthetic synthon for constructing N&#8208;containing organic compounds. A series of reaction models, including a substitution reaction, cycloaddition reaction, and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction, were successfully performed using Li2CN2 under mild conditions. Various valuable cyanamides, carbodiimides, N&#8208;aryl cyanamides and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives were readily synthesized in moderate to excellent yields. With this method, the 15N&#8208;labeled products, including oxazolidine derivatives with anti&#8208;cancer activity, could also be facilely prepared from 15N2 gas.

         <title>The Rigid Core and Flexible Surface of Amyloid Fibrils Probed by Magic&#8208;Angle&#8208;Spinning NMR Spectroscopy of Aromatic Residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic ring flips are a hallmark of &#8220;breathing motions&#8221; in proteins. But does the infinitely long &#946;&#8208;sheet structure of amyloids allow for such motions? In this study, we apply specific isotope labeling and solid&#8208;state NMR to two amyloid fibrils to demonstrate that the motion of aromatic rings strongly differs between the core and the surface of the fibril.







Abstract
Aromatic side chains are important reporters of the plasticity of proteins, and often form important contacts in protein&#8211;protein interactions. We studied aromatic residues in the two structurally homologous cross&#8208;&#946; amyloid fibrils HET&#8208;s, and HELLF by employing a specific isotope&#8208;labeling approach and magic&#8208;angle&#8208;spinning NMR. The dynamic behavior of the aromatic residues Phe and Tyr indicates that the hydrophobic amyloid core is rigid, without any sign of &#8220;breathing motions&#8221; over hundreds of milliseconds at least. Aromatic residues exposed at the fibril surface have a rigid ring axis but undergo ring flips on a variety of time scales from nanoseconds to microseconds. Our approach provides direct insight into hydrophobic&#8208;core motions, enabling a better evaluation of the conformational heterogeneity generated from an NMR structural ensemble of such amyloid cross&#8208;&#946; architecture.

         <title>Controlled Deformation of Soft Nanogel Particles Generates Artificial Biominerals with Ordered Internal Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled deformation of soft nanogel particles during their occlusion within calcite crystals enables the generation of artificial biominerals with oriented internal structure. This model system provides new mechanistic insights regarding the formation of oriented structures during biomineralization and indicates that the rational design of multi&#8208;scale nanocomposite materials should be feasible via nanoparticle occlusion.







Abstract
Biominerals can exhibit exceptional mechanical properties owing to their hierarchically&#8208;ordered organic/inorganic nanocomposite structure. However, synthetic routes to oriented artificial biominerals of comparable complexity remain a formidable technical challenge. Herein we design a series of soft, deformable nanogels that are employed as particulate additives to prepare nanogel@calcite nanocomposite crystals. Remarkably, such nanogels undergo a significant morphological change&#8212;from spherical to pseudo&#8208;hemispherical&#8212;depending on their degree of cross&#8208;linking. This deformation occurs normal to the growth direction of the (104) face of the calcite and the underlying occlusion mechanism is revealed by in situ atomic force microscopy studies. This model system provides new mechanistic insights regarding the formation of oriented structures during biomineralization and offers new avenues for the design of synthetic nanocomposites comprising aligned anisotropic nanoparticles.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Electrocatalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reactions Accelerated by Interpretable Intrinsic Descriptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes an interpretable intrinsic descriptor to accelerate the high&#8208;throughput screening of more than 700&#8197;single&#8208;atom catalysts without calculations by combining physical insights with machine learning. The role of metal&#8208;ligand interaction on activity is also clarified using this descriptor. A series of experiments further verify the descriptor's guidance.







Abstract
Developing easily accessible descriptors is crucial but challenging to rationally design single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). This paper describes a simple and interpretable activity descriptor, which is easily obtained from the atomic databases. The defined descriptor proves to accelerate high&#8208;throughput screening of more than 700&#8197;graphene&#8208;based SACs without computations, universal for 3&#8211;5d transition metals and C/N/P/B/O&#8208;based coordination environments. Meanwhile, the analytical formula of this descriptor reveals the structure&#8211;activity relationship at the molecular orbital level. Using electrochemical nitrogen reduction as an example, this descriptor's guidance role has been experimentally validated by 13&#8197;previous reports as well as our synthesized 4&#8197;SACs. Orderly combining machine learning with physical insights, this work provides a new generalized strategy for low&#8208;cost high&#8208;throughput screening while comprehensive understanding the structure&#8208;mechanism&#8208;activity relationship.

         <title>Suppressive Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions on Ruthenium/TiO2 Promote Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Reduction with Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suppressive strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSI) enable hot electrons excited on Ru to transfer to a TiO2&#8722;H2 support, thereby reducing the electron density on Ru and accelerating light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction with methane. The optimized Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 composite exhibits an enhanced CO2 conversion rate of 400&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) have gained great attention in the heterogeneous catalysis field, but its negative role in regulating light&#8208;induced electron transfer is rarely explored. Herein, we describe how SMSI significantly restrains the activity of Ru/TiO2 in light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by CH4 due to the photo&#8208;induced transfer of electrons from TiO2 to Ru. In contrast, on suppression of SMSI Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 achieves a 46&#8208;fold CO2 conversion rate compared to Ru/TiO2. For Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2, a considerable number of photo&#8208;excited hot electrons from Ru nanoparticles (NPs) migrate to oxygen vacancies (OVs) and facilitate CO2 activation under illumination, simultaneously rendering Ru&#948;+ electron deficient and better able to accelerate CH4 decomposition. Consequently, photothermal catalysis over Ru/TiO2&#8722;H2 lowers the activation energy and overcomes the limitations of a purely thermal system. This work offers a novel strategy for designing efficient photothermal catalysts by regulating two&#8208;phase interactions.

         <title>Branched Multimeric Peptides as Affinity Reagents for the Detection of &#945;&#8208;Klotho Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Klotho recognizing branched peptides were prepared via parallel automated fast&#8208;flow synthesis. The branched peptide binders show at least a 30&#8208;fold improvement in affinity relative to the monomeric versions, can be used to study Klotho engagement by pull&#8208;down from cell lysates, and label Klotho for live imaging in kidney cells.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Klotho, an aging&#8208;related protein found in the kidney, parathyroid gland, and choroid plexus, acts as an essential co&#8208;receptor with the fibroblast growth factor 23 receptor complex to regulate serum phosphate and vitamin D levels. Decreased levels of &#945;&#8208;Klotho are a hallmark of age&#8208;associated diseases. Detecting or labeling &#945;&#8208;Klotho in biological milieu has long been a challenge, however, hampering the understanding of its role. Here, we developed branched peptides by single&#8208;shot parallel automated fast&#8208;flow synthesis that recognize &#945;&#8208;Klotho with improved affinity relative to their monomeric versions. These peptides were further shown to selectively label Klotho for live imaging in kidney cells. Our results demonstrate that automated flow technology enables rapid synthesis of complex peptide architectures, showing promise for future detection of &#945;&#8208;Klotho in physiological settings.

         <title>Unsupervised Learning&#8208;Guided Accelerated Discovery of Alkaline Anion Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cells</title>

A virtual module compound enumeration screening (V&#8208;MCES) model was used to automatically search the chemical space containing over 420&#8201;000 candidates and identified promising AEMs with highly chemical stability.







Abstract
Without insight into the correlation between the structure and properties, anion exchange membranes (AEMs) for fuel cells are developed usually using the empirical trial and error method or simulation methods. Here, a virtual module compound enumeration screening (V&#8208;MCES) approach, which does not require the establishment of expensive training databases and can search the chemical space containing more than 4.2&#215;105 candidates was proposed. The accuracy of the V&#8208;MCES model was considerably improved when the model was combined with supervised learning for the feature selection of molecular descriptors. Techniques from V&#8208;MCES, correlating the molecular structures of the AEMs with the predicted chemical stability, generated a ranking list of potential high stability AEMs. Under the guidance of V&#8208;MCES, highly stable AEMs were synthesized. With understanding of AEM structure and performance by machine learning, AEM science may enter a new era of unprecedented levels of architectural design.

         <title>A Hydrazine&#8208;Nitrate Flow Battery Catalyzed by a Bimetallic RuCo Precatalyst for Wastewater Purification along with Simultaneous Generation of Ammonia and Electricity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new and general electrochemical redox strategy for spontaneous and simultaneous decontamination of wastewater and generation of both fuels and electricity at low cost. Using hydrazine and nitrate effluents as a demonstration, the bimetallic RuCo precatalyst can efficiently catalyze both the hydrazine oxidation and nitrate reduction reactions so as to assemble a hydrazine&#8208;nitrate flow battery with electricity and ammonia generation.







Abstract
The traditional technologies for industrial and agricultural effluent treatment are often energy&#8208;intensive. Herein, we suggest an electrochemical redox strategy for spontaneous and simultaneous decontamination of wastewater and generation of both fuels and electricity at low cost. Using hydrazine and nitrate effluents as a demonstration, we propose a hydrazine&#8208;nitrate flow battery (HNFB) that can efficiently purify the wastewater and meanwhile generate both ammonia fuel and electricity with the assistance of our developed bimetallic RuCo precatalyst. Specifically, the battery delivers a peak power density of 12&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and continuously operates for 20&#8197;h with an ammonia yield rate of ca. 0.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The generated electricity can further drive a hydrazine electrolyzer to produce hydrogen fuel. Our work provides an alternative pathway to purify wastewater and generate high value&#8208;added fuels at low cost.

         <title>Polymerized Thermally Activated Delayed&#8208;Fluorescence Small Molecules: Long&#8208;Axis Polymerization Leads to a Nearly Concentration&#8208;Independent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nearly concentration&#8208;independent luminescence has been demonstrated by polymerizing a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor type TADF small molecule through its long&#8208;axis direction rather than the short&#8208;axis one. The corresponding PLQY remains almost unchanged, leading a promising EQE up to 20&#8201;% in a whole doping control window of 5&#8211;100&#8197;wt.&#8201;%.







Abstract
Nowadays numerous thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers have been developed for PLEDs to realize high device performance and tunable emission colors. However, they often possess a strong concentration dependence on their luminescence including aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). Herein, we first report a nearly concentration&#8208;independent TADF polymer based on the strategy of polymerized TADF small molecules. It is found that when a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) type TADF small molecule is polymerized through its long&#8208;axis direction, the triplet state is distributed along the polymeric backbone to effectively suppress the unwanted concentration quenching. Unlike the short&#8208;axis one with an ACQ effect, the photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of the resultant long&#8208;axis polymer remains almost unchanged with the increasing doping concentration.

     alt="Polymerized Thermally Activated Delayed-Fluorescence Small Molecules: Long-Axis Polymerization Leads to a Nearly Concentration-Independent Luminescence"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nearly concentration-independent luminescence has been demonstrated by polymerizing a donor-acceptor-donor type TADF small molecule through its long-axis direction rather than the short-axis one. The corresponding PLQY remains almost unchanged, leading a promising EQE up to 20&#8201;% in a whole doping control window of 5&#8211;100&#8197;wt.&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays numerous thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers have been developed for PLEDs to realize high device performance and tunable emission colors. However, they often possess a strong concentration dependence on their luminescence including aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) and aggregation-induced emission (AIE). Herein, we first report a nearly concentration-independent TADF polymer based on the strategy of polymerized TADF small molecules. It is found that when a donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) type TADF small molecule is polymerized through its long-axis direction, the triplet state is distributed along the polymeric backbone to effectively suppress the unwanted concentration quenching. Unlike the short-axis one with an ACQ effect, the photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of the resultant long-axis polymer remains almost unchanged with the increasing doping concentration. Accordingly, a promising external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 20&#8201;% is successfully achieved in a whole doping control window of 5&#8211;100&#8197;wt.&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network as a Modulator of Bismuth&#8211;Antimony Complex Anodes for Self&#8208;Healable and Wider Temperature Adaptive Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bi0.67Sb1.33S3 nanoparticles deposited on poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PET) are confined when the polymer is crosslinked with polythioctic acid (PTA) (Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA). This material exhibits wider temperature adaptability for potassium storage, benefiting from a greater number of hydrogen bonds exchangeable binding (HBEB) sites. Moreover, in&#8208;depth insights into the intrinsic formation and potassium&#8208;storage mechanisms are also put forward.







Abstract
Antimony (Sb)&#8208;based anodes are attractive candidates in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their superior capacities and rational potassium inserting voltages. However, the sluggish kinetics and poor interface compatibility severely hinder practical application. Herein, Bi0.67Sb1.33S3 nanospheres embedded into in situ formed poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) crosslinked with polythioctic acid (PET@PTA) (Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA) were elaborately conceptualized with hydrogen bonds exchangeable binding (HBEB) sites. Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA exhibits notable self&#8208;healing ability and wider temperature adaptability. Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA displays an impressive capacity of 819&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, prominent cycle ability with a 73&#8201;% capacity conservation after 500 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and high capacity retention of 66&#8201;% and 84&#8201;% at &#8722;40 and 70&#8201;&#176;C to that case at room temperature, respectively, for potassium storage. This work provides a new perspective for HBEB sites in maximizing the desirable K+ storage performance.

         <title>Catalytic Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Radical Carbocyanation of 2&#8208;Azadienes for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino Nitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and broadly applicable method for the construction of complex &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile derivatives through a novel cascade strategy is presented. Alkyl radicals are generated by the photo&#8208;mediated reductive decarboxylation of redox&#8208;active esters, captured by 2&#8208;azadienes to provide 2&#8208;azallyl radicals and cyanized by a copper catalyst.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Amino nitriles are versatile structural motifs in a variety of biologically active compounds and pharmaceuticals and they serve as valuable building blocks in synthesis. The preparation of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitriles from readily available scaffolds, however, remains challenging. Herein is reported a novel dual catalytic photoredox/copper&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and regioselective radical carbocyanation of 2&#8208;azadienes to access functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitriles by using redox&#8208;active esters (RAEs) and trimethylsilyl cyanide. This cascade process employs a broad scope of RAEs and provides the corresponding &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile building blocks in 50&#8211;95&#8201;% yields (51 examples, regioselectivity &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5). The products were transformed into prized &#945;&#8208;amino nitriles and &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Mechanistic studies suggest a radical cascade coupling process.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Activated Circularly Polarized Luminescence Film Based on Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Copper(I) Cluster&#8208;Assembled Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) copper cluster&#8208;assembled chains was prepared, which exhibited unique photo&#8208;response characteristics with concentration&#8208;wavelength correlation. Based on this work, the first photo&#8208;activated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film was constructed, which showed reversible photo&#8208;response with excellent fatigue resistance.







Abstract
In this study, a pair of chiral copper(I) cluster&#8208;assembled materials (R/S&#8208;2) was prepared, exhibiting unique photo&#8208;response characteristics with a concentration&#8208;wavelength correlation property in DMSO solution. By the combination of R/S&#8208;2 with a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix, the first photo&#8208;activated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film was developed, the CPL signal (glum=9&#215;10&#8722;3) of which could be induced by UV light irradiation. Moreover, the film exhibited a reversible photo&#8208;response and extremely good fatigue resistance. Mechanism study revealed that the photo&#8208;response properties of the R/S&#8208;2 solution and film are attributed to the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics of R/S&#8208;2 and a photo&#8208;induced deoxygenation process. This study enriches the types of luminescent cluster&#8208;assembled molecules and provides a new strategy for the construction of metal cluster&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive composite materials.

Mechanism study revealed that the photo-response properties of the R/S-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; solution and film are attributed to the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics of R/S-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and a photo-induced deoxygenation process. This study enriches the types of luminescent cluster-assembled molecules and provides a new strategy for the construction of metal cluster-based stimuli-responsive composite materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ruthenium/TiO2&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenolysis of Polyethylene Terephthalate: Reaction Pathways Dominated by Coordination Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination environment of Ru in Ru/TiO2 dictates the reaction pathway for polyethylene terephthalate hydrogenolysis. Under&#8208;coordinated Ru sites favor the formation of arenes through a desired binding orientation of aromatic adsorbates, which discourages ring hydrogenation and ring&#8208;opening reactions.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrogenolysis can produce benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX), where the selectivity control is challenging. We report a reaction pathway dictated by the Ru coordination environment by examining the binding geometries of adsorbates on differently coordinated Ru centers and their evolution during PET hydrogenolysis. A BTX yield of 77&#8201;% was obtained using a Ru/TiO2 with a Ru coordination number of ca. 5.0 where edge/corner sites are dominant, while more gas and saturated products were formed for Ru/TiO2 containing primarily terrace sites. Density functional theory and isotopic labelling revealed that under&#8208;coordinated Ru edge sites favor &#8220;upright&#8221; adsorption of aromatic adsorbates while well&#8208;coordinated Ru sites favor &#8220;flat&#8208;lying&#8221; adsorption, where the former mitigates ring hydrogenation and opening. This study demonstrates that reaction pathways can be directed through controlled reactant/intermediate binding via tuning of the Ru coordination environment for efficient conversion of PET to BTX.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;&#960; Catalysis Made Asymmetric&#8212;Enantiomerization Catalysis Mediated by the Chiral &#960;&#8208;System of a Perylene Bisimide Cyclophane</title>

         <dc:description>
The rate of [5]helicene enantiomerization has been enhanced by a factor of about 700 by using a chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophane host at room temperature. Computational models suggest the reaction barrier is lowered through a stabilization of the nonplanar transition&#8208;state structure of [5]helicene within the cyclophane through &#960;&#8208;&#960; catalysis, supported by a ground&#8208;state destabilization of the heterochiral host&#8211;guest complex.







Abstract
Enzymes actuate catalysis through a combination of transition state stabilization and ground state destabilization, inducing enantioselectivity through chiral binding sites. Here, we present a supramolecular model system which employs these basic principles to catalyze the enantiomerization of [5]helicene. Catalysis is hereby mediated not through a network of functional groups but through &#960;&#8208;&#960; catalysis exerted from the curved aromatic framework of a chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophane offering a binding pocket that is intricately complementary with the enantiomerization transition structure. Although transition state stabilization originates simply from dispersion and electrostatic interactions, enantiomerization kinetics are accelerated by a factor of ca. 700 at 295&#8197;K. Comparison with the meso&#8208;congener of the catalytically active cyclophane shows that upon configurational inversion in only one PBI moiety the catalytic effect is lost, highlighting the importance of precise transition structure recognition in supramolecular enzyme mimics.

         <title>MALDI Imaging Assisted Discovery of a Di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosyltransferase from Platycodon grandiflorum Root</title>

A MALDI MS imaging assisted genome screening strategy was developed and enabled the identification and characterization of a di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosyltransferase PgGT1 from Platycodon grandiflorum root.







Abstract
A matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) assisted genome mining strategy was developed for the discovery of glycosyltransferase (GT) from the root of Platycodon grandiflorum. A di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosyltransferase PgGT1 was discovered and characterized that is capable of catalyzing platycoside&#8197;E (PE) synthesis through the attachment of two &#946;&#8208;1,6&#8208;linked glucosyl residues sequentially to the glucosyl residue at the C3 position of platycodin&#8197;D (PD). Although UDP&#8208;glucose is the preferred sugar donor for PgGT1, it could also utilize UDP&#8208;xylose and UDP&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine as weak donors. Residues S273, E274, and H350 played important roles in stabilizing the glucose donor and positioning the glucose in the optimal orientation for the glycosylation reaction. This study clarified two key steps involved in the biosynthetic pathway of PE and could greatly contribute to improving its industrial biotransformation.

         <title>Study of Intermolecular Reconfiguration of Flexible COF&#8208;5 Film and Its Ultra&#8208;high Chemiresistive Humidity Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible COF&#8208;5 film is synthesized on PI substrate by a vapor&#8208;assisted conversion method and used to fabricate a humidity sensor. The sensor shows resistance response to 11&#8201;%&#8211;98&#8201;% RH over 4 orders of magnitude and maintains a linear relation even when bent at 180&#176;. Simulations are applied to reveal the intermolecular reconfiguration mechanism in humidity sensing. The superior sensitivity makes COF&#8208;5 films a potential candidate for human respiration monitoring.







Abstract
Recently, abundant active materials are developed to achieve the wearable detection of human body humidity. However, the limited response signal and sensitivity restrict further application due to their moderate affinity to water. Herein, we propose a flexible COF&#8208;5 film synthesized by a brief vapor&#8208;assisted method at room temperature. Intermediates are calculated by DFT simulation to investigate the interaction between COF&#8208;5 and water. The adsorption and desorption of water molecule result in a reversible deformation of COF layers while creating new conductive path by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The as&#8208;prepared COF&#8208;5 films are applied to the flexible humidity sensors, exhibiting a resistance change in 4 orders of magnitude with remarkable linear relation between log function of resistance and relative humidity (RH) in 11&#8201;%&#8211;98&#8201;% RH range. Applications including respiratory monitoring and non&#8208;contact switch are tested, providing a promising prospect for the detection of human body humidity.

         <title>Solid Interhalogen Compounds with Effective Br0 Fixing for Stable High&#8208;energy Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an all&#8208;active solid interhalogen compound IBr as a cathode, in which the active I fixes the oxidized Br0 without generating crossing&#8208;diffusing Br2/Br3&#8722; species during the whole charge and discharge process. The Zn||IBr battery delivers improved energy density compared with those of I2, MEMBr3, and TPABr3 cathodes.







Abstract

         <title>Rationally Modulating the Functions of Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx Nanocomposite Electrocatalysts towards Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the understanding of intrinsic properties of the catalyst and the interactions with all pertinent intermediates, an efficient Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx electrocatalyst was designed and proven to realize mutual coordination among functions of active sites on the efficient dissociative adsorption of water, the easy desorption of OH&#8722;, and the facile hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bond formation concurrently, leading to significantly boosted alkaline HER kinetics.







Abstract
Identifying electrocatalysts with functions of easy dissociation of water, rapid transformation of hydroxyl and facile hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bond formation are indispensable while challenge for realizing efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we presented the design of Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx nanocomposites towards addressing this challenge. We showed that Ni3Sn2 possessed ideal hydrogen adsorption and low hydroxyl adsorption abilities and NiSnOx facilitated water dissociation and hydroxyl transfer process, respectively. Consequently, the fine&#8208;tuned interplay of the two functional parts realized the mutual coordination among the multiple functions and led to significantly boosted HER kinetics. Current densities of 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 were obtained at overpotentials of 14 and 165&#8197;mV on the optimized catalyst. This work highlights the significance of considering intrinsic interactions between active sites and all pertinent intermediates on obtaining promising electrocatalysts.

         <dc:description>
A new and convenient procedure for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation of bromoacetonitrile has been developed. A variety of valuable 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;acetamide and 2&#8208;cyanoacetate compounds were obtained in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, this transformation can be carried out under atmospheric pressure and provides an alternative route to 7 drug compounds.







Abstract
Nitrile compounds containing ester and amide groups are important functionalized chemicals in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. In this article, an efficient and convenient palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative procedure toward 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;acetamide and 2&#8208;cyanoacetate compounds has been developed. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions via radical intermediate which is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization. Gram&#8208;scale experiment was performed successfully under low catalyst loading and gave the target product in excellent yield. Additionally, this transformation can be performed under atmospheric pressure and provide alternative routes to 7 drug precursors.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Regulation of Cobalt Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes: Engineering High&#8208;Efficiency Catalase Mimics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A correlation between the atomic structures of Co single&#8208;atom nanozymes and their catalase&#8208;like performance is established by both computational screening and experimental design. A strategy is elucidated for atomic&#8208;level regulation of Co single&#8208;atom nanozymes operating as catalase mimics.







Abstract
Nanozymes aim to mimic the highly evolved active centers of natural enzymes. Despite progress in nanozyme engineering, their catalytic performance is much less favorable compared with natural enzymes. This study shows that precise control over the atomic configuration of the active centers of Co single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) enables the rational regulation of their catalase&#8208;like performance guided by theorical calculations. The constructed Co&#8208;N3PS SAzyme exhibits an excellent catalase&#8208;like activity and kinetics, exceeding the representative controls of Co&#8208;based SAzymes with different atomic configurations. Moreover, we developed an ordered structure&#8208;oriented coordination design strategy for rationally engineering SAzymes and established a correlation between the structure and enzyme&#8208;like performance. This work demonstrates that precise control over the active centers of SAzymes is an efficient strategy to mimic the highly evolved active sites of natural enzymes.

         <title>Precise Regulation of Emission Maxima and Construction of Highly Efficient Electroluminescent Materials with High Color Purity</title>

A nitrogen&#8208;atom embedding molecular engineering strategy is proposed and a series of congeners of BN&#8208;TP (a triphenylene core substituted with two di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcarbazole motifs and coordinated with one boron atom), namely BN&#8208;TP&#8208;Nx (x=1, 2, 3, 4), are constructed. Anchoring the nitrogen&#8208;atom at different positions of triphenylene hexagonal lattice results in varying degrees of perturbation to the electronic structure. The newly&#8208;constructed multiple resonance induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters demonstrate the precise regulation of emission maxima to meet industrial demand, and further enrich the MR&#8208;TADF molecular reservoir.







Abstract
Advanced multiple resonance induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters have emerged as a privileged motif for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), because they furnish highly tunable TADF characteristics and high color purity emission. Herein, based on the unique nitrogen&#8208;atom embedding molecular engineering (NEME) strategy, a series of compounds BN&#8208;TP&#8208;Nx (x=1, 2, 3, 4) have been customized. The nitrogen&#8208;atom anchored at different position of triphenylene hexagonal lattice entails varying degrees of perturbation to the electronic structure. The newly&#8208;constructed emitters have demonstrated the precise regulation of emission maxima of MR&#8208;TADF emitters to meet the actual industrial demand, and further enormously enriched the MR&#8208;TADF molecular reservoir. The BN&#8208;TP&#8208;N3&#8208;based OLED exhibits ultrapure green emission, with peak of 524&#8197;nm, full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 33&#8197;nm, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.23, 0.71), and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.3&#8201;%.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Anchored Molybdenum Oxide Nanoclusters as Efficient Catalysts for the Electrosynthesis of Ammonia and Urea</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoOx nanoclusters supported on carbon black are used as highly efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts for selective synthesis of NH3 and urea via nitrate reduction and its coupling with CO2. This work opens up new opportunities for the rational design of novel electrocatalysts for the electrocatalytic activation of small molecules for the production of value&#8208;added chemicals.







Abstract
The electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction and its coupling with CO2 can provide novel and clean routes to synthesize NH3 and urea, respectively. However, their practical application is still impeded by the lack of efficient catalysts with desirable Faradaic efficiency (FE) and yield rate. Herein, we report the synthesis of molybdenum oxide nanoclusters anchored on carbon black (MoOx/C) as electrocatalyst. It affords an outstanding FE of 98.14&#8201;% and NH3 yield rate of 91.63&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 in NO3&#8722; reduction. Besides, the highest FE of 27.7&#8201;% with a maximum urea yield rate of 1431.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 toward urea is also achieved. The formation of electron&#8208;rich MoOx nanoclusters with highly unsaturated metal sites in the MoOx/C heterostructure is beneficial for enhanced catalytic performance. Studies on the mechanism reveal that the stabilization of *NO and *CO2NOOH intermediates are critical for the NH3 and urea synthesis, respectively.

         <title>Mimicking Photosynthesis: A Natural Z&#8208;Scheme Photocatalyst Constructed from Red Mud Bauxite Waste for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nature&#8208;mimicking Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalyst was constructed by coupling acid&#8208;activated and alkali&#8208;treated red mud bauxite waste with an iron electron mediator. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state system presented a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity for overall water splitting, which even exceeded several artificially synthesized Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalysts. This work provides a sustainable way for new energy production through component engineering of natural mineral&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalysts have attracted significant attention due to their great potential for solar fuel production. However, delicately coupling two individual semiconductors with a charge shuttle by a material strategy remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a new protocol of natural Z&#8208;Scheme heterostructures by strategically engineering the component and interfacial structure of red mud bauxite waste. Advanced characterizations elucidated that the hydrogen&#8208;induced formation of metallic Fe enabled the effective Z&#8208;Scheme electron transfer from &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 to TiO2, leading to the significantly boosted spatial separation of photo&#8208;generated carriers for overall water splitting. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first Z&#8208;Scheme heterojunction based on natural minerals for solar fuel production. Thus our work provides a new avenue toward the utilization of natural minerals for advanced catalysis applications.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Stabilized Defective Black Phosphorene as a Lithium&#8208;Like Catalyst for Boosting Nitrogen Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and feasible strategy is proposed for obtaining environmentally stable defective black phosphorene via simultaneously constructing defects and fluorination protection. Due to the inherent high chemical reactivity, the fluorine&#8208;stabilized defective black phosphorene as a nitrogen reduction electrocatalyst induces a high NH3 yield rate of &#8776;70&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and a high Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;26&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) is recognized as a zero&#8208;carbon emission method for NH3 synthesis. However, to date, this technology still suffers from low yield and low selectivity associated with the catalyst. Herein, inspired by the activation of N2 by lithium metal, a highly reactive defective black phosphorene (D&#8722;BPene) is proposed as a lithium&#8208;like catalyst for boosting electrochemical N2 activation. Correspondingly, we also report a strategy for producing environmentally stable D&#8722;BPene by simultaneously constructing defects and fluorination protection based on topochemical reactions. Reliable performance evaluations show that the fluorine&#8208;stabilized D&#8722;BPene can induce a high NH3 yield rate of &#8776;70&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and a high Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;26&#8201;% at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE in an aqueous electrolyte. This work not only exemplifies the first stable preparation and practical application of D&#8722;BPene, but also brings a new design idea for NRR catalysts.

         <title>Water Activation for Boosting Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>

Water is demonstrated as an innovative co&#8208;reactant in the luminol electrochemiluminescence system for the first time. Cobalt&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide serves as an advanced co&#8208;reaction accelerator to efficiently catalyze the oxidation of water for the generation of reactive oxygen species, achieving the enhancement of electrochemiluminescence emission for sensitive biosensing.







Abstract
In conventional luminol electrochemiluminescence (ECL) systems, hydrogen peroxide and dissolved oxygen are employed as typical co&#8208;reactants to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) for efficient ECL emission. However, the self&#8208;decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and limited solubility of oxygen in water inevitably restrict the detection accuracy and luminous efficiency of luminol ECL system. Inspired by ROS&#8208;mediated ECL mechanism, for the first time, we used cobalt&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide as co&#8208;reaction accelerator to efficiently activate water to generate ROS for enhancing luminol emission. Experimental investigations verify the formation of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals in the process of electrochemical water oxidation, which subsequently react with luminol anion radicals to trigger strong ECL signals. Finally, the detection of alkaline phosphatase has been successfully achieved with impressive sensitivity and reproducibility for practical sample analysis.

         <title>Reversible Li Plating on Graphite Anodes through Electrolyte Engineering for Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>

Electrolyte engineering towards a high&#8208;quality SEI regulates Li plating on graphite anode with a high reversibility and uniform morphology during fast&#8208;charging. This work provides a novel strategy to address the Li plating issue for fast&#8208;charging batteries.







Abstract
The difficulties to identify the rate&#8208;limiting step cause the lithium (Li) plating hard to be completely avoided on graphite anodes during fast charging. Therefore, Li plating regulation and morphology control are proposed to address this issue. Specifically, a Li plating&#8208;reversible graphite anode is achieved via a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to successfully regulate the Li plating with high reversibility over high&#8208;rate cycling. The evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) before and after Li plating is deeply investigated to explore the interaction between the lithiation behavior and electrochemical interface polarization. Under the fact that Li plating contributes 40&#8201;% of total lithiation capacity, the stable LiF&#8208;rich SEI renders the anode a higher average Coulombic efficiency (99.9&#8201;%) throughout 240&#8197;cycles and a 99.95&#8201;% reversibility of Li plating. Consequently, a self&#8208;made 1.2&#8208;Ah LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 | graphite pouch cell delivers a competitive retention of 84.4&#8201;% even at 7.2&#8197;A (6&#8197;C) after 150&#8197;cycles. This work creates an ingenious bridge between the graphite anode and Li plating, for realizing the high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance and Self&#8208;Powered X&#8208;Ray Detectors Made of Smooth Perovskite Microcrystalline Films with 100&#8197;&#956;m Grains</title>

Dense, smooth, substrate&#8208;integrated, large&#8208;area and thickness&#8208;controlled perovskite microcrystalline films are prepared. They are used as self&#8208;powered microcrystalline X&#8208;ray detectors with an impressive sensitivity of 6.1&#215;104&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 1.5&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, leading to high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging at an ultra&#8208;low dose rate of 67&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, which may further reduce the X&#8208;ray radiation risk to patients.







Abstract
Perovskite single crystals and polycrystalline films have complementary merits and deficiencies in X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. Herein, we report preparation of dense and smooth perovskite microcrystalline films with both merits of single crystals and polycrystalline films through polycrystal&#8208;induced growth and hot&#8208;pressing treatment (HPT). Utilizing polycrystalline films as seeds, multi&#8208;inch&#8208;sized microcrystalline films can be in situ grown on diverse substrates with maximum grain size reaching 100&#8197;&#956;m, which endows the microcrystalline films with comparable carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime (&#956;&#964;) product as single crystals. As a result, self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detectors with impressive sensitivity of 6.1&#215;104&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low detection limit of 1.5&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 are achieved, leading to high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging at an ultra&#8208;low dose rate of 67&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. Combining with the fast response speed (186&#8197;&#956;s), this work may contribute to the development of perovskite&#8208;based low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>Boosting Selective Oxidation of Ethylene to Ethylene Glycol Assisted by In situ Generated H2O2 from O2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ generated H2O2 from O2 electroreduction over mesoporous carbon is applied to oxidize ethylene via titanium silicalite&#8208;1. The in situ generated &#8901;OOH on the mesoporous carbon can form the key active species Ti&#8208;OOH over titanium silicalite&#8208;1 and oxidize ethylene. This route exhibits outstanding production rate and selectivity of ethylene glycol.







Abstract
Ethylene glycol is a useful organic compound and chemical intermediate for manufacturing various commodity chemicals of industrial importance. Nevertheless, the production of ethylene glycol in a green and safe manner is still a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we established an integrated, efficient pathway for oxidizing ethylene into ethylene glycol. Mesoporous carbon catalyst produces H2O2, and titanium silicalite&#8208;1 catalyst would subsequently oxidize ethylene into ethylene glycol with the in situ generated H2O2. This tandem route presents a remarkable activity, i.e., 86&#8201;% H2O2 conversion with 99&#8201;% ethylene glycol selectivity and 51.48&#8197;mmol&#8201;gecat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 production rate at 0.4&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. Apart from generated H2O2 as an oxidant, there exists &#8901;OOH intermediate which could omit the step of absorbing and dissociating H2O2 over titanium silicalite&#8208;1, showing faster reaction kinetics compared to the ex situ one. This work not only provides a new idea for yielding ethylene glycol but also demonstrates the superior of in situ generated H2O2 in tandem route.

         <title>Peripherally Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Decorated Strategy Towards High&#8208;Performance Pure Green Electroluminescence with External Quantum Efficiency over 40&#8201;%</title>

         <dc:description>
A molecular design tactic to achieve both large rate of reverse intersystem crossing and narrow full&#8208;width at half maximum of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters by heavy&#8208;atom effect is proposed by peripherally decorating the MR&#8208;skeleton with selenoxanthone. External quantum efficiency (EQE) above 40&#8201;%, Commission Internationale de l'Echairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.19, 0.70) and reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off are recorded in corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Heavy&#8208;atom integration into thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecule could significantly promote the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. However, simultaneously achieving high efficiency, small roll&#8208;off, narrowband emission and good operational lifetime remains a big challenge for the corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, we report a pure green multi&#8208;resonance TADF molecule BN&#8208;STO by introducing a peripheral heavy atom selenium onto the parent BN&#8208;Cz molecule. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode device based on BN&#8208;STO exhibited state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 40.1&#8201;%, power efficiency (PE) of 176.9&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, well&#8208;suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off and pure green gamut. This work reveals a feasible strategy to reach a balance between fast RISC process and narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of MR&#8208;TADF by heavy atom effect.

         <title>Switching Quantum Interference in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions by Mechanical Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching among different anchoring sites of single&#8208;molecule junctions was achieved by mechanical tuning, leading to the control of the transmission pathway between the destructive quantum interference (DQI) and the constructive quantum interference (CQI) at the single&#8208;molecule level, which provides a new strategy for designing molecular electromechanics devices.







Abstract
The charge transport through single&#8208;molecule electronic devices can be controlled mechanically by changing the molecular geometrical configuration in situ, but the tunable conductance range is typically less than two orders of magnitude. Herein, we proposed a new mechanical tuning strategy to control the charge transport through the single&#8208;molecule junctions via switching quantum interference patterns. By designing molecules with multiple anchoring groups, we switched the electron transport between the constructive quantum interference (CQI) pathway and the destructive quantum interference (DQI) pathway, and more than four orders of magnitude conductance variation can be achieved by shifting the electrodes in a range of about 0.6&#8197;nm, which is the highest conductance range ever achieved using mechanical tuning.

         <title>A Complete Triad of Zero&#8208;Valent 17&#8208;Electron Monoradicals of Group 7 Elements Stabilized by m&#8208;Terphenyl Isocyanides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structurally analogous monomeric manganese(0), technetium(0) and rhenium(0) monoradicals has been stabilized by means of sterically encumbered m&#8208;terphenyl isocyanides. They possess square&#8208;pyramidal structures. Their electron spin of S=
 allows the detection of resolved EPR spectra. High field EPR (Q band and W band) is shown to be a valuable tool for a complete analysis of the tensor components of the manganese compound.







Abstract
The first consistent series of mononuclear 17&#8208;electron complexes of three Group 7 elements has been isolated in crystalline form and studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction and spectroscopic methods. The paramagnetic compounds have a composition of [M0(CO)(CNp&#8208;F&#8208;ArDArF2)4] (M=Mn, Tc, Re; ArDArF2=2,6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)2C6H2F) and are stabilized by four sterically encumbering isocyanides, which prevent the metalloradicals from dimerization. They have a square pyramidal structure with the carbonyl ligands as apexes. The frozen&#8208;solution EPR spectra of the rhenium and technetium compounds are clearly anisotropic with large 99Tc and 185,187Re hyperfine interactions for one component. High&#8208;field EPR (Q band and W band) has been applied for the elucidation of the EPR parameters of the manganese(0) complex.

An efficient method has been developed for the asymmetric intramolecular C(sp3)&#8722;H amination of aryl and arylsulfonyl azides to give chiral indolines and benzofused cyclic sulfonamides in high product yields and with excellent enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions, as reported by Li Dang, Yungen Liu, Chi&#8208;Ming Che and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202218577). This method provides a complementary approach to asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H aminations by precious metal&#8208;based catalysis.

Rock&#8208;solid amyloid?. Aromatic residues in the core of the amyloid fibrils HELLF and HET&#8208;s show no sign&#160;of ring flips suggesting a rigid core that does not undergo "breathing motions". Aromatic residues facing outside on the other hand are highly flexible and show ring flips on various timescales. These conclusions could be drawn from dynamics measurements by solid&#8208;state MAS NMR in combination with specific labeling of phenylalanines and tyrosines as Paul Schanda&#160;et&#8197;al. describe in their Research Article (e202219314).

Non&#8208;covalent interaction modulation is a promising strategy to guide the design of applicable (supra)molecular electronics. A rare investigation of the relationship between host&#8211;guest interaction and supramolecular charge transport is reported by Cunlan Guo, Shigui Chen et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202216987). The current density through the pillar[5]arenes&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayers can be raised up to ~2.1 orders of magnitude after the introduction of cationic guest molecules, providing a new route for the design of molecular electronic devices and functional sensors with tunable electronic components.

Regulation of dynamic chirality and conversion of the regulated dynamic chirality to static chirality is challenging and important for their applications. In their Research Article (e202217971), Tomoki Ogoshi and co&#8208;workers report the control and amplification of dynamic planar chirality of pillar[5]arene by guest solvents and crystallization, respectively. The regulated dynamic chirality was changed to static chirality by introducing bulky stoppers. The image shows the conversion of the dynamic&#8208;to&#8208;static planar chirality in pillar[5]arenes (cars) by introducing bulky stoppers (pit stop).

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Activation of Carbon Monoxide: Ketenyl Anions by PPh3/CO Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article highlights the recent findings reported by Gessner and co&#8208;workers in the synthesis of valuable ketenyl anions by an exchange of triphenylphosphine with carbon monoxide at a metalated ylide. The metal ketenyl/ynolate was structurally characterized and used as a reagent in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Ketenes (R2C=C=O) are important reactive intermediates in organic chemistry which are often challenging to access in stable form due to their polarized cumulenic structure and inherent high reactivity. Ketenyl anions (R(M)C=C=O) or metal ynolates (R&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;OM) represent alternative, highly attractive synthetic targets, but are typically prepared in situ and their structure and synthetic access are little investigated. Now, a fundamentally new strategy utilizing an exchange reaction of a phosphine with carbon monoxide at a metalated ylide gives rise to a series of novel ketenyl anions. These compounds are flexible reagents and can easily be transferred with electrophiles into more complex building blocks for synthetic applications. Since carbon monoxide is an inexpensive C1 building block, the new exchange strategy is an elegant concept and a valuable new entry in the synthetic toolbox of organic synthesis.

Precise and ultrafast ion sieving is highly desirable for versatile applications in environment&#8208;, energy&#8208;, and resource&#8208;related fields.

Abstract
Precise and ultrafast ion sieving is highly desirable for many applications in environment&#8208;, energy&#8208;, and resource&#8208;related fields. The development of a permselective lamellar membrane constructed from parallel stacked two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets opened a new avenue for the development of next&#8208;generation separation technology because of the unprecedented diversity of the designable interior nanochannels. In this Review, we first discuss the construction of homo&#8208; and heterolaminar nanoarchitectures from the starting materials to the emerging preparation strategies. We then explore the property&#8211;performance relationships, with a particular emphasis on the effects of physical structural features, chemical properties, and external environment stimuli on ion transport behavior under nanoconfinement. We also present existing and potential applications of 2D membranes in desalination, ion recovery, and energy conversion. Finally, we discuss the challenges and outline research directions in this promising field.

Dinitrogen activation and addition to unsaturated substrates such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ketones, acid halides, nitriles, alkynes, and allenes mediated by transition metal complexes efficiently afford a variety of N&#8722;C bond formation products.







Abstract
Dinitrogen (N2) activation and functionalization is of fundamental interest and practical importance. This review focuses on N2 activation and addition to unsaturated substrates, including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, heteroallenes, aldehydes, ketones, acid halides, nitriles, alkynes, and allenes, mediated by transition metal complexes, which afforded a variety of N&#8722;C bond formation products. Emphases are placed on the reaction modes and mechanisms. We hope that this work would stimulate further explorations in this challenging field.

         <title>Operando Stability of Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are among the most intriguing electrocatalysts with maximized material efficiency. For their viable application in industry, the next challenge is ensuring their long&#8208;term stability. This Minireview summarizes the recent progress in understanding the operational stability of SACs and provides an outlook for their future developments.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are appealing next&#8208;generation catalysts for various electrochemical technologies. Along with significant breakthroughs in their initial activity, SACs now face the next challenge for their viable applications, insufficient operational stability. In this Minireview, we summarize the current knowledge of SAC degradation mechanisms mainly based on Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C SACs, some of the most investigated SACs. Recent studies on isolated metal, ligand, and support degradations are introduced, and the underlying fundamentals of each degradation path are categorized into active site density (SD) and turnover frequency (TOF) losses. Finally, we discuss the challenges and prospects for the future outlook of stable SACs.

         <title>A Spectroscopic Study on Nitrogen Electrooxidation to Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The powerful electrochemical in situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) techniques are employed to detect reaction intermediates. Based on the detected intermediates, the associative mechanism with the addition of hydroxyl at distal N (distal mechanism) is deduced for nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR).







Abstract
As a potential substitute technique for conventional nitrate production, electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) is gaining more and more attention. But, the pathway of this reaction is still unknown owing to the lack of understanding on key reaction intermediates. Herein, electrochemical in situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) and isotope&#8208;labeled online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) are employed to study the NOR mechanism over a Rh catalyst. Based on the detected asymmetric NO2&#8722; bending, NO3&#8722; vibration, N=O stretching, and N&#8722;N stretching as well as isotope&#8208;labeled mass signals of N2O and NO, it can be deduced that the NOR undergoes an associative mechanism (distal approach) and the strong N&#8801;N bond in N2 prefers to break concurrently with the hydroxyl addition in distal N.

         <title>Excessive Iodine Enabled Ultrathin Inorganic Perovskite Growth at the Liquid&#8208;Air Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin inorganic perovskite nanosheets are prepared by liquid&#8208;air interfacial synthesis by adding only iodine into the precursor solution. The thickness, lateral size, defects, optical and optoelectronic properties of these freestanding materials are optimized by simply adjusting the iodine concentration of the solution.







Abstract
The liquid&#8208;air interface offers a platform for the in&#8208;plane growth of free&#8208;standing materials. However, it is rarely used for inorganic perovskites and ultrathin non&#8208;layered perovskites. Herein the liquid&#8208;air interfacial synthesis of inorganic perovskite nanosheets (Cs3Bi2I9, Cs3Sb2I9) is achieved simply by drop&#8208;casting the precursor solution with only the addition of iodine. The products are inaccessible without iodine addition. The thickness and lateral size of these nanosheets can be adjusted through the iodine concentration. The high volatility of the iodine spontaneously drives precursors that normally stay in the liquid to the liquid&#8208;air interface. The iodine also repairs in situ iodine vacancies during perovskite growth, giving enhanced optical and optoelectronic properties. The liquid&#8208;air interfacial growth of ultrathin perovskites provides multi&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom for constructing perovskite&#8208;based heterostructures and devices at atomic scale.

         <title>Dynamic Activation of Ga Sites by Pt Dopant in Low&#8208;Temperature Liquid&#8208;Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persistent geometric features are identified within low&#8208;temperature liquid&#8208;metal catalysts that may provide active sites for the reaction catalysis. Furthermore, Ga atoms can play a key role in the catalysis mechanism due to an altered electronic structure resulting from the dopant atom and the stochastic nature of the liquid.







Abstract
Liquid GaPt catalysts with Pt concentrations as low as 1&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;atomic&#8201;% have recently been identified as highly active for the oxidation of methanol and pyrogallol under mild reaction conditions. However, almost nothing is known about how liquid state catalysts support these significant improvements in activity. Here, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are employed to examine GaPt catalysts in isolation and interacting with adsorbates. We find that persistent geometric features can exist in the liquid state, given the correct environment. We postulate that the Pt dopant may not be limited to direct involvement in catalysis of reactions, but rather that its presence can also enable Ga atoms to become catalytically active.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarization&#8208;dependent sum&#8208;frequency&#8208;generation (SFG) spectroscopy of adsorbed CO was employed to characterize the morphology of oxide&#8208;supported Pt and Pd nanoparticles. Via the Issp/Ippp ratio, the orientation of CO relative to the macroscopic surface normal reveals the abundance of inclined/curved facets.







Abstract
The surface structure of oxide&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles can be determined via characteristic vibrations of adsorbed probe molecules such as CO. Usually, spectroscopic studies focus on peak position and intensity, which are related to binding geometries and number of adsorption sites, respectively. Employing two differently prepared model catalysts, it is demonstrated that polarization&#8208;dependent sum&#8208;frequency&#8208;generation (SFG) spectroscopy reveals the average surface structure and shape of the nanoparticles. SFG results for different particle sizes and morphologies are compared to direct real&#8208;space structure analysis by TEM and STM. The described feature of SFG could be used to monitor particle restructuring in situ and may be a valuable tool for operando catalysis.

         <title>C&#8208;Bound or O&#8208;Bound Surface: Which One Boosts Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling of carbon dioxide and nitrate is a sustainable and promising alternative for urea synthesis. Here we demonstrate that the localized negatively charged surface with C&#8208;affinity is superior to the positively charged one with O&#8208;affinity, providing guidance for screening and design of electrocatalysts for urea synthesis.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrate under ambient conditions is kind of sustainable and promising alternative method for urea synthesis. To date, the influence of catalyst surface properties on molecular adsorption configuration and electrocatalytic urea synthesis activity is unclear. In this work, we proposed that the urea synthesis activity is closely linked with the localized surface charge on bimetallic electrocatalysts, it is found that a negatively charged surface induces C&#8208;bound path and boosts urea synthesis. The urea yield rate can reach 13.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 on negatively charged Cu97In3&#8208;C, which is about 13&#8197;times that of positively charged Cu30In70&#8208;C counterpart with O&#8208;bound surface. This conclusion also applies to Cu&#8722;Bi and Cu&#8722;Sn systems. The molecular modification shifts the surface of Cu97In3&#8208;C to positively charged state, which leads to a sharp decline in urea synthesis performance. We demonstrated that the C&#8208;bound surface is more favorable than O&#8208;bound one to boost electrocatalytic urea synthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective Reductive (Hetero)Arylation of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonyl Imines by Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric reductive (hetero)arylations of imines using aryl and heteroaryl halides have been uncovered with a chiral cobalt&#8208;bisphosphine catalyst. This approach complements the traditional strategy using preformed organometallic reagents, and it exhibits good functional group compatibility under mild conditions.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective addition of aryl organometallic reagents to imines has emerged as one of the most powerful tools for the formation of optically active diarylmethylamines. Here, we report the first asymmetric reductive (hetero)arylations of imines using aryl and heteroaryl halides enabled by a chiral cobalt&#8208;bisphosphine catalyst. This approach shows good functional group compatibility and complements the reported strategy without use of organometallic reagents. Mechanistic investigations supported that aryl&#8208;cobalt, instead of an arylzinc reagent, was formed in situ in this reductive aryl&#8208;addition event.

         <title>Intramolecular Ynamide&#8211;Benzyne (3+2) Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reactions involving benzyne and ynamides as three&#8208;atom components have been accomplished through the utilization of benzyne precursors having a linking functionality. The ambivalent nature of the intermediate indolium ylide, which exhibits both nucleophilic and electrophilic properties at its C2 atom, is thus brought to light in this approach.







Abstract
We report herein intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reactions between ynamides as three&#8208;atom components and benzyne. In these intramolecular reactions, the two&#8208;bond formation is realized by exploiting benzyne precursors that contain a chlorosilyl group as a linking functionality. This method thus highlights the ambivalent character of the intermediate indolium ylide, which exhibits both nucleophilic and electrophilic properties at its C2 atom.

         <title>Circumcoronenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circumcoronenes were finally obtained by solution&#8208;phase synthesis and isolated in crystalline form. The Br&#248;nsted/Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers or alkynes was employed as the key reaction. X&#8208;ray analysis, NMR and theoretical calculations confirmed a structure with seven aromatic sextets and six localized K&#8208;region double bonds.







Abstract
Circumcoronene, a hexagonal graphene fragment with six zigzag edges, has been the focus of theoretical studies for many years, but its synthesis in solution has remained a challenge. In this study, we present a facile method for synthesizing three derivatives of circumcoronene using Br&#248;nsted/Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ether or alkyne. Their structures were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Bond length analysis, NMR measurement, and theoretical calculations showed that circumcoronene mostly follows Clar's bonding model and exhibits dominant local aromaticity. Its absorption and emission spectra are similar to those of the smaller hexagonal coronene due to its six&#8208;fold symmetry.

         <title>Cooperative Proton and Li&#8208;ion Conduction in a 2D&#8208;Layered MOF via Mechanical Insertion of Lithium Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high ionic conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) was observed in the 2D&#8208;Ti&#8208;dobdc MOF after Li salt intercalation, which improved the H2O affinity of the frameworks, facilitating Li+ and H+ diffusion. Furthermore, the ion diffusion evaluated by PFG&#8197;NMR indicates the counter anion effect. It was demonstrated that the moderate covalent/ionic character of LiBr and the high H2O uptake are crucial factors in efficient ionic conductors.







Abstract
Ionic conduction in highly designable and porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks has been explored through the introduction of various ionic species (H+, OH&#8722;, Li+, etc.) using post&#8208;synthetic modification such as acid, salt, or ionic liquid incorporation. Here, we report on high ionic conductivity (&#963;&gt;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) in a two&#8208;dimensionally (2D)&#8208;layered Ti&#8208;dobdc (Ti2(Hdobdc)2(H2dobdc), H4dobdc: 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid) via LiX (X=Cl, Br, I) intercalation using mechanical mixing. The anionic species in lithium halide strongly affect the ionic conductivity and durability of conductivity. Solid&#8208;state pulsed&#8208;field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG&#8197;NMR ) verified the high mobility of H+ and Li+ ions in the temperature range of 300&#8211;400&#8197;K. In particular, the insertion of Li salts improved the H+ mobility above 373&#8197;K owing to strong binding with H2O. Furthermore, the continuous increase in Li+ mobility with temperature contributed to the retention of the overall high ionic conductivity at high temperatures.

&lt;p&gt;A high ionic conductivity (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) was observed in the 2D-Ti-dobdc MOF after Li salt intercalation, which improved the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O affinity of the frameworks, facilitating Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion. Furthermore, the ion diffusion evaluated by PFG&#8197;NMR indicates the counter anion effect. It was demonstrated that the moderate covalent/ionic character of LiBr and the high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O uptake are crucial factors in efficient ionic conductors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ionic conduction in highly designable and porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks has been explored through the introduction of various ionic species (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, etc.) using post-synthetic modification such as acid, salt, or ionic liquid incorporation. Here, we report on high ionic conductivity (&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in a two-dimensionally (2D)-layered Ti-dobdc (Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Hdobdc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dobdc), H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;dobdc: 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid) via LiX (X=Cl, Br, I) intercalation using mechanical mixing. The anionic species in lithium halide strongly affect the ionic conductivity and durability of conductivity. Solid-state pulsed-field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG&#8197;NMR ) verified the high mobility of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in the temperature range of 300&#8211;400&#8197;K. In particular, the insertion of Li salts improved the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mobility above 373&#8197;K owing to strong binding with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Furthermore, the continuous increase in Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mobility with temperature contributed to the retention of the overall high ionic conductivity at high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical CaC2&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Biochar to C2H2: High Carbon Efficiency and Low Contamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid cathode electrolysis in molten salts is expected to convert biomass carbon into CaC2 with 100&#8201;% carbon efficiency. Simultaneously, the electrolysis can remove elements such as S and P from biomass, circumventing the contamination of harmful H2S and H3P in the final hydrolytic C2H2 product.







Abstract
The carbon to CaC2 route is promising to provide a sustainable elementary unit, C2H2, for the organic synthesis industry, but the traditional thermal reaction process suffers from low carbon efficiency, harmful gas contamination, high temperature operation, and risky CO management. We herein report a high carbon efficiency (ca. 100&#8201;%) conversion of biochar to C2H2 through an electrolytic synthesis of solid CaC2 in molten CaCl2/KCl/CaO at 973&#8197;K. The main reactions are carbon reduction to CaC2 at the solid carbon cathode and oxygen evolution at an inert anode. Meanwhile, the electrolysis removes S and P from the solid cathode, avoiding the formation of CaS and Ca3P2 in CaC2 and consequently eliminating H2S and PH3 contamination in the finally produced C2H2.

         <title>Catalytic Homologation&#8208;Allylboration Sequence for Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Densely Functionalized &#946;&#8208;Fluorohydrins with Tertiary Fluoride Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized &#946;&#8208;fluorohydrins with tertiary fluoride stereocenters can be obtained via catalytic homologation and allylboration sequence with stereoselectivities up to 99&#8201;% ee. By allylboration of ketones, the process can also be used to access compounds with adjacent tertiary C&#8722;F and C&#8722;O stereocenters.







Abstract
Homologation of trisubstituted fluoroalkenes followed by allylboration of aldehyde, ketone and imine substrates is suitable for synthesis of &#946;&#8208;fluorohydrin and amine products. In the presence of (R)&#8208;iodo&#8208;BINOL catalyst enantioselectivities up to 99&#8201;% can be achieved by formation of a single stereoisomer with adjacent stereocenters, of which one is a tertiary C&#8722;F center.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Stable Diazoalkenes by Diazo Transfer from Azides: Pyridine&#8208;Derived Diazoalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable diazoalkenes based on a pyridine backbone are accessible via dinitrogen transfer from azides. This fundamentally new substance class features the lowest C&#8722;C bond polarization of the few known stable diazoalkenes, therefore representing best the presentation R2C=C=N2. Photochemically triggered loss of N2 represents a new strategy to access C4 cumulenes.







Abstract
Recently, stable diazoalkenes have received significant attention as a new substance class in organic chemistry. While their previous synthetic access was exclusively limited to the activation of nitrous oxide, we here establish a much more general synthetic approach utilizing a Regitz&#8208;type diazo transfer with azides. Importantly, this approach is also applicable to weakly polarized olefins such as 2&#8208;pyridine olefins. The new pyridine diazoalkenes are not accessible by the activation of nitrous oxide, allowing for a considerable extension of the scope of this only recently accessed functional group. The new diazoalkene class has properties distinct from the previously reported classes, such as photochemically triggered loss of dinitrogen affording cumulenes and not C&#8722;H insertion products. Pyridine&#8208;derived diazoalkenes represent the so far least polarized stable diazoalkene class reported.

         <title>Stochastic Bullvalene Architecture Modulates Structural Rigidity in &#960;&#8208;Rich Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bullvalene, a shape&#8208;shifting molecular cage, is incorporated into a pi&#8208;rich polymer backbone to modulate chain architecture. Stochastic bullvalene isomers within the backbone lead to a kinked chain architecture and decreased thermal transitions that are tunable based on percent bullvalene incorporation.







Abstract
The synthesis and processing of &#960;&#8208;rich polymers found in novel electronics and textiles is difficult because chain stiffness leads to low solubility and high thermal transitions. The incorporation of &#8220;shape&#8208;shifting&#8221; molecular cages into &#960;&#8208;rich backbone provides an ensemble of structural kinks to modulate chain architecture via a self&#8208;contained library of valence isomers. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of (bullvalene&#8208;co&#8208;phenylene)s that feature smaller persistence lengths than a prototypical rigid rod polymer, poly(p&#8208;phenylene). By varying the amount of bullvalene incorporation within a poly(p&#8208;phenylene) chain (0&#8211;50&#8201;%), we can tune thermal properties and solution&#8208;state conformation. These features are caused by stochastic bullvalene isomers within the polymer backbone that result in kinked architectures. Synthetically, bullvalene incorporation offers a facile method to decrease structural rigidity within &#960;&#8208;rich materials without concomitant crystallization. VT&#8197;NMR experiments confirm that these materials remain dynamic in solution, offering the opportunity for future stimuli&#8208;responsive applications.

         <title>Superhydrophobic and Conductive Wire Membrane for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 19, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superhydrophobic, conductive and hierarchical wire (CuO/F/C(w)) membrane composed of porous core&#8211;shell CuO nanospheres, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) is fabricated by a facile electrospinning strategy. Advantageous features of this membrane electrode including maximized triple&#8208;phase interfaces on highly exposed CuO. Good conductivity and hierarchical architecture enable adequate CO2 supply and effective electron/mass transfer, and afford numerous active sites for efficient CO2 electroreduction to multicarbon products.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid triple&#8208;phase interfaces (TPI) are essential for promoting electrochemical CO2 reduction, but it remains challenging to maximize their efficiency while integrating other desirable properties conducive to electrocatalysis. Herein, we report the elaborate design and fabrication of a superhydrophobic, conductive, and hierarchical wire membrane in which core&#8211;shell CuO nanospheres, carbon nanotubes (CNT), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are integrated into a wire structure (designated as CuO/F/C(w); F, PTFE; C, CNT; w, wire) to maximize their respective functions. The realized architecture allows almost all CuO nanospheres to be exposed with effective TPI and good contact to conductive CNT, thus increasing the local CO2 concentration on the CuO surface and enabling fast electron/mass transfer. As a result, the CuO/F/C(w) membrane attains a Faradaic efficiency of 56.8&#8201;% and a partial current density of 68.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for multicarbon products at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) in the H&#8208;type cell, far exceeding 10.1&#8201;% and 13.4&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for bare CuO.
