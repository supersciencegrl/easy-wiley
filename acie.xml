         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Meta&#8208;C&#8208;H Arylation of Arenes with Varied Linker Lengths: Bridging Catalytic Selectivity with Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The directing group (DG)&#8208;assisted approach has so far been the major route to achieve selective C&#8208;H activation at both proximal and distal positions. While rhodium catalysts are highly effective in DG&#8208;assisted ortho&#8208;C&#8208;H arylation, meta&#8208;C&#8208;H arylation with rhodium has not yet been reported. In this study, we present the first example of Rh&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8208;H arylation of arenes. We found that the 2&#8208;cyanophenyl&#8208;based directing group, in conjunction with aryl boronic acids, selectively promotes meta&#8208;arylation with complete mono&#8208;selectivity. Despite significant advancements in meta&#8208;C&#8208;H activation for substrates with shorter linkers, such as hydrocinnamic acids, benzyl alcohols/amines, etc., meta&#8208;C&#8208;H activation of substrates with longer alkyl chains remains challenging with limited literature examples. We demonstrated that arenes with varying chain lengths, including conformationally flexible and less rigid ones such as 4&#8208;phenylbutanoic acid, 5&#8208;phenyl valeric acid, 6&#8208;phenylcaproic acid, 3&#8208;phenylpropanol, and 4&#8208;phenylbutanol underwent meta&#8208;arylation with high levels of regiocontrol. From a synthetic perspective, this approach could be valuable as it allows for the production of biaryl derivatives of flexible arenes with native functional groups at the meta&#8208;position. The synthetic utility of this strategy is demonstrated through the total synthesis of CNBCA, a bioactive compound possessing promising potency against the SHP2 enzyme activity in vitro.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;temperature CO2 Hydrogenation to Olefins on Anorthic NaCoFe Alloy Carbides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to olefins (CTO) represents an ideal pathway towards carbon neutrality. However, most current CTO catalysts require a high&#8208;temperature condition of 300&#8208;450&#176;C, resulting in high energy consumption and possible aggregation among active sites. Herein, we developed an efficient iron&#8208;based catalyst modified with high&#8208;sodium content (7%) and low&#8208;cobalt content (2%), achieving a CO2 conversion of 22.0% and an olefin selectivity of 55.9% at 240&#176;C and 1000 mL/g/h, and it is even active at 180&#176;C and 4000 mL/g/h with more than 25% olefins in hydrocarbons. The catalyst was kept stable under continuous operating conditions of 500 hours. Numerous characterizations and calculations reveal high content of sodium as an electronic promoter enhances the stability of the active anorthic Fe5C2 phase at low temperatures. Further incorporating the above catalyst with cobalt, as a structural promoter, causes Fe species to form a FexCoy alloying phase, which in turn facilitates the formation of higher active anorthic (FexCoy)5C2 phase, different from the conventional carbides and alloy carbides. An in&#8208;depth investigation of the synergistic effects of structural and electronic promoters can improve catalyst performance, increase reaction efficiency and cost&#8208;effectiveness, and provide profound insights for understanding and optimizing CO2 hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Open Pyrene Sites Isolated by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Helical Chains for Efficient Separation of Xenon and Krypton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving efficient xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation in emerging hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is highly challenging because of the lack of gas&#8208;binding sites on their pore surfaces. Herein, we report the first microporous HOF (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168) based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded helical chains, which prevent self&#8208;aggregation of the pyrene core, thereby preserving open pyrene sites on the pore surfaces. Its activated form, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168a is capable of separating Xe/Kr under ambient conditions while achieving an excellent balance between adsorption capacity and selectivity. At 296 K and 1 bar, the Xe adsorption capacity of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168a reached 78.31 cm&#179;/g, with an Xe/Kr IAST selectivity of 22.0; both values surpass those of currently known top&#8208;performing HOFs. Breakthrough experiments confirmed its superior separation performance with a separation factor of 8.6 and a yield of high&#8208;purity Kr (&gt; 99.5%) of 184 mL/g. Furthermore HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168 exhibits excellent thermal and chemical stability, as well as renewability. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular modeling revealed that the unique electrostatic surface potential around the open pyrene sites creates a micro&#8208;electric field, exerting a stronger polarizing effect on Xe than on Kr, thereby enhancing host&#8208;Xe interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia on AuCu Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Aerogels under Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AuCu single&#8208;atom alloy aerogels (AuCu SAAs) electrocatalyst toward NO3RR with high faradaic efficiency and active ammonia yield under a wide potential window.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) is very attractive for nitrate removal and ammonia production in industrial processes. However, the nitrate reduction reaction is characterized by intense hydrogen competition at strong reduction potentials, which greatly limits the Faraday efficiency at strong reduction potentials. Herein, we reported an AuxCu single&#8208;atom alloy aerogels (AuxCu SAAs) with three&#8208;dimensional network structure with significant nitrate reduction performance of Faraday efficiency (FE) higher than 90&#8201;% over a wide potential range (0&#8201;~&#8201;&#8722;1&#8197;V RHE). The FE of the catalyst was close to 100&#8201;% at a high reduction potential of &#8722;0.8&#8197;VRHE, accompanying with NH3 yield reaching 6.21&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;M&#8722;&gt;1&#8201;cm&lt;M&#8722;&gt;2. More importantly, the catalyst maintained a long&#8208;term operation over 400&#8197;h at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;M&#8722;&gt;2 for the NO3RR using a continuous flow system in a H&#8208;cell. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the catalyst can lower the energy barrier for the hydrogenation reaction of *NO2, leading to a rapid consumption of the generated *H, facilitate the hydrogenation process of NO3RR, and inhibit the competitive HER at high overpotentials, which efficiently promotes the nitrate reduction reaction, especially in industrial applications.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction on Cup&#8208;Stacked Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;responsive hot electron escape driver was constructed using edge&#8208;plane sites in cup&#8208;stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs). During the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) process, these sites exhibited a propensity to release hot electrons due to their unique geometric and electronic structure, enhancing CO2 reduction reactions.







Abstract
Carbon nanotubes feature one&#8208;dimensional nature of collective excitations, wherein strong confinement of surface plasmons severely hinders the liberation of hot electrons (HEs), posing grand challenges for their utilization in photochemistry. In this study, we prototypically achieved directed HEs flow and extraction in hybrid plasmonic CNN based on cup&#8208;stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs), taking advantage of their privileged edge&#8208;plane sites. The localized pz electronic states and accessible intersubband plasmon excitations in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regime stands in striking contrast to the conventional concentric carbon nanotubes, as evidenced by combined photo&#8208;induced force microscopy (PiFM) and transient photocurrent response. The hybrid comprising intimately integrated CSCNTs&#8208;C3N4 effectively sustains interfacial electronic states and underlies the energy extraction out of plasmonic components. The CNN demonstrates almost near&#8208;unity NIR light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to CO with a rate of 1.35&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This work sheds light on the exploitation of metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based plasmonic nanostructures for photocatalytic applications.

&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; electronic states and accessible intersubband plasmon excitations in the near-infrared (NIR) regime stands in striking contrast to the conventional concentric carbon nanotubes, as evidenced by combined photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM) and transient photocurrent response. The hybrid comprising intimately integrated CSCNTs-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; effectively sustains interfacial electronic states and underlies the energy extraction out of plasmonic components. The CNN demonstrates almost near-unity NIR light-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to CO with a rate of 1.35&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work sheds light on the exploitation of metal-free carbon-based plasmonic nanostructures for photocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Spring&#8208;Like Fe(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover Complexes Experiencing Giant and Anisotropic Thermal Expansion Across Two Distinct Temperature Regimes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique supramolecular spring&#8208;like Fe(II)&#8208;SCO complex has been reported, showcasing multiple dynamic factors, including SCO events, ring rotation, and flexible Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au distances. This synergy results in various switchings in magnetism and structure, along with a remarkable &#8220;breathing&#8221; thermal expansion feature across two temperature regions, highlighting its potential as a multifunctional dynamic material for future devices.







Abstract
Dynamic molecules with tunable chemical and physical properties in response to external stimuli hold great potential for applications in various fields such as information storage, smart molecular machines, and biomimetics. Among them, supramolecular springs and spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes can both undergo visible macroscopic changes under heat or light stimulation. In this study, we synthesized a unique trinuclear Fe(II)&#8208;SCO complex, [(R&#8722;L)FeII{Au(CN)2}2] (R&#8201;1), using a chiral chelating ligand decorated with rotatable benzyl rings. The [FeAu2] trinuclear molecules form a 21&#8208;helical supramolecular chain via elastic Au

&#8943;

 ${\cdots }$



Au distance) endows the complex with multiple switchings in both magnetism and structure, as well as the most intriguing characteristic of giant and anisotropic &#8220;breathing&#8221; feature in thermal expansion within two distinct temperature regimes. Specifically, complex R&#8201;1 undergoes two hysteretic magnetic transitions: a non&#8208;spin transition between 360 and 380&#8197;K and an unsymmetric SCO transition in the region of 160&#8211;280&#8197;K, associated with a symmetry&#8208;breaking event between the non&#8208;polar and polar space groups (P212121&#8596;P21). Both transitions are triggered/accompanied by the rotation (inward vs. outward) of the benzyl rings. Correspondingly, reversible spring&#8208;like motions of the helical chains with the helical pitches varying from 11.345140&#8197;K to 12.509280&#8197;K then back to 11.630380&#8197;K&#8197;&#197; are observed in the two distinct temperature regimes. This work demonstrates a significant success in incorporating both SCO and spring&#8208;like motion in one system, paving the way for designing multifunctional dynamic materials for future devices.

         <title>Formation of Multiple Naturally Occurring Meroterpenoid Scaffolds by the Norrish&#8208;Yang Reaction of a p&#8208;Benzoquinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis acid&#8208;promoted Norrish&#8208;Yang reaction of p&#8208;benzoquinone has been demonstrated. The chemodivergent features of this transformation arises from both the regiodivergence of the hydrogen abstraction and the spin properties of semiquinone radicals. The developed chemistry enabled the stereoselective synthesis of multiple scaffolds of Avarane&#8208;derived meroterpenoid from neoavarone.







Abstract
The Norrish&#8208;Yang reaction, as a typical example, demonstrates the inherent ability of photochemical reaction to facilitate formation of sterically congested C&#8722;C bonds, efficiently crafting intricate ring structure in complex organic molecules. Herein we report for the first time a unified synthesis using quinone&#8208;based acid&#8208;promoted Norrish&#8208;Yang photocyclization for the stereoselective construction of multiple avarane&#8208;type meroterpenoid natural products.

         <title>Influence of Chloride and Electrolyte Stability on Passivation Layer Evolution at the Negative Electrode of Mg Batteries Revealed by operando EQCM&#8208;D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding passivation layer formation, its morphology and dissolution is essential to systematically develop electrolytes which enable highly reversible Mg deposition. By applying operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, the impact of chloride and differences between more and less stable electrolytes are revealed, showing that highly efficient interphase&#8208;free cycling is possible.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries are promising for future energy storage. However, among other challenges, their practical application is hindered by low coulombic efficiencies of magnesium plating and stripping. Fundamental processes such as the formation, structure, and stability of passivation layers and the influence of different electrolyte components on them are still not fully understood. In this work, we gain unique insights into the initial Mg plating and stripping cycles by comparing magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Mg(TFSI)2)&#8208; and magnesium tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy)borate (Mg[B(hfip)4]2)&#8208;based electrolytes, each with and without MgCl2, on gold electrodes by highly sensitive operando electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (EQCM&#8722;D) applying hydrodynamic spectroscopy. With the stable Mg[B(hfip)4]2&#8208;based electrolytes, highly efficient and interphase&#8208;free cycling is possible and passivation layers are attributed to electrolyte contaminants. These are forming and degrading during the so&#8208;called initial conditioning process. With the more reactive Mg(TFSI)2&#8208;based electrolyte, thick passivation layers with small pores are growing during cycling. We demonstrate that the addition of chloride lowers the amount of passivated Mg deposits in these electrolytes and accelerates the currentless dissolution of the passivation layer. This has a positive effect since we observe the most efficient cycling and uniform deposition when no interphase is present on the electrode.

         <title>Anion Modulation: Enabling Highly Conductive Stable Polymer Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a design concept of an anion&#8208;modulated polymer electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and decent interfacial compatibility. By combining high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant and high charge density units with an anion receptor unit, we get a polymer electrolyte which possesses a wide electrochemical window (5.55&#8197;V versus Li/Li+) and a high ionic conductivity (3.80&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) at room temperature. The anion&#8208;modulated structure makes it compatible with both Li&#8208;metal anode and high&#8208;voltage LCO cathode. This work provides new insight into the design of high&#8208;performance polymer electrolytes through anion modulation.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are promising ionic conductors for developing high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, developing SPEs with both high ionic conductivity and interfacial compatibility remains a challenge. Here, we propose a design concept of an anion&#8208;modulated polymer electrolyte (termed AMPE) for high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Specifically, we design the AMPE by incorporating high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant and high charge density units with an anion receptor unit. The high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant and high charge density segments contribute to achieving a decent voltage tolerance of the polymer chains and ensure sufficient carrier ions. The anion receptor, represented by a boron&#8208;containing molecule, promotes the generation of free Li+ by dissociating anion&#8208;cation pairs. More importantly, the strong interaction between the electron&#8208;deficient B and the TFSI&#8722; in the matrix promotes the anion reduction to form a stable anion&#8208;derived mosaic&#8208;like solid electrolyte interphase on the Li&#8208;metal anode. As a result, the AMPE exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 3.80&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and effectively suppresses lithium dendrites, enabling an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li|AMPE|LiCoO2 cell to achieve a cycle life of 700&#8197;cycles at an operating voltage of 4.40&#8197;V. This design concept would inspire efforts to develop high&#8208;performance SPEs for high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Location&#8208;Specific Microenvironment Modulation Around Single&#8208;Atom Metal Sites in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single Cu atoms are precisely anchored to Zr&#8208;oxo clusters in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with different &#8208;X (X=&#8208;NO2, &#8208;H, and &#8208;NH2) groups on the linkers. This creates ideal platforms of catalytic Cu sites surrounding with location&#8208;specific microenvironment of &#8208;X groups that play critical roles in regulating the Cu electronic structures, resulting in improved activity in the hydroboration of phenylacetylene.







Abstract
Despite coordination environment of catalytic metal sites has been recognized to be of great importance in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), a significant challenge remains in the understanding how the location&#8208;specific microenvironment in the higher coordination sphere influences their catalysis. Herein, a series of Cu&#8208;based SACs, namely Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X=&#8208;NO2, &#8208;H, and &#8208;NH2), are successfully constructed by anchoring single Cu atoms onto the Zr&#8208;oxo clusters of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), i.e., UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X. The &#8208;X functional groups dangling on the MOF linkers could be regarded as location&#8208;specific remote microenvironment to regulate electronic properties of the single Cu atoms. Remarkably, they exhibit significant differences in the catalysis toward the hydroboration of alkynes. The activity follows the order of Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NO2 &gt; Cu1/UiO&#8208;66 &gt; Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 under identical reaction conditions, where Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NO2 showcases the phenylacetylene conversion of 92&#8201;%, ~3.5 times higher efficiency than that of Cu1/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Experimental and calculation results jointly support that the Cu electronic structure is modulated by the location&#8208;specific microenvironment, thereby regulating the product desorption and promoting the catalysis.

         <title>A Hypothesis on the Function of High&#8208;Valent Fe in NiFe (Hydr)oxide in the Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the dynamic changes in NiFe (hydr)oxide and the role of high&#8208;valent Fe in the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction within alkaline media using in situ techniques. The findings provide insights into the oxidation processes, and show the involvement of bulk and surface Fe4+ species in charge accumulation and catalysis, respectively, offering a novel perspective on optimizing oxygen&#8208; evolution reaction performance.







Abstract
This study investigated the dynamic changes in NiFe (hydr)oxide and identified the role of high&#8208;valent Fe in the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) within alkaline media via in situ techniques. Several high&#8208;valent Fe ions were found to remain considerably stable in the absence of potential in NiFe (hydr)oxide, even 96&#8197;hours after the OER. For Ni2+ hydroxide treated with 57Fe ions, where Fe sites are introduced onto the surface of Ni2+ hydroxide, no Fe4+ species were detected at the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS). The findings of this study suggested that the oxidation of bulk Fe ions, similar to Ni ions, to high valent forms, is charge accumulation without a direct role in OER; these results offered a novel perspective on manipulating Fe states to optimize OER efficacy. The prevailing hypothesis suggested that trace amounts of high&#8208;valent Fe ions, notably those on the surface, directly participate in OER.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Induced Localized Oxide Path Mechanism Enables Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iron&#8208;doped cobalt molybdate three&#8208;dimensional nano&#8208;flower electrocatalyst exhibited excellent performance in the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Fe incorporation regulating the electronic structure, breaking the Co&#8722;O&#8722;Co equilibrium and causing size mismatch, both AEM and LOPM pathways simultaneously occurred on CFMO&#8208;2, where the AEM pathway takes place at Co sites without adjacent Fe and the LOPM pathway takes place at Co&#8722;O&#8722;Fe bimetallic sites.







Abstract
The sluggish reaction kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the inadequate catalytic performance of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts represent substantial barriers to the development of anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). This study performed the synthesis of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanoflower&#8208;like electrocatalyst (CFMO) via a simple one&#8208;step method. The substitution of Co with Fe in the structure induces a localized oxide path mechanism (LOPM), facilitating direct O&#8722;O radical coupling for enhanced O2 evolution. The optimized CFMO&#8208;2 electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance, achieving an overpotential of 217&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, alongside exceptional long&#8208;term stability with minimal degradation after 1000&#8197;h of operation in 1.0&#8197;M KOH. These properties surpass most of conventional noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the assembled AEMWE system, utilizing CFMO&#8208;2, operates with a cell voltage of 1.65&#8197;V to deliver 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ characterizations reveal that, in addition to the traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) at isolated Co sites, a new LOPM occurred around the Fe and Co bimetallic sites. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm the LOPM greatly reduced the energy barriers. This work highlights the potential of LOPM for improving the design of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the development of AEMWE.

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric [2+2] Annulation for the Construction of Chiral Benzocyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective [2+2] annulation for the construction of chiral benzocyclobutenes was developed for the first time. A wide range of enantio&#8208;enriched BCBs could be prepared selectively under mild conditions. Further transformations of the products provide efficient access to a diverse array of chiral BCBs. The enantiodetermining step has been investigated via isolation of the chiral palladacycle intermediate and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Asymmetric de novo synthesis of benzocyclobutenes (BCBs) via catalytic intermolecular reaction is highly desired for efficient access to this important class of compounds, yet such a strategy remains unmet challenge. Here, we report a Pd/Pyrox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [2+2] annulation between arylboronic acids and functionalized alkenes, providing an unprecedented efficient protocol to access various enantio&#8208;enriched BCBs in a modular and versatile manner under mild conditions. A broad substrate scope with excellent enantioselectivity has been achieved under the current protocol. The isolation and characterization of the key chiral palladacycle intermediate, together with DFT calculations, provides strong evidence for the catalytic pathway including an enantiodetermining arylpalladation step.

         <title>The Fatal Mushroom Neurotoxin Muscarine is Released from a Harmless Phosphorylated Precursor upon Cellular Injury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
l&#8208;(+)&#8208;Muscarine is one of the most toxic mushroom metabolites. We identified its congener 4&#8217;&#8208;phosphomuscarine in the fool's funnel and in various fiber cap mushrooms, and chemically and pharmacologically characterized this new natural product. As hydrolysis of its ester releases muscarine, our results help estimate the true toxin content of these mushrooms.







Abstract
l&#8208;(+)&#8208;Muscarine (1)&#8208;producing mushrooms pose a severe threat to human health as ingestion can result in circulatory collapse or even death. However, their metabolic profile is surprisingly poorly understood, including knowledge of poison release and potentially toxic congeners. In the mycelium of the 1&#8208;producing fool's funnel mushroom Clitocybe rivulosa, we identified 4&#8217;&#8208;phosphomuscarine (2) as the major natural product. Its structure was elucidated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and by comparison with a synthesized reference. We also detected this previously overlooked phosphorylated compound in the fiber cap mushrooms Pseudosperma spectrale and Inocybe nitidiuscula. Studies on the activation of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 indicate only weak affinity of 2 to this target. Furthermore, we present biological evidence that muscaridine (3), a quaternary amine congener related to and co&#8208;occurring with 1, does not activate the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 on human embryonic kidney cells. Our work provides important insight into the metabolic profile and the pharmacology of some of the most poisonous mushrooms. As the harmless 2 can liberate the potentially fatal 1 by unspecific enzymatic ester cleavage, these results are highly relevant for emergency medicine to estimate the true toxicity of these mushrooms.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-(+)-Muscarine is one of the most toxic mushroom metabolites. We identified its congener 4&#8217;-phosphomuscarine in the fool's funnel and in various fiber cap mushrooms, and chemically and pharmacologically characterized this new natural product. As hydrolysis of its ester releases muscarine, our results help estimate the true toxin content of these mushrooms.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-(+)-Muscarine (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;)-producing mushrooms pose a severe threat to human health as ingestion can result in circulatory collapse or even death. However, their metabolic profile is surprisingly poorly understood, including knowledge of poison release and potentially toxic congeners. In the mycelium of the &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-producing fool's funnel mushroom &lt;i&gt;Clitocybe rivulosa&lt;/i&gt;, we identified 4&#8217;-phosphomuscarine (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) as the major natural product. Its structure was elucidated by high-resolution mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and by comparison with a synthesized reference. We also detected this previously overlooked phosphorylated compound in the fiber cap mushrooms &lt;i&gt;Pseudosperma spectrale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Inocybe nitidiuscula&lt;/i&gt;. Studies on the activation of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; indicate only weak affinity of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; to this target.

         <title>Development of the Esterase PestE for Amide Bond Synthesis Under Aqueous Conditions: Enzyme Cascades for Converting Waste PET into Tamibarotene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The esterase PestE shows promiscuous activity in catalysing the formation of a wide range of amides under aqueous conditions and can be integrated into enzyme cascades as demonstrated in the conversion of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) degradation product terephthalate into the leukemia drug tamibarotene. PestE variants F33L&#8194;F289A and F33L show improved activity for a model reaction and tamibarotene formation respectively.







Abstract
A growing number of hydrolase enzymes show promiscuous acyltransferase activity, even under aqueous conditions. Here we report, for the first time, the ability of Pyrobaculum calidifontis VA1 esterase (PestE) to catalyse the formation of a wide range of amides in buffer, where the acyl donor forms a significant structural component in the amide product. The reactions occur under mild conditions and can achieve conversions up to 97&#8201;% in 6&#8197;h for formation of N&#8208;benzylfuranamide as the model reaction. We demonstrate PestE's potential in enzyme cascades to make amides from waste PET plastic and the conversion of the terephthalic acid product to tamibarotene, a drug with activity against acute leukemia. Rational mutagenesis led to identification of PestE variants F33L&#8194;F289A and F33L. F33L&#8194;F289A increased conversion of N&#8208;benzylfuranamide by 1.2&#8208;fold, and F33L gave a 4&#8208;fold increase in conversion to tamibarotene.

         <title>Robust and Reversible Thermal/Electro&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Polymeric Adhesives via Synergistic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonds and Ionic Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthogonal yet synergistic effect of H&#8722;bonding DAP/Thy moieties with poly(ionic liquid)s towards the robust and reversible thermal/electro&#8208;responsive polymeric adhesives has been addressed. The incorporated ionic segments can partly mitigate intermolecular DAP/Thy H&#8722;bonding interactions within cohesion network, thereby liberate more free H&#8722;bonds towards the substrate interface, endowing the promoted interfacial adhesion forces.







Abstract
Adhesive conducting elastomers are rising materials towards cutting&#8208;edge applications in wearable and implantable soft electronics. Yet, engineering the conductive adhesives with robust and tunable interfacial bonding strength is still in its infancy stage. We herein identify a structurally novel supramolecular polymer scaffold, characterized by synergistic coexistence of hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8722;bonding) interactions and electrostatic ionic junctions, endowing the robust and tunable elastic conducting adhesives with remarkable thermal/electro&#8208;responsive performance. H&#8722;bonding association and electrostatic interaction play orthogonal yet synergistic roles in the strong supramolecular adhesive formation, serving as the leveraging forces for opposing both cohesion and adhesion energy. To do so, six&#8208;arm star&#8208;shaped random copolymers P1, and P2 are strategically designed, bearing H&#8722;bonding PDAP (poly(diaminopyridine acrylamide)) and PThy (poly(thymine)) segments, which can form hetero&#8208;complementary DAP/Thy H&#8722;bonding association, along with ionic conductive poly(ionic liquid)s segment: PMBT, (poly(1&#8208;[2&#8208;methacryloylethyl]&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethane)&#8208;sulfonamide)). DAP/Thy H&#8722;bonding association, along with electrostatic ionic interaction, can yield dual supramolecular forces crosslinked polymeric networks with robust cohesion energy. Moreover, coexistence of poly(ionic liquid)s can impact and interfere the configuration of H&#8722;bonding association, liberate more free DAP and Thy motifs to form H&#8722;bonds towards substrate, affording strong surface adhesion in a synergistic manner. This work demonstrates a significant forward step towards potential adhesives devoted to hybrid electronic devices.

         <title>Pyrolysis&#8208;Free Synthesis of Synergistic Single&#8208;Atom/Nanocluster Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyrolysis&#8208;free synthetic strategy is developed to integrate single atoms and nanoclusters towards highly satisfactory catalytic performances for both acidic and alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. The as&#8208;prepared catalysts with hybrid single atom/nanocluster sites exhibited superior catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution in both acidic and alkaline media with low over&#8208;potentials at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of 25&#8197;mV and 8.6&#8197;mV.







Abstract
Constructing catalysts that simultaneously contain single atom/metal nanocluster active sites is a promising strategy to enhance the original catalytic behavior and accelerate the catalysis involving multi&#8208;electron reactions or multi&#8208;intermediates. Herein, the pyrolysis&#8208;free synthetic method is developed to integrate single atoms and nanoclusters towards highly satisfactory catalytic performances for both acidic and alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. The controllable pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy allows the precise modulation of the active centers, realizing the optimization of the adsorption energy and the regulation of the synergistic active components. Specially, the as&#8208;prepared catalysts with hybrid single&#8208;atom/nanocluster sites exhibited superior catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution in both acidic and alkaline media with low over&#8208;potentials at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of 25&#8197;mV and 8.6&#8197;mV, respectively, combining with outstanding durability towards high current density and methanol poisoning. This work developed a universal synthetic strategy for the single atom/nanocluster synergy systems and addressed the superiority of hybrid single&#8208;atom/nanocluster sites.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Carbo&#8208;Carboxylation of Alkynes with CO2: En Route to Axially Chiral Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic atroposelective carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkynes with CO2 is reported. A variety of valuable axially chiral carboxylic acids are obtained with good yields and high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, Z/E and enantio&#8208;selectivities. An unexpected anti&#8208;selective carbo&#8208;carboxylation is observed in the sp2&#8208;hybrid carbo&#8208;electrophile&#8208;initiated reductive carboxylation of alkynes.







Abstract
Precise synthesis of carboxylic acids via catalytic carboxylation with CO2 is highly appealing. Although considerable advancements have been achieved in difunctionalizing carboxylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, the asymmetric variants are conspicuously underdeveloped, particularly in addressing axially chiral alkenes. Herein, we report the first catalytic atroposelective carboxylation of alkynes with CO2. A variety of valuable axially chiral carboxylic acids are obtained with good yields and high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, Z/E and enantio&#8208;selectivities. Notably, an unexpected anti&#8208;selective carbo&#8208;carboxylation is observed in the sp2&#8208;hybrid carbo&#8208;electrophile&#8208;initiated reductive carboxylation of alkynes. Mechanistic studies including DFT calculation elucidate the origin of chiral induction and anti&#8208;selectivity in vinyl&#8208;carboxylation of alkynes.

         <title>Design of Ligand&#8208;Nonbridging Sites in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Lithium Storage Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;bridging defect sites are achieved in a metal&#8211;organic framework by integrating a modulator molecule (T&#8217;) into a homologous ligand (T), allowing to unveil the role of them on improving lithium storage performance in this study. The presence of defect sites enables markedly improved Li+ adsorption energy (&#916;Ea) and reduced Li+ migration barriers (Em), leading to boosted lithium storage capabilities.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are lagging in the use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), ascribing to full coordination between metal nodes and organic ligands, to a large extent. By integrating a modulator into a ligand with missing bridging functionality, this study elucidates the role of non&#8208;bridging defect sites in MOFs in tailoring lithium storage performance. A fully bridged pristine MOF (p&#8208;MOF) utilizing the meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl) porphyrin ligand is compared with a modified MOF containing non&#8208;bridging defects (d&#8208;MOF) introduced by a homologous ligand, tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin. Spectroscopic and cryogenic low&#8208;dose electron microscopy techniques verify the presence of non&#8208;bridging defect sites in the d&#8208;MOF and reveal their explicit local structure. Density functional theory calculations show significantly enhanced Li+ adsorption energies and reduced Li+ migration barriers at the non&#8208;bridging sites in the d&#8208;MOF compared to the fully bridging sites in the p&#8208;MOF. As a result, the d&#8208;MOF exhibits exceptional lithium storage performance, achieving a high capacity of 761&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and superior rate performance of 203&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which substantially outperform the p&#8208;MOF. This study highlights the potential of modulating MOFs with non&#8208;bridging defects to develop high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Assisted Controllable Synthesis of PdNi Nanoalloys for Highly Selective Hydrogenation of Biomass&#8208;Derived 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective and stable Pd2Ni1/SBA&#8208;15 nanoalloy catalyst has been prepared using a solvent&#8208;free CO2&#8208;assisted method for the hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural. A striking volcano&#8208;like trend was observed between activity and the Pd/Ni ratio, with 2,5&#8208;bishydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran yield surpassing most previously reported catalysts. Alloying Pd with Ni and the formation of Pd&#948;&#8722;&#8722;Ni&#948;+ pairs significantly enhance catalytic performance.







Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;bishydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran (BHMTHF), a vital fuel precursor and solvent, is crucial for biomass refining. Herein, we report highly selective and stable PdNi nanoalloy catalysts for this deep hydrogenation process. A CO2&#8208;assisted green method was developed for the controllable synthesis of various bimetallic and monometallic catalysts. The PdNi/SBA&#8208;15 catalysts with various Pd/Ni ratios exhibited a volcano&#8208;like trend between BHMTHF yield and Pd/Ni ratio. Among all catalysts tested, Pd2Ni1/SBA&#8208;15 achieved the best performance, converting 99.0&#8201;% of HMF to BHMTHF with 96.0&#8201;% selectivity, surpassing previously reported catalysts. Additionally, the Pd2Ni1/SBA&#8208;15 catalyst maintained excellent stability even after five recycling runs. Catalyst characterizations (e.&#8201;g., HAADF&#8208;STEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the successful formation of the alloy structure with electron transfer between Ni and Pd, which accounts for the remarkable performance and stability of the catalyst. This work paves the way for developing highly selective and stable alloy catalysts for biomass valorization.

         <title>A Structural and Functional Mimic of P680+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimeric MgII&#8208;porphyrin complex has been developed as a structural and functional mimic of the dimeric&#8208;chlorophyll reaction center found in photosystem II. The corresponding &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex was prepared and characterized. The dimeric &#960;&#8208;cation radical showed markedly higher rates of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) oxidation of phenols compared to its monomeric counterpart indicating that photosynthetic reaction centers may employ multiple &#960;&#8208;conjugated complexes in order to lower the barrier to PCET oxidation.







Abstract
One or multiple chlorophyll a molecules are employed in the reaction center of photosystem II&#8242;s main electron donor (defined as P680). We have a poor understanding of how the reaction center facilitates water oxidation in photosystem II and the roles that mono&#8208; and/or multimeric chlorophyll groups play when P680 oxidizes a neighboring tyrosine in order to drive water oxidation at the oxygen evolving complex. We have prepared a dimeric MgII&#8208;porphyrin complex [Mg2(BTPP)] (1, H4&#8208;BTPP=1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;(10,15,20&#8208;triphenylporphyrin&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;benzene) as a structural and functional mimic of the dimeric core of P680. 1 was oxidized by one&#8208;electron to the corresponding &#960;&#8208;cation radical complex 2. The radical cation was characterized by UV/Vis&#8208;NIR, FT&#8208;IR, and EPR spectroscopic techniques. 2 was shown to be reactive towards phenols to give the corresponding phenoxyl radicals, mimicking the reactivity of the P680 cation radical which oxidizes tyrosine to tyrosyl radical. Critically, the dimeric &#960;&#8208;cation radical showed markedly higher rates of proton coupled electron transfer oxidation (PCET) of phenols when compared to its monomeric counterpart [Mg(TPP)] (TPP=5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin). Our findings demonstrate that MgII&#8208;porphyrin complexes are reliable mimics of photosynthetic PCET processes and suggest that photosynthetic reaction centers with multiple &#960;&#8208;conjugated complexes likely lower the barrier to PCET oxidation by &#960;&#8208;cation radical species.

         <title>Reducing Dead Species by Electrochemically&#8208;Densified Cathode&#8208;Interface&#8208;Reaction Layer towards High&#8208;Rate&#8208;Endurable Zn||I&#8208;Br Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A densified cathode&#8208;interface&#8208;reaction layer (CIRL) is electrochemically formed in Br&#8722;&#8208;concentrated electrolytes, which remarkably reduces the &#8220;dead species&#8221; phenomena usually present in diluted electrolytes, enabling Zn||I&#8722;Br batteries involving interhalogen conversion with excellent high&#8208;rate endurability.







Abstract
Interhalogen&#8208;involved aqueous Zn||halogen batteries (AZHBs) are latent high&#8208;energy systems for grid&#8208;level energy storage, yet usually suffer from poor high&#8208;rate endurability caused by the formation of &#8220;dead species&#8221;. Herein, via an electrochemically&#8208;densified cathode&#8208;interface&#8208;reaction layer (CIRL), Zn||I&#8722;Br batteries involving interhalogen reactions between the I2 cathode and Br&#8722; from the electrolytes are initially achieved with excellent high&#8208;rate endurability. Different from that in diluted electrolytes, the CIRL formed in Br&#8722;&#8208;concentrated electrolyte is denser and water&#8208;lean, which enables halogen species conversion with a more rapid charge transfer and lower activation energy. More importantly, the CIRL robustly affords a decent I2 conservation by accelerated conversion kinetics and limited species diffusion, thereby endowing the Zn||I&#8722;Br batteries with an ultralong high&#8208;rate lifespan. The electrochemical mechanism is sufficiently verified by multiple spectral characterizations. Consequently, Zn||I&#8722;Br batteries in Br&#8722;&#8208;concentrated (20&#8197;m) electrolytes exhibit an overwhelming rate capability and lifespan to those in Br&#8722;&#8208;diluted (2&#8197;m) electrolytes. Typically, when cycled at a large current density of 10&#8197;A g&#8722;1, an ultralong lifespan of over 25,000 cycles is achieved with a high retention of 98.3&#8201;%. This study provides new insight into the CIRL&#8208;dictated active species conservation for high&#8208;rate endurable AZHBs, which could apply to other high&#8208;energy interhalogen batteries.

         <title>Masked Divalent Reactivity of Heterobimetallic Lanthanide Isocarbonyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mildly reducing organo&#8208;iron ligand allows trivalent yttrium and dysprosium to react as though they were present in their less common divalent oxidation state. This masked divalent reactivity is used to reduce a series of N&#8208;heterocycles, resulting in the formation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208; or trimetallic lanthanide complexes of the reduced ligands.







Abstract
A new rare&#8208;earth reduction system is described in which trivalent yttrium and dysprosium react as though present in their unstable divalent oxidation state. This masked divalent reactivity is achieved using the isocarbonyl&#8208;bridged dimers [(

         <title>Interface&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Induced C&#8211;C Coupling for C2H4 Photosynthesis from Atmospheric&#8208;Concentration CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Producing ethylene (C2H4) from carbon dioxide (CO2) photoreduction under mild conditions is primarily restricted by the difficulty of C&#8722;C coupling. Herein, we designed highly active metal atom clusters anchored on semiconductor nanosheet, which established heteroatom sites on the interface to steer C&#8722;C coupling, realizing air&#8208;concentration CO2 photoreduction into C2H4 in pure water for the first time. As an example, the Pd nanoclusters loaded on ZnO nanosheets are prepared, demonstrated by the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field image. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the C&#8722;C coupling step over the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets, while quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy illustrates the active sites of Pd and Zn atoms on the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets during CO2 photoreduction. Density functional theoretical calculations unveil the transition state energy barrier of C&#8211;C coupling of CO* and COH* intermediates are only 0.998 eV, hinting the easy C&#8211;C coupling to produce C2 fuels. Therefore, the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets first realize C2H4 photosynthesis by atmospheric&#8208;concentration CO2 reduction with the formation rate of 1.03 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, while the ZnO nanosheets only acquired the carbon monoxide product.</dc:description>

         <title>How Carbene Ligands Transform AuAg Alloy Nanoclusters for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal nanoclusters stabilized by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have attracted increasing interest for their special structures and diverse applications. However, developing synthetic strategies and extending the database of NHC&#8208;protected nanoclusters are still challenging tasks. In this work, a novel and rapid synthetic method is developed to prepare AuAg alloy nanocluster ligated by carbene based on the reactivity of nanoclusters. The rod&#8208;like carbene&#8208;capped bimetal nanocluster, [Au13Ag12(PPh3)8(BMIm)2I8]SbF6 (Au13Ag12:BMIm), was achieved and characterized by a series of techniques. The alloy nanocluster consists of two vertex&#8208;sharing icosahedrons and carbene ligands, phosphine ligands, and I atoms. Interestingly, the introduced carbene ligands show strong coordination capabilities with Au, enhancing the interaction between metal core and ligands. To the best of our knowledge, the carbene&#8208;capped Au13Ag12:BMIm nanocluster is the first of its kind to show higher thermostability and higher sensitivity to light compared with the homogeneously capped analogue nanocluster ([Au13Ag12(PPh3)10I8]SbF6). Density functional theory calculations attribute these properties to a unique delocalization of electrons within the frontier orbitals. Finally, the Au13Ag12:BMIm anchored on NiFe&#8208;LDH exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the electrosynthesis of urea from NO3&#8722; and CO2, achieving a urea production rate of 29.5 mmol gcat&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 34% at &#8208;0.5 V (vs. RHE).</dc:description>

A bioorthogonal photoclick&#8208;release method is exploited based on 405&#8197;nm light&#8208;induced cycloaddition between BiSyd and 2&#8208;ArNH2&#8208;NQ to give BIZON7 in situ as a photo&#8208;pharmacophore while uncaging naphthalimide&#8208;6&#8208;amine for fluorogenic imaging. This method is applied to &#955;&#8208;gated theranostics with tracking and photodynamic therapy on designated cells targeting mitochondria.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal click&#8208;release chemistry is a cutting&#8208;edge tool for exploring and manipulating biomolecule functions in native biological systems. However, it is challenging to achieve the precise regulation or therapy of individual cells via click&#8208;release strategies driven by proximity and thermodynamics. Herein, we propose a novel photoclick&#8208;release approach based on a photo&#8208;induced cycloaddition between 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(N&#8208;arylsydnone) or C&#8208;bithienyl&#8208;diarylsydnone and 2&#8208;arylamino&#8208;naphthoquinone via irradiation with 405 or 485&#8197;nm light. It constructs 1,3&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[f]indazole&#8208;4,9&#8208;dione (BIZON) as a pharmacophore while releases an arylamine for fluorescence turn&#8208;on probing. Both photoclick reagents were tailored by connecting to the triphenyl phosphonium delivery motif for enrichment in the mitochondria of live cells. This enables an intracellular photoclick and release under the control of 405 or 485&#8197;nm light. We then discovered that the in situ photo&#8208;generated BIZON is capable of photosensitizing upon 485 or 520&#8197;nm light to produce singlet oxygen inside the mitochondria under aerobic conditions. Therefore, we realized wash&#8208;free fluorescence tracking and subsequent anti&#8208;cancer efficacy at single&#8208;cell resolution using global illumination, which provides a foundation for wavelength&#8208;gated single&#8208;cell theranostics.

Guided by this stratedy, the giant birefringence achieved by ionic crystal, (C5H6ON)+(NO3)&#8722;, 4HPN, is achieved. This concept has convincingly demonstrated its applicability and relevance across a diverse array of systems, providing a guiding principle in design synthesis.







Abstract
Birefringent crystals, which possess optical anisotropy, are important optical components. However, designing and synthesizing birefringent crystals faces the challenge of achieving anisotropic structures, especially coplanar geometries. Herein, we achieve a significant birefringence in an ionic compound (C5H6ON)+(NO3)&#8722;, (4&#8208;hydroxypyridinium nitrate, 4HPN) by hydrogen bonding between planar donors and planar acceptors. We demonstrate that the interactions between the planar hydrogen bond donor ((C5H6ON)+) and planar hydrogen bond acceptor ((NO3)&#8722;) ensure the coplanarity during the crystal packing, generating the desired giant optical anisotropy. On two manually cut crystal chips, we observe a

 value already surpasses those of the benchmark crystals, e.g., YVO4 and CaCO3, commonly used in the UV to visible and near IR spectral range. 4HPN also exhibits a strong second harmonic generation response (9.55&#215;KDP). This strategy offers a promising avenue for the design and development of birefringent crystals with potential applications in optical communication, sensing and signal processing devices.

         <title>Reversible Redox Probes to Determine Band&#8208;Edge Locations and Dopant Concentrations of Nano&#8208;TiO2 Thin&#8208;Films: Settling the Mott&#8208;Schottky Conundrum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We extend concepts in semiconductor electrochemistry through current&#8208;potential measurements for reversible redox active species on a thin&#8208;film nano&#8208;semiconductor electrode. In the process, we demonstrate a novel but facile methodology to determine a nano&#8208;semiconductor electrode's flatband potential, and estimate its conduction band edge position and dopant concentration.







Abstract
Knowing the exact location of the semiconductor band&#8208;edges is key for mechanistic insights into their use for water and CO2 photo/electrocatalysis. In this regard, a reliable strategy for nano&#8208;semiconductors did not exist yet. We demonstrate the use of reversible redox probes on nano&#8208;semiconductor electrodes to determine their band&#8208;edge locations in aqueous solutions. Rectifying current&#8208;potential (i&#8208;U) characteristics with the high work function (i.e. more positive formal potential) Fe(CN)63&#8722;/Fe(CN)64&#8722; redox couple yielded the exact flatband potential at various pH whereas the reversible i&#8208;U characteristics with the low work function (i.e. more negative formal potential) Ru(NH3)63+/Ru(NH3)62+ redox couple provided the conduction band&#8208;edge location and dopant concentration for a 30&#8197;nm thin&#8208;film n&#8208;TiO2. The methodology can be extended to other nano&#8208;semiconductors and serves as an alternative to and goes beyond the capabilities of the Mott&#8208;Schottky procedure for bulk semiconductor electrodes.

         <dc:description>Flexible zeolite membranes are promising for scalable and adaptable separation of critical gases such as helium; however, the synthesis of such membranes remains a significant challenge. In this study, we report the successful fabrication of crack&#8208;free ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite membranes on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) supports using a seeded growth method. PTFE&#8208;supported membranes exhibit unprecedented helium permeance of over 6.7&#215;10&#8208;7 mol m&#8208;2 s&#8208;1 Pa&#8208;1 and high He/N2 and He/CH4 separation factors of 17 and 83 respectively, surpassing current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. These flexible membranes maintain excellent separation performance even after bending and stretching. Furthermore, large&#8208;scale membranes demonstrate stable helium separation from multicomponent gas mixtures, showcasing their significant potential for practical helium extraction from natural gas.</dc:description>

         <title>Rebuilding Peripheral F, Cl, Br Footprints on Acceptors Enables Binary Organic Photovoltaic Efficiency Exceeding 19.7&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By delicately rebuilding peripheral F, Cl, Br footprints, the central brominated acceptor of CH&#8722;B afforded the first&#8208;class efficiency of 19.78&#8201;% for binary organic solar cells, also achieved the best performance when further increasing active layer thickness to ~300&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Given homomorphic fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br) atoms are featured with gradually enlarged polarizability/atomic radius but decreased electronegativity, the rational screen of halogen species and locations on small molecular acceptors (SMAs) is quite essential for acquiring desirable molecular packing to boost efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, three isomeric SMAs (CH&#8722;F, CH&#8722;C and CH&#8722;B) are constructed by delicately rebuilding peripheral F, Cl, Br footprints on both central and end units. Such a re&#8208;permutation of peripheral halogens could not only maintain the structural symmetry of SMAs to the maximum, but also acquire extra asymmetric benefits of enhanced dipole moment and intramolecular charge transfer, etc. Moreover, central brominating enhances molecular crystallinity of CH&#8722;B without introducing undesirable steric hindrance on end groups, thus rendering a better balance between high crystallization and domain size control in PM6:CH&#8722;B blend. Further benefitting from the large dielectric constant, small exciton binding energy, optimized molecular packing and great electron transfer integral, CH&#8722;B affords the first class binary OSC efficiency of 19.78&#8201;%, moreover, the highest efficiency of 18.35&#8201;% thus far when increasing active layer thickness to ~300&#8197;nm. Our successful screening in rebuilding peripheral halogen footprints provides the valuable insight into further rational design of SMAs for record&#8208;breaking OSCs.

         <title>Confinement Effects and Manipulation Strategies of Nanocomposite Membranes towards Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocomposite membranes with nanoscale channels are vital for molecular separation. This review categorizes these membranes into polymer&#8208;dominated and filler&#8208;dominated types, focusing on confinement effects at the polymer&#8208;filler interface and regulation of membrane channels. We highlight structure&#8208;mass transfer mechanisms, and recent progress in separation applications. Finally, the current challenges and future directions were summarized.







Abstract
Materials featuring well&#8208;defined nanoscale channels offer inherent advantages in the selective transport of gases, liquids, and ions, making them pivotal in applications such as molecular separation, catalysis and energy storage. A crucial challenge lies in assembling ordered nanochannel structures and translating these microscopic architectures into macroscopic regular distributions to enhance performance. Nanocomposites provide a promising solution by incorporating nanoscale material (e.g., filler) that significantly enhances macroscale properties of matrix (e.g., polymer). In this review, we spotlight nanocomposite membranes nanocomposite membranes that utilize confinement effects between filler and matrix to precisely control nanochannel apertures, surface properties, and channel distribution for efficient separation of target systems. We discussed the underlying design principles, channel architectures, and strategies for optimizing polymer&#8208;filler interfaces and nanochannel manipulation within functional membranes. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental mechanisms of mass transport, and the structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationships within the nanocomposite membranes towards molecular separation. This work aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these nanocomposite membranes can be further developed to meet the demands of industrial and environmental applications.

         <title>Unlocking Self&#8208;antioxidant Capability and Processability of Additive&#8208;free MXene Ink towards High&#8208;performance Customizable Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ oxyanion terminations permit MXene ink to exhibit remarkable self&#8208;antioxidant capability and processability in an aqueous solution, without any additives. This strategy can extend the shelf life of MXene to five months and enable the fabrication of high&#8208;performance, customizable supercapacitors through solution processing, unlocking its potential applications in flexible electronics.







Abstract
The solution processing of MXene ink is the feasible strategy to realize its state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. Nevertheless, achieving high stability and processability of additive&#8208;free MXene ink is particularly challenging. Herein, we propose an oxyanion&#8208;terminated Ti3C2Tx MXene ink that exhibits excellent self&#8208;antioxidant capability and processability. The vertex&#8208;connected polyhedrons of oxyanions capping on the Ti3C2 host serve as an in situ antioxidative shield, effectively preventing the attack of free H2O molecules while increasing the robustness of the Ti&#8722;C bond and reducing the susceptibility of surface Ti atoms to oxidation. Consequently, the shelf life of MXene ink can be extended up to 5&#8197;months at room temperature. Moreover, the high electron accumulation of oxyanions enhances the interlayer interactions among MXene sheets through electrostatic binding, which enables the formation of stable and uniform MXene inks with controlled rheological properties and processability. Inspired by Chinese calligraphy, we utilize the oxyanion&#8208;terminated MXene ink to fabricate high&#8208;performance and customizable paper supercapacitors, which exhibit exceptional flexibility and stability, allowing them to be tailored to desired capacity, stretchability, and shapes. This in situ surface chemistry strategy of oxyanions can activate the self&#8208;antioxidant capability and solution processability of MXene, paving the way for its widespread applications in flexible and wearable electronics.

         <title>High&#8208;Potential and Stable Organic Cathode for Rechargeable Batteries with Fast&#8208;Charging and Wide&#8208;Temperature Adaptability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bipolar polymer featuring an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure was well designed by grafting high&#8208;potential p&#8208;type TPA onto high&#8208;capacity n&#8208;type AQ, which effectively addressed the dissolution issue of AQ and improved the average potential. Benefiting from the successful molecular design, the polymer exhibited high stability, excellent fast&#8208;charging capability within 17&#8197;s and superior wide&#8208;temperature adaptability from &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C to +80&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Organic carbonyl compounds have been recognized as promising electrodes due to multiple active sites, abundant element resources and flexible structural designability, while their practical applications are still hindered by the easy solubility and low discharge potential. Herein, a novel bipolar polymer composite (TAC) was well&#8208;designed by grafting p&#8208;type triphenylamine units onto n&#8208;type anthraquinone to form an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure and in situ growing on carbon nanotubes, which was proved not only with higher discharge potential but also effectively suppress the dissolution issues. Moreover, TAC combined the advantages of different active sites and behaved a dual&#8208;ion storage mechanism. Benefitting from the in situ polymerization process, TAC with tube&#8208;type core&#8211;shell structure exhibited enhanced electron transport and improved utilization of active sites, resulting in high capacity (193&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), outstanding rate performance (fast charging within 17&#8197;s), long&#8208;term stability (a high capacity retention of 87&#8201;% after 1000 cycles) and high mass loading (10&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Additionally, TAC can well adapt to the temperature change, outputting a capacity of 72&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C and 165&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Such versatile polymer structure inspires the design of high performance organic materials for rechargeable batteries to satisfy high stability and wide temperature operations.

         <title>Mild&#8208;Condition Photocatalytic Reforming of Methanol&#8208;Water by a Hierarchical, Asymmetry Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical asymmetry porous carbon nitride was synthesized by supramolecular subassembly strategy. Abundant defects and structure distortions of MetCNx expedite the separation of photogenerated charges. The suitable band structure and surface carboxyl promote the efficiency of photocatalytic reforming of methanol and water at mild conditions, to contribute to the green co&#8208;cycle of carbon and hydrogen.







Abstract
As a reproducible intermediate for hydrogen (H2) and carbon cycling, methanol mixed with water (H2O) in a ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 can multiply the outcome of green H2 generation via Photocatalytic reforming of methanol&#8208;H2O (PRMW). Hitherto, low&#8208;energy and mild&#8208;condition PRMW remains a serious challenge. Here, the amino acid&#8208;derived carbon nitrides (ACN) were synthesized supramolecular precursor strategy for PRMW and achieved excellent performance (H2, 35.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1; CO2, 11.5&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) under sunlight at 35&#8201;&#176;C. It was revealed that the surface&#8208;terminating carboxyl groups (&#8722;COOH) promote the dark dehydrogenation of methanol on MetCNx to form methoxy (*OCH3) and methylol (*CH2OH) simultaneously, with the hydroxyl (*OH) generated by photostimulated H2O oxidation promotes the C&#8722;H activation of formaldehyde, then leads the whole reaction into the formation of CO2 and three H2. The extended light absorption, enhanced charge separation and transport, and efficient surface reaction improve photocatalytic efficiency.

         <title>Functionalization of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Cyclopentadienyl Cobalt for C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the use of isoreticular chemistry to synthesize two novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs functionalized with cyclopentadienyl cobalt. UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 with shorter building blocks exhibits high C2H2 capacity and promising C2H2/CO2 separation performance. In addition, UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 can maintain separation stability in the presence of water vapor and methane impurities.







Abstract
Emerging covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received great attention for their unique features, but the limited building blocks restrict their structural diversity and performance exploration. Reticular chemistry provides guidance for the structural expansion and performance regulation of COFs. Herein, we constructed two novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs functionalized with cyclopentadienyl cobalt, denoted as UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;2, via [4+2] imine condensation with diamine building blocks of different length. Theoretical simulations combined with experimental results reveal that UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 with shorter building blocks, narrower pore sizes, and stronger host&#8211;guest interactions has better C2H2/CO2 separation performance. In addition, UPC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 can maintain separation stability in the presence of water vapor and methane impurities. This work provides a new evidence for the performance regulation of isoreticular COFs with modular and tunable building blocks.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework with Dense Lithiophilic Sites as Protective Layer to Enable High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D COF) with dense lithiophilic sites as an anodic protective layer based quasi&#8208;three dimensional 6&#8208;connected phosphazene and 4&#8208;connected porphyrin. Both phosphazene and porphyrin rings in the COF served as electron&#8208;rich and lithiophilic sites, enhanced a homogeneous Li+ flux via 3D direction towards highly smooth and compact Li deposition on the current collector.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries with remarkable energy densities are restrained by short lifetime and low Coulombic efficiency (CE), resulting from the accumulative Li dendrites and dead Li during cycling. Here, we prepared a new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic framework (COF) with dense lithiophilic sites (heteoatom weight contents of 32.32&#8197;wt&#8201;%) as an anodic protective layer of Li metal batteries. The 3D COF was synthesized using a [6+4] synthesis strategy by inducing flexible 6&#8208;connected cyclotriphosphazene derivative aldehyde and 4&#8208;connected porphyrin&#8208;based tetraphenylamines. Both phosphazene and porphyrin rings in the COF served as electron&#8208;rich and lithiophilic sites, enhancing a homogeneous Li+ flux via 3D direction towards highly smooth and compact Li deposition. The Li/Por&#8208;PN&#8208;COF&#8208;Cu cells achieved a record average CE of 99.1&#8201;% for 320&#8197;cycles with smooth Li deposition. Meanwhile, the abundant lithiophilic sites can promote fast Li+ transport with Li+ transference number of 0.87, enabling LiFePO4 full cell with stable stripping/plating processes even at a harsh rate of 5&#8197;C. Theoretical calculations revealed that the strong interaction force between Li+ and the COF facilitated the dissolution of Li+ from the electrolyte, and the low migration barrier of 1.08&#8197;eV indicated a favorable interaction between the Li+ ions and the &#960;&#8208;electron system.

         <title>Progressive Fabrication of a Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Catalyst toward Highly Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy catalyst (PtCuSnAuPd/SiO2) with greatly improved catalytic properties toward propane dehydrogenation (PDH) was progressively designed and fabricated. The well&#8208;balanced alloying effects and high configurational entropy (&#916;Smix) concertedly created abundant isolated Pt sites, conducive to striking activity, high selectivity, and superior stability.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as burgeoning heterogeneous catalysts due to their vast material space, unique structure, and superior stability. However, the dominant trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches hamper the exploration of efficient catalysts, necessitating the development of rational design strategies. Here, we report a progressive approach to the design and fabrication of HEA catalysts guided by alloying effects toward propane dehydrogenation. Cu, Sn, Au, and Pd are selected and demonstrated to induce dilution, encapsulation, surface enrichment, and inhomogeneity effects on Pt. The fabricated HEA, PtCuSnAuPd/SiO2, exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability. The propylene formation rates reach 256 and 390 molC3H6 gPt&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 550 and 600&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. Systematic characterizations reveal that the random elemental mixing, structural stability, and high Pt exposure promote the exposure of abundant stable isolated Pt sites. This work comprehensively explores the rational design and fabrication of HEA catalysts from a unique perspective, offering opportunities for developing advanced catalysts.

         <title>Targeting Lysosomal Thiols for Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described reversible thiol binder 11, which accumulates in lysosomes of cancer cells, increases the level of ROS leading to their disruption and immunogenic cancer cell death. In murine sarcoma Nemeth&#8208;Kellner model, 11 extends the lifespan of the mice from 21 to 85&#8197;days and cures 40&#8201;% of mice. 11 induces the direct antitumor effect supported by humoral immune responses, as well as priming neutrophil's reaction against tumors.







Abstract
The number and stability of lysosomes (LYs) are different in cancer and healthy cells that makes them a possible target for cancer specific therapy. However, no LY&#8208;targeting drug is clinically approved yet. We describe in this paper a new therapeutic approach based on alkylation of lysosomal thiols in cancer cells by reversible thiol binder 11. The treatment with 11 increases the level of lysosomal reactive oxygen species leading to their destabilization, disruption and immunogenic cancer cell death. These effects are not observed in healthy cells. In murine sarcoma Nemeth&#8208;Kellner (NK)/Ly&#8208;RB model, 11 exhibits the spectacular therapeutic effect: it extends the lifespan of the treated mice from 21 to 85&#8197;days and cures 40&#8201;% of mice. The survived mice develop antibodies against tumor NK/Ly&#8208;RB cells. Their repeated challenge with the NK/Ly&#8208;RB cells results in 100&#8201;% mice survival compared to 0&#8201;% survival in the control group of na&#239;ve mice. Ex vivo data indicate that neutrophils in spleen of the cured animals are also involved in targeting cancer cells and produce neutrophil extracellular traps. In summary, 11 induces the direct antitumor effect supported by humoral immune responses, as well as priming neutrophil's reaction against tumors.

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared to Blue Photon Upconversion by Ultrafast Spin Flip and Triplet Energy Transfer at Organic/2D Semiconductor Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D organic/inorganic bilayer heterostructure with atomically thin monolayer semiconductor and 9,10&#8208;bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl)anthracene exhibits efficient and low threshold NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue light upconversion, dirven by ultrafast spin flip, interfacial exciton transfer and triplet&#8208;triple annihilation. This work demonstrates 2D monolayers as superior sensitizers for photon upconversion and reveals the fundamental photoexcitation dynamics.







Abstract
Solid state photon upconversion by triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA), particularly near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion, holds instant promise for enhancing optoelectronic and photochemical applications. Despite extensive studies, NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion has remained particularly challenging and elusive due to inherent multiple energy&#8208;downhill processes in TTA upconversion. In this study, using atomically thin two dimensional (2D) monolayer semiconductor as a triplet sensitizer, we demonstrate an efficient and robust solid&#8208;state NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion system. The ultrathin and flexible organic/2D bilayer heterostructure exhibits a NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion with high quantum yield (&#934;UC=1.2&#8201;%, out of 50&#8201;%), low threshold power density (Ith=110&#8197;mW/cm2) and a record&#8208;high apparent anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 1.12&#8197;eV. Further spin&#8208; and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast (&lt;500&#8197;fs) electron spin flip to triplet&#8208;like excitons in semiconductor sensitizer and subsequent picosecond (~6&#215;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1) interfacial Dexter energy transfer to annihilator molecules. The triplet energy transfer rate and efficiency depend strongly on driving force, exhibiting Marcus normal region behavior. This work demonstrates 2D monolayer semiconductor as a superior ultrathin light harvesting and triplet sensitization layer and reveals the key knob to overcome the compromise between upconversion efficiency and energy loss, offering a viable pathway to efficient solid state NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion and implementation.

         <title>Distinctive Photomechanical Shape Change of p&#8208;Phenylenediacrylic Acid Dimethyl Ester Single Crystals Induced By Spatially Heterogeneous Photoreaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding photoreaction dynamics in crystals is important for predicting the dynamic property changes accompanying these photoreactions. In this work, we investigate the photoreaction dynamics of p&#8208;phenylenediacrylic acid dimethyl ester (p&#8208;PDAMe) in single crystals that show reaction front propagation, in which the photoreaction proceeds heterogeneously from the edge to the center of the crystal. Moreover, we find that p&#8208;PDAMe single crystals exhibit a distinctive crystal shape change from a parallelogram to a distorted shape resembling a fluttering flag, then to a rectangle as the photoreaction proceeds. Density functional theory calculations predict the crystal structure after the photoreaction, providing a reasonable explanation of the distinctive crystal shape change that results from the spatially heterogeneous photoreaction.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding photoreaction dynamics in crystals is important for predicting the dynamic property changes accompanying these photoreactions. In this work, we investigate the photoreaction dynamics of p-phenylenediacrylic acid dimethyl ester (p-PDAMe) in single crystals that show reaction front propagation, in which the photoreaction proceeds heterogeneously from the edge to the center of the crystal. Moreover, we find that p-PDAMe single crystals exhibit a distinctive crystal shape change from a parallelogram to a distorted shape resembling a fluttering flag, then to a rectangle as the photoreaction proceeds. Density functional theory calculations predict the crystal structure after the photoreaction, providing a reasonable explanation of the distinctive crystal shape change that results from the spatially heterogeneous photoreaction.

         <title>Vertically Expanded Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Water Oxidation into Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertically expanded covalent organic frameworks are constructed via one&#8208;pot reaction to merge two&#8208;dimensional covalent polygonal skeletons with spatially expanded layers separated by molecular pillars. The resultant frameworks expose all sites in layers to catalysis, improve exciton dissociation, increase oxidation potential, and facilitate water delivery, achieving exceptional activities in photocatalytic water oxidation into oxygen.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks with unique &#960; architectures and pores could be developed as photocatalysts for transformations. However, they usually form &#960;&#8208;stacking layers, so that only surface layers function in photocatalysis. Here we report a strategy for developing vertically expanded frameworks to expose originally inaccessible active sites hidden in layers to catalysis. We designed covalently linked two&#8208;dimensional cobalt(II) porphyrin layers and explored coordination bonds to connect the cobalt(II) porphyrin layers with bidentate ligands via a three&#8208;component one&#8208;pot polymerization. The resultant frameworks expand the interlayer space greatly, where both the up and down faces of each cobalt(II) porphyrin layer are exposed to reactants. Unexpectedly, the vertically expanded frameworks increase skeleton oxidation potentials, decrease exciton dissociation energy, improve pore hydrophilicity and affinity to water, and facilitate water delivery. Remarkably, these positive effects work collectively in the photocatalysis of water oxidation into oxygen, with an oxygen production rate of 1155&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, a quantum efficiency of 1.24&#8201;% at 450&#8197;nm, and a turnover frequency of 1.39&#8197;h&#8722;1, which is even 5.1&#8208;fold as high as that of the &#960;&#8208;stacked frameworks and ranks them the most effective photocatalysts. This strategy offers a new platform for designing layer frameworks to build various catalytic systems for chemical transformations.

         <title>Molecular Chain Rearrangement of Natural Cellulose&#8208;Based Artificial Interphase for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural cellulose&#8208;based artificial interphase constructed by molecular chain rearrangement strategy is proposed to achieve ultra&#8208;stable Zn metal anodes (e.g., an outstanding cycling lifespan of over 8000&#8197;hours at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.) This designed interphase, featuring a synergistically optimized structure and surface chemistry, demonstrate a huge potential of natural polymers materials for advanced energy storage applications.







Abstract
The unstable electrolyte&#8208;anode interface, plagued by parasitic side reactions and uncontrollable dendrite growth, severely hampers the practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. To address these challenges, we developed a regenerated cellulose&#8208;based artificial interphase with synergistically optimized structure and surface chemistry on the Zn anode (RC@Zn), using a facile molecular chain rearrangement strategy. This RC interphase features a drastically increased amorphous region and more exposed active hydroxyl groups, facilitating rapid Zn2+ diffusion and homogeneous Zn2+ interface distribution, thereby enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. Additionally, the compact texture and abundant negatively charged surface of the RC interphase effectively shield water molecules and harmful anions, completely preventing H2 evolution and Zn corrosion. The superior mechanical strength and adhesion of the RC interphase also accommodate the substantial volume changes of Zn anodes even under deep cycling conditions. Consequently, the RC@Zn electrode demonstrates an outstanding cycling lifespan of over 8000&#8197;hours at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Significantly, the electrode maintains stable cycling even at a 90&#8201;% depth of discharge and ensures stable operation of full cells with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.6. This study provides new solution to construct highly stable and deep cycling Zn metal anodes through interface engineering.

         <dc:description>An operationally convenient cobalt&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot one&#8208;step hydrosilylation/hydroboration reaction of arylidenecyclopropanes is developed to access racemic 1,4&#8208;borylsilylalkanes. In addition, the corresponding asymmetric reaction is developed with a chiral copper catalyst to prepare 1,4&#8208;borylsilylalkanes with high enantioselectivity by a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step procedure. Mechanistic studies reveal that this difunctionalization process begins with metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydrosilylation of arylidenecyclopropanes to generate homoallylsilane intermediates, followed by regio&#8208; or enantioselective metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of homoallylsilanes to produce skipped borylsilylalkanes.

         <title>Precise Photochemical Post&#8208;Processing of Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular crystals carry a great potential as new soft smart materials, with a plethora of recent examples overcoming the major obstacle of mechanical flexibility, and this research direction holds enormous potential to revolutionize optics, electronics, medicine, and space exploration. However, shaping organic crystals into desired shapes and sizes remains a major practical challenge due to the lack of control over the crystallization process, and the difficulties in mechanical post&#8208;processing without introduction of defects that are usually imparted by their soft nature. Here we present an innovative approach that employs photochemical processing for precise and nondestructive cutting of a molecular crystal. Our proposed method uses light to post&#8208;process crystals of the desired size and shape, similar to using light to cut other materials. This reaction induces strain, ensuring sharp cleavage without the need for melting or other processes. We further demonstrate the potential of this approach by producing crystals of arbitrary size, which can be used as controllable optical waveguides. Among other potential applications, this method can be used to prepare dynamic crystals, particularly those with aspect ratios crucial for mechanical deformation, such as flexible electronics, soft robotics, and sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Transfer Mediator Modulates Type II Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Photosensitizers for Type I Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a minimally invasive and effective local treatment, heavily depends on photosensitizer (PS) performance and oxygen availability. Despite the use of PS&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to address the solubility and aggregation issues of PSs, the inherent hypoxic intolerance of mainstream Type II PDT remains challenging. Herein, we report an electron transfer strategy for the fabrication of hypoxia&#8208;tolerant Type I MOFs by encapsulating thymoquinone (TQ) into existing Type II MOFs. With TQ serving as an effective electron transfer mediator, it facilitates the electron transfer process from the MOF ligand PS to oxygen, establishing the Type I pathway and attenuating the original Type II pathway. Four representative porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs are synthesized to demonstrate the proposed strategy. Our findings reveal that TQ@MOF&#8208;1 nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit enhanced anticancer activity under hypoxic conditions and superior in vivo antitumor efficacy compared to parent MOF&#8208;1 NPs. This work offers an effective and universal strategy to modulate ROS generation in PS&#8208;based MOFs, endowing hypoxic tolerance with improved PDT performance against solid tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodide anion enables a reductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling for preparing tertiary amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reducing power of iodide anion is an underexplored property that can be used for the cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of organic molecules. Herein we harness this trait for the preparation of tertiary amines through the combination of two simple reagents: an electrophilic&#8208;carbon precursor and an iminium iodide in a dual role&#8212;both as nitrogen&#8208;containing building block and as reducing agent. The underlying mechanism of this new C&#8211;C bond&#8208;formation paradigm is explored through a combination of experiment and quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Induced Spin State Transition Switches the Reactivity of Nickel (II) Porphyrin in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron spin plays a critical role in chemical processes, particularly in reactions involving metal complexes with unpaired electrons. However, more definitive state&#8208;to&#8208;state experiments are needed to better elucidate the role of electronic spin. Herein, we chose nickel (II) 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) porphyrin 1 as a catalyst, which allows switching from a low spin to a high spin state of Ni(II) center through an axial pyridine coordination, for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). When pyridine is present, we observed &#946;&#8208;hydrogenation of porphyrin through electron transfer followed by proton transfer. In contrast, hydrogen evolution mainly occurs via the concerted proton&#8208;coupling electron transfer without pyridine coordination. Similar distinct spin&#8208;dependent selectivity was also observed in chemical reduction of 1 by CoCp2 with subsequent addition of pyridinium p&#8208;toluenesulfonate. Computational calculations using density functional theory demonstrated that the transition from low spin to high spin state enriches the ligand&#8217;s electron density after one&#8208;electron reduction, leading to preferential protonation of &#946;&#8208;periphery rather than meso&#8208;position or metal center.</dc:description>

         <title>Inverse Vulcanization of Aziridines: Enhancing Polysulfides for Superior Mechanical Strength and Adhesive Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study introduces a novel approach to inverse vulcanization by utilizing a commercially available triaziridine crosslinker as an alternative to conventional olefin&#8208;based crosslinkers. The model reactions reveal a self&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening of "unactivated" aziridine with elemental sulfur, forming oligosulfide&#8208;functionalized diamines. The triaziridine&#8208;derived polysulfides exhibit impressive mechanical properties, achieving a maximum stress of ~8.3 MPa and an elongation at break of ~107%. The incorporation of silicon dioxide (20 wt%) enhances the composite&#8217;s rigidity, yielding a Young's modulus of ~0.94 GPa. Furthermore, these polysulfides display excellent adhesion strength on various substrates, such as aluminum (~7.0 MPa), walnut (~9.6 MPa), and steel (~11.0 MPa), with substantial retention of adhesion strength (~3.3 MPa on steel) at &#8722;196 &#176;C. The straightforward synthetic process, combined with the accessibility of the triaziridine crosslinker, emphasizes the potential for further innovations in sulfur polymer chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Methanolation of Olefins: Low&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Alcohols by the Formal Addition of Methanol to Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methanolation of olefins is introduced as a new low&#8208;pressure synthetic pathway to C1 elongated alcohols. Formally, H3COH is added to the C=C bond in a 100% atom efficient manner. Mechanistically, the overall transformation occurs as a tandem reaction sequence by combining the dehydrogenation of methanol to syngas at a CO:H2 ratio of 1:2 with subsequent hydroformylation to the corresponding aldehyde and its final hydrogenation to the alcohol. The dehydrogenation and hydrogenation steps are catalysed by a Mn/pincer complex, while the hydroformylation is accomplished by a Rh/phosphine catalyst. Using 1&#8208;octene as prototypical substrate, a yield of 80% nonanol was achieved with a ratio of 93:7 of linear to branched alcohols and turnover numbers (TONRh) of more than 17 000 could be obtained in relation to the precious metal Rhodium. The integrated catalytic system provides direct access to alcohols from olefins and &#8220;green&#8221; methanol, avoiding the handling of pressurized CO and H2 and the use of specialized high&#8208;pressure equipment as the process conditions do not exceed 10 bar with partial pressures of syngas in the range of only 1&#8208;2 bar.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanomaterials&#8208;Induced PANoptosis: A Promising Anti&#8208;Tumor Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Malignant tumors pose a significant threat to global public health. Promoting programmed cell death in cancer cells has become a critical strategy for cancer treatment. PANoptosis, a newly discovered form of regulated cell death, integrates key molecular components of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, activating these three death pathways simultaneously to achieve synergistic multi&#8208;mechanistic killing. PANoptosis significantly inhibits cancer cell growth and resistance, making tumor&#8208;specific induction of PANoptosis a potential cancer therapeutic strategy. Currently, cancer treatment research related to PANoptosis is mainly focused on the development of small molecules and cytokines. However, these approaches still face limitations in terms of metabolic stability and tumor specificity. The development of nanotechnology offers new opportunities for cancer treatment by improving targeting efficiency, extending circulation time, and enhancing therapeutic efficacy and safety. Additionally, the unique physicochemical properties of nanomaterials can effectively optimize PANoptosis induction strategies, establishing nanomaterials as ideal candidates for inducing PANoptosis in tumor cells. This review summarizes the concept and mechanisms of PANoptosis, highlights the latest applications of nanoagents in PANoptosis&#8208;based anti&#8208;cancer therapy, and discusses the challenges and future directions for clinical translation. This&#160;review will inspire further exploration and development of PANoptosis&#8208;based cancer treatments, providing new perspectives for researchers in the field</dc:description>

         <title>Zwitterionic 2&#8208;Phosphaethene&#8208;thiolates [(LC)P=CS(LC/P)]+ as PCS Building Blocks (LC = NHC, LP = PR3)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The zwitterionic compounds [(LC)P=CS(LC/P)]+ (3+, LC = NHC, LP = PR3), featuring cationic substituents at the phosphorus and carbon atoms, are synthesized as their triflate salts at a multi&#8208;gram scale from the reaction of Lewis base adducts of CS2, namely LC/P&#8211;CS2 (4), with a combination of [(LCP)4][OTf]4 (1[OTf]4) and Ph3P. The feasibility of using 3+ as PCS building blocks is showcased in their reactions with representative electrophiles (MeOTf) and nucleophiles (MesMgBr, Ph3PCH2), leading to selective functionalization of the PCS core at the S&#8208; and P&#8208;terminus, respectively. Additionally, it is reported that 3+ can function as ambident nucleophiles with AgOTf (2 equivalents), affording unprecedented linear coordination polymer [Ag2(OTf)3&#8208;&#956;2:&#954;P,&#954;S&#8211;((LC)P=CS(PCy3))]+ (6b), where the PCS moiety acts as a bridging ligand in transition metal complexes for the first time. Reduction of 3+ facilitates the cleavage of the P&#8208; and C&#8208;bound substituents leading to the formation of the [PCS]&#8211; anion. Moreover, cycloaddition reactions of 3+ with 1[OTf]4 are shown to selectively yield five&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered polyphosphorus heterocycles. Preliminary results suggest the possibility of activating the C&#8211;S bond in [(LC)P=CS(LC)]+, resulting in the formation of [(LC)P=C(LC)&#8211;P(LC)][OTf]2, 12[OTf]2, which may serve as a synthon for the PCP unit in future studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Unconventional Near&#8208;equilibrium&#160;Nucleation of Graphene on Si&#8208;terminated SiC(0001) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transfer&#8208;free character of graphene growth on Silicon Carbide (SiC) makes it compatible with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Si semi&#8208;conductor technologies for directly fabricating high&#8208;end electronics. Although significant progress has been achieved in epitaxial growth of graphene on SiC recently, the underlying nucleation mechanism remains elusive. Here, we present a theoretical study to elucidate graphene near&#8208;equilibrium nucleation on Si&#8208;terminated hexagonal&#8208;SiC(0001) surface. It is found that the ultra&#8208;large lattice mismatch between SiC(0001) surface and graphene and the highly localized electron distribution on SiC(0001) surface lead to a distinctive nucleation process: (i) Most of the magic carbon clusters on SiC(0001) show only C1 symmetry and are mainly composed of pentagonal rings; (ii) Two possible nucleation pathways are revealed, i.e, longitudinal and circular modes; (iii) Carbon clusters are more stable on flat terraces than near atomic step edges. Based on above findings, a graphene nucleation diagram on SiC(0001) is established and experimentally observed contradictories for graphene growth on SiC(0001) are answered.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The transfer-free character of graphene growth on Silicon Carbide (SiC) makes it compatible with state-of-the-art Si semi-conductor technologies for directly fabricating high-end electronics. Although significant progress has been achieved in epitaxial growth of graphene on SiC recently, the underlying nucleation mechanism remains elusive. Here, we present a theoretical study to elucidate graphene near-equilibrium nucleation on Si-terminated hexagonal-SiC(0001) surface. It is found that the ultra-large lattice mismatch between SiC(0001) surface and graphene and the highly localized electron distribution on SiC(0001) surface lead to a distinctive nucleation process: (i) Most of the magic carbon clusters on SiC(0001) show only C1 symmetry and are mainly composed of pentagonal rings; (ii) Two possible nucleation pathways are revealed, i.e, longitudinal and circular modes; (iii) Carbon clusters are more stable on flat terraces than near atomic step edges. Based on above findings, a graphene nucleation diagram on SiC(0001) is established and experimentally observed contradictories for graphene growth on SiC(0001) are answered. Our in-depth understanding on graphene nucleation on SiC(0001) extends nucleation mechanisms of 2D crystals and will benefit high-quality graphene growth on SiC(0001).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced photocatalytic synthesis of urea from co&#8208;reduction of N2 and CO2 on Z&#8208;schematic SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4 heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and N2 is a sustainable method for urea synthesis under mild conditions. However, high&#8208;yield synthesis of urea is a challenge due to the sluggish kinetics of the C&#8208;N coupling reaction. Herein, we have successfully engineered a Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst, SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4, for boosting photocatalytic urea synthesis via enhancing the initial CO2 and N2 adsorption step and reducing the energy barrier for the C&#8208;N coupling reaction. A high urea yield of 8054.2 &#956;g&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8208;1 was achieved on SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4, which was significantly higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4 Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst, with accelerated charge transfer by FeS, not only had dual active sites for the chemical adsorption and activation of CO2 and N2, but also retained the high conduction band (&#8208;1.50 eV) and accelerated supply of electrons and protons, which are responsible for its good photoreduction activity and significantly reduced energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of C&#8208;N coupling reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement Microenvironment Regulation of Carbon Dots in Zeolite for Multi&#8208;Mode Time&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Color Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Matrix immobilization has been proven to be a favored method for enhancing the phosphorescence of carbon dots (CDs), however, it remains a significant challenge to realize time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence colors (TDPC) by embedding CDs with single emission center. In this study, we present a novel matrix&#8208;controlling strategy to regulate the microenvironment of CDs by doping limited Mn2+ in zeolite. The surrounding environment influences the surface state of the CDs, leading to the formation of different excitons. At low temperatures, Mn&#8208;coordinated CDs (C&#8208;CDs) show fast&#8208;decaying green phosphorescence, while non&#8208;coordinated CDs (NC&#8208;CDs) exhibit inherent slow&#8208;decaying blue phosphorescence. Notably, the energy transfer occurs between NC&#8208;CDs and Mn2+ to produce an ultrafast&#8208;decaying red phosphorescence, with the intensity of the red component increasing as the temperature rises. The interplay of these luminescent centers with distinct decay rates activates fascinating multi&#8208;mode TDPC behavior as the temperature changes, resulting in dynamic afterglow evolutions from red to green at 298 K, orange to green at 273 K, and green to cyan to blue at 77 K. Leveraging the diverse luminescence of CDs@MnAPO&#8208;5, a multi&#8208;dimensional dynamic afterglow color pattern was developed for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Fabrication of P and M Helices in One&#8208;component Chiral System by Methanol&#8208;Water Mediated Dual Assembly Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synergetic evolution of multiple chiral structures stemmed from same building units is ubiquitous in nature and vital to living systems, but achieving it in artificial systems remains a challenge. Herein, we report a methanol&#8208;water mediated dual assembly pathway strategy for simultaneous construction of P and M helices in one&#8208;component chiral system. The conformation of l&#8208;phenylaniline derivates (LBpyF) is controlled to folded state in CH3OH due to the hydrogen bonds as well as C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction between LBpyF and CH3OH. Addition of H2O into above CH3OH solution of LBpyF results in the simultaneous occurrence of two self&#8208;assembly pathways and double networks of P and M helices were therefore formed, due to the synchronous process of 1) self&#8208;assembly of folded LBpyF into M&#8208;helices and 2) H2O induced unfolding of folded LBpyF molecules followed by self&#8208;assembly of them into P&#8208;helices. The bipyridine core, phenyl ring, amide unit all adapted into different stacking modes in M&#8208;helices and P&#8208;helices, and energy analysis indicated that the minority M&#8208;helices were more thermodynamically favored products. This study provides an approach to explore synergetic evolution of multiple chiral structures by manipulating the multiple assembly pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Nanobodies Bind Bismuth, Indium and Gallium for Applications in Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Attaching metals to antibodies involves using bifunctional linkers that contain both a reactive and chelating group. This study eliminates the need for such linkers by incorporating the metal directly within a single&#8208;domain antibody. This is demonstrated for gallium, indium, and bismuth, addressing both diagnostic and therapeutic applications in positron emission tomography, single&#8208;photon emission computed tomography, and targeted alpha therapy.







Abstract
Targeted theranostics heavily rely on metal isotopes conjugated to antibodies. Single&#8208;domain antibodies, known as nanobodies, are much smaller in size without compromising specificity and affinity. The conventional way of conjugating metals to nanobodies involves non&#8208;specific modification of amino acid residues with bifunctional chelating agents. We demonstrate that mutagenesis of a single residue in a nanobody creates a triple cysteine motif that selectively binds bismuth which is, for example, used in targeted alpha therapy. Two mutations create a quadruple cysteine mutant specific for gallium and indium used in positron emission tomography and single&#8208;photon emission computed tomography, respectively. Labelling is quantitative within a few minutes. The metal nanobodies maintain structural integrity and stability over weeks, resist competition from endogenous metal binders like glutathione, and retain functionality.

Puzzling of ligands at C(0): In their Research Article (e202415228), Max M. Hansmann et&#8197;al. demonstrate a new strategy to afford stable diazoalkenes by cleavage of a carbophosphinocarbene and carbodicarbenes with N2O. The follow&#8208;up N2/NHC exchange allows easy access to novel carbodicarbenes or cumulenic compounds. The combination of exchange reactions overall allows to &#8220;puzzle&#8221; the fragments at a C(0) atom.

Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) have attracted great interest for their potential as sustainable, environmentally friendly, low&#8208;cost sources of renewable energy. Alkaline polyelectrolytes play a crucial role in AEMWEs, determining their performance and longevity. Because heteroatom&#8208;containing polymers have been shown to have poor durability in alkaline conditions, this review focuses on ether&#8208;free alkaline polyelectrolytes, which are more chemically stable. The merits, weaknesses, and challenges in preparing ether&#8208;free AEMs are summarized and highlighted. The evaluation of synthesis methods for polymers, modification strategies, and cationic stability will provide insights valuable for the structural design of future alkaline polyelectrolytes. Moreover, the in situ degradation mechanisms of AEMs and ionomers during AEMWE operation are revealed. This review provides insights into the design of alkaline polyelectrolytes for AEMWEs to accelerate their widespread commercialization.

         <title>Modulating Interfacial Solvation via Ion Dipole Interactions for Low&#8208;Temperature and High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;concentrated and fluorine&#8208;free ether&#8208;based electrolyte is developed to sustain lithium batteries working at high voltage and low temperature. Based on ion dipole interaction and competitive adsorption in electric double layer, the enhanced stability of electrolyte correlates with the evolution of solvation environment from bulk electrolyte to interface and the formation of antioxidant cathode electrolyte interface (CEI).







Abstract
Extending the stability of ether solvents is pivotal for developing low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage lithium batteries. Herein, we elucidate the oxidation behavior of tetrahydrofuran with ternary BF4&#8722;, PF6&#8722; and difluoro (oxalato) borate anions and the evolution of interfacial solvation environment. Combined in situ analyses and computations illustrate that the ion dipole interactions and the subsequent formation of ether&#8208;Li+&#8208;anion complexes in electrolyte rearrange the oxidation order of solvated species, which enhances the electrochemical stability of ether solvent. Furthermore, preferential absorption of anions on the surface of high&#8208;voltage cathode favors the formation of a solvent&#8208;deficient electric double layer and an anti&#8208;oxidation cathode electrolyte interphase, inhibiting the decomposition of tetrahydrofuran. Remarkably, the formulated electrolyte based on ternary anion and tetrahydrofuran solvent endows the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode with considerable rate capability of 5.0&#8197;C and high capacity retention of 93.12&#8201;% after 200&#8197;cycles. At a charging voltage of 4.5&#8197;V, the Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells deliver Coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% at both 25 and &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C.

Mechanochemistry can be used in the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as reported by Xavier Ottenwaelder, Tomislav Fri&#353;&#269;i&#263;, Dmytro F. Perepichka et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202404539). Based on this concept the first mechanochemical synthesis of boroxine&#8208;based 2D and 3D COFs with high surface area of up to 2,500 m2 g&#8722;1 was developed.

         <title>Tetrahedral DNA Framework&#8208;Based Spherical Nucleic Acids for Efficient siRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA framework&#8208;based spherical nucleic acid (tDF&#8208;SNA) with a dynamic, spiky interface is developed to improve siRNA delivery efficiency. This system largely enhances siRNA duplex efficiency, promotes cellular uptake, and facilitates cytoplasmic access. Consequently, tDF&#8208;SNA effectively delivers siRNA into the cytoplasm, leading to increased gene silencing efficacy.







Abstract
Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) hold substantial therapeutic potential for the delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Nevertheless, their potential remains largely untapped due to the challenges of cytosolic delivery. Inspired by the dynamic, spiky architecture of coronavirus, an interface engineering approach based on a tetrahedral DNA framework (tDF) is demonstrated for the development of coronavirus&#8208;mimicking SNAs. By exploiting their robustness and precise construction, tDFs are evenly arranged on the surface of core nanoparticles (NPs) with flexible conformations, generating a dynamic, spiky architecture. This spiky architecture in tetrahedral DNA framework&#8208;based SNAs (tDF&#8208;SNAs) substantially improve siRNAs duplex efficiency from 20&#8201;% to 95&#8201;%. Meanwhile, tDF&#8208;SNAs changed the endocytosis pathway to clathrin&#8208;independent cellular engulfment pathway and enhanced the cellular uptake efficiency. Due to these advances, the delivery efficiency of siRNA molecules by tDF&#8208;SNAs is 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than that of SNAs, resulting in a 2&#8208;fold increase in gene silencing efficacy. These results show promise in the development of bioinspired siRNAs delivery systems for intracellular applications.

         <title>The Paradoxical Influence of Hydrothermally Treated Zeolites on the Hydrocarbon Pool Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work examines how steaming affects the material&#8216;s properties and influences the organic reaction mechanism in the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol conversion process.







Abstract
Understanding the mechanistic intricacies of hydrothermally treated zeolite is crucial for valorizing any oxygen&#8208;containing renewable feedstocks (e.&#8201;g., methanol, carbon dioxide, biomass). Additionally, the regeneration of deactivated zeolite catalysts under oxidative conditions, akin to hydrothermal treatment, is essential in industrial processes. While research in this area has predominantly focused on characterizing steaming&#8208;induced physicochemical changes in zeolite, their ultimate impact on the organic reaction mechanism governed by the hydrocarbon pool dual&#8208;cycle mechanism remains unclear. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates the effect of steamed zeolite on the organic reaction mechanism during the industrially significant methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons process. We achieved this objective by strategically integrating catalytic and control experiments over the pristine and steamed zeolites and their advanced characterization, including under operando conditions, XRD structural refinement, and using &#8220;mobility&#8208;dependent&#8221; solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. This multimodal characterization approach was instrumental in elucidating elusive mechanistic information in the dual&#8208;cycle mechanism, shedding light on phenomena such as the unchanged ethylene selectivity despite decreasing aromatics selectivity, while ethylene could solely be derived from arene&#8208;based reaction intermediates. This study could improve the process efficiency in zeolite catalysis by connecting steaming&#8208;induced changes in the organic reaction mechanisms with inorganic material aspects.

         <title>Photoregulated Supramolecular Polymerization through Halogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we exploit halogen bonding (XB) interactions as a reversible network element to control the communication between stimuli&#8208;responses and self&#8208;assembly. This approach broadens the still limited scope of XB in solution assemblies and paves the way for multifunctional adaptive supramolecular systems.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers are able to change their structure, morphology and function in response to external stimuli. However, controlling the independence of stimuli&#8208;responses in these systems is challenging. Herein, we exploit halogen bonding (XB) as a reversible network element to regulate the photoresponsive and adaptive behavior of supramolecular polymers. To this end, we have designed a two&#8208;component system comprising an amphiphilic XB acceptor with the ability to self&#8208;assemble in aqueous media (OPE&#8208;Py) and a molecule with a dual photoresponsive and XB donor function [(E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I]. OPE&#8208;Py self&#8208;assembles in aqueous media into supramolecular polymers, which transform into nanoparticle assemblies upon co&#8208;assembly with (E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I. Interestingly, a third type of assembly (2D sheets) is obtained if OPE&#8208;Py is treated with (E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I and exposed to photoirradiation. At ambient conditions, both nanoparticles and 2D sheets remain invariant over time. However, heating dissociates the XB interactions present in both assemblies, resulting in their transformation to the original fiber&#8208;like morphology of OPE&#8208;Py. Thus, breaking the communication between self&#8208;assembly and the stimuli&#8208;responses upon heating restores the original state of the system, drawing parallels to feedback loops in programming language. This work broadens the still limited scope of XB in solution assemblies and paves the way for multifunctional adaptive supramolecular systems.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we exploit halogen bonding (XB) interactions as a reversible network element to control the communication between stimuli-responses and self-assembly. This approach broadens the still limited scope of XB in solution assemblies and paves the way for multifunctional adaptive supramolecular systems.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular polymers are able to change their structure, morphology and function in response to external stimuli. However, controlling the independence of stimuli-responses in these systems is challenging. Herein, we exploit halogen bonding (XB) as a reversible network element to regulate the photoresponsive and adaptive behavior of supramolecular polymers. To this end, we have designed a two-component system comprising an amphiphilic XB acceptor with the ability to self-assemble in aqueous media (&lt;b&gt;OPE-Py&lt;/b&gt;) and a molecule with a dual photoresponsive and XB donor function [&lt;b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-Azo-I&lt;/b&gt;]. &lt;b&gt;OPE-Py&lt;/b&gt; self-assembles in aqueous media into supramolecular polymers, which transform into nanoparticle assemblies upon co-assembly with &lt;b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-Azo-I&lt;/b&gt;. Interestingly, a third type of assembly (2D sheets) is obtained if &lt;b&gt;OPE-Py&lt;/b&gt; is treated with &lt;b&gt;(&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-Azo-I&lt;/b&gt; and exposed to photoirradiation. At ambient conditions, both nanoparticles and 2D sheets remain invariant over time. However, heating dissociates the XB interactions present in both assemblies, resulting in their transformation to the original fiber-like morphology of &lt;b&gt;OPE-Py&lt;/b&gt;. Thus, breaking the communication between self-assembly and the stimuli-responses upon heating restores the original state of the system, drawing parallels to feedback loops in programming language. This work broadens the still limited scope of XB in solution assemblies and paves the way for multifunctional adaptive supramolecular systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unprecedented Photoinduced&#8208;Electron&#8208;Transfer Probe with a Turn&#8208;ON Chemiluminescence Mode&#8208;of&#8208;Action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first PeT&#8208;based turn&#8208;on probe utilizing a chemiluminescent mechanism is presented. The probe is activated through a reaction between a quenched dioxetane&#8208;azide and a strained cycloalkyne, resulting in high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise protein detection and outperforming a fluorescent analog.







Abstract
PeT&#8208;based fluorescent probes were demonstrated to be powerful tools for detection and imaging, owing to their significant fluorescence enhancement in response to specific targets. While numerous examples of fluorescence&#8208;based PeT have been frequently reported, there is not even a single example of a PeT probe that operates via a chemiluminescence mode. Here we report the first PeT&#8208;based turn&#8208;on probe that acts via a chemiluminescent operation mode. We designed, synthesized, and evaluated a novel chemiluminescent probe, featuring a PeT&#8208;based turn&#8208;on mechanism. The probe consists of a phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane, linked to an azide unit that acts as a PeT quencher. Upon cycloaddition of a strained cycloalkyne with the azide, a triazole&#8208;dioxetane is formed, which undergoes relatively slow chemiexcitation, resulting in a measurement window with an exceptionally high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (over 5000&#8208;fold). The PeT&#8208;dioxetane probe could effectively detect and image two model proteins labeled with strained cycloalkyne units (Myc&#8208;DBCO and Max&#8208;DBCO) through either NHS or maleimide conjugations. Comparative analysis shows that our PeT&#8208;based chemiluminescent probe significantly outperforms a commercially available fluorescent analog. We anticipate that the insights gained from this study will facilitate the development of additional chemiluminescent probes utilizing various PeT&#8208;quenching pathways.

         <title>Comediating Adsorption and Electron Transfer via Dual&#8208;Active Site Catalyst Construction for Improving the Treatment of Extraction Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon (FNC) catalyst with dual&#8208;active sites was developed to comediate adsorption and electron transfer. Specially, F site with electron acquisition can transfer electrons provided by di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) enriched at N sites to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), facilitating the continuous generation of hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH).







Abstract
Solvent extraction is widely applied, while extraction wastewater treatment remains a huge challenge because of the stability of extractants. Heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalysis is a promising method, but the short half&#8208;life of hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) generated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activation results in unsatisfactory &#8901;OH utilization and organics removal. Herein, an efficient strategy for treating extraction wastewater based on comediating adsorption and electron transfer by fluorine and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon (FNC) catalyst with dual&#8208;active site was developed. Specially, N sites adsorb organics and F sites activate H2O2, shortening the migration distance of &#8901;OH. Theoretical calculation and di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) extraction wastewater degradation experiment showed that F site with electron acquisition can transfer electrons provided by electron&#8208;rich D2EHPA enriched at N sites to H2O2, facilitating the continuous generation of &#8901;OH through lowering the energy barrier for H2O2 activation. As a result, 96.49&#8201;% D2EHPA in simulated wastewater and 90.26&#8201;% total organic carbon in real extraction wastewater were removed. Moreover, FNC catalyst exhibited excellent reusability and ionic adaptability, and can be extended to the removal of various extractants. The proposed dual&#8208;active site catalyst provides an effective strategy for Fenton&#8208;like reaction to treat refractory extraction wastewater, promoting sustainable development of solvent extraction industry.

         <title>Tuning Proton Affinity on Co&#8722;N&#8722;C Atomic Interface to Disentangle Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;off in Acidic Oxygen Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing proton affinity over Co&#8722;N&#8722;C atomic interface via B doping is shown to direct proton attack to the former oxygen in *OOH, facilitating H2O2 formation without sacrificing activity. The obtained Co1&#8208;NBC catalyst exhibits remarkable 2e&#8722; ORR activity and selectivity at the same time, achieving ultrahigh H2O2 production ability.







Abstract
In oxygen reduction reaction to H2O2 via two&#8208;electron pathway (2e&#8722; ORR), adsorption strength of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates determines both catalytic activity and selectivity. However, it also causes activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. Herein, we propose a novel strategy through modulating the interaction between protons and *OOH intermediates to break the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off for highly active and selective 2e&#8722; ORR. Taking the typical cobalt&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon single&#8208;atom catalyst as an example, boron heteroatoms doped into second coordination sphere of CoN4 (Co1&#8208;NBC) increase proton affinity on catalyst surface, facilitating proton attack on the former oxygen of *OOH and thereby promoting H2O2 formation. As a result, Co1&#8208;NBC simultaneously achieves prominent 2e&#8722; ORR activity and selectivity in acid with onset potential of 0.724&#8197;V vs. RHE and H2O2 selectivity of 94&#8201;%, surpassing most reported catalysts. Furthermore, Co1&#8208;NBC exhibits a remarkable H2O2 productivity of 202.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a remarkable stability of 60&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell. This work provides new insights into resolving activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off in electrocatalysis.

     alt="Tuning Proton Affinity on Co&#8722;N&#8722;C Atomic Interface to Disentangle Activity-Selectivity Trade-off in Acidic Oxygen Reduction to H2O2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing proton affinity over Co&#8722;N&#8722;C atomic interface via B doping is shown to direct proton attack to the former oxygen in *OOH, facilitating H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation without sacrificing activity. The obtained Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-NBC catalyst exhibits remarkable 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR activity and selectivity at the same time, achieving ultrahigh H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production ability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In oxygen reduction reaction to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via two-electron pathway (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR), adsorption strength of oxygen-containing intermediates determines both catalytic activity and selectivity. However, it also causes activity-selectivity trade-off. Herein, we propose a novel strategy through modulating the interaction between protons and *OOH intermediates to break the activity-selectivity trade-off for highly active and selective 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR. Taking the typical cobalt&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon single-atom catalyst as an example, boron heteroatoms doped into second coordination sphere of CoN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-NBC) increase proton affinity on catalyst surface, facilitating proton attack on the former oxygen of *OOH and thereby promoting H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation. As a result, Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-NBC simultaneously achieves prominent 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR activity and selectivity in acid with onset potential of 0.724&#8197;V &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. RHE and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 94&#8201;%, surpassing most reported catalysts. Furthermore, Co&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-NBC exhibits a remarkable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; productivity of 202.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a remarkable stability of 60&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in flow cell.

         <title>Bowl&#8208;Shaped Anthracene&#8208;Fused Antiaromatic Ni(II) Norcorrole: Synthesis, Structure, Assembly with C60, and Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triple fusion of a Ni(II) norcorrole unit with anthracene units deforms the antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;conjugated core into a bowl&#8208;shaped conformation, which enables effective fullerene binding in the solution and solid states via convex&#8211;concave interactions. The extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation by the anthracene moieties enhances the absorption bands into the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) region. The NIR&#8208;absorbing properties of the fused anthrylnorcorroles together with their antiaromatic character induce effective photothermal&#8208;conversion properties.







Abstract
The synthesis of bowl&#8208;shaped antiaromatic molecules is challenging because the molecular distortion further destabilizes these already inherently reactive molecules. Here, we report the synthesis and properties of bowl&#8208;shaped fused anthrylnorcorroles that exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption reaching 1900&#8197;nm. The oxidation of meso&#8208;anthryldibromodipyrrin provides fused anthryldibromodipyrrin, which was converted to the fused mono&#8208; and bisanthrylnorcorroles through Ni(0)&#8208;mediated intramolecular coupling with a bis(dibromodipyrrin) Ni(II) complex. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed bowl&#8208;shaped structures for the fused mono&#8208; and bisanthrylnorcorroles, which enables them to act as suitable receptors for C60 with bonding constants of 2.89&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 1.59&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively. The formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex between the fused monoanthrylnorcorrole and C60 was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The effective expansion of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation through the triple fusion of the norcorrole with the anthracene units substantially enhances the near&#8208;infrared absorption bands, which endows these anthrylnorcorroles with effective photothermal conversion.

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Silver Clusters from Ag57 to Ag72 via Laminating Multiple Different Anion Templates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike previous approaches that employed single or double hetero&#8208;anion templates, the current research introduces a groundbreaking strategy using multiple distinct types of anion templates with varying sizes, geometries, and charge states. By deliberately introducing a third SO42&#8722; anion template to a hetero&#8208;anion (Cl&#8722; and lacunary [SiW9O34]10&#8722;) templated system, a pioneering example of longitudinal epitaxial growth from Ag57 to Ag72 has been realized. These findings underscore the significance of multiple anion&#8208;template strategy in advancing high&#8208;nuclearity silver clusters.







Abstract
The established capability of anion templates in precisely manipulating the size, geometry, and function of metal clusters is well acknowledged. However, the development of a systematic methodology for orchestrating the assembly of silver clusters, particularly those encompassing multiple distinct types of anion templates, remains elusive due to the formidable synthetic challenge. In this work, we report two novel silver clusters, Ag57 and Ag72, using two and three different anion templates, respectively. Ag57 features a gyroscope&#8208;like monovalent cation with an Ag3 triangle core sandwiched by one [SiW9O34]10&#8722; and a triad of Cl&#8722; anion templates. By intentionally introducing the third anion template, SO42&#8722;, the structure is expanded to the unprecedented Ag72 (with 15&#8197;silver atoms epitaxially grown on top of Ag57) resembling a tumbler, inside of which two Ag3 layers are laminated by one [SiW9O34]10&#8722;, seven Cl&#8722; and one SO42&#8722; anion templates in parallel with respect to longitudinal orientation. It is noteworthy that Ag72 exhibits remarkable structural complexity and represents a pioneering achievement as the first silver cluster incorporating three distinct types of anion templates. In addition, Ag72 demonstrates a significant advantage over Ag57, particular in terms of applications such as luminescent thermometers and remote laser ignition. This work not only broadens the horizon for precise control of the silver cluster structures through the integration of multiple types of hetero&#8208;anions but also lays a solid foundation for potential optical applications in the future.

Piano stool rhodium complexes, which are derived from helicene&#8208;indene proligands, can catalyse enantioselective C&#8722;H arylation leading to axially chiral biaryls in mostly high yields and enantiomeric ratios. Stereocontrolled synthesis of such complexes and their use in catalysis expresses an unusual sequence of central&#8208;to&#8208;helical&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer, as reported by Tereza Edlov&#225;, Irena G.

         <title>Adamantane&#8208;Type Nitridophosphate Phosphors AExLi10&#8211;2xP4N10:Eu2+via Medium&#8208;Pressure Ion&#8208;Exchange Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitridophosphates have emerged as promising host compounds in the field of solid&#8208;state lighting. Their industrial relevance has increased significantly, mainly due to recent advances in synthetic approaches under medium&#8208;pressure (MP) conditions, including ammonothermal synthesis and hot isostatic pressing (HIP). In this study, we report on the synthesis and characterization of the quaternary representatives CaxLi10&#8211;2xP4N10 (x&#160;=&#160;2,&#160;2.7,&#160;4) and Sr3Li4P4N10, prepared via a simplified ion exchange reaction under MP conditions, starting from the nitridophosphate&#8208;based lithium ion conductor Li10P4N10. The synthesis route allowed for the preservation of the anionic [P4N10]10&#8211; structural motif of the starting material, while simultaneously introducing potential doping sites for Eu2+ by incorporating divalent alkaline earth cations (Ca2+/Sr2+). Upon excitation of Eu2+ doped samples with blue light, strong luminescence due to parity&#8208;allowed 4f6(7F)5d1&#8594;4f7(8S7/2) transition can be observed in the red (Ca2Li6P4N10:Eu2+: &#955;max&#160;=&#160;626&#160;nm), yellow/orange (Ca2.7Li4.6P4N10:Eu2+: &#955;max1&#160;=&#160;506&#160;nm, &#955;max2 = 592&#160;nm and Sr3Li4P4N10:Eu2+: &#955;max&#160;=&#160;596&#160;nm) and green (Ca4Li2P4N10:Eu2+: &#955;max&#160;=&#160;546&#160;nm) spectral regions of the visible light.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nitridophosphates have emerged as promising host compounds in the field of solid-state lighting. Their industrial relevance has increased significantly, mainly due to recent advances in synthetic approaches under medium-pressure (MP) conditions, including ammonothermal synthesis and hot isostatic pressing (HIP). In this study, we report on the synthesis and characterization of the quaternary representatives CaxLi10&#8211;2xP4N10 (x&#160;=&#160;2,&#160;2.7,&#160;4) and Sr3Li4P4N10, prepared via a simplified ion exchange reaction under MP conditions, starting from the nitridophosphate-based lithium ion conductor Li10P4N10.

         <title>Formally Zerovalent Bis(arene) Germylene Complexes of Zirconium and Hafnium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrachlorides of zirconium&#8208; and hafnium form adducts (2,&#160;3) with an intramolecular germylene phosphine Lewis pair. Two electron reduction treating the adducts with [MesNacnacMg]2 gives the low valent metal complexes (4, 5) featuring &#951;6&#8208;Trip coordination at the Zr(II) and Hf(II) metal atom. Reduction of the M(II)&#8208;complexes gives the zerovalent metal complexes of zirconium (6) and hafnium (7), which have been structurally characterized. Two arene moieties and the germylene exhibit metal coordination. Puckered coordination of a P&#8208;phenyl unit was observed for both derivatives 6 and 7. Four electron reduction of a reaction mixture of metal tetrachloride with the germylene&#8208;phosphine Lewis pair also gives the zerovalent complexes in good yield. Carbonyl complexes were synthesized treating the reduced metal complexes with carbon monoxide. Dimethylbutadiene shows a reaction with an arene moiety and the coordinated germylene ligand of the zerovalent complexes. A cyclohexadienyl and a triorganogermate ligand are formed. For zirconium this reaction is reversible at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Proton Intercalation into an Open&#8208;Tunnel Bronze Phase with Near&#8208;Zero Volume Change</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton intercalation of Mo3Nb2O14 bronze occurs with near&#8208;zero volume change, which arises from rotation and shrinkage of the flexible MOn framework (M = Mo, Nb) as reported by Kosuke Kawai et al. in their Research Article (e202410971). As a result, the Mo3Nb2O14 particle maintains high crystallinity after repeating proton (de)intercalation, which contributes to high Coulombic efficiency and long&#8208;term charge/discharge operation of an aqueous proton battery.

         <title>Back Cover: Target&#8208;templated Construction of Functional Proteomimetics Using Photo&#8208;foldamer Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flat protein surfaces involved in protein&#8211;protein interactions are notoriously difficult targets. In their Research Article (e202410435), Tam&#225;s A. Martinek, Gy&#246;rgy M. Keser&#369; et&#8197;al. addressed this challenge by creating a protein surface&#8208;compatible library of short helical foldamers that can be used as fragments. The light&#8208;induced photoscreening enabled the capture and localization of the weak binding of the helices to the target. Protein&#8208;templated linking of the initial hits to dimeric compounds increased their affinity and resulted in functional proteomimetics.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Gapped and Rotated Grain Boundary Revealed in Ultra&#8208;small Au Nanoparticles for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although gapped grain boundaries have often been observed in bulk and nanosized materials, they have not been reported in metal nanoparticles smaller than 2&#8197;nm owing to the difficulty in characterization and the high instability of grain boundary (GB) atoms. In their Research Article (e202410109), Zhikun Wu, Jun Yang, Lingwen Liao et al. report a novel nanocluster with a 26&#8208;atom gapped and rotated GB, and demonstrate the effectiveness of manipulating GBs for enhancing the catalytic activity of nanocatalysts.

         <title>Halogen Radical&#8208;Activated Perovskite&#8208;Substrate Buried Heterointerface for Achieving Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Tin&#8208;Based Solar Cells with Efficiencies Surpassing 14%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sn&#8208;based perovskites have emerged as one of the most promising environmentally&#8208;friendly photovoltaic materials. Nonetheless, the low&#8208;cost production and stable operation of Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still limited by the costly hole transport layer (HTL) and the under&#8208;optimized interfacial carrier dynamics. Here, we innovatively developed a halogen radical chemical bridging&#160;strategy that enabled to remove the HTL and optimize the perovskite&#8208;substrate heterointerface for constructing high&#8208;performance, simplified Sn&#8208;based PSCs. The modification of ITO electrode by&#160;highly active chlorine radicals&#160;could effectively mitigate the surface oxygen vacancies, alter the chemical constitutions, and favorably down&#8208;shifted the work function of ITO surface to be close to the valence band of perovskites. As a result, the interfacial energy barrier was reduced by 0.20 eV and the carrier dynamics were optimized at the ITO/perovskite heterointerface. Encouragingly, the efficiency of HTL&#8208;free Sn&#8208;based PSCs was enhanced from 6.79% to 14.20%, representing&#160;the record performance for the Sn perovskite photovoltaics in the absence of HTL. Notably, the target device exhibited enhanced stability for 2000 h. The Cl&#8208;RCB strategy is also versatile to construct Pb&#8208;based and mixed Sn&#8208;Pb HTL&#8208;free PSCs, achieving efficiencies of 22.27% and 21.13%, respectively, all representing the advanced device performances for the carrier transport layer&#8208;free PSCs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sn-based perovskites have emerged as one of the most promising environmentally-friendly photovoltaic materials. Nonetheless, the low-cost production and stable operation of Sn-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still limited by the costly hole transport layer (HTL) and the under-optimized interfacial carrier dynamics. Here, we innovatively developed a halogen radical chemical bridging&#160;strategy that enabled to remove the HTL and optimize the perovskite-substrate heterointerface for constructing high-performance, simplified Sn-based PSCs. The modification of ITO electrode by&#160;highly active chlorine radicals&#160;could effectively mitigate the surface oxygen vacancies, alter the chemical constitutions, and favorably down-shifted the work function of ITO surface to be close to the valence band of perovskites. As a result, the interfacial energy barrier was reduced by 0.20 eV and the carrier dynamics were optimized at the ITO/perovskite heterointerface.

The Cl-RCB strategy is also versatile to construct Pb-based and mixed Sn-Pb HTL-free PSCs, achieving efficiencies of 22.27% and 21.13%, respectively, all representing the advanced device performances for the carrier transport layer-free PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Responsive Artificial Protein&#8208;Protein Communication for Field&#8208;Deployable Cell&#8208;Free Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural protein&#8208;protein communications, such as those between transcription factors (TFs) and RNA polymerases/ribosomes, underpin cell&#8208;free biosensing systems operating on the transcription/translation (TXTL) paradigm. However, their deployment in field analysis is hampered by the delayed response (hour&#8208;level) and the complex composition of in vitro TXTL systems. For this purpose, we present a de novo&#8208;designed ligand&#8208;responsive artificial protein&#8208;protein communication (LIRAC) by redefining the connection between TFs and non&#8208;interacting CRISPR/Cas enzymes. By rationally designing a chimeric DNA adaptor and precisely regulating its binding affinities to both proteins, LIRAC immediately transduces target&#8208;induced TF allostery into rapid CRISPR/Cas enzyme activation within a homogenous system. Consequently, LIRAC obviates the need for RNA/protein biosynthesis inherent to conventional TXTL&#8208;based cell&#8208;free systems, substantially reducing reaction complexity and time (from hours to 10 minutes) with improved sensitivity and tunable dynamic range. Moreover, LIRAC exhibits excellent versatility and programmability for rapidly and sensitively detecting diverse contaminants, including antibiotics, heavy metal ions, and preservatives. It also enables the creation of a multi&#8208;protein communication&#8208;based tristate logic for the intelligent detection of multiple contaminants. Integrated with portable devices, LIRAC has been proven effective in the field analysis of environmental samples and personal care products, showcasing its potential for environmental and health monitoring.</dc:description>

         <title>An Expeditious Synthesis of Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Imide&#8208;Based Graphene Nanoribbons and Their Photothermal Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with low band gap and strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption are potential candidates for optoelectronic and biomedical applications. In this context, imide&#8208;based GNRs are promising, but there are no rational design principles that yield these robust GNRs with strong NIR absorption. Here, we demonstrate a rational synthesis route to achieve NIR&#8208;absorbing imide&#8208;based robust GNRs by exploring the bay region of polyperylene (PP). Using the oxidative Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, we have successfully introduced mono and diimide functional groups on PP. After cyclodehydrogenation, the resultant GNRs, benzoperylene imide GNR (BPI&#8208;GNR) and coronene diimide GNR (CDI&#8208;GNR), show oscillatory edge geometry with strong NIR absorption (up to 1000 nm) and optical band gap of ~1.3 eV. Computational studies also indicate that imide substituents play an important role in fine&#8208;tuning the optoelectronic properties of GNRs. Moreover, these GNRs are solution&#8208;processable and can be made into thin films via spray coating. Owing to the strong NIR absorption and imide substitutions, BPI and CDI&#8208;GNRs show good photothermal conversion with excellent cyclic stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid, Non&#8208;Invasive, Accurate&#160;Diagnosis&#160;and Efficient&#160;Clearance of&#160;Metastatic&#160;Lymph Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is currently the standard procedure for clinical cancer diagnosis and treatment, but still faces the risks of false negatives and tumor metastasis, as well as time&#8208;consuming pathological evaluation procedure. Herein, we proposed a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8208;1700 nm) theranostic nanosystem (FLAGC) for rapid, non&#8208;invasive, accurate diagnosis and efficient clearance of metastatic lymph nodes in breast cancer. Initialized by chlorin e6 (Ce6), a pH&#8208;sensitive amphiphilic amino acid fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;L&#8208;histidine (Fmoc&#8208;His) was assembled with Gd3+, luminol, and AgAuSe quantum dots (AAS QDs) to form FLAGC. In FLAGC, luminol and AAS QDs form a NIR&#8208;II chemical resonance energy transfer (CRET) system (Luminol&#8208;AAS); Ce6 initiates the assembly and also serves as a photosensitizer. Upon subcutaneous injection, FLAGC was easily drained into SLNs, achieving their precise localization. Subsequently, the acidity of tumor microenvironment triggered the rapid disassembly of FLAGC, exposing Luminol&#8208;AAS. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) secreted by tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and neutrophils in SLNs mediates the oxidation of luminol, lighting up AAS QDs through the CRET process for precise diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes. Moreover, highly efficient clearance of positive lymph nodes was achieved through Ce6&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy. Our strategy provides a new paradigm for identifying and eliminating clinically metastatic lymph nodes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of triptycene&#8208;based C3v&#8208; and Cs&#8208;symmetric stable radical trimers. SQUID magnetometry showed the propeller&#8208;shaped trimers were both an antiferromagnetic equilateral triangle spin system with small spin&#8208;spin interaction J/kB ~ &#8722;120 K and &#8211;106 K, leading to ca. 4/6 coexistence of the doublet/quartet states in thermal equilibrium at room temperature. The trimers exhibited characteristic NIR absorption bands reaching 1000 nm, which was solely ascribed to the triradical in the doublet state by variable&#8208;temperature spectroscopic studies and quantum chemical calculations. Taking advantage of the spin&#8208;specific absorption feature, we found that the triradicals in the low&#8208;spin state undergo symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer, while those in the high&#8208;spin state fall into a monomer&#8208;like excited state.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Nanozymes for Enhanced Enzyme&#8208;Like Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The global crisis of bacterial infections is exacerbated by the escalating threat of microbial antibiotic resistance. Nanozymes promise to provide ingenious solutions. Here, we reported a homogeneous catalytic structure of Pt nanoclusters with finely tuned metal&#8208;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) channel structures for the treatment of infected wounds. Catalytic site normalization showed that the active site of the Pt aggregates structure with fine&#8208;tuned pore modifications structure had a catalytic capacity of 14.903 &#215;105 min&#8208;1, which was 18.7 times higher than that of the Pt particles in monodisperse state in ZIF&#8208;8 (0.793 &#215;105 min&#8208;1). In situ tests revealed that the change from homocleavage to heterocleavage of hydrogen peroxide at the interface of the nanozyme was one of the key reasons for the improvement of nanozyme activity. Density&#8208;functional theory and kinetic simulations of the reaction interface jointly determine the role of the catalytic center and the substrate channel together. Metabolomics analysis showed that the developed nanozyme, working in conjunction with reactive oxygen species, could effectively block energy metabolic pathways within bacteria, leading to spontaneous apoptosis and bacterial rupture. This pioneering study elucidates new ideas for the regulation of artificial enzyme activity and provides new perspectives for the development of efficient antibiotic substitutes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the increasing sales of electric vehicles, lots of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) assembled with LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes will retire in the next few years, posing a significant challenge for their effective and environmentally&#8208;friendly recycling. The main reason why spent LFP cathodes fail to re&#8208;utilize lies in the lattice defects caused by lithium loss and structural defects resulting from stress accumulation. In this work, we propose an in&#8208;situ granule reconstruction strategy to directly regenerate spent LFP black mass (S&#8208;BM) using glycerol in industry settings. The hydroxyl groups abundant in glycerol serves as electron donor that help reduce Fe (III) and repair Fe&#8211;Li antisite defects (FeLi). Additionally, the chelating properties of glycerol intervene with structurally disintegrated particles, inhibiting Oswald ripening effect and promoting bonding of grain boundaries to generate lamellar microcrystals with homogeneous grain size, recover their morphology and crystal structure after a facile annealing procedure. Furthermore, the regenerated LFP restores Fe&#8211;O bonds which further inhibits structural distortion and improve Li+ migration kinetics. As a result, the regenerated industrial LFP black mass (R&#8208;BM) exhibits superior lithium storage performance with a discharge capacity of 123.2 mA h g&#8211;1 after 500 cycles at 5.0 C (a capacity retention rate of 93.1%).</dc:description>

As for &#945;&#8208;substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, a 1,4&#8208;hydroarsination/enantioselective protonation event occurs smoothly in satisfying results.

Finally, some control experiments show that HAsPh2 is activated through coordination with the copper(I) catalyst and HAsPh2 exhibits inferior soft Lewis basicity to HPPh2 in the presence of a copper(I)&#8208;bisphosphine complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Freestanding Phosphonium Covalent Organic Frameworks with Efficient Hydroxide Conduction for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their well&#8208;defined crystalline pore structures and ordered functional ionic groups along the skeleton, ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) exhibit excellent performance and have significant potential for use in energy storage and conversion devices. Herein, we for the first time developed cationic phosphonium COFs with high hydroxide conduction even with low ion exchange capacity (IEC). Specifically, we synthesized COFs containing quaternary phosphonium groups as excellent ion transport moieties. Then, we fabricated freestanding phosphonium membranes through a vapor&#8208;assisted method, which exhibited high hydroxide conductivity of 126 mS cm&#8211;1 at 80 &#176;C from a minimal IEC of 1.17 mmol g&#8211;1. The resulting film was successfully applied to zinc&#8211;air batteries, demonstrating energy density of 96.1 mW cm&#8211;2, specific capacity of 95.0 mAh cm&#8211;2, and stable operation over 2,300 min. Overall, in addition to investigating a novel cationic functional group, we demonstrated a freestanding film formation method of COF&#8208;based materials. The findings can provide a solid foundation for advancing the field of iCOFs to ion transport and promoting electrochemical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Phenothiazine Dioxide via External Heavy Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing pure organic materials with ultralong lifetimes and balanced quantum efficiency is attractive but challenging. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to investigate external heavy atoms by linking molecular emitters with halogen through a flexible alkyl chain. X&#8208;ray crystal analysis clearly reveal the halogen C&#8208;X&#8208;&#960; interactions, which can be tuned by halogen donors, as well as the distance and geometry between them. Impressively, DOPTZ&#8208;C3Cl featuring a chloride atom as donor, exhibits a balanced long phosphorescence lifetime of 1351 ms and a phosphorescence quantum yield of 10.1%. We also first demonstrate that Cl can induce more positive effect than heavier halogens (Br and I) on prolonging the lifetime. We envisage that the present study will expedite new molecular design to manipulate the room temperature phosphorescence via external heavy atom effect, and highlight a special C&#8208;Cl&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction for the development of ultralong phosphorescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Collective Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Dynamics in Hexafluoroisopropanol Related to its Chemical Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexafluoro&#8208;isopropanol (HFIP) is a popular solvent strongly enhancing reaction rates. Its unique properties are thought to be connected to its hydrogen&#8208;bond structure. Here we investigate the hydrogen&#8208;bond dynamics of HFIP and its non&#8208;fluorinated counterpart, isopropanol, by means of infrared and dielectric spectroscopy. We show that the smaller size and faster dynamics of hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters in HFIP play an important role in its superior solvent properties.







Abstract
Using fluorinated mono&#8208;alcohols, in particular hexafluoro&#8208;isopropanol (HFIP), as a solvent can enhance chemical reaction rates in a spectacular manner. Previous work has shown evidence that this enhancement is related to the hydrogen&#8208;bond structure of these liquids. Here, we investigate the hydrogen&#8208;bond dynamics of HFIP and compare it to that of its non&#8208;fluorinated analog, isopropanol. Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy experiments show that the dynamics of individual hydrogen&#8208;bonds is about twice as slow in HFIP as in isopropanol. Surprisingly, from dielectric spectroscopy we find the opposite behavior for the dynamics of hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters: collective rearrangements are 3&#8197;times faster in HFIP than in isopropanol. This difference indicates that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters in HFIP are smaller than in isopropanol. The differences in cluster size can be traced to changes in the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor and acceptor strengths upon fluorination. The smaller cluster size can boost reaction rates in HFIP by increasing the concentration of reactive, terminal OH&#8208;groups of the clusters, whereas the fast collective dynamics can increase the rate of formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonds with the reactants. The longer lifetime of the individual hydrogen&#8208;bonds in HFIP can enhance the stability of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded clusters, and so increase the probability of reactant&#8208;solvent hydrogen&#8208;bonding.

         <title>Early Detection of High&#8208;Altitude Hypoxic Brain Injury by In Vivo Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we proposed a strategy based on in vivo electrochemistry for early detecting high&#8208;altitude hypoxic brain injury (HHBI). The characteristic changes in the brain oxygen level under the high&#8208;altitude exposure directly associated with the brain hypoxia status. Given that brain hypoxia is the main pathogenesis of HHBI, the risk of HHBI can be prognosed 3&#8197;days in advance according to the characteristics of brain oxygen change within initial 1&#8211;2&#8197;hours of high&#8208;altitude exposure.







Abstract
High&#8208;altitude hypoxic brain injury (HHBI) is a kind of acute mountain sickness and the survival rate of patients with HHBI can be improved only if it is detected and treated at the early stage. However, limited by speediness and accuracy, it is still very difficult for most of current approaches to realize the early detection of HHBI. We propose herein a novel strategy for this goal based on spatiotemporal changes in the brain oxygen level. As revealed by in vivo electrochemistry, the characteristic changes of brain oxygen level under the high&#8208;altitude exposure are directly associated with the brain hypoxia status. Given brain hypoxia is the main pathogenesis of HHBI, the degree of HHBI can be diagnosed by the variation of brain oxygen, making the early detection of HHBI feasible. In addition, the risk of HHBI for mouse exposed to high&#8208;altitude hypoxia environments can be also prognosed days in advance.

         <title>Reductive C(sp2)&#8722;Si Cross&#8208;Couplings by Catalytic Sodium&#8208;Bromine Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a chemical transformation that exploits the sodium&#8208;bromine exchange reaction catalytically is presented. Using stable tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted silyldiazenes (tBu&#8722;N=N&#8722;SiR3) as silylating reagents, various (hetero)aryl bromides have been converted to the corresponding organosilicon compounds using inexpensive sodium alkoxides as catalytic promoters. Mechanistic studies point to the involvement of tert&#8208;butylsodium (tBuNa) that mediates the key Na/Br exchange event.







Abstract
The metal&#8208;halogen exchange reaction constitutes one of the most important preparative routes towards polar organometallic reagents such as aryllithium or Grignard reagents. However, despite extensive developments over the past eight decades, this fundamental organometallic elementary step has only been exploited stoichiometrically. Against this background, we demonstrate that the sodium&#8208;bromine exchange reaction can be implemented in a catalytic setting as a mean to activate C(sp2)&#8722;Br bonds in a transition metal&#8208;free manner en route to the regioselective and general preparation of (hetero)aryl silanes. Simply treating structurally diverse (hetero)aryl bromides with N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;silyldiazenes (tBu&#8722;N=N&#8722;Si) as silylating reagents and inexpensive sodium alkoxides as catalytic promoters yields a range of aromatic organosilicon compounds under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies provide solid evidence for the involvement of tert&#8208;butyl sodium as the C(sp2)&#8722;Br metalating agent.

         <title>A Crystalline Mesoionic Diazasilole Featuring Low&#8208;Valent Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the isolation of a mesoionic diazasilole featuring a low&#8208;valent silicon center that exhibits properties characteristic of both mesoionic silylene and silylone. Preliminary reactivity studies, including coordination with transition metals, oxidation, silicon atom transfer, ring saturation, ring contraction, and skeletal rearrangement, have yielded an array of novel silicon&#8208;based heterocycles.







Abstract
A 1,4,2&#8208;diazasilole containing a low&#8208;valent silicon atom has been synthesized employing a bulky imino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand. This molecular structure is characterized by a mesoionic C2N2Si five&#8208;membered ring, notable for its delocalized &#960; electrons, intrinsic charge&#8208;separated zwitterionic properties, and a distinctly nucleophilic silicon center, culminating in 6&#960; aromaticity. This compound manifests either mesoionic silylene or silylone characteristics upon coordination with transition metals. Demonstrating extraordinary versatility, this compound engages in diverse reactions such as coordination with iron or iridium, oxidation by S8, intramolecular ring saturation under the coordination influence of iridium, silicon atom transfer facilitated by Ph2Se2, ring contraction induced by Ph2Te2, and skeletal rearrangement triggered by Et3N&#8226;HCl. These reactions culminate in the formation of a variety of unprecedented silicon&#8208;based heterocycles, which are typically formidable to achieve using conventional methods. This study unveils previously unexplored facets of low&#8208;valent 1,4,2&#8208;diazasilole, positioning it as a promising foundational building block for future innovations in unique silicon compounds.

         <title>Modular Design and Scaffold&#8208;Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Functional Fluorophores for Targeted Cellular Imaging and Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular approach is established to synthesize multi&#8208;functional fluorophores via a scaffolding approach using the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction. The characterization and applications of a small library of such probes with fluorogenic character for optical imaging and theranostics are shown. The probes can be equipped with distinct cellular localization signals and can induce programmed cell death.







Abstract
Fluorophores are essential tools for optical imaging and biomedical research. Their synthetic modification to incorporate new functions, however, remains a challenging task. Conventional strategies rely on linear synthesis in which a parent framework is gradually extended. We here designed and synthesized a versatile library of multi&#8208;functional fluorophores via a scaffold&#8208;based Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (U&#8208;4CR). The adaptability of the scaffold is achieved through modification of starting materials. This allows to use a small range of starting materials for the creation of fluorogenic probes that can detect reactive&#8208;oxygen species and where the localization into subcellular organelles or membranes can be controlled. We present reaction yields ranging from 60&#8201;% to 90&#8201;% and discovered that some compounds can even function as imaging and therapeutic agents via Fenton chemistry inducing pyroptosis in living cancer cells. Our study underlines the potential of scaffold&#8208;based synthesis for versatile creation of functional fluorophores and their applications.

         <dc:description>Herein, we present the first catalytic asymmetric nucleophilic addition of diarylphosphines to 2H&#8208;azirines, facilitated by a chiral Mn(I) complex. This method not only provides access to novel class of derivatives of the aziridine core&#8212;a structural motif recognized for its antitumor and antibacterial properties&#8212;but also introduces a phosphine moiety alongside the generation of an NH moiety within a strained three&#8208;membered ring.

         <dc:description>Three new 3d&#8208;4f complexes of general formula trans&#8208;[MF2(py)4][LnDOTA] (M = Cr3+ or Co3+, Ln = Dy3+ or Y3+, py = pyridine and DOTA = tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;N,N&#8242;,N&#8243;,N&#8244;&#8208;tetraacetate) have been synthetised. The fluoride&#8208;bridged systems were designed to achieve perfect tetragonal symmetry by combining four&#8208;fold symmetric lanthanide and transition metal building blocks. From single crystal measurements, an unprecedented switch of the tetragonal anisotropy of the Dy3+ complexes has been observed. A combination of spectroscopic observations, magnetometry measurements and ab initio calculations allowed us to pinpoint the origin of this phenomenon, which is related to the peculiar energy level structure of the complexes. Moreover, the fourfold anisotropy of the complex has been exploited to design a rotating magnetocaloric experiment showing that tetragonal anisotropy holds great potential to engineer a new class of more efficient magnetic refrigerants.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonenzymatic Hydration of Phosphoenolpyruvate: General Conditions for Hydration in Protometabolism by Searching Across Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous reactions within metabolic pathways have been reported to occur nonenzymatically, supporting the hypothesis that life arose upon a primitive nonenzymatic precursor to metabolism. However, most of those studies reproduce individual transformations or segments of pathways without providing a common set of conditions for classes of reactions that span multiple pathways. In this study, we search across pathways for common nonenzymatic conditions for a recurring chemical transformation in metabolism: alkene hydration. The mild conditions that we identify (Fe oxides such as green rust) apply to all hydration reactions of the rTCA cycle and gluconeogenesis, including the hydration of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to 2&#8208;phosphoglycerate (2PGA), which had not previously been reported under nonenzymatic conditions. Mechanistic insights were obtained by&#160;studying analogous substrates and through anoxic and radical trapping experiments. Searching for nonenzymatic conditions across pathways provides a complementary strategy to triangulate conditions conducive to the nonenzymatic emergence of a protometabolism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Base&#8208;Free Two&#8208;Coordinate Oxoborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxoboranes (R&#8208;BO) are transient species that rapidly trimerise to form boroxines. To date, the only method used to stabilise oxoboranes is to add a Lewis base, but this forms a three&#8208;coordinate at boron oxoborane that has a different bonding/reactivity profile. Herein we report a base&#8208;free, two&#8208;coordinate oxoborane that is isolated as a Lewis adduct with AlCl3. This species, Mes*BO&#8208;AlCl3 (Mes* = 2,4,6&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2), has a &#957;11&#914;&#927; stretching frequency of 1843 cm&#8208;1, indicating a strong BO bond. Computational analysis indicates this is due to a highly polarised BO bonding interaction combined with modest BO multiple bond character. While the polarisation of the BO bond on AlCl3 coordination enhances the Lewis acidity at boron it also reduces the basicity at oxygen and the latter is key to accessing a base&#8208;free oxoborane. Finally, this oxoborane reacts with PhN3 in a unique way to form an unprecedented boron heterocycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrolyte Engineering to Construct Robust Interphase with High Ionic Conductivity for Wide Temperature Range Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unstable interphase formed in conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes significantly hinders the widespread application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high&#8208;capacity nickel&#8208;rich layered oxides (e.g., LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NCM811) over a wide temperature range. To balance ion transport kinetics and interfacial stability over wide temperature range, herein a bifunctional electrolyte (EAFP) tailoring the electrode/electrolyte interphase with 1,3&#8208;propanesultone as an additive was developed. The resulting cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase with an inorganic inner layer and an organic outer layer possesses high mechanical stability and flexibility, alleviating stress accumulation and maintaining the structural integrity of the NCM811 cathode. Meanwhile, the inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase inhibits electrolyte side reactions and facilitates fast Li+ transport. As a result, the Li||Li cells exhibit stable performance in extensive temperatures with low overpotentials, especially achieving a long lifespan of 1000 h at 30 &#176;C. Furthermore, the optimized EAFP is also suitable for LiFePO4 and LiCO2 cathodes (1000 cycles, retention: 67%). The Li||NCM811 and graphite||NCM811 pouch cells with lean electrolyte (g/Ah grade) operate stably, verifying the broad electrode compatibility of EAFP. Notably, the Li||NCM811 cells can operate in wide climate range from &#8208;40 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C. This work establishes new guidelines for the regulation of interphase by electrolytes in all&#8208;weather LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyphenol Oxidase Activity on Guaiacyl and Syringyl Lignin Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conversion of lignin&#8208;derived guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) compounds into methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols through oxidative ortho&#8208;hydroxylation and ortho&#8208;demethoxylation reactions catalyzed by novel fungal polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) is presented. The formation of o&#8208;diphenols rather than reactive quinones can be steered by the addition of a reductant. These PPOs offer new methods to reduce the heterogeneity of G and S lignin&#8208;derived product mixtures.







Abstract
The natural heterogeneity of guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) compounds resulting from lignin processing hampers their direct use as plant&#8208;based chemicals and materials. Herein, we explore six short polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) from lignocellulose&#8208;degrading ascomycetes for their capacity to react with G&#8208;type and S&#8208;type phenolic compounds. All six PPOs catalyze the ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of G&#8208;type compounds (guaiacol, vanillic acid, and ferulic acid), forming the corresponding methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols. Remarkably, a subset of these PPOs is also active towards S&#8208;compounds (syringol, syringic acid, and sinapic acid) resulting in identical methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols. Assays with 18O2 demonstrate that these PPOs in particular catalyze ortho&#8208;hydroxylation and ortho&#8208;demethoxylation of S&#8208;compounds and generate methanol as a co&#8208;product. Oxidative (ortho&#8722;) demethoxylation of S&#8208;compounds is a novel reaction for PPOs, which we propose occurs by a distinct reaction mechanism as compared to aryl&#8208;O&#8208;demethylases. We further show that addition of a reducing agent can steer the PPO reaction to form methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols from both G&#8208; and S&#8208;type substrates rather than reactive quinones that lead to unfavorable polymerization. Application of PPOs opens for new routes to reduce the heterogeneity and methoxylation degree of mixtures of G and S lignin&#8208;derived compounds.

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of Glycine from Methanol and Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report a novel photocatalytic system for the synthesis of glycine directly from methanol and nitrate. Ba2+&#8722;TiO2 nanoparticles show a high glycine photosynthesis rate under mild conditions. The success of this work provides a sustainable pathway for the valorization of green &#8220;liquid sunlight&#8221; and nitrate waste.







Abstract
Photocatalytic utilization of methanol and nitrate as carbon and nitrogen sources for the direct synthesis of amino acids could provide a sustainable way for the valorization of green &#8220;liquid sunlight&#8221; and nitrate waste. In this study, we develop an efficient photochemical method to synthesize glycine directly from methanol and nitrate, which cascades the C&#8722;C coupling to form glycol, nitrate reduction to NH3, and finally C&#8722;N coupling to generate glycine. Interestingly, the involved photocatalytic tandem reactions show a synergistic effect, in which the presence of nitrate is the dominant factor to enable the overall reaction and reach high synthetic efficiency. Ba2+&#8722;TiO2 nanoparticles are confirmed as a feasible and efficient catalyst system for the photosynthesis of glycine with a remarkable glycine photosynthesis rate of 870&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under optimal conditions. This work establishes a novel catalytic system for amino acid synthesis from methanol and nitrate under mild conditions. These results also allow us to further suppose the formation pathways of amino acids on the primitive earth, as an extension to proposals based on the Miller&#8208;Urey experiments.

Exchanging a sulfur atom against a methine group in a series of azaacene based diradicals furnishes non&#8208;Kekul&#233;, meta&#8208;quinodimethane based diradicals with singlet ground states and small singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Zwitterionic contributions are ruled out experimentally and quantum&#8208;chemically, and the diradicals display huge two&#8208;photon cross sections in the infrared spectral region.







Abstract
Non&#8208;Kekul&#233; quinoidal azaacences m&#8208;A (1&#8201;a,b) were synthesized and compared to their para&#8208; and ortho&#8208;quinodimethane analogues. m&#8208;A display high diradical characters (1&#8201;b: y0 = 0.88) due to their meta&#8208;quinodimethane (m&#8208;QDM) topology. Electron paramagnetic, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and supraquantum interference device measurements in combination with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations revealed singlet ground states for m&#8208;A with singlet&#8208;triplet gaps &#916;EST (0.13&#8211;0.25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and thermally populated triplet states. These non&#8208;Kekul&#233; structures are over all void of zwitterionic character and possess record high two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections over a broad spectral range in the near&#8208;infrared.

         <title>Intracellular Gold Nanocluster/Organic Semiconductor Heterostructure for Enhancing Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small heterostructures (AuNCs@OFTF) with amphiphilicity were developed. They can be rapidly internalized in cyanobacteria and provide a programmable electronic interface, where the strong energetic coupling accelerates electron transfer in living cyanobacteria. Exogenous photogenerated electrons from AuNCs@OFTF enable a five&#8208;fold increase in photocurrent and enhance biomass production of cyanobacteria.







Abstract
Photosynthetic microorganisms, which rely on light&#8208;driven electron transfer, store solar energy in self&#8208;energy carriers and convert it into bioenergy. Although these microorganisms can operate light&#8208;induced charge separation with nearly 100&#8201;% quantum efficiency, their practical applications are inherently limited by the photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency. Artificial semiconductors can induce an electronic response to photoexcitation, providing additional excited electrons for natural photosynthesis to improve solar conversion efficiency. However, challenges remain in importing exogenous electrons across cell membranes. In this work, we have developed an engineered gold nanocluster/organic semiconductor heterostructure (AuNCs@OFTF) to couple the intracellular electron transport chain of living cyanobacteria. AuNCs@OFTF exhibits a prolonged excited state lifetime and effective charge separation. The internalized AuNCs@OFTF permits its photogenerated electrons to participate in the downstream of photosystem II and construct an oriented electronic highway, which enables a five&#8208;fold increase in photocurrent in living cyanobacteria. Moreover, the binding events of AuNCs@OFTF established an abiotic&#8208;biotic electronic interface at the thylakoid membrane to enhance electron flux and finally furnished nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Thus, AuNCs@OFTF can be exploited to spatiotemporally manipulate and enhance the solar conversion of living cyanobacteria in cells, providing an extended nanotechnology for re&#8208;engineering photosynthetic pathways.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Formal (3+2) Cycloadditions of Bicyclobutanes with Imines: Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc Lewis acid catalyzes asymmetric (3+2) cycloadditions of BCBs with imines to afford aza&#8208;BCHs bearing &#945;&#8208;chiral amine fragments and two quaternary carbon centers in high yields and er values. Expeirmental studies and DFT calculations provide mechanistic insight.







Abstract
The cycloaddition reaction involving bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) offers a versatile and efficient synthetic platform for producing C(sp3)&#8208;rich rigid bridged ring scaffolds, which act as phenyl bioisosteres. However, there is a scarcity of catalytic asymmetric cycloadditions of BCBs to fulfill the need for enantioenriched saturated bicycles in drug design and development. In this study, an efficient synthesis of valuable azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (aza&#8208;BCHs) by an enantioselective zinc&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) cycloadditions of BCBs with imines is reported. The reaction proceeds effectively with a novel type of BCB that incorporates a 2&#8208;acyl imidazole group and a diverse array of alkynyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted imines. The target aza&#8208;BCHs, which consist of &#945;&#8208;chiral amine fragments and two quaternary carbon centers, are efficiently synthesized with up to 94&#8201;%&#8197;and 96.5:3.5 er under mild conditions. Experimental and computational studies reveal that the reaction follows a concerted nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening mechanism of BCBs with imines. This mechanism is distinct from previous studies on Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of BCBs.

         <title>Skeletal Editing of Aromatic N&#8208;Heterocycles via Hydroborative Cleavage of C&#8722;N Bonds&#8212;Scope, Mechanism, and Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and facile BH3&#8208;mediated skeletal editing of aromatic heterocycles via hydroborative cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds is reported. Structurally diverse products, including tetrahydrobenzo azaborinines, diazaboroles, O&#8208;anilinophenylethyl alcohols, benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, and more were readily obtained. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed an interesting and counterintuitive indole hydroboration phenomenon, including &#8722;BH2 shift from C3&#8208;position to C2&#8208;position. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the synthesized diazaboroles was studied, and an interestingly and pronounced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior was disclosed.







Abstract
Skeletal editing of the core structure of heterocycles offers new opportunities for chemical construction and is a promising yet challenging research topic that has recently gained increasing interest. However, several limitations of the reported systems remain to be addressed. For example, the reagents employed are generally in high&#8208;energy, such as chlorocarbene precursors, nitrene species, and metal carbenes, which are also associated with low atomic efficiencies. Thus, the development of simple systems for the skeletal editing of heterocycles is still desired. Herein, a straightforward and facile BH3&#8208;mediated skeletal editing of readily available indoles, benzimidazoles, and several other aromatic heterocycles is reported. Structurally diverse products were readily obtained, including tetrahydrobenzo azaborinines, diazaboroles, O&#8208;anilinophenylethyl alcohols, benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, and more. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed a BH3&#8208;induced C&#8722;N bond cleavage reaction pathway. An exciting and counterintuitive indole hydroboration phenomenon of &#8722;BH2 shift from C3&#8208;position to C2&#8208;position was disclosed. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the synthesized diazaboroles were studied, and an interestingly and pronounced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior was disclosed.

         <title>Peptide Degrader&#8208;Based Targeting of METTL3/14 Improves Immunotherapy Response in Cutaneous Melanoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study unveils METTL3&#8217;s oncogenic role in melanoma. RM3, a designed peptide inhibitor disrupting METTL3/14 complex, induces proteasomal degradation via STUB1. RM3 reduces melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody, RM3 elicits significantly enhanced tumor response in vivo, with a favorable safety profile.







Abstract
METTL3 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in cancer treatment, although its oncogenic functions in melanoma development and potential for therapeutic targeting drug have not been fully explored. In this study, we define the oncogenic role of METTL3 in melanoma development and progression. Building on this insight, we examine our recently designed peptide inhibitor RM3, which targets the binding interface of METTL3/14 complex for disruption and subsequent ubiquitin&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation via the E3 ligase STUB1. RM3 treatment reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induces apoptosis in melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis identified changes in immuno&#8208;related genes following RM3&#8208;mediated suppression of METTL3/14 N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase activity, suggesting a potential for interaction with immunotherapy. A combination treatment of RM3 with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody results in significantly higher beneficial tumor response in vivo, with a good safety profile. Collectively, these findings not only delineate the oncogenic role of METTL3 in melanoma but also showcase RM3, acting as a peptide degrader, as a novel and promising strategy for melanoma treatment.

Subsequent transcriptomic analysis identified changes in immuno-related genes following &lt;b&gt;RM3&lt;/b&gt;-mediated suppression of METTL3/14 N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) methyltransferase activity, suggesting a potential for interaction with immunotherapy. A combination treatment of &lt;b&gt;RM3&lt;/b&gt; with anti-PD-1 antibody results in significantly higher beneficial tumor response in vivo, with a good safety profile. Collectively, these findings not only delineate the oncogenic role of METTL3 in melanoma but also showcase &lt;b&gt;RM3&lt;/b&gt;, acting as a peptide degrader, as a novel and promising strategy for melanoma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Pyrazolone Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective acylative kinetic resolution of racemic pyrazolone tertiary alcohols catalysed by chiral isothioureas is described (s=&gt;100 in &gt;25 examples). This method was applied to highly functionalised pharmaceutically derived compounds, demonstrated at a decagram scale, and at ppm catalyst loading with DFT analysis indicating an NC=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction key to enantiorecognition.







Abstract
The development of methods for the selective acylative kinetic resolution (KR) of tertiary alcohols is a recognised synthetic challenge with relatively few successful substrate classes reported to date. In this manuscript, a highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative KR of tertiary pyrazolone alcohols is reported. The scope and limitations of this methodology have been developed, with high selectivity observed across a broad range of substrate derivatives incorporating varying substitution at N(2)&#8208;, C(4)&#8208; and C(5)&#8208;, as well as bicyclic constraints within the pyrazolone scaffold (30 examples, selectivity factors (s) typically &gt;100) at generally low catalyst loadings (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%). The application of this KR method to tertiary alcohols derived directly from a natural product (geraniol), alongside pharmaceutically relevant drug compounds (indomethacin, gemfibrozil and probenecid), with high efficiency (s &gt;100) is also described. The KR process is readily amenable to scale up using bench grade solvents and reagents, with effective resolution on a 50&#8197;g (0.22&#8197;mol) scale demonstrated. The key structural motif leading to excellent selectivity in this KR process has been probed through computation, with an NC=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction from substrate to acylated catalyst observed within the favoured transition state. Similarly, the effect of C(5)&#8208;aryl substitution that leads to reduced experimental selectivity is probed, with a competitive &#960;&#8211;isothiouronium interaction identified as leading to reduced selectivity.

         <title>Simultaneously Strengthening and Toughening All&#8208;Natural Structural Materials via 3D Nanofiber Network Interfacial Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial interlocking structure is designed by introducing protonated chitosan (CS) at the interface between the surface oxidized 3D nanonetwork of bacterial cellulose (BC). This interfacial structure provides enough physical contact sites for hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. The obtained structural material shows better environmental friendliness and mechanical and thermal properties than engineering plastics.







Abstract
Constructing structural materials from sustainable raw materials is considered an efficient way to reduce the potential threat posed by plastics. Nevertheless, challenges remain regarding combining excellent mechanical and thermal properties, especially the balance of strength and toughness. Here, we report a 3D nanofiber network interfacial design strategy to strengthen and toughen all&#8208;natural structural materials simultaneously. The introduced protonated chitosan at the interface between the surface oxidized 3D nanonetwork of bacterial cellulose forms the interfacial interlocking structure of nanonetworks, achieving a robust physical connection and providing enough physical contact sites for chemical crosslinking. The obtained sustainable structural material successfully integrates excellent mechanical and thermal properties on the nanoscale of cellulose nanofibers, such as light weight, high strength, and superior thermal expansion coefficient. The relationship between structural design and comprehensive mechanical property improvement is analyzed in detail, providing a universal perspective to design sustainable high&#8208;performance structural materials from nanoscale building blocks.

         <title>P&#8208;doped RuSe2 on Porous N&#8208;Doped Carbon Matrix as Catalysts for Accelerated Sulfur Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalyst of phosphorus doped RuSe2 (P&#8208;RuSe2) with&#160;the enhanced conductivity and the modulation of the d&#8208;band center is engineered via a rational screening strategy, which augments its effectiveness in interacting with LiPSs and hence exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of high capacity, superior rate capability and stable cycle life.







Abstract
Monocomponent catalysts exhibit the limited catalytic conversion of polysulfides due to their intrinsic electronic structure, but their catalytic activity can be improved by introducing heteroatoms to regulate its electronic structure. However, the rational selection principles of doping elements remain unclear. Here, we are guided by theoretical calculations to select the suitable doping elements based on the balanced relationship between the adsorption strength of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalytic activity of lithium sulfide. We apply the screening method to develop a new catalyst of phosphorus doped RuSe2, manifesting the further enhanced conductivity compared with original RuSe2, facilitating charge transfer and further modulating the d&#8208;band center of RuSe2, thereby augmenting its effectiveness in interacting with LiPSs. Consequently, the assembled cell exhibits an areal capacity of 7.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, even under high sulfur loading of 8.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a lean electrolyte condition (5.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1). This rational screening strategy offers a robust solution for the design of advanced catalysts in the field of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries and potentially other domains as well.

         <title>Configurational Isomerization&#8208;Induced Orientation Switching: Non&#8208;Fused Ring Dipodal Phosphonic Acids as Hole&#8208;Extraction Layers for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fused ring dipodal phosphonic acids, characterized by non&#8208;fused ring backbones and dipodal phosphonic acid anchors, are developed and used as hole&#8208;extraction layers in organic solar cells. Such simple and tailorable backbones offer a novel platform to study structural effect on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors on ITO, which leads to an impressive performance of 19.66&#8201;% owing to optimized interfacial contact and active layer morphology.







Abstract
Phosphonic acid (PA) self&#8208;assembled molecules have recently emerged as efficient hole&#8208;extraction layers (HELs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the structural effects of PAs on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors on indium tin oxide (ITO) and thus photovoltaic performance remain obscure. Herein, we present a novel class of PAs, namely &#8220;non&#8208;fused ring dipodal phosphonic acids&#8221; (NFR&#8208;DPAs), featuring simple and malleable non&#8208;fused ring backbones and dipodal phosphonic acid anchoring groups. The efficacy of configurational isomerism in modulating the photoelectronic properties and switching molecular orientation of PAs atop electrodes results in distinct substrate surface energy and electronic characteristics. The NFR&#8208;DPA with linear (C2h symmetry) and brominated backbone exhibits favorable face&#8208;on orientation and enhanced work function modification capability compared to its angular (C2v symmetry) and non&#8208;brominated counterparts. This makes it versatile HELs in mitigating interfacial resistance for energy barrier&#8208;free hole collection, and affording optimal active layer morphology, which results in an impressive efficiency of 19.11&#8201;% with a low voltage loss of 0.52&#8197;V for binary OSC devices and an excellent efficiency of 19.66&#8201;% for ternary OSC devices. This study presents a new dimension to design PA&#8208;based HELs for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

A putative &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase from aculene biosynthesis, AneA, was functionally characterized and explored as biocatalyst for C&#8722;H oxidation. AneA exhibits broad substrate promiscuity and is capable of both hydroxylation and desaturation depending on its substrate structure. The utility of the biocatalytic reaction was demonstrated in several oxidative desymmetrizations and in the chemoenzymatic synthesis of complex sesquiterpenoids.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases (&#945;KGDs) have recently emerged as useful biocatalysts for C&#8722;H oxidation and functionalization. In this work, we characterized a new &#945;KGD from aculene biosynthesis, AneA, which displays broad promiscuity toward a number of substrates with different ring systems. Unexpectedly, AneA was found to be capable of both desaturation and hydroxylation and require an amino ester motif on its substrate for productive catalysis. Insights gathered from the functional characterization and substrate&#8208;activity profiling of AneA enabled the development of a chemoenzymatic strategy toward several complex sesquiterpenoids.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Dissipative Assembly with Switchable Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A switchable non&#8208;equilibrium dissipative assembly promoting fibroblast adhesion/proliferation and efficient drug delivery was developed using chemical fuel. Nanofibers acted as chiral hydrogel scaffolds for cell adhesion and drug reservoirs. This system transitions between nanofiber and nanospherical forms, enabling targeted drug delivery and recovery, highlighting its scientific significance.







Abstract
Natural dissipative assembly (DSA) often exhibit energy&#8208;driven shifts in natural functions. However, creating man&#8208;made DSA that can mimic such biological activities transformation remains relatively rare. Herein, we introduce a cytomembrane&#8208;like dissipative assembly system based on chiral supramolecules. This system employs benzoyl cysteine in an out of equilibrium manner, enabling the shifts in biofunctions while minimizing material use. Specifically, aroyl&#8208;cystine derivatives primarily assemble into stable M&#8208;helix nanofibers under equilibrium conditions. These nanofibers enhance fibroblast adhesion and proliferation through stereospecific interactions with chiral cellular membranes. Upon the addition of chemical fuels, these functional nanofibers temporarily transform into non&#8208;equilibrium nanospheres, facilitating efficient drug delivery. Subsequently, these nanospheres revert to their original nanofiber state, effectively recycling the drug. The programmable function&#8208;shifting ability of this DSA establishes it as a novel, fuel&#8208;driven drug delivery vehicle. And the bioactive DSA not only addresses a gap in synthetic DSAs within biological applications but also sets the stage for innovative designs of &#8242;living&#8242; materials.

         <title>Gas Tunnel Engineering of Prolyl Hydroxylase Reprograms Hypoxia Signaling in Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gas tunnel of PHD2, an iron&#8208;based O2 sensing enzyme, is engineered using a computation&#8208;guided rational design approach. The engineered mutants exhibit an increased rate of gas transport to the active site, along with increased catalytic activity in vitro. These mutants also display enhanced intracellular activity demonstrating the ability to reprogram hypoxia signaling by activating PHD2.







Abstract
Cells have evolved intricate mechanisms for recognizing and responding to changes in oxygen (O2) concentrations. Here, we have reprogrammed cellular hypoxia (low O2) signaling via gas tunnel engineering of prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), a non&#8208;heme iron dependent O2 sensor. Using computational modeling and protein engineering techniques, we identify a gas tunnel and critical residues therein that limit the flow of O2 to PHD2&#8217;s catalytic core. We show that systematic modification of these residues can open the constriction topology of PHD2&#8217;s gas tunnel. Using kinetic stopped&#8208;flow measurements with NO as a surrogate diatomic gas, we demonstrate up to 3.5&#8208;fold enhancement in its association rate to the iron center of tunnel&#8208;engineered mutants. Our most effectively designed mutant displays 9&#8208;fold enhanced catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM=830&#177;40&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) in hydroxylating a peptide mimic of hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF&#8208;1&#945;, as compared to WT PHD2 (kcat/KM=90&#177;9&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Furthermore, transfection of plasmids that express designed PHD2 mutants in HEK&#8208;293T mammalian cells reveal significant reduction of HIF&#8208;1&#945; and downstream hypoxia response transcripts under hypoxic conditions of 1&#8201;% O2. Overall, these studies highlight activation of PHD2 as a new pathway to reprogram hypoxia responses and HIF signaling in cells.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Frameworks Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production from Alkaline Water: One Atom Makes a Significant Improvement</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel photoactive azobenzene&#8208;bridged 2D COF (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo) shows an excellent photocatalytic H2O2 production rate up to 1498&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at pH = 11, which is 7.9&#8197;times higher than its corresponding imine&#8208;linked 2D COF (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA), although only one atom is different in the two 2D COFs (&#8722;N=N&#8722; vs. &#8722;C=N&#8722;). COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo exhibits much narrower band gap, enhanced charge transport, and prompted photoactivity, which is benefited from its azo linkages.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been demonstrated as promising photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, the construction of COFs with new active sites, high photoactivity, and wide&#8208;range light absorption for efficient H2O2 production remains challenging. Herein, we present the synthesis of a novel azobenzene&#8208;bridged 2D COF (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo) with excellent performance on photocatalytic H2O2 production under alkaline conditions. Notably, although COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo differs by only one atom (&#8722;N=N&#8722; vs. &#8722;C=N&#8722;) from its corresponding imine&#8208;linked counterpart (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA), COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo exhibits a significantly narrower band gap, enhanced charge transport, and prompted photoactivity. Remarkably, when employed as a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst, COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo achieves a high photocatalytic H2O2 production rate up to 1498&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at pH = 11, which is 7.9&#8197;times higher than that of COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the &#8722;N=N&#8722; linkages are the active sites for photocatalysis. This work provides new prospects for developing high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Scalable Production of Thin and Durable Practical Li Metal Anode for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

A practical thin (10&#8211;40&#8197;&#956;m) Li/Mo/Li2Se anode with concurrently modulated interphase and mechanical properties was achieved via a scalable mechanical rolling process. The Li/Mo/Li2Se demonstrates ultrahigh&#8208;rate performance and ultralong&#8208;lifespan cycling sustainability. The Li|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells deliver enhanced cycling stability with a superior energy density of 329.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 even under the harsh cycling conditions.







Abstract
Utilization of thin Li metal is the ultimate pathway to achieving practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries (LMBs), but its practical implementation has been significantly impeded by formidable challenges of poor thinning processability, severe interphase instability and notorious dendritic Li growth. Here we report a practical thin (10&#8211;40&#8197;&#956;m) Li/Mo/Li2Se with concurrently modulated interphase and mechanical properties, achieved via a scalable mechanical rolling process. The in situ generated Li2Se and Mo not only enhance the mechanical strength enabling the scalable fabrication of thin Li metal, but also promote homogeneous Li electrodeposition. Significantly, the Li/Mo/Li2Se demonstrates ultrahigh&#8208;rate performance (15&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and ultralong&#8208;lifespan cycling sustainability (2700&#8197;cycles) with exceptional anti&#8208;pulverization capability. The Li|LiFePO4 cells show substantially prolonged cyclability over 1200&#8197;cycles with an ultralow decay rate of ~0.01&#8201;% per cycle. Moreover, the Li|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells deliver enhanced cycling stability even under the extremely harsh conditions of low negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive&#8208;capacity (N/P) ratio of ~1.2 and lean electrolyte of ~0.95&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, showing an exceptional energy density of 329.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This work sheds light on facile pathway for scalable production of durable thin Li metal anode toward reliable practicability.

         <title>Multifunctional Modification of the Buried Interface in Mixed Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regulating the buried interface is crucial for perovskite crystallization and charge transport. An innovative approach, using hydroxylamine salts for interface modification precisely anchors perovskite ions, promoting controlled crystal growth. This approach significantly enhances the efficiency and long&#8208;term stability of Sn&#8722;Pb perovskite solar cells, critical for future development of all&#8208;perovskite tandems.







Abstract
Mixed tin&#8208;lead perovskite solar cells can reach band gaps as low as 1.2&#8197;eV, offering high theoretical efficiency and serving as base materials for all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, instability and high defect densities at the interfaces, particularly the buried surface, have limited performance improvements. In this work, we present the modification of the bottom perovskite interface with multifunctional hydroxylamine salts. These salts can effectively coordinate the different perovskite components, having critical influences in regulating the crystallization process and passivating defects of varying nature. The surface modification reduced traps at the interface and prevented the formation of excessive lead iodide, enhancing the quality of the films. The modified devices presented fill factors reaching 81&#8201;% and efficiencies of up to 23.8&#8201;%. The unencapsulated modified devices maintained over 95&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 2000&#8197;h of shelf storage.

         <title>Fused Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Porphyrin Conjugates with Tailorable Excited&#8208;State Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of three novel C&#8722;C bond&#8208;fused porphyrin&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) conjugates is presented. By connecting the aromatic systems of the macrocycles via 5&#8208;membered rings under standard Scholl conditions, the formation of highly soluble and stable &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins is achieved. The described planarization led to significant alterations regarding the photophysical and optoelectronic characteristics of the molecules.







Abstract
A new clear&#8208;cut strategy for fusing N&#8208;heterocyclic and carbon&#8208;pure systems is introduced en route to a versatile platform of multi&#8208;purpose tetrapyrrolic chromophores. In particular, three novel C&#8722;C bond&#8208;fused porphyrin&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) conjugates were synthesized under oxidative cyclodehydrogenation conditions, starting from tailor&#8208;made nickel porphyrin precursors. The fusion of the individual aromatic systems via 5&#8208;membered rings led to highly soluble &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins in excellent yields. The resulting porphyrin&#8208;HBC conjugates exhibit absorption cross&#8208;sections that are of interdisciplinary interest in the ever&#8208;growing field of organic photovoltaics and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. Quantum chemical calculations show that the newly formed 5&#8208;membered rings induce biradicaloid character in the porphyrin core, which has a strong impact on excited state lifetimes. This is confirmed by a thorough optoelectronic and time&#8208;resolved characterization in order to understand these unique features better. Broadened absorption characteristics go hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with short&#8208;lived excited states with up to six orders of magnitude faster decay rates.

         <title>S&#8722;S Bond Strategy at Sulfide Heterointerface: Reversing Charge Transfer and Constructing Hydrogen Spillover for Boosted Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

RuSx/NbS2 heterostructure was synthesized by the introducing of amorphous RuSx onto crystalline NbS2 surface. It shows a Pt&#8208;like HER activity with a low overpotential as 38&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is mainly benefit from hydrogen spillover caused by reversing charge transfer that induced by S&#8722;S bonds at RuSx/NbS2 heterointerface.







Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalyst in sulfides for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) still poses challenges due to the lack of understanding the role of sulfide heterointerface. Here, we report a sulfide heterostructure RuSx/NbS2, which is composed of 3R&#8208;type NbS2 loaded by amorphous RuSx nanoparticles with S&#8722;S bonds formed at the interface. As HER electrocatalyst, the RuSx/NbS2 shows remarkable low overpotential of 38&#8197;mV to drive a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acid, and also low Tafel slope of 51.05&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The intrinsic activity of RuSx/NbS2 is much higher than that of Ru/NbS2 reference as well as the commercial Pt/C. Both experiments and theoretical calculations unveil a reversed charge transfer at the interface from NbS2 to RuSx that driven by the formation of S&#8722;S bonds, resulting in electron&#8208;rich Ru configuration for strong hydrogen adsorption. Meanwhile, electronic redistribution induced by the sulfide heterostructure facilitates hydrogen spillover (HSo) effect in this system, leading to accelerated hydrogen desorption at the basal plane of NbS2. This study provides an effective S&#8722;S bond strategy in sulfide heterostructure to synergistically modulate the charge transfer and adsorption thermodynamics, which is very valuable for the development of efficient electrocatalysts in practical applications.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Promoted Interatomic Hot Carriers Regulation Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LSPR effect can efficiently promote interatomic transfer of plasmon hot carriers and the extra hot electrons transferred on Cu atoms from Au atoms effectively enhance the desorption of ammonia molecules, thereby accelerating the ENRR. This study provides an important reference for understanding the distribution and mechanism of plasmon hot carriers on the surface of alloy heterogeneous nanostructure.







Abstract
Utilizing hot carriers for efficient plasmon&#8208;mediated chemical reactions (PMCRs) to convert solar energy into secondary energy is one of the most feasible solutions to the global environmental and energy crisis. Finding a plasmonic heterogeneous nanostructure with a more efficient and reasonable hot carrier transport path without affecting the intrinsic plasmonic properties is still a major challenge that urgently needs to be solved in this field. Herein, the mechanism by which plasmon&#8208;promoted interatomic hot electron redistribution on the surface of Au3Cu alloy nanoparticles promotes the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) is successfully clarified. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect can boost the transfer of plasmon hot electrons from Au atoms to Cu atoms, trigger the interatomic electron regulation of Au3Cu alloy nanoparticles, enhance the desorption of ammonia molecules, and increase the ammonia yield by approximately 93.9&#8201;%. This work provides an important reference for rationally designing and utilizing the LSPR effect to efficiently regulate the distribution and mechanism of plasmon hot carriers on the surface of heterogeneous alloy nanostructures.

         <title>Highly Dispersed Pd@ZIF&#8208;8&#8201;for Photo&#8208;Assisted Cross&#8208;Couplings and CO2 to Methanol: Activity and Selectivity Insights</title>

A commercially available ZIF&#8208;8 metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) was used to deposit palladium, demonstrating excellent performance in photocatalysis and thermal CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reactions under various pre&#8208;treatment conditions.







Abstract
Our study unveils a pioneering methodology that effectively distributes Pd species within a zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8). We demonstrate that Pd can be encapsulated within ZIF&#8208;8 as atomically dispersed Pd species that function as an excited&#8208;state transition metal catalyst for promoting carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) cross&#8208;couplings at room temperature using visible light as the driving force. Furthermore, the same material can be reduced at 250&#8201;&#176;C, forming Pd metal nanoparticles encapsulated in ZIF&#8208;8. This catalyst shows high rates and selectivity for carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol under industrially relevant conditions (250&#8201;&#176;C, 50&#8197;bar): 7.46&#8197;molmethanol&#8201;molmetal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and &gt;99&#8201;%. Our results demonstrate the correlations of the catalyst structure with the performances at experimental and theoretical levels.

         <title>The Fate of the Formic Acid Proton on the Anatase TiO2(101) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High vacuum FTIR experiments at temperatures as low as 13&#8197;K, together with divide&#8208;and&#8208;conquer semiclassical and path integral molecular dynamics simulations, indicate that a short and strong hydrogen bond is formed during the adsorption of HCOOH on the anatase (101) TiO2 surface. Such unusual H&#8208;bond has previously escaped direct spectral detection because of a huge red shift of its vibrational frequency.







Abstract
As a prototype adsorption reaction of gas Br&#248;nsted acid on oxides, we study the adsorption of formic acid on anatase. We perform infrared spectroscopy measurements of adsorbed HCOOH and HCOOD on TiO2 nanopowders, from 13&#8197;K up to room temperature in an ultra&#8208;high vacuum chamber. We assign the IR signals via computed spectra from nuclear quantum dynamics simulations using our divide&#8208;and&#8208;conquer semiclassical ab initio molecular dynamics method. The acid proton forms an extraordinarily short and strong hydrogen bond with the surface oxygen. The strength of this hydrogen bond, that compares to H bonds in ice at high pressures, is at the root of a substantial redshift with respect to the typical free OH stretching frequency, which eludes its straightforward detection.

         <title>Rationalizing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction over IrO2: Essential Role of Hydronium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydronium cation (H3O+) was found to be critical to regulating the observed behaviors of IrO2 during acidic oxygen evolution reaction. The H3O+ cation induced an internal electric field at the interface, enabling selective bond&#8208;tuning to the reaction intermediates. As a result, 0.5&#8197;monolayer of *OH species was stabilized under OER operational condition, and the overall conversion was revealed to be hindered by *OH&#8594;*O.







Abstract
The development of active, stable, and more affordable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great importance for the practical application of electrolyzers and the advancement of renewable energy conversion technologies. Currently, IrO2 is the only catalyst with high stability and activity, but a high cost. Further optimization of the catalyst is limited by the lack of understanding of catalytic behaviors at the acid&#8208;IrO2 interface. Here, in strong interaction with the experiment, we develop an explicit model based on grand&#8208;canonical density function theory (GC&#8208;DFT) calculations to describe acidic OER over IrO2. Compared to the explicit models reported previously, hydronium cations (H3O+) are introduced at the electrochemical interface in the current model. As a result, a variation in stable IrO2 surface configuration under the OER operating condition from previously proposed complete *O&#8208;coverage to a mixture coverage of *OH and *O is revealed, which is well supported by in situ Raman measurements. In addition, the accuracy of predicted overpotential is increased in comparison with the experimentally measured. More importantly, an alteration of the potential limiting step from previously identified *O&#8594;*OOH to *OH&#8594;*O is observed, which opens new opportunities to advance the IrO2&#8208;based catalysts for acidic OER.

         <title>Enantioconvergent and Site&#8208;Selective Etherification of Carbohydrate Polyols through Chiral Copper Radical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By harnessing a chiral radical copper catalytic system, the challenging enantioconvergent and site&#8208;selective etherification of carbohydrate polyols is achieved. Besides being broadly applicable over a considerable range of sugars, multiple dimensions of stereocontrol can be tackled simultaneously. Remarkably, when anomeric unprotected reducing sugars were employed, dynamic kinetic resolution is further activated to achieve &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation.







Abstract
Going beyond currently reported two electron transformations that formed the core backdrop of asymmetric catalytic site&#8208;selective carbohydrate polyol functionalizations, we herein report a seminal demonstration of an enantioconvergent copper catalyzed site&#8208;selective etherification of minimally protected saccharides through a single&#8208;electron radical pathway. Further, this strategy paves a rare strategy, through which a carboxamide scaffold that is present in some glycomimetics of pharmacological relevance, can be selectively introduced. In light of the burgeoning interest in chiral radical catalysis, and the virtual absence of such stereocontrol broadly in carbohydrate synthesis, our strategy showcased the unknown capability of chiral radical copper catalysis as a contemporary tool to address the formidable site&#8208;selectivity challenge on a remarkable palette of naturally occurring saccharides. When reducing sugars were employed, a further dynamic kinetic resolution type glycosylation can be activated by the catalytic system to selectively generate the challenging &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going beyond currently reported two electron transformations that formed the core backdrop of asymmetric catalytic site-selective carbohydrate polyol functionalizations, we herein report a seminal demonstration of an enantioconvergent copper catalyzed site-selective etherification of minimally protected saccharides through a single-electron radical pathway. Further, this strategy paves a rare strategy, through which a carboxamide scaffold that is present in some glycomimetics of pharmacological relevance, can be selectively introduced. In light of the burgeoning interest in chiral radical catalysis, and the virtual absence of such stereocontrol broadly in carbohydrate synthesis, our strategy showcased the unknown capability of chiral radical copper catalysis as a contemporary tool to address the formidable site-selectivity challenge on a remarkable palette of naturally occurring saccharides. When reducing sugars were employed, a further dynamic kinetic resolution type glycosylation can be activated by the catalytic system to selectively generate the challenging &#946;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glycosides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Charge&#8208;Carrier Dynamics and Efficient Photoelectrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion on Antimony Sulfide&#8208;Based Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

This work integrates a CuSn alloy&#8208;modified CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 photocathode for efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. The photocathode possesses an excellent onset potential of 0.62&#8197;VRHE, achieves the highest ammonia Faraday efficiency of 97.82&#8201;% with a yields up to 16.96&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;VRHE. The excellent charge carrier kinetics and moderate NO2&#8722; adsorption provide an effective strategy for achieving stable and efficient photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
The photoelectrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (PEC NO3RR) has emerged as a promising pathway for facilitating the natural nitrogen cycle. The PEC NO3RR can lower the reduction potential needed for ammonia synthesis through photogenerated voltage, showcasing the significant potential for merging abundant solar energy with sustainable nitrogen fixation. However, it is influenced by the selective photocathodes with poor carrier kinetics, low catalytic selectivity, and ammonia yields. There are few reports on suitable photoelectrodes owning efficient charge transport on PEC NO3RR at low overpotentials. Herein, we rationally constructed the CuSn alloy co&#8208;catalysts on the antimony sulfides with a highly selective PEC ammonia and an ultra&#8208;low onset potential (0.62&#8197;VRHE). CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 photoelectrodes achieved an ammonia faradic efficiency of 97.82&#8201;% at a low applied potential of 0.4&#8197;VRHE, and an ammonia yield of 16.96&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;VRHE under one sun illumination. Dynamics experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 has an enhanced charge separation and transfer efficiency, facilitating photogenerated electrons to participate in PEC NO3RR quickly. Meanwhile, moderate NO2* adsorption on this photocathode optimizes the catalytic activity and increases the NH4+ yield. This work opens an avenue for designing sulfide&#8208;based photocathodes for the efficient route of solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion.

         <title>Navigating Ball Mill Specifications for Theory&#8208;to&#8208;Practice Reproducibility in Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commonly reported parameters such as time, rpm, and ball mass are often insufficient to replicate mechanochemical syntheses accurately. By demonstrating that reaction outcomes are tied to the cumulative total energy, we can enhance the reproducibility of mechanochemical reactions across various laboratory mills, including planetary and mixer mills. To aid in this, we offer a free online calculator to compute and report all necessary parameters.







Abstract
The rising prospects of mechanochemically assisted syntheses hold promise for both academia and industry, yet they face challenges in understanding and, therefore, anticipating respective reaction kinetics. Particularly, dependencies based on variations in milling equipment remain little understood and globally overlooked. This study aims to address this issue by identifying critical parameters through kinematic models, facilitating the reproducibility of mechanochemical reactions across the most prominent mills in laboratory settings, namely planetary and mixer mills. Through a series of selected experiments replicating major classes of organic, organometallic, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, and inorganic reactions from literature, we rationalize the independence of kinematic parameters on reaction kinetics when the accumulated energy criterion is met. As a step forward and to facilitate the practicability of our findings, we provide a freely accessible online tool[&#8224;] that allows the calculation of respective energy parameters for different planetary and mixer mills. Our work advances the current understanding of mechanochemistry and lays the foundation for future rational exploration in this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Mitigating the Kinetic Hysteresis of Co&#8208;Free Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes via Gradient Penetration of Nonmagnetic Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synergistic tuning of lattice magnetic fields and interfacial structure stability, this work provides a green, efficient, and universal strategy of Si gradient doping to overcome the kinetic hysteresis problems that have long&#8208;term hindered the development of Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials.







Abstract
Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are considered a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and high capacity. However, they still suffer from the practical challenges of low discharge capacity and poor rate capability due to the hysteresis of Li&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics. Herein, based on the regulation of the lattice magnetic frustration, the Li/Ni intermixing defects as the primary origin of kinetic hysteresis are radically addressed via the doping of the nonmagnetic Si element. Meanwhile, by adopting gradient penetration doping, a robust Si&#8722;O surface structure with reversible lattice oxygen evolution and low lattice strain is constructed on Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathodes to suppress the formation of surface dense barrier layer. With the remarkably enhanced Li&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics in atomic and electrode particle scales, the as&#8208;obtained cathodes (LiNixMn1&#8722;xSi0.01O2, 0.6&#8804;x&#8804;0.9) achieve superior performance in discharge capacity, rate capability, and durability. This work highlights the coupling effect of magnetic structure and interfacial chemicals on Li&#8208;ion transport properties, and the concept will inspire more researchers to conduct an intensive study.

         <title>Engineering the Substrate Specificity of UDP&#8208;Glycosyltransferases for Synthesizing Triterpenoid Glycosides with a Linear Trisaccharide as Aided by Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

UDP&#8208;glycosyltransferase UGT91H enzymes for the regioselective 2&#8220;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation of triterpenoids to generate triterpenoid glycosides with a linear trisaccharide are described. Ancestral sequence reconstruction was successfully applied to expand the substrate scope of UGT91H enzymes, and an RTAS loop was identified to affect the substrate specificity of UGT91H enzymes.







Abstract
Triterpenoids have wide applications in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. The glycosylation of triterpenoids catalyzed by UDP&#8208;glycosyltransferases (UGTs) is a crucial method for producing valuable derivatives with enhanced functions. However, only a few UDP&#8208;glucosyltransferases have been reported to synthesize the rare triterpenoids with linear&#8208;chain trisaccharide at C3&#8722;OH. This study revealed that the UGT91H subfamily primarily contributed to the 2&#8220;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation of triterpenoids with high regioselectivity, then the substrate scope was further expanded by ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR). With ancestral enzyme UGT91H_A1 as a model, the sequence&#8208;structure&#8208;function relationship was explored. A RTAS loop (R212/T213/A214/S215) was identified to affect the substrate specificity of UGT91H_A1. Transferring this RTAS loop to the corresponding position of UGT91H enzymes successfully expanded their substrate spectra. The functional role of RTAS loop was further elucidated by molecular dynamics simulation and quantum mechanical computation. UGT91H_A1 was applied to the low&#8208;cost synthesis of terpenoid rhamnosides with a linear trisaccharide in combining with a self&#8208;sufficient UDP&#8208;rhamnose regeneration system. Finally, we developed a phylogeny&#8208;based platform to efficiently mining new UGT91Hs from plant genomic data. This study provided robust biocatalysts for synthesizing various triterpenoid glycosides with a linear trisaccharide and demonstrated ASR as an efficient tool in engineering the function of UDP&#8208;glycosyltransferases.

Transferring this RTAS loop to the corresponding position of UGT91H enzymes successfully expanded their substrate spectra. The functional role of RTAS loop was further elucidated by molecular dynamics simulation and quantum mechanical computation. UGT91H_A1 was applied to the low-cost synthesis of terpenoid rhamnosides with a linear trisaccharide in combining with a self-sufficient UDP-rhamnose regeneration system. Finally, we developed a phylogeny-based platform to efficiently mining new UGT91Hs from plant genomic data. This study provided robust biocatalysts for synthesizing various triterpenoid glycosides with a linear trisaccharide and demonstrated ASR as an efficient tool in engineering the function of UDP-glycosyltransferases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component vinylene&#8208;linked D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A copper&#8208;cyclic trinuclear units (Cu&#8208;CTUs)&#8208;based metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF) with reinforced intramolecular charge separation driving force was designed and prepared, achieving highly&#8208;efficient charge spatial separation efficiency and photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. The Cu&#8208;CTUs active sites can effectively adsorb and activate CO2 to further enhance photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Intramolecular charge separation driving force and linkage chemistry between building blocks are critical factors for enhancing the photocatalytic performance of metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF) based photocatalyst. However, robust achieving both simultaneously has yet to be challenging despite ongoing efforts. Here we develop a fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated vinylene&#8208;linked multivariate donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor MCOF (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A, termed UJN&#8208;1) by integrating benzyl cyanides linker with multiple functional building blocks of electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine and electron&#8208;deficient copper&#8208;cyclic trinuclear units (Cu&#8208;CTUs) moieties, featuring with strong intramolecular charge separation driving force, extended conjugation degree of skeleton, and abundant active sites. The incorporation of Cu&#8208;CTUs acceptor with electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and concomitantly giant charge separation driving force can efficiently accelerate the photogenerated electrons transfer from triphenylamine to Cu&#8208;CTUs, revealing by experiments and theoretical calculations. Benefiting from the synergistically effect of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A configuration and vinylene linkage, the highly&#8208;efficient charge spatial separation is achieved. Consequently, UJN&#8208;1 exhibits an excellent CO formation rate of 114.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 4&#8197;h without any co&#8208;catalysts or sacrificial reagents under visible light, outperforming those analogous MCOFs with imine&#8208;linked (UJN&#8208;2, 28.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and vinylene&#8208;linked COF without Cu&#8208;CTU active sites (UJN&#8208;3, 50.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1), emphasizing the role of charge separation driving force and linkage chemistry in designing novel COFs&#8208;based photocatalyst.

         <title>High Performance Memristors Based on Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks Obtained Using a Protonation Modification Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protonation&#8208;modification strategy has been employed to modify imine&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type covalent organic frameworks (COFs), significantly improving the electron delocalization capabilities of the imine bonds and constructing advanced memory devices. The obtained novel COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT@PTSA thin film&#8208;based rewritable memristors exhibit high ON/OFF current ratio (ca. 105) and unprecedented endurance (more than 1300 number of cycles).







Abstract
Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are garnering substantial interest in resistive random&#8208;access memory, attributed to their superior crystallinity, excellent chemical and thermal stability, and modifiable molecular structures. However, the development of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based memristors impeded by challenges such as low conjugation degree of imine bonds and poor electron delocalization ability. Herein, we report a protonation strategy to modify the imine bonds of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type COFs. This modification significantly enhances the electron delocalization capability of imine bonds, lowers the energy barriers for electron injection from electrodes, and stabilizes the conductive charge transfer state, thus markedly improving device performance. The protonated COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;BPy and COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT thin films&#8208;based memristors show remarkable device performance with a high ON/OFF current ratio of 105, a low driving voltage, and outstanding endurance exceeding 600 and 1300&#8197;cycles, respectively, which is nearly twice the durability of analogous non&#8208;protonated COFs&#8208;based memristors. Notably, the protonated COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT&#8208;based memristor exhibit the highest number of cycles reported at present. This work not only unprecedentedly enhances the performance of COF&#8208;based memristors, but also provides a universal and promising approach for the molecular design and potential application of D&#8208;A type imine&#8208;linked COFs.

         <title>A Supramolecular Deep Eutectic Electrolyte Enhancing Interfacial Stability and Solution Phase Discharge in Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed supramolecular deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) based on LiTFSI, acetamide and boric acid, improving the oxidation voltage up to 4.5&#8197;V, and enhancing the solution phase discharge mechanism by forming Li&#8208;bonds and H&#8208;bonds with Li+ and O2&#8722;. The introduction of boric acid also promotes the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, which induces Li+ uniform deposition. The Li&#8722;O2 battery with this DEE delivers ultrahigh discharge capacity, improved cycling performance and intrinsic safety.







Abstract
Li&#8722;O2 batteries (LOBs) have gained widespread recognition for their exceptional energy densities. However, a major challenge faced by LOBs is the lack of appropriate electrolytes that can effectively balance reactant transport, interfacial compatibility, and non&#8208;volatility. To address this issue, a novel supramolecular deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) has been developed, based on synergistic interaction between Li&#8208;bonds and H&#8208;bonds through a combination of lithium salt (LiTFSI), acetamide (Ace) and boric acid (BA). The incorporation of BA serves as an interface modification additive, acting as both Li&#8208;bonds acceptor and H&#8208;bonds donor/acceptor, thereby enhancing the redox stability of the electrolyte, facilitating a solution phase discharge process and improving compatibility with the Li anode. Our proposed DEE demonstrates a high oxidation voltage of 4.5&#8197;V, an ultrahigh discharge capacity of 15225&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and stable cycling performance of 196&#8197;cycles in LOBs. Additionally, the intrinsic non&#8208;flammability and successful operation of a Li&#8722;O2 pouch cell indicate promising practical applications of this electrolyte. This research broadens the design possibilities for LOBs electrolytes and provides theoretical insights for future studies.

         <title>The Impact of Supersaturated Electrode on Heterogeneous Lithium Nucleation and Growth Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces new insights into the heterogeneous lithium nucleation and growth dynamics that directly influence the performance of lithium metal anodes (LMAs). It reveals that high&#8208;performance electrodes for LMAs, characterized by a high active lithium adsorption capacity and fast surface diffusion kinetics, can be defined as &#8242;supersaturated electrodes.







Abstract
The concept of a lithiophilic electrode proves inadequate in describing carbon&#8208;based electrode materials due to their substantial mismatch in surface energy with lithium metal. However, their notable capacity for lithium chemisorption can increase active lithium concentration required for nucleation and growth, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of lithium metal anodes (LMAs). In this study, we elucidate the effects of the supersaturated electrode which has high active lithium capacity around equilibrium lithium potential on LMAs through an in&#8208;depth electrochemical comparison using two distinct carbon electrode platforms with differing carbon structures but similar two&#8208;dimensional morphologies. In the supersaturated electrode, both the dynamics and thermodynamic states involved in lithium nucleation and growth mechanisms are significantly improved, particularly under continuous current supply conditions. Furthermore, the chemical structures of the solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface layers (SEIs) are greatly influenced by the elevated surface lithium concentration environment, resulting in the formation of more conductive lithium&#8208;rich SEI layers. The improved dynamics and thermodynamics of surface lithium, coupled with the formation of enhanced SEI layers, contribute to higher power capabilities, enhanced Coulombic efficiencies, and improved cycling performances of LMAs. These results provide new insight into understanding the enhancements in heterogeneous lithium nucleation and growth kinetics on the supersaturated electrode.

In the supersaturated electrode, both the dynamics and thermodynamic states involved in lithium nucleation and growth mechanisms are significantly improved, particularly under continuous current supply conditions. Furthermore, the chemical structures of the solid-electrolyte-interface layers (SEIs) are greatly influenced by the elevated surface lithium concentration environment, resulting in the formation of more conductive lithium-rich SEI layers. The improved dynamics and thermodynamics of surface lithium, coupled with the formation of enhanced SEI layers, contribute to higher power capabilities, enhanced Coulombic efficiencies, and improved cycling performances of LMAs. These results provide new insight into understanding the enhancements in heterogeneous lithium nucleation and growth kinetics on the supersaturated electrode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantifying Interface&#8208;Performance Relationships in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction through Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Assembly of Nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;Nanowire Superstructures</title>

A versatile mixed&#8208;dimensional assembly approach is proposed to construct nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;nanowire superstructures with accurately tailored biphasic interfaces. Using Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures as a model catalyst for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, this work establishes a logarithmic linear relationship between catalytic activity and the number of Au/Ag interfaces per unit mass of the catalyst.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning the interfacial sites within heterogeneous catalysts is pivotal for unravelling the intricate structure&#8211;property relationship and optimizing their catalytic performance. Herein, a simple and versatile mixed&#8208;dimensional assembly approach is proposed to create nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;nanowire superstructures with precisely adjustable numbers of biphasic interfaces. This method leverages an efficient self&#8208;assembly process in which colloidal nanocrystals spontaneously organize onto Ag nanowires, driven by the solvophobic effect. Importantly, varying the ratio of the two components during assembly allows for accurate control over both the quantity and contact perimeter of biphasic interfaces. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a series of Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures with varying numbers of Au/Ag interfaces are constructed and employed as electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Experimental results reveal a logarithmic linear relationship between catalytic activity and the number of Au/Ag interfaces per unit mass of Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures. This work presents a straightforward approach for precise interface engineering, paving the way for systematic exploration of interface&#8208;dependent catalytic behaviors in heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term and Continuous Plasmonic Oligonucleotide Monitoring Enabled by Regeneration Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a method for long&#8208;term, continuous plasmonic biosensing of oligonucleotides with 5&#8208;minute temporal resolution by using regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach. A picomolar limit of detection (LoD) in both buffered and serum complexes is achieved, and reliable performance for over 100&#8197;measurements per day and stability over 9&#8197;days were demonstrated.







Abstract
The demand for continuous monitoring of biochemical markers for diagnostic purposes is increasing as it overcomes the limitations of traditional intermittent measurements. This study introduces a method for long&#8208;term, continuous plasmonic biosensing of oligonucleotides with high temporal resolution. Our method is based on a regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach that ensures rapid reversibility in less than 1&#8197;minute, allowing the sensor to fully reset after each measurement. We investigated label&#8208;free and AuNP enhancements for different dynamic ranges and sensitivities, achieving a limit of detection down to pM levels. We developed a regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach for continuous biosensing, optimizing buffer conditions using the Taguchi method to achieve rapid, consistent reversibility, ensuring reliable performance for long&#8208;term monitoring. We detected oligonucleotides in buffered and complex solutions, including undiluted and unfiltered human serum, for up to 100 sampling cycles in a day. Moreover, we showed the long&#8208;term stability of the sensor for monitoring capabilities in buffered solutions and human serum, with minimal signal value drift and excellent sensor reversibility for up to 9&#8197;days. Our method opens the door to new prospects in continuous biosensing by providing insights beyond intermittent measurements for numerous analytical and diagnostic applications.

         <title>A Strongly Coupled Metal/Hydroxide Heterostructure Cascades Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate Reduction Reactions toward Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strongly coupled metal/hydroxide heterostructure was constructed. The heterostructure provides dual&#8208;sites for carbon dioxide reduction and nitrate reduction reactions, and thus facilitate efficient C&#8722;N coupling toward urea formation. The obtained Ag&#8722;CuNi(OH)2 composite delivers greatly enhanced urea yield rate and Faradaic efficiency compared with individual Ag and CuNi(OH)2.







Abstract
The direct coupling of nitrate ions and carbon dioxide for urea synthesis presents an appealing alternative to the Bosch&#8211;Meiser process in industry. The simultaneous activation of carbon dioxide and nitrate, however, as well as efficient C&#8722;N coupling on single active site, poses significant challenges. Here, we propose a novel metal/hydroxide heterostructure strategy based on synthesizing an Ag&#8722;CuNi(OH)2 composite to cascade carbon dioxide and nitrate reduction reactions for urea electrosynthesis. The strongly coupled metal/hydroxide heterostructure interface integrates two distinct sites for carbon dioxide and nitrate activation, and facilitates the coupling of *CO (on silver, where * denotes an active site) and *NH2 (on hydroxide) for urea formation. Moreover, the strongly coupled interface optimizes the water splitting process and facilitates the supply of active hydrogen atoms, thereby expediting the deoxyreduction processes essential for urea formation. Consequently, our Ag&#8722;CuNi(OH)2 composite delivers a high urea yield rate of 25.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and high urea Faradaic efficiency of 46.1&#8201;%, as well as excellent cycling stability. This work provides new insights into the design of dual&#8208;site catalysts for C&#8722;N coupling, considering their role on the interface.

         <title>Suspension Bead Loading (SBL): An Economical Protein Delivery Platform to Study URM1&#8217;s Behavior in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

We have developed a &#8220;Suspension bead loading&#8221; (SBL) approach that serves as a general and economical delivery method to address fundamental biological questions. We applied SBL to investigate the cellular behavior of synthetic Ubiquitin related modifier&#8197;1 (URM1) under normal and oxidative stress conditions. Created with BioRender.com.







Abstract
Uniquely modified synthetic proteins are difficult to produce in large quantities, which could limit their use in various in vitro settings and in cellular studies. In this study, we developed a method named &#8220;suspension bead loading&#8221; (SBL), to deliver protein molecules into suspended living cells using glass beads, which significantly reduces the amount of protein required for effective delivery. We investigated the delivery efficiency of functionally different proteins and evaluated the cytotoxic effect of our method and the chemical and functional integrity of the delivered protein. We utilized SBL to address questions related to ubiquitin&#8208;related modifier&#8197;1 (URM1). Employing minimal protein quantities, SBL has enabled us to study its behavior within live cells under different redox conditions, including subcellular localization and conjugation patterns. We demonstrate that oxidative stress alters both the localization and conjugation pattern of URM1 in cells, highlighting its possible role in cellular response to such extreme conditions.

We present a hydrogen isotope exchange reaction using non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis. The catalytic system relies on a commercially available pyridine ligand that enables aromatic C&#8722;H activation. Labelling of 39 pharmaceuticals was achieved by utilizing D2O as the deuterium source and solvent, without requiring fluorinated cosolvents. Expansion to T/H exchange on three different pharmaceuticals by using T2O as isotopic source was demonstrated.







Abstract
Deuterated and tritiated analogs of drugs are valuable compounds for pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. In this work, we present a novel hydrogen isotope exchange reaction of drugs using non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis. Aromatic C&#8722;H activation is achieved by a commercially available pyridine ligand. Using the most convenient and cheapest deuterium source, D2O, as the only solvent 39&#8197;pharmaceuticals were labelled with clean reaction profiles and high deuterium uptakes. Additionally, we describe the first application of non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis for H/T exchange on three different pharmaceuticals by using T2O as isotopic source, demonstrating the applicability to the synthesis of radiotracers.

         <title>Unlocking the Anion Effect on Steerable Production of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We first proposed the anion effect on steerable production of HMF using metal salts with different anions as catalyst in a biphasic system of THF/NaCl aq, which is attributed to the proximity effect and electron tension. The anion promotes electron transfer through proximity effects and also induces a decrease in the electron cloud density of glucose carbon atoms, generating electron tension, thereby increasing the HMF yield.







Abstract
Homogeneous metal salt catalysts play a pivotal role in industrial production of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Herein, we first proposed the anion effect on steerable production of HMF using metal salts with different anions as catalyst in a biphasic system of tetrahydrofuran (THF)/NaCl aqueous solution (NaCl aq). Notably, the anions affected the catalytic activity of the metal salts, leading to an order of magnitude difference in the HMF yields, i.e., AlBr3 (74.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%)&gt;AlCl3 (60.8&#8197;mol&#8201;%)&gt;Al2(SO4)3 (35.2&#8197;mol&#8201;%)&gt;Al(NO3)3 (14.9&#8197;mol&#8201;%). The anion effect on steerable production of HMF could be attributed to the proximity effect and electron tension. Anions form close&#8208;range interactions with glucose molecules by proximity effect to promote electron transfer, facilitating the isomerization of glucose to fructose. Besides, anions induce a reduction of the electron cloud density of glucose carbon atoms, generating electron tension that rapidly transforms glucose from the ground state to the transition state, thereby increasing the HMF yield. Based on the revelation of anions effect and evaluation of techno&#8208;economic process, we expect to provides theoretical guidance for high&#8208;throughput screening of metal salt catalysts in industrial biorefinery.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Sodium Ion Batteries Enabled by Switching Sodiophobic Graphite into Sodiophilic and High&#8208;Capacity Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodiophobic graphite can be converted to sodiophilic graphite intercalation compounds through solvated&#8208;sodium&#8208;ion co&#8208;intercalation mechanisms, thus facilitating dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal plating/stripping with enhanced Coulombic efficiencies. This finding propels the achievement of cost&#8208;effective and high capacity anodes for advanced sodium ion batteries with energy densities of above 250&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Owing to the crustal abundance of sodium element, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered a promising complementary to lithium&#8208;ion battery for stationary energy storage applications. The cointercalation chemistry enables the use of cost&#8208;effective graphite as anodes, whereas the low capacity (&lt;130&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and high redox potential (&gt;0.6&#8197;V vs. Na/Na+) of graphite significantly limit the energy density of SIBs. Herein, we induce the high&#8208;capacity Na metal into sodiophilic ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t&#8208;GICs) via co&#8208;intercalation and deposition reactions, thereby achieving Na/t&#8208;GIC anodes with high capacities and low working voltage (0.18&#8197;V). The new anodes exhibit high coulombic efficiencies of above 99.7&#8201;% over 550&#8197;cycles and a high&#8208;rate capacity of 588.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 6&#8197;C (10&#8197;min per charge). When it is paired with Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathodes, the SIBs demonstrate a high energy density of 259&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1both electrodes surpassing that of commercial LiFePO4//graphite batteries. The outstanding anode performance is attributed to the tailored sodiophilicity of graphite through manipulating the ether solvents and the in situ generated space among t&#8208;GIC flakes to stably accommodate Na metal. Our findings for stable Na plating/striping on sodiophilic graphite materials provide an effective approach for developing advanced SIBs.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Dependent Lipopeptide Antibiotics against Drug&#8208;Resistant Pathogens Discovered via Host&#8208;Dependent Heterologous Expression of a Cloned Biosynthetic Gene Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ambocidins are calcium&#8208;dependent lipopeptide antibiotics with a unique peptide core that are active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Heterologous expression of their biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in multiple hosts resulted in production of new metabolites. However, only one heterologous host was capable of supporting production of the ambocidins. The ambocidins bind lipid II at a site distinct from the target of vancomycin.







Abstract
Historically, small molecules biosynthesised by bacteria have been an excellent source for antibacterial drugs. Today, however, the rediscovery of known compounds is a significant hurdle to developing new antimicrobials. Here we use a genome mining and synthetic biology approach to discover the ambocidins: calcium&#8208;dependent lipodepsipeptides that are active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. By cloning a silent biosynthetic gene cluster (the amb cluster) from Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC 2387 and integrating this into the chromosome of Streptomyces avermitilis we induce expression of ambocidin A and B: two new N&#1013;&#8208;hydroxyarginine&#8208;containing cyclic lipodepsipeptides active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Using a panel of Streptomyces host strains, we show that the choice of heterologous host is critical for producing the biologically active compounds, and that inappropriate host choice leads to aberrant production inactive derivatives. We show that N&#1013;&#8208;hydroxyarginine is the product of a heme&#8208;dependent oxygenase and that it enhances biological activity. Ambocidin A inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by binding to Lipid II at a different site than vancomycin. Furthermore, unlike daptomycin, ambocidin A retains potent antimicrobial activity in the presence of lung surfactant, giving it the potential to treat bacterial pneumonia. Our work expands the family of calcium&#8208;dependent lipopeptide antibiotics with a new member exhibiting a distinct mechanism of action.

This work reports a high&#8208;voltage p&#8208;type organic cathode material of DHTAT for application in aqueous zinc batteries, exhibiting a high capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. After 5000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the DHTAT electrode retains 73&#8201;% of its initial capacity, indicating promising cycling stability. Additionally, DHTAT also exhibits good low&#8208;temperature performance and can stably cycle at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C for 4000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, making it a competitive candidates cathode material for low&#8208;temperature batteries.







Abstract
P&#8208;type organic cathode materials typically exhibit high redox potentials and fast redox kinetics, presenting broad application prospects in aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs). However, most of the reported p&#8208;type organic cathode materials exhibit limited capacity (&lt;100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), which is attributable to the low mass content ratio of oxidation&#8208;reduction active functional groups in these materials. Herein, we report a high&#8208;capacity p&#8208;type organic material, 5,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraazatetracene (DHTAT), for aqueous zinc batteries. Both experiments and calculation indicate the charge storage of DHTAT mainly involves the adsorption/desorption of ClO4&#8722; on the &#8722;NH&#8722; group. Benefitting from the high mass content ratio of the &#8722;NH&#8722; group in DHATA molecule, the DHATA electrode demonstrates a remarkable capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a stable voltage of 1.12&#8197;V. Notably, after 5000&#8197;cycles at a high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, DHTAT retains 73&#8201;% of its initial capacity, showing a promising cycling stability. In addition, DHTAT also has good low&#8208;temperature performance and can stably cycle at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C for 4000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, making it a competitive candidates cathode material for low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>Living Hybrid Exciton Materials: Enhanced Fluorescence and Chiroptical Properties in Living Supramolecular Polymers with Strong Frenkel/Charge&#8208;Transfer Exciton Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetrically L/D&#8208;glutamate&#8208;derived PDIs having linear alkyl chains exhibit living supramolecular polymerization in thermodynamically stable chiral molecular orientation, which shows the coupling of Frenkel and charge transfer exciton states, resulting in significantly enhanced fluorescence quantum yield, CD and CPL properties. Meanwhile, PDIs with branched chains only show common H&#8208;aggregates. Thus, molecular control on living hybrid exciton nanomaterials is achieved.







Abstract
A family of chiral perylene diimides (PDIs) was newly developed as excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. They are asymmetrically derivatized with a double&#8208;alkyl&#8208;chained L&#8208; or D&#8208;glutamate unit and a linear or branched alkyl chain. When water is added to the tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of glutamate&#8208;PDI&#8208;linear&#8208;alkyl chain compounds, kinetically formed H&#8208;aggregates are formed in globular nanoparticles (NPs). These NPs undergo spontaneous transformation into thermodynamically stable nanotubes via helical nanostructures, which showed structured broad spectra originating from the strong coupling of delocalized Frenkel excitations (FE) and charge transfer excitations (CTE). Significant enhancement of circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence quantum yield, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) are observed during the transformation of NPs to the FE/CTE&#8208;coupled helical and tubular structures. This transformation process is significantly accelerated by applying physical stimuli, i.e., ultrasonication or adding helical aggregates as seed crystals, a feature unique to living supramolecular polymerization. Meanwhile, the branched chain&#8208;containing PDIs only form H&#8208;aggregates and did not show FE/CTE hybrid exciton states with living supramolecular polymerization properties. This study unveils that suitably designed chiral PDI derivatives show FE/CTE coupling accompanied by high fluorescence quantum yields, enhanced chiroptical properties, and supramolecular living polymerization characteristics.

         <title>Redox Activity and Potentials of Bidentate N&#8208;Ligands Commonly Applied in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report establishes the redox activity of biOx (bi&#8208;oxazoline), biIm (bi&#8208;imidazoline), and pyIm (pyridine&#8208;imidazoline) ligands in stabilizing nickel radical complexes. Direct comparison of the redox potentials of bidentate N&#8208;ligands provides crucial benchmarks for controlling catalytic activity and enhancing catalyst stability.







Abstract
Bidentate N&#8208;ligands are paramount to recent advances in nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Through comprehensive organometallic, spectroscopic, and computational studies on bi&#8208;oxazoline and imidazoline ligands, we reveal that a square planar geometry enables redox activity of these ligands in stabilizing nickel radical species. This finding contrasts with the prior assumption that bi&#8208;oxazoline lacks redox activity due to strong mesomeric donation. Moreover, we conducted systematic cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses of bidentate pyridyl, oxazoline, and imidazoline nitrogen ligands, along with their corresponding nickel complexes. Complexation with nickel shifts the reduction potentials to a more positive region and narrows the differences in redox potentials among the ligands. Additionally, various ligands led to different degrees of bromide dissociation from singly reduced (L)Ni(Ar)(Br) complexes, reflecting varying reactivity in the subsequent activation of alkyl halides, a crucial step in cross&#8208;electrophile coupling. These insights highlight the significant electronic effects of ligands on the stability of metalloradical species and their redox potentials, which interplay with coordination geometry. Quantifying the electron&#8208;donating, &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of these ligands, as well as their effect on catalyst speciation, provides crucial benchmarks for controlling catalytic activity and enhancing catalyst stability.

         <title>Electrochemical Homo&#8208; and Crossannulation of Alkynes and Nitriles for the Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Synthesis of 3,6&#8208;Diarylpyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular Homo&#8208;couplings, but especially Cross&#8208;couplings are challenging! We reported an electrochemical [2+2+2] annulation of alkynes with nitriles using triarylamine as a redox mediator to form substituted pyridines. Our process demonstrates unprecedented control of chemoselectivity, allowing both homo&#8208; and heterocouplings of alkynes and nitriles. A mechanistic rationale is proposed, supported by CV, EPR, NMR, and computational studies.







Abstract
We disclose a mediated electrochemical [2+2+2] annulation of alkynes with nitriles, forming substituted pyridines in a single step from low&#8208;cost, readily available starting materials. The combination of electrochemistry and a triarylamine redox mediator obviates the requirements of transition metals and additional oxidants. Besides the formation of diarylpyridine moieties via the homocoupling of two identical alkynes, the heterocoupling of two different alkynes depending on their electronic nature is possible, highlighting the unprecedented control of chemoselectivity in this catalytic [2+2+2] process. Mechanistic investigations like cyclic voltammetry and crossover experiments combined with DFT calculations indicate the initial oxidation of an alkyne as the key step leading to the formation of a vinyl radical cation intermediate. The utilization of continuous flow technology proved instrumental for an efficient process scale&#8208;up. The utility of the products is exemplified by the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended molecules, being relevant for material or drug synthesis.

This work demonstrates that the capability of hole molecules to strengthen the interface bonding and interactions between molecules and interfaces is crucial to maximally passivate defects, affording robust interface, inhibition of ion migration, and photostable perovskite solar cells. Consequently, the newly developed mDPA&#8208;SFX enables cells with a PCE of 24.8&#8201;%, and an excellent T80 lifetime of 2,238&#8197;h at maximum power point tracking.







Abstract
Poor operational stability is a crucial factor limiting the further application of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Organic semiconductor layers can be a powerful means for reinforcing interfaces and inhibiting ion migration. Herein, two hole&#8208;transporting molecules, pDPA&#8208;SFX and mDPA&#8208;SFX, are synthesized with tuned substituent connection sites. The meta&#8208;substituted mDPA&#8208;SFX results in a larger dipole moment, more ordered packing, and better charge mobility than pDPA&#8208;SFX, accompanying with strong interface bonding on perovskite surfaces and suppressed ion motion as well. Importantly, mDPA&#8208;SFX&#8208;based PSCs exhibit an efficiency that has significantly increased from 22.5&#8201;% to 24.8&#8201;% and a module&#8208;based efficiency of 19.26&#8201;% with an active area of 12.95&#8197;cm2. The corresponding cell retain 94.8&#8201;% of its initial efficiency at maximum power point tracking (MPPT) after 1,000&#8197;h (T95=1,000&#8197;h). The MPPT T80 lifetime is as long as 2,238&#8197;h. This work illustrates that a small degree of structural variation in organic compounds leaves considerable room for developing new HTMs for light stable PSCs.

         <title>Experimental Observation of a Terminal Borylene&#8208;Dinitrogen Adduct via Cleavage of a 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;Diboratriazoline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of a doubly cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicyanodiborene with organic azides yields stable CAAC&#8208;iminoborane adducts. Experimental and computational data confirm the involvement of a relatively long&#8208;lived terminal borylene&#8208;dinitrogen adduct (i.e. diazoborane), [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)] as a key intermediate in the reaction.







Abstract
While azides do not react with simple alkenes except under harsh conditions, a diboron alkene analogue, the doubly cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicyanodiborene 1, reacts spontaneously with organic azides (7&#8211;10&#8197;equiv.) at room temperature to yield two equivalents of stable CAAC&#8208;imino(cyano)boranes (2&#8208;R). NMR&#8208;spectroscopic monitoring of the reaction mixtures shows the initial formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of 2&#8208;R and a relatively long&#8208;lived intermediate (Int), which in the presence of excess azide is converted into a second equivalent of 2&#8208;R. In the absence of excess azide, however, Int decomposes to 3, the product of an intramolecular C&#8722;H activation by a putative dicoordinate borylene intermediate &#8220;(CAAC)B(CN)&#8221;. Mechanistic insights from trapping experiments, NMR&#8208;spectroscopic and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry data, as well as DFT computations reveal that Int is the terminal borylene end&#8208;on&#8208;dinitrogen adduct [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)]. The formation of the iminoboranes 2&#8208;R from diborene 1 and RN3 proceeds via an azide&#8208;diborene Huisgen&#8208;type [3+2] cycloaddition reaction, followed by a retro&#8208;[3+2] cycloaddition, yielding 2&#8208;R and [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)]. The latter then undergoes either N2 extrusion and intramolecular C&#8722;H activation to generate 3, or a Staudinger&#8208;type reaction with a second equivalent of azide to generate a second equivalent of the iminoborane 2&#8208;R.

         <title>Ferroptosis Inducing Co(III) Polypyridine Sulfasalazine Complex for Therapeutically Enhanced Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting ferroptosis provides a novel avenue to overcome the limitations of apoptotic anticancer treatments. The Co(III) polypyridine sulfasalazine complex described here acts as a potent ferroptosis inducer for anticancer therapy. This complex selectively accumulates in mitochondria, generating reactive oxygen species, initiating lipid peroxidation, depleting glutathione, inhibiting glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4, and ultimately driving ferroptosis.







Abstract
Despite significant improvements in the treatment of cancerous tumors in the last decades, cancer remains one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. To overcome the shortcomings of currently applied chemotherapeutic treatments, much research efforts have been devoted towards the development of ferroptosis inducing anticancer agents. Ferroptosis is a newly described form of regulated, non&#8208;apoptotic cell death that is associated with high potential inside the clinics. Herein, the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of a Co(III) polypyridine sulfasalazine complex as a ferroptosis inducer is reported. Upon entering the cancerous cells, the metal complex primarily accumulated in the mitochondria, triggering the production of hydroxy radicals and lipid peroxides, ultimately causing cell death by ferroptosis. The compound demonstrated to eradicate various monolayer cancer cells as well as colon carcinoma multicellular tumor spheroids. To the best of our knowledge this study reports on the first example of a Co(III) complex that is capable of inducing ferroptosis.

An earth&#8208;abundant iron catalyst enabled efficient electrochemical recycling of post&#8208;consumer polystyrene with molecular hydrogen as the sole by&#8208;product, highlighting its potential for a circular carbon economy with a scalable green hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
Plastics are omnipresent in our everyday life, and accumulation of post&#8208;consumer plastic waste in our environment represents a major societal challenge. Hence, methods for plastic waste recycling are in high demand for a future circular economy. Specifically, the degradation of post&#8208;consumer polymers towards value&#8208;added small molecules constitutes a sustainable strategy for a carbon circular economy. Despite of recent advances, chemical polymer degradation continues to be largely limited to chemical redox agents or low energy efficiency in photochemical processes. We herein report a powerful iron&#8208;catalyzed degradation of high molecular weight polystyrenes through electrochemistry to efficiently deliver monomeric benzoyl products. The robustness of the ferraelectrocatalysis was mirrored by the degradation of various real&#8208;life post&#8208;consumer plastics, also on gram scale. The cathodic half reaction was largely represented by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The scalable electro&#8208;polymer degradation could be solely fueled by solar energy through a commercially available solar panel, indicating an outstanding potential for a decentralized green hydrogen economy.

         <title>Surface Tension Manipulation with Visible Light through Sensitized Disequilibration of Photoswitchable Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disequilibration by sensitization under confinement is used for the first time to modulate the surface tension of water with the aid of photoswitchable surfactants. Surfactants POS or NEG were encapsulated in a macrocyclic cage together with a photosensitizer so that irradiation with visible light (green or red) could induce isomerization and thus modify the surface tension based on the altered surface activity of the amphiphile.







Abstract
Azoarene isomerization lies at the heart of numerous applications, from catalysis or energy storage to photopharmacology. While efficient switching between their E and Z isomers predominantly relies on UV light, a recent study by Klajn and co&#8208;workers introduced visible light sensitization of E azoarenes and their subsequent isomerization as a tool coined disequilibration by sensitization under confinement (DESC) to obtain high yields of the Z isomer. This host&#8211;guest approach is, however, still constrained to minimally substituted azoarenes with limited applicability in advanced molecular systems. Herein, we expand DESC for the assembly of surfactants at the air&#8211;water interface. Leveraging our expertise with photoswitchable amphiphiles, we induce substantial alterations of the water surface tension through reversible arylazopyrazole isomerization. After studying the binding of charged surfactants to the host, we find that the surface activity differences upon visible light switching for both isomers are comparable to those obtained by UV light excitation. The method is demonstrated on a large concentration range and can be activated using green or red light, depending on the sensitizer chosen.

     alt="Surface Tension Manipulation with Visible Light through Sensitized Disequilibration of Photoswitchable Amphiphiles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disequilibration by sensitization under confinement is used for the first time to modulate the surface tension of water with the aid of photoswitchable surfactants. Surfactants &lt;b&gt;POS&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;NEG&lt;/b&gt; were encapsulated in a macrocyclic cage together with a photosensitizer so that irradiation with visible light (green or red) could induce isomerization and thus modify the surface tension based on the altered surface activity of the amphiphile.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azoarene isomerization lies at the heart of numerous applications, from catalysis or energy storage to photopharmacology. While efficient switching between their &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomers predominantly relies on UV light, a recent study by Klajn and co-workers introduced visible light sensitization of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; azoarenes and their subsequent isomerization as a tool coined disequilibration by sensitization under confinement (DESC) to obtain high yields of the &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomer. This host&#8211;guest approach is, however, still constrained to minimally substituted azoarenes with limited applicability in advanced molecular systems. Herein, we expand DESC for the assembly of surfactants at the air&#8211;water interface. Leveraging our expertise with photoswitchable amphiphiles, we induce substantial alterations of the water surface tension through reversible arylazopyrazole isomerization. After studying the binding of charged surfactants to the host, we find that the surface activity differences upon visible light switching for both isomers are comparable to those obtained by UV light excitation. The method is demonstrated on a large concentration range and can be activated using green or red light, depending on the sensitizer chosen. The straightforward implementation of photoswitch sensitization in a complex molecular network showcases how DESC enables the improvement of existing systems and the development of novel applications driven by visible light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Horizontal Transport in Ti3C2Tx MXene for Highly Efficient Osmotic Energy Conversion from Saline&#8208;Alkali Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene with horizontal ionic transport channels (H&#8208;MXene) to withstand extreme saline&#8208;alkali conditions, significantly outperforms that with vertical ionic transport channels (V&#8208;MXene) in ion selectivity and permeability, achieving a current density over three orders of magnitude higher without significant polarization, an osmotic power density of 9.47&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2, and an exceptional energy conversion efficiency of 45.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Osmotic energy from the ocean has been thoroughly studied, but that from saline&#8208;alkali lakes is constrained by the ion&#8208;exchange membranes due to the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity, stemming from the unfavorable structure of nanoconfined channels, pH tolerance, and chemical stability of the membranes. Inspired by the rapid water transport in xylem conduit structures, we propose a horizontal transport MXene (H&#8208;MXene) with ionic sequential transport nanochannels, designed to endure extreme saline&#8208;alkali conditions while enhancing ion selectivity and permeability. The H&#8208;MXene demonstrates superior ion conductivity of 20.67&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M NaCl solution and a diffusion current density of 308&#8197;A&#8201;m&#8722;2 at a 10&#8208;fold salinity gradient of NaCl solution, significantly outperforming the conventional vertical transport MXene (V&#8208;MXene). Both experimental and simulation studies have confirmed that H&#8208;MXene represents a novel approach to circumventing the permeability&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. Moreover, it exhibits efficient ion transport capabilities, addressing the gap in saline&#8208;alkali osmotic power generation.

This demonstration of the electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem reaction process gives a new avenue for sulfions upgrading from wastewater and simultaneous efficient hydrogen production







Abstract
Realizing high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity features of Lihium&#8208;organic batteries is essential for their practical use but remains a big challenge, which is due to the instrinsic poor conductivity, limited redox kinetics and low utility of organic electrode mateials. This work presents a well&#8208;designed donor&#8208;acceptor Covalent Organic Framework (COFs) with extended conjugation, mesoscale porosity, and dual redox&#8208;active centers to promote fast charge transfer and multi&#8208;electron processes. As anticipated, the prepared cathode with benzo [1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;&#8242;] trithiophene (BTT) as p&#8208;type and pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) as n&#8208;type material (BTT&#8208;PTO&#8208;COF) delivers impressive specific capacity (218&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in ether&#8208;based electrolyte and 275&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte) and outstanding rate capability (79&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in ether&#8208;based electrolyte and 124&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte). In addition, the potential of BTT&#8208;PTO&#8208;COF electrode for prototype batteries has been demonstrated by full cells of dual&#8208;ion (FDIBs), which attain comparable electrochemical performances to the half cells. Moreover, mechanism studies combining ex situ characterization and theoratical calculations reveal the efficient dual&#8208;ion storage process and facile charge transfer of BTT&#8208;PTO&#8208;COF. This work not only expands the diversity of redox&#8208;active COFs but also provide concept of structure design for high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity organic electrodes.

         <title>A Macrocyclic Hybrid PET/MRI Probe for Quantitative Perfusion Imaging In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the integration of PET and MRI in molecular imaging has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care. We have developed a hybrid PET/MRI probe, [18F][Gd(FL1)], which is exceptionally stable, rapidly synthesized, efficiently radiolabeled, and allows simultaneous PET/MR imaging. The potential for in vivo application is demonstrated by quantitative characterization of tissue and renal clearance in mice.







Abstract
Perfusion dynamics play a vital role in delivering essential nutrients and oxygen to tissues while removing metabolic waste products. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) use contrast agents to visualize perfusion and clearance patterns; however, each technique has specific limitations. Hybrid PET/MRI combines the quantitative power and sensitivity of PET with the high functional and anatomical detail of MRI and holds great promise for precision in molecular imaging. However, the development of dual PET/MRI probes has been hampered by challenging synthesis and radiolabeling. Here, we present a novel PET/MRI probe, [18F][Gd(FL1)], which exhibits excellent stability comparable to macrocyclic MRI contrast agents used in clinical practice. The unique molecular design of [18F][Gd(FL1)] allows selective and expeditious radiolabeling of the gadolinium chelate in the final synthetic step. Leveraging the strengths of MRI and PET signals, the probe enables quantitative in vivo mapping of perfusion and excretion dynamics through an innovative voxel&#8208;based analysis. The diagnostic capabilities of [18F][Gd(FL1)] were demonstrated in a pilot study on healthy mice, successfully detecting early cases of unilateral renal dysfunction, a condition that is typically challenging to diagnose. This study introduces a new approach for PET/MRI and emphasizes a streamlined probe design for practical synthesis and improved diagnostic accuracy.

         <title>Transforming Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with DTPA&#8208;Na: A Synergistic SEI and CEI Engineering Approach for Exceptional Cycling Stability and Self&#8208;Discharge Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is developed to enhance the stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Incorporation of DTPA&#8208;Na additive enables a synergistic formation of robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI).

Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) hold immense potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, but their practical implementation faces significant challenges related to the zinc anode, including dendrite formation, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. This study addresses these challenges by introducing diethylenetriamine pentaacetate sodium salt (DTPA&#8208;Na) as a novel electrolyte additive. DTPA&#8208;Na exhibits a unique dual functionality, enabling the formation of a robust, multi&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the zinc anode and a stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the MnOOH cathode. The engineered SEI effectively suppresses interfacial side reactions, facilitates uniform zinc deposition, and mitigates dendrite growth, while the CEI inhibits MnOOH dissolution and detrimental cathode side reactions. This synergistic SEI/CEI engineering approach significantly enhances ZIB performance, achieving remarkable cycling stability and self&#8208;discharge inhibition, as evidenced by the extended lifespan of Zn||Zn symmetrical cells (4400&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA/cm2) and the exceptional capacity retention of Zn||MnOOH full cells after prolonged rest (98.61&#8201;% after 720&#8197;hours).

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Biocatalytic Conversion of Chemically Inert Hydrocarbons into Chiral Amino Acids through Internal Cofactor and H2O2 Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;enzyme cascade conversion system was developed using O2 as the oxidant and ammonium as the amination reagent. This system is based on internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling. It is designed to facilitate the one&#8208;pot enzymatic conversion from chemically inert hydrocarbons to chiral amino acids under environmentally friendly conditions, which is a highly challenging transformation in traditional organic synthesis.







Abstract
Chemically inert hydrocarbons are the primary feedstocks used in the petrochemical industry and can be converted into more intricate and valuable chemicals. However, two major challenges impede this conversion process: selective activation of C&#8722;H bonds in hydrocarbons and systematic functionalization required to synthesize complex structures. To address these issues, we developed a multi&#8208;enzyme cascade conversion system based on internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling to achieve the one&#8208;pot deep conversion from heptane to chiral (S)&#8208;2&#8208;aminoheptanoic acid under mild conditions. First, a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8208;cycle&#8208;based NADH regeneration method and H2O2 in&#8197;situ generation and consumption strategy were applied to realize selective C&#8722;H bond oxyfunctionalization, converting heptane into 2&#8208;hydroxyheptanoic acid. Integrating subsequent reductive amination driven by the second hydrogen&#8208;borrowing cycle, (S)&#8208;2&#8208;aminoheptanoic acid was finally accumulated at 4.57&#8197;mM with eep&gt;99&#8201;%. Hexane, octane, 2&#8208;methylheptane, and butylbenzene were also successfully converted into the corresponding chiral amino acids with eep&gt;99&#8201;%. Overall, the conversion system employed internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling, with O2 as the oxidant and ammonium as the amination reagent to fulfill the enzymatic conversion from chemically inert hydrocarbons into chiral amino acids under environmentally friendly conditions, which is a highly challenging transformation in traditional organic synthesis.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Sulfide Catalyst Boosts Energy&#8208;Saving Electrochemical Sulfion Upgrading to Thiosulfate Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>

Amorphous high&#8208;entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrSx/NF, with the manipulated chemical environments and electron states surrounding &#8220;soft&#8208;acid&#8221; sites and the sulfophobic properties of &#8220;hard&#8208;acid&#8221; metal sites, shows excellent sulfion&#8208;oxidation reaction performance coupled with hydrogen evolution at the industrial&#8208;level current density for long&#8208;time stability. This demonstration of the electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem reaction process gives a new avenue for sulfions upgrading from wastewater and simultaneous efficient hydrogen production







Abstract
Electrochemical sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) offers a sustainable strategy for sulfion&#8208;rich wastewater treatment, which can couple with cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. However, the corrosion and passivation of sulfur species render the inferior catalytic SOR performance, and the oxidation product, polysulfide, requires further acidification to recover cheap elementary sulfur. Here, we reported an amorphous high&#8208;entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrSx nanosheets in situ growth on the nickel foam (CuCoNiMnCrSx/NF) for SOR, which achieved an ultra&#8208;low potential of 0.25&#8197;V to afford 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stable electrolysis at as high as 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 100&#8197;h. These were endowed by the manipulated chemical environments surrounding Cu+ sites and the constructed &#8220;soft&#8208;acid&#8221; to &#8220;hard&#8208;acid&#8221; adsorption/desorption sites, enabling synergistically boosted adsorption/desorption process of sulfur species during SOR. Moreover, we developed an electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem process to convert sulfions to value&#8208;added thiosulfate, providing a good choice for simultaneous wastewater utilization and hydrogen production.

         <title>Promoting CO2 Electroreduction to Hydrocarbon Products via Sulfur&#8208;Enhanced Proton Feeding in Atomically Precise Thiolate&#8208;Protected Cu Clusters</title>

Two model Cu4(MMI)4 and Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 clusters with well&#8208;defined structures and stable low&#8208;coordinated Cu+ species are prepared to explore the synergistic effect of Cu+ and adjacent S site on CO2RR. Cu4(MMI)4 reduce CO2 to deep&#8208;reduced products with a FE of 91.0&#8201;% (including 53.7&#8201;% for CH4) while maintaining remarkable stability. Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 shows a notable preference for C2+ products with a maximum FE of 58.5&#8201;% and a JC2+ of 152.1&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Thiolate&#8208;protected Cu clusters with well&#8208;defined structures and stable low&#8208;coordinated Cu+ species exhibit remarkable potential for the CO2RR and are ideal model catalysts for establishing structure&#8208;electrocatalytic property relationships at the atomic level. However, extant Cu clusters employed in the CO2RR predominantly yield 2e&#8722; products. Herein, two model Cu4(MMI)4 and Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 clusters (MMI=2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole) are prepared to investigate the synergistic effect of Cu+ and adjacent S sites on the CO2RR. Cu4(MMI)4 can reduce CO2 to deep&#8208;reduced products with a 91.0&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (including 53.7&#8201;% for CH4) while maintaining remarkable stability. Conversely, Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 shows a remarkable preference for C2+ products, achieving a maximum FE of 58.5&#8201;% with a C2+ current density of 152.1&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2. In situ XAS and ex situ XPS spectra reveal the preservation of Cu+ species in Cu clusters during CO2RR, extensively enhancing the adsorption capacity of *CO intermediate. Moreover, kinetic analysis and theoretical calculations confirm that S sites facilitate H2O dissociation into *H species, which directly participate in the protonation process on adjacent Cu sites for the protonation of *CO to *CHO. This study highlights the important role of Cu&#8722;S dual sites in Cu clusters and provides mechanistic insights into the CO2RR pathway at the atomic level.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Chalcone&#8208;Flavylium Photochromic Systems in Aqueous Media&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, Bandyopadhyay and co&#8208;workers reported new chalcone photoswitches claimed to display advantageous optical and photochemical properties for potential biological applications, i.e., switching with blue, green and red light in aqueous solution. In this Correspondence, we argue that further experimental evidence is required to support the proposed design, data interpretation, and main conclusions.







Abstract
In a recent Communication in this journal, Bandyopadhyay and co&#8208;workers proposed a rational design of chalcone photoswitches that are claimed to convert into the respective flavylium cations upon irradiation with blue, green, and red light in aqueous media. Here we argue that the reported improvements on the optical/photochemical properties of the new chalcone photoswitches are not substantiated and that the proposed design and data interpretation rely on assumptions that have yet to be validated. We also identify a series of control experiments that can be performed to verify the hypotheses and better support the conclusions presented by the authors.

The Janus bifunctionality of Pd nanoparticles or atoms encapsulated in a Zn&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework is reported by Magnus Rueping, Pedro Casta&#241;o et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409490). As illustrated in the cover picture, on one side the catalyst is active and selective in photo&#8208;assisted cross&#8208;couplings, and on the other side selective and stable in the carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol.

         <dc:description>
Chiral supramolecular living polymers with strongly coupled, delocalized Frenkel excitations (FE) and charge&#8208;transfer excitations (CTE) were developed by Jianlei Han, Shigenori Fujikawa, and Nobuo Kimizuka in their Research Article (e202410431). Suitably designed, chiral perylene diimides (PDIs) show spontaneous transformation from kinetically formed nanoparticles into thermodynamically stable, luminescent helical and tubular nanostructures with enhanced chiroptical properties, fluorescence quantum yields, and living polymerization characteristics.

A novel hybrid PET/MRI probe integrating stable gadolinium chelate with radioactive fluorine&#8208;18 was designed for precision imaging of perfusion and excretion dynamics. In their Research Article (e202409520), Andr&#233; F. Martins, Miloslav Polasek et&#8197;al. demonstrate how merging quantitative PET signal with MRI contrast within a single molecule improves diagnostic capabilities. Employing sophisticated image analysis, this innovative probe can reveal hidden health issues, such as early stages of kidney dysfunction.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Rationalizing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction over IrO2: Essential Role of Hydronium Cation (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 48/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid environment was found to play a critical role in regulating the catalytic behavior of IrO2 during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As demonstrated by Jingguang G. Chen, Ping Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409526), the presence of hydronium cation (H3O+) introduces an internal electric field at the interface. It allows selective bond&#8208;tuning of the reaction intermediates and formation of partial surface hydroxylation under the operational conditions, which actively catalyzed the OER.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Curvature Formation in Synthetic Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bilayer&#8208;forming supramolecular amphiphile, reported by Elizebath et&#8197;al., helps elucidate mechanisms of curvature induction in synthetic membranes. Assembly in water led initially to aggregates but, over time, membrane budding and vesicle formation were observed due to asymmetric protonation of the water&#8208;exposed terminal tertiary amines. Insights could lead to the development of new hierarchical life&#8208;like materials and artificial cells.







Abstract
The mimicking of natural lipid bilayers with synthetic amphiphilic systems is of great interest to researchers, as insights could lead to better understanding of the complexities of cell membranes, as well as new materials and healthcare technologies. Recapitulating natural lipid asymmetry across bilayer membranes has important implications for curvature in cell, vesicle, and organelle morphologies, but has been challenging to achieve with synthetic lipid combinations or standard amphiphilic block copolymers. In a recent article, Elizebath et&#8197;al. report the synthesis of a new type of synthetic amphiphile able to induce asymmetry in an artificial bilayer membrane dynamically. The molecules were designed around an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated hydrophobic core with tertiary amine&#8208;terminated oxyalkylene side chains. Protonation of the tertiary amines on the bilayer exterior leads to curvature induction, bilayer fission, and vesicle formation as monitored by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy techniques and microscopy. The results were further validated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The delicate balance between different molecular scale interactions in the supramolecular structures led to the dynamic transformation of the bilayer membranes. Insights described could be used to advance the assembly of hierarchical life&#8208;like materials.

         <title>Contrasting Historical and Physical Perspectives in Asymmetric Catalysis: &#916;&#916;G&#8800; versus Enantiomeric Excess</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the difference between enantiomeric excess (ee) and relative Gibbs free activation energies (&#916;&#916;G&#8800;) as modeling targets in asymmetric catalysis. Through data analysis and application of modern machine learning methods, we unveil the strengths and limitations of each approach. Our results offer critical insights into which target more accurately predicts enantioselectivity, providing a guide for future research in machine learning for catalysis.







Abstract
With the rise of machine learning (ML), the modeling of chemical systems has reached a new era and has the potential to revolutionize how we understand and predict chemical reactions. Here, we probe the historic dependence on utilizing enantiomeric excess (ee) as a target variable and discuss the benefits of using relative Gibbs free activation energies (&#916;&#916;G&#8800;), grounded firmly in transition&#8208;state theory, emphasizing practical benefits for chemists. This perspective is intended to discuss best practices that enhance modeling efforts especially for chemists with an experimental background in asymmetric catalysis that wish to explore modelling of their data. We outline the enhanced modeling performance using &#916;&#916;G&#8800;, escaping physical limitations, addressing temperature effects, managing non&#8208;linear error propagation, adjusting for data distributions and how to deal with unphysical predictions,in order to streamline modeling for the practical chemist and provide simple guidelines to strong statistical tools. For this endeavor, we gathered ten datasets from the literature covering very different reaction types. We evaluated the datasets using fingerprint&#8208;, descriptor&#8208;, and graph neural network&#8208;based models. Our results highlight the distinction in performance among varying model complexities with respect to the target representation, emphasizing practical benefits for chemists.

         <title>Carbon Dot Synthesis and Purification: Trends, Challenges and Recommendations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review analyzes the current trends and challenges in the synthesis and purification of carbon dots prepared through various methods and using a wide variety of precursors. Diverse purification techniques, including centrifugation, filtration, dialysis, column chromatography, and electrophoresis, are systematically and thoroughly described, along with pointing out the gaps in the synthesis, purification, and assessment of CD purity.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have rapidly emerged as a new family of carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials since their initial discovery two decades ago. Numerous appealing properties, such as precursor and synthesis process flexibility, tunable photoluminescence, and good biocompatibility, have enabled their widespread applications in sensing, catalysis, energy, and biomedical fields. As the field expands, notable efforts have recently focused on mechanistically elucidating the structural formation and optical behavior of CDs. However, the absence of &#8220;clean&#8221; CDs presents a major obstacle to achieving a solid understanding of these aspects. Often, the claimed CDs are, in fact, a mixture of small molecules, oligomers, nano&#8208;sized aggregates, or even microparticles. Such coexistence of impurities markedly impacts the physicochemical properties of resulting CD&#8208;based mixtures, hampering the resolution of key mechanistic questions. Here, we aim to address this fundamental shortcoming of the field, going beyond the customary focus of the existing reviews that predominantly cover synthesis, optical performance, and application prospects. We begin with an overview of CD synthesis and then thoroughly examine the purification methods, including filtration, dialysis, electrophoresis, and chromatography.

     alt="Carbon Dot Synthesis and Purification: Trends, Challenges and Recommendations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Review analyzes the current trends and challenges in the synthesis and purification of carbon dots prepared through various methods and using a wide variety of precursors. Diverse purification techniques, including centrifugation, filtration, dialysis, column chromatography, and electrophoresis, are systematically and thoroughly described, along with pointing out the gaps in the synthesis, purification, and assessment of CD purity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon dots (CDs) have rapidly emerged as a new family of carbon-based nanomaterials since their initial discovery two decades ago. Numerous appealing properties, such as precursor and synthesis process flexibility, tunable photoluminescence, and good biocompatibility, have enabled their widespread applications in sensing, catalysis, energy, and biomedical fields. As the field expands, notable efforts have recently focused on mechanistically elucidating the structural formation and optical behavior of CDs. However, the absence of &#8220;clean&#8221; CDs presents a major obstacle to achieving a solid understanding of these aspects. Often, the claimed CDs are, in fact, a mixture of small molecules, oligomers, nano-sized aggregates, or even microparticles. Such coexistence of impurities markedly impacts the physicochemical properties of resulting CD-based mixtures, hampering the resolution of key mechanistic questions. Here, we aim to address this fundamental shortcoming of the field, going beyond the customary focus of the existing reviews that predominantly cover synthesis, optical performance, and application prospects. We begin with an overview of CD synthesis and then thoroughly examine the purification methods, including filtration, dialysis, electrophoresis, and chromatography. The insights provided here will guide the researchers towards obtaining high-quality CDs, employing proper combinations of available tools, and ultimately paving the way for more demanding applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanomole Scale Screening of Fluorescent RNA&#8208;Methyltransferase Probes Enables the Discovery of METTL1 Inhibitors</title>

A nanomole&#8208;scale modular synthesis approach enables the rapid development of fluorescent RNA MTase probes, facilitating high&#8208;throughput screenings for drug development. This innovative approach enables advancements in RNA MTase medicinal chemistry highlighted by the discovery of METTL1 inhibitors.







Abstract
RNA methylation is a metabolic process validated for its association with various diseases, and thus, RNA methyltransferases (MTases) have become increasingly important in drug discovery. Yet, most frequently utilized RNA MTase assays are limited in their throughput and hamper this rapidly evolving field of medicinal chemistry. In this study, we describe a modular nanomole scale building block system that allowed the identification of tailored fluorescent MTase probes to unlock a broad selection of MTase drug targets for fluorescence&#8208;based binding assays. Probe candidates were initially prepared on a 4 nanomole scale and could be tested directly from crude reaction mixtures to allow rapid probe identification and optimization. Using an alkyne&#8208;azide click late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy and in silico protein databank mining, we established a selection of fluorescent probes suitable for relevant drug targets from the METTL and NSUN families, as well as bacterial and viral MTases. Using this concept, a high&#8208;throughput screening on the unexplored drug target METTL1 discovered three hit compounds with micromolar potency providing a (1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;based starting point for METTL1 drug discovery.

         <title>An Atomic&#8208;Scale Explanation for The High Selectivity Towards Carbon Dioxide Reduction Observed On Liquid Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hads travels with the motion of a liquid metal surface, allowing it to reach dopant sites (In or Sn) where it reacts with CO2 to make formate with a low barrier (0.25&#8197;eV). Hads is not mobile on a solid surface, explaining why only liquid metals catalyse the reaction.







Abstract
The low&#8208;temperature liquid metals Ga&#8208;In and Ga&#8208;Sn have previously showcased &gt;95&#8201;% selectivity towards the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate, occuring only when the alloys are melted, not solid. Here, density functional theory molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations reveal that CO2 does not directly adsorb to the Ga&#8208;alloy surface, but instead is reduced indirectly by reaction with an adsorbed hydrogen. The reaction barrier is vastly more favourable when this process occurs at In or Sn sites (average: 0.26&#8197;eV), than when it occurs on Ga (average: 0.47&#8197;eV). However, there is no difference in barrier between solid and liquid surfaces. Instead, we find that Hads is mobile only on the liquid surface, travelling due to the motion of the liquid beneath. This process drives Hads to In/Sn sites, allowing low&#8208;barrier CO2 reduction to occur only on the liquid. Therefore, the dynamic motion of liquid metal catalysts can underpin their unique reactivity. The result has far reaching implications for any protonation reaction conducted with a liquid metal catalyst.

         <title>Atomically Precise Ternary Cluster: Polyoxometalate Cluster Sandwiched by Gold Clusters Protected by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a ternary cluster consisting of a polyoxometalate cluster sandwiched by two gold clusters protected by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes was synthesized through ligand exchange, whose atomically precise structures were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. These composite clusters demonstrate excellent catalytic capabilities for reducing H2O2 via the intercluster synergistic effects.







Abstract
Coinage metal (Au, Ag, Cu) cluster and polyoxometalate (POM) cluster represent two types of subnanometer &#8220;artificial atoms&#8221; with significant potential in catalysis, sensing, and nanomedicine. While composite clusters combining Ag/Cu clusters with POM have achieved considerable success, the assembly of gold clusters with POM is still lagging. Herein, we first designedly synthesized two cluster structural units: an Au3O cluster stabilized by diverse N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands and an amine&#8208;terminated POM linker. The subsequent reaction involved amine substitution in the POM linker for the central O atom in the Au3O cluster, resulting in the first ternary composite cluster&#8212;a POM cluster sandwiched by two Au clusters protected by NHCs. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and other characteristic methods characterized their atomically precise structures. Furthermore, altering the NHC ligands decreased the number of gold atoms in the sandwich structures, accompanying the different protonated degrees of amine ligand in the terminal end of the POM linker. These composite clusters showed excellent performances in catalytic H2O2 conversion through the synergistic effect between gold clusters and POM clusters. This work opens a new avenue to functional composite metal clusters and would promote their enhanced catalysis applications through intercluster synergistic interactions within composite systems.

         <title>Native Proteomics by Capillary Zone Electrophoresis&#8208;Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native proteomics enabled the measurement of protein complexes up to 400&#8197;kDa from a complex proteome, via online coupling of native capillary zone electrophoresis to an ultra&#8208;high mass range Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry&#8208;based native proteomics agreed well with native mass photometry regarding the mass distribution of detected proteins.







Abstract
Native proteomics measures endogenous proteoforms and protein complexes under a near physiological condition using native mass spectrometry (nMS) coupled with liquid&#8208;phase separations. Native proteomics should provide the most accurate bird's&#8208;eye view of proteome dynamics within cells, which is fundamental for understanding almost all biological processes. nMS has been widely employed to characterize well&#8208;purified protein complexes. However, there are only very few trials of utilizing nMS to measure proteoforms and protein complexes in a complex sample (i.e., a whole cell lysate). Here, we pioneer the native proteomics measurement of large proteoforms or protein complexes up to 400&#8197;kDa from a complex proteome via online coupling of native capillary zone electrophoresis (nCZE) to an ultra&#8208;high mass range (UHMR) Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The nCZE&#8208;MS technique enabled the measurement of a 115&#8208;kDa standard protein complex while consuming only about 0.1&#8197;ng of protein material. nCZE&#8208;MS analysis of an E.coli cell lysate detected 72&#8197;proteoforms or protein complexes in a mass range of 30&#8211;400&#8197;kDa in a single run while consuming only 50&#8208;ng protein material. The mass distribution of detected proteoforms or protein complexes agreed well with that from mass photometry measurement. This work represents a technical breakthrough in native proteomics for measuring complex proteomes.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Methanogenesis through Microbial Ecosystem Engineering on Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microbial ecosystem engineering enables efficient solar&#8208;driven methanogenesis over a biohybrid photocatalyst. The syntrophic coculture of Methanosarcina barkeri (M. barkeri) with the electron transport specialist Geobacter sulfurreducens KN400 (KN400) over carbon nitride produced a semi&#8208;biological photocatalyst for the sunlight&#8208;driven methane synthesis from carbon dioxide.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;biological photosynthesis combines synthetic photosensitizers with microbial catalysts to produce sustainable fuels and chemicals from CO2. However, the inefficient transfer of photoexcited electrons to microbes leads to limited CO2 utilization, restricting the catalytic performance of such biohybrid assemblies. Here, we introduce a biological engineering solution to address the inherently sluggish electron uptake mechanism of a methanogen, Methanosarcina barkeri (M. barkeri), by coculturing it with an electron transport specialist, Geobacter sulfurreducens KN400 (KN400), an adapted strain rich with multiheme c&#8208;type cytochromes (c&#8208;Cyts) and electrically conductive protein filaments (e&#8208;PFs) made of polymerized c&#8208;Cyts with enhanced capacity for extracellular electron transfer (EET). Integration of this M. barkeri&#8208;KN400 co&#8208;culture with a synthetic photosensitizer, carbon nitride, demonstrates that c&#8208;Cyts and e&#8208;PFs, emanating from live KN400, transport photoexcited electrons efficiently from the carbon nitride to M. barkeri for methanogenesis with remarkable long&#8208;term stability and selectivity. The demonstrated cooperative interaction between two microbes via direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) and the photosensitizer to assemble a semi&#8208;biological photocatalyst introduces an ecosystem engineering strategy in solar chemistry to drive sustainable chemical reactions.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioconvergent Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Etherification of Phenols by Allylation to Access Chiral C(sp3)&#8722;O Allyl Aryl Ethers</title>

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed etherification of phenols with regioisomeric mixtures of racemic silylated and germylated allylic chlorides enables the enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent formation of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted chiral allylic aryl ethers as a single regioisomer (see Scheme). Key to success is the metalloid moiety governing the regioselectivity, and these highly functionalized allylic ethers can subsequently undergo chemoselective chemical modifications.







Abstract
An enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent allylation of phenols under nickel catalysis with an &#945;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;regioisomeric mixture of racemic silylated/germylated allylic chlorides is reported. The silyl/germyl group governs the regioselectivity, and the transformation affords enantiomerically enriched unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allyl aryl ethers with excellent regiocontrol in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, no nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;O bond activation is observed at room temperature. The synthetic value of these densely functionalized silicon&#8208;containing building blocks is demonstrated in a series of chemoselective transformations, including a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement for the construction of an &#945;&#8208;chiral silane.

         <title>Abiotic Foldamer Quaternary Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of hydrogen bond donors at precise locations at the periphery of a stable aromatic foldamer helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix tertiary fold led to its aggregation in chloroform to produce genuine discrete abiotic quaternary structures in which the tertiary folds are preserved. The quaternary structures were assigned to C3&#8208;symmetrical trimer corresponding to the initial design, and to an unexpected hydrated C2&#8208;symmetrical dimer.







Abstract
Abiotic aromatic foldamer sequences have been previously shown to fold in helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix motifs in organic solvents. Using simple computational tools, a new helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix motif was designed that bears additional hydrogen bond donor OH groups to promote its aggregation into a genuine, trimeric, abiotic quaternary structure. This sequence was synthesized and its self&#8208;assembly in solution was investigated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Circular Dichroism (CD) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The existence of two stable discrete aggregates was evidenced, one assigned to the initially designed trimer, the other to a dimer including multiple water molecules. The two species may be quantitatively interconverted upon changing the water content of the solution or the temperature. These results represent important steps in the design of protein&#8208;like abiotic architectures.

         <title>A DNA Polymerase Variant Senses the Epigenetic Marker 5&#8208;Methylcytosine by Increased Misincorporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering of a Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase that distinguishes methylated from unmethylated DNA by increased misincorporation opposite 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5&#8197;mC) during DNA synthesis. By generating 5&#8197;mC&#8208;dependent mutation signatures in the PCR product, the enzyme is able to sense methylated sites and allows direct detection by reading elevated error rates at 5&#8197;mC positions after sequencing without prior conversion of the template DNA.







Abstract
Dysregulation of DNA methylation is associated with human disease, particularly cancer, and the assessment of aberrant methylation patterns holds great promise for clinical diagnostics. However, DNA polymerases do not effectively discriminate between processing 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5&#8197;mC) and unmethylated cytosine, resulting in the silencing of methylation information during amplification or sequencing. As a result, current detection methods require multi&#8208;step DNA conversion treatments or careful analysis of sequencing data to decipher individual 5&#8197;mC bases. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel DNA polymerase&#8208;mediated 5&#8197;mC detection approach. Here, we describe the engineering of a thermostable DNA polymerase variant derived from Thermus aquaticus with altered fidelity towards 5&#8197;mC. Using a screening&#8208;based evolutionary approach, we have identified a DNA polymerase that exhibits increased misincorporation towards 5&#8197;mC during DNA synthesis. This DNA polymerase generates mutation signatures at methylated CpG sites, allowing direct detection of 5&#8197;mC by reading an increased error rate after sequencing without prior treatment of the sample DNA.

         <title>Tricyanomethane or Dicyanoketenimine&#8212;Silylation makes the Difference</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of a dicyanoketenimine, Me3Si&#8722;NC&#8722;C(CN)2, was achieved by introduction of a bulky Me3Si group, whereas the protonated species features the tricyanomethanide isomer HC(CN)3. Further silylation with [Me3Si&#8722;H&#8722;SiMe3][B(C6F5)4] led to the formation of an unusual persilylated dication [C(CN&#8722;SiMe3)3]2+ stabilized by a weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
Pseudohalides such as tricyanomethanide, [C(CN)3]&#8722;, are well known in chemistry, biochemistry and industrial chemistry. The protonated species HC(CN)3, a classic hydrogen pseudohalide Br&#248;nsted acid, is a very strong acid with a pKa value of &#8722;5. However, HC(CN)3 is difficult to handle as it tends to decompose rapidly or, more precisely, to oligo&#8208; and polymerize. Therefore, silylated pseudohalide compounds with the [Me3Si]+ as the &#8220;big organometallic proton&#8221; have become interesting, exhibiting similar chemical properties but better kinetic protection. Here, the stepwise silylation of the pseudohalide anion [C(CN)3]&#8722; is reported, forming the heavier homologue of HC(CN)3, namely [Me3Si][C(CN)3], and in presence of two additional [Me3Si]+ cations even the dicationic species [(Me3Si&#8722;NC)3C]2+ as stable [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; salt. Surprisingly, in contrast to the protonated species HC(CN)3, in which the proton is bound to the central carbon atom of [C(CN)3]&#8722;, silylation of the [C(CN)3]&#8722; anion occurs at one of the three terminal nitrogen atoms, thus forming the long&#8208;sought dicyanoketenimine [Me3Si&#8722;NC&#8722;C(CN)2]. All further silylation steps take place exclusively on the terminal N atoms of the three CN groups and not on the central carbon atom, until the intriguing, highly symmetrical dication, [(Me3Si&#8722;NC)3C]2+, is finally generated. The experimental data are supported by quantum chemical calculations in terms of thermodynamics and chemical bonding.

&lt;p&gt;The first synthesis of a dicyanoketenimine, Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8722;NC&#8722;C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, was achieved by introduction of a bulky Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si group, whereas the protonated species features the tricyanomethanide isomer HC(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Further silylation with [Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8722;H&#8722;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] led to the formation of an unusual persilylated dication [C(CN&#8722;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stabilized by a weakly coordinating anion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudohalides such as tricyanomethanide, [C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, are well known in chemistry, biochemistry and industrial chemistry. The protonated species HC(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a classic hydrogen pseudohalide Br&#248;nsted acid, is a very strong acid with a p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value of &#8722;5. However, HC(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is difficult to handle as it tends to decompose rapidly or, more precisely, to oligo- and polymerize. Therefore, silylated pseudohalide compounds with the [Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as the &#8220;big organometallic proton&#8221; have become interesting, exhibiting similar chemical properties but better kinetic protection. Here, the stepwise silylation of the pseudohalide anion [C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is reported, forming the heavier homologue of HC(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, namely [Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si][C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], and in presence of two additional [Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations even the dicationic species [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8722;NC)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as stable [B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; salt. Surprisingly, in contrast to the protonated species HC(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, in which the proton is bound to the central carbon atom of [C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, silylation of the [C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion occurs at one of the three terminal nitrogen atoms, thus forming the long-sought dicyanoketenimine [Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8722;NC&#8722;C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. All further silylation steps take place exclusively on the terminal N atoms of the three CN groups and not on the central carbon atom, until the intriguing, highly symmetrical dication, [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8722;NC)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, is finally generated. The experimental data are supported by quantum chemical calculations in terms of thermodynamics and chemical bonding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Unusual (4+3) Annulation of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with Bicyclobutanes: Access to Oxabicyclo[4.1.1]Octanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of oxabicyclo[4.1.1.]octanes is demonstrated via the Lewis acid catalyzed (4+3) annulation of para&#8208;quinone methides with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. The reaction proceeds with the simultaneous activation of p&#8208;QMs and BCBs by Lewis acid. Mechanistically, the reaction entails the activation of the ester enolate of BCB by the Lewis acid. This method is notably straightforward in operation, proceeds efficiently under mild conditions, and exhibits excellent compatibility with various functional groups, demonstrating a broad scope.







Abstract
Over the past few years, there has been a surge of interest in the chemistry of bicyclobutanes (BCBs). Although BCBs have been used to synthesize bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes and bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, the synthesis of bicyclo[4.1.1]octanes has remained elusive. Herein, we report the first Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed unexpected (4+3) annulation of para&#8208;quinonemethides (p&#8208;QMs) with BCBs allowing the synthesis of oxabicyclo[4.1.1]octanes proceeding under mild conditions. With 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Bi(OTf)3, the reaction afforded the (4+3) annulated product in high regioselectivity and good functional group compatibility via a simultaneous Lewis acid activation of BCBs and p&#8208;QMs. The reaction is likely initiated by the 1,6&#8208;addition of Lewis acid activated BCBs to p&#8208;QMs followed by the C2&#8208;selective intramolecular addition of the phenol moiety to the generated cyclobutyl cation intermediate. Moreover, detailed mechanistic studies provided insight into the mechanism of the reaction.

         <title>Versatile Light&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Degradable Bottlebrush Polymers Using &#945;&#8208;Lipoic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

Two&#8208;step approach to bottlebrush synthesis using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA) enables control over side&#8208;chain chemistry and catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of degradable bottlebrush polymers.







Abstract
Bottlebrush polymers have a variety of useful properties including a high entanglement molecular weight, low Young's modulus, and rapid kinetics for self&#8208;assembly. However, the translation of bottlebrushes to real&#8208;world applications is limited by complex, multi&#8208;step synthetic pathways and polymerization reactions that rely on air&#8208;sensitive catalysts. Additionally, most bottlebrushes are non&#8208;degradable. Herein, we report an inexpensive, versatile, and simple approach to synthesize degradable bottlebrush polymers under mild reaction conditions. Our approach relies on the &#8220;grafting&#8208;through&#8221; polymerization of &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA)&#8208;functionalized macromonomers. These macromonomers can be polymerized under mild, catalyst&#8208;free conditions, and due to reversibility of the disulfide bond in LA, the resulting bottlebrush polymers can be depolymerized by cleaving disulfide backbone bonds. Bottlebrushes with various side&#8208;chain chemistries can be prepared through the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of LA&#8208;functionalized macromonomers, and the backbone length is governed by the macromonomer molecular weight and solvent polarity. We also demonstrate that LA&#8208;functionalized macromonomers can be copolymerized with acrylates to form degradable bottlebrush networks. This work demonstrates the preparation of degradable bottlebrush polymers with a variety of side&#8208;chain chemistries and provides insight into the light&#8208;mediated grafting&#8208;through polymerization of dithiolane&#8208;functionalized macromonomers.

         <title>Polaritonic Chemistry Enabled by Non&#8208;Local Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a non&#8208;local metasurface to achieve vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between surface lattice resonance and the C=O stretching modes of both ethyl acetate and p&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA). Within this VSC system, we observed a 2.7&#8208;fold increase in the solvolysis reaction of PNPA compared to the bare reaction. This finding highlights the robustness of metasurfaces in catalyzing chemical reactions via VSC.







Abstract
Vibrational strong coupling can modify chemical reaction pathways in unconventional ways. Thus far, Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities formed by pairs of facing mirrors have been mostly utilized to achieve vibrational strong coupling. In this study, we demonstrate the application of non&#8208;local metasurfaces that can sustain surface lattice resonances, enabling chemical reactions under vibrational strong coupling. We show that the solvolysis kinetics of para&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate can be accelerated by a factor of 2.7 by strong coupling to the carbonyl bond of the solvent and the solute with a surface lattice resonance. Our work introduces a new platform to investigate polaritonic chemical reactions. In contrast to Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities, metasurfaces define open optical cavities with single surfaces, which removes alignment hurdles, facilitating polaritonic chemistry across large areas.

         <title>Complex Dance of Molecules in the Sky: Choreography of Intermolecular Structure and Dynamics in the Cyclopentene&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O Hetero Ternary Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

The application of high&#8208;resolution rotational spectroscopy coupled with comprehensive theoretical calculations provides a first observation and analysis of the c&#8208;C5H8&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O hetero ternary cluster, unveiling the subtle interplay of forces that govern its formation.







Abstract
This study delves into driving forces behind the formation of a hetero ternary cluster consisting of volatile organic compounds from industrial or combustion sources, specifically cyclopentene, alongside greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, and water vapor. While substantial progress has been made in understanding binary complexes, the structural intricacies of hetero ternary clusters remain largely uncharted. Our research characterized the cyclopentene&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O hetero ternary cluster utilizing Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. The observed isomer in the pulsed jet has CO2 and H2O aligning above the cyclopentene ring, with water undergoing an internal rotation approximately about its C2 symmetry axis. Theoretical analyses support these observations, identifying an O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; hydrogen bond and a secondary C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O tetrel bond within this cluster. This study marks a critical step towards comprehending the molecular dynamics and interactions of VOCs, greenhouse gases, and water in the atmosphere, paving the way for further investigations into their roles in climate dynamics and air quality.

&lt;p&gt;This study delves into driving forces behind the formation of a hetero ternary cluster consisting of volatile organic compounds from industrial or combustion sources, specifically cyclopentene, alongside greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, and water vapor. While substantial progress has been made in understanding binary complexes, the structural intricacies of hetero ternary clusters remain largely uncharted. Our research characterized the cyclopentene&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O hetero ternary cluster utilizing Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. The observed isomer in the pulsed jet has CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O aligning above the cyclopentene ring, with water undergoing an internal rotation approximately about its &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry axis. Theoretical analyses support these observations, identifying an O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; hydrogen bond and a secondary C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O tetrel bond within this cluster. This study marks a critical step towards comprehending the molecular dynamics and interactions of VOCs, greenhouse gases, and water in the atmosphere, paving the way for further investigations into their roles in climate dynamics and air quality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Construction of C&#8208; and Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silacyclopentanes via Hydrosilylation of Arylmethylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydrosilylation of arylmethylenecyclopropanes with dihydrosilanes or primary silanes, which gives access to a variety of C&#8208;stereogenic and Si&#8208;stereogenic silacyclopentanes in decent yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
Silacycles have exhibited significant potential for application in the fields of medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science. Accordingly, the development of effective methods for synthesizing these compounds has attracted increasing attention. Here, we report an efficient Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of arylmethylenecyclopropanes with hydrosilanes, that allows the rapid assembly of various enantioenriched carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic silacyclopentanes in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities under mild conditions. Further stereospecific transformation of the Si&#8722;H bond on the chiral silicon center expands the diversity of these C&#8208; and Si&#8208;stereogenic silacyclopentanes.

         <title>A Carbazole&#8208;Centered Expanded Helicene Stabilized with Hexabenzocoronene (HBC) Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and stabilization of heteroatom&#8208;doped nanocarbon molecules, such as carbazole&#8208;containing (super)helicenes, present significant challenges due to the complexities involved in maintaining structural integrity and electronic functionality. In this study, we successfully synthesized a carbazole&#8208;centered expanded tris&#8208;hexabenzo[7]helicene (1) via a facile FeCl3&#8208;mediated Scholl coupling reaction. 1 exhibits both chemical and chiral stability and demonstrates fluorescence at 628 nm with a quantum yield of 0.40. Additionally, the enantiomers of 1 display pronounced chiroptical properties, including a distinct circular dichroism (CD) signal spanning from 300 to 600 nm. The absorption dissymmetry factor (|gabs|) is determined to be 2.98 &#215; 10&#8722;3, while the circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) is measured as 32.50 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Phase Perchlorate Activation Enabled by a Dinuclear Fe&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perchlorate, initially regarded as a weakly coordinating counterion rather than a reactive oxidizing reagent due to its kinetic stability, has garnered attention for its potential in microbial systems. Under anaerobic conditions, microbes utilize perchlorate as a terminal oxidant for methane oxidation, involving two distinct stages: extraction and release of oxidizing ability. This two&#8208;phase activation process necessitates the collaborative action of multiple enzymes, a phenomenon not extensively explored in artificial systems. To address this issue, a dinuclear Fe&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complex 1 was designed to enable the two&#8208;phase activation of perchlorate. Initially, complex 1 extracts the oxidative potential of perchlorate, leading to the formation of Fe(III)&#8208;O&#8208;Fe(III) complex 2 as the oxidation product. Subsequently, the extracted oxidative potential can be released by photolyzing a mixture of complex 2 and 9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene. In contrast to the commonly observed selectivity, the homocoupling product 5 was identified as the major product in this C&#8208;H activation reaction. Further, a catalytic C&#8208;H activation reaction is initiated under anaerobic conditions to selectively form the C&#8208;C coupling product, achieving the complete two&#8208;phase activation of perchlorate using a single artificial catalyst. This work provides a new paradigm for constructing biomimetic anaerobic oxidation using kinetically inert high&#8208;valent oxygenated acid anions as oxidants.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Chirality Transfer in Self&#8208;Assembled Nanocomposites Powered by A Trace Amount of Chiral Dimeric Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembly has markedly advanced the development of chiral materials. While the Sergeant and Soldiers principle allows for chirality amplification, it necessitates precise shape&#8208;matching between chiral and achiral molecules, leading to a low chirality transfer efficiency&#8212;where one chiral molecule influences the chirality of a limited number of achiral molecules. Here, we show that this efficiency can be markedly enhanced by introducing chiral dimeric molecules. In this work, a single chiral molecule can control the chirality of up to 200 achiral molecules and even direct the assembly of inorganic nanoparticles into chiral nanocomposites through a sequential chirality transfer process. Moreover, this approach exhibits remarkable robustness, operating effectively without necessitating a precise match between chiral and achiral molecules. Consequently, using the same chiral molecules at an exceptionally low molar fraction (0.5 mol%) allows for the chiral&#8208;selective assembly of achiral molecules over a broad spectrum, regardless of their packing habits, thus facilitating the creation of otherwise inaccessible chiral materials with modulated chiroptical properties. Last but not least, even a trace amount of chiral molecules can enhance the elastic modulus of the self&#8208;assembled nanocomposites by a factor of eight.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;selective Defect Minimization towards Highly Efficient Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The persistence of defects in polycrystalline membranes poses a substantial obstacle to reaching the theoretical molecular sieving separation and scaling up production. The low membrane selectivity in most reported literature is largely due to the unavoidable non&#8208;selective defects during synthesis, leading to a mismatch between the well&#8208;defined pore structure of polycrystalline molecular sieve materials. This paper presents a novel approach for minimizing non&#8208;selective defects in metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes by a constricted crystal growth strategy in a confined environment. The in&#8208;situ ZIF formation using the densely packed seeding array between the substrate and the pre&#8208;grown top ZIF layer yields a confined membrane interlayer, which is highly uniform with a tightly packed crystalline structure. Unlike uncontrolled crystal growth, we purposely regulate the interlayer membrane growth in the direction parallel to the substrate. A notable 99% decrease in defects in the confined interlayer was achieved compared to the random&#8208;grown top layer, leading to a ~353% increment in H2/N2 selectivity over the non&#8208;confined reference MOF membrane. The performance of this new membrane sits in the optimal range above the Robeson upper bound. The membrane boasts a balanced high H2 permeability (&gt;5000 Barrer) and selectivity (&gt;50), significantly surpassing peer ZIF membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Electrochemical Glycerol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) is a promising candidate to couple with cathodic reaction, like hydrogen evolution reaction, to produce high&#8208;value product with less energy consumption. Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs), comprising square&#8208;planar metal&#8208;coordination motifs (e.g., MO4, M(NH)4, MS4), are notable for their programable active sites, intrinsic charge transport, and excellent stability, making them promising catalyst candidates for GOR. Here, we introduce a novel class of 2D c&#8208;MOFs electrocatalysts, M2[NiPcS8] (M=Co/Ni/Cu), which are synthesized via coordination of octathiolphthalocyaninato nickel (NiPc(SH)8) with various metal centers. Due to a fast kinetic and high activity of CoS4 sites for GOR, the electrocatalytic tests demonstrate that Co2[NiPcS8] supported on carbon paper displays a low GOR potential of 1.35 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, significantly reducing the overall water&#8208;electrolysis&#8208;voltage reduction by 0.27 V from oxygen evolution reaction to GOR, thereby outperforming Ni2[NiPcS8] and Cu2[NiPcS8]. Additionally, we have determined that the GOR activity of CoX4 linkage sites varies with different heteroatoms, following an experimentally and theoretically confirmed activity order of CoS4&gt;CoO4&gt;Co(NH)4. The GOR performance of Co2[NiPcS8] not only demonstrate superior performance among non&#8208;noble metal complex, but also provides critical insights on designing high&#8208;performance MOF electrocatalysts upon optimizing the electronic environment of active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Three&#8208;Component &#945;&#8208;Allylic Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Amino Esters by Synergistic Photoinduced Pd/Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis has emerged as an intriguing strategy for unlocking new reactivity potential of simple substrates. However, the related transformations are still limited and the enantiocontrol remains challenging. Organocatalysis displays unique capability in substrate activation and stereocontrol. Combination of organocatalysis and photoinduced excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis may provide opportunities to develop new enantioselective reactions from simple substrates. By applying cooperative triple catalysis including excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis, ground&#8208;state Pd catalysis, and carbonyl catalysis, we have successfully realized enantioselective &#945;&#8208;allylic alkylation of &#945;&#8208;amino esters with simple styrene and alkyl halide starting materials. The reaction allows rapid modular assembly of the three reaction partners into a variety of chiral quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino esters in good yields with 90&#8208;99% ee, without protecting group manipulations at the active NH2 group. The cooperation of the chiral pyridoxal catalyst and the chiral phosphine ligand accounts for the excellent chirality induction.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer and DNAzyme Based Colorimetric Biosensors for Pathogen&#160;Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detection of pathogens is critical for preventing and controlling health hazards across clinical, environmental, and food safety sectors. Functional nucleic acids (FNAs), such as aptamers and DNAzymes, have emerged as versatile molecular tools for pathogen detection due to their high specificity and affinity. This review focuses on the in vitro selection of FNAs for pathogens, with emphasis on the selection of aptamers for specific biomarkers and intact pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. Additionally, the selection of DNAzymes for bacterial detection is discussed. The integration of these FNAs into colorimetric biosensors has enabled the development of simple, cost&#8208;effective diagnostic platforms. Both non&#8208;catalytic and catalytic colorimetric biosensors are explored, including those based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), polydiacetylenes (PDAs), protein enzymes, G&#8208;quadruplexes, and nanozymes. These biosensors offer visible detection through color changes, making them ideal for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics. The review concludes by highlighting current challenges and future perspectives for advancing FNA&#8208;based colorimetric biosensing technologies for pathogen detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of Sulfoximine&#8208;Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes: Functionalizable, Tuneable and Cysteine&#8208;Selective Chiral Warheads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic covalent warheads with appropriate reactivity and selectivity are crucial to the investigation of protein function and the discovery of therapeutics. Here we report the synthesis of sulfoximine bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) as novel thiol reactive chiral warheads, achieved in one&#8208;pot from methylsulfoximines. Unusually the warhead can then be derivatized, keeping the BCB intact, over 3 vectors: i) sulfoximine N&#8208;modification instills a broad range of strain&#8208;release reactivity; ii) sp2&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reactions on aryl&#8208;BCB&#8208;sulfoximines allows direct diversification, and iii) functionalization of the BCB motif itself is achieved by metalation and trapping with electrophiles. The BCB sulfoximines are shown to react selectively with cysteine including in a protein model (CDK2) under biocompatible conditions. Preliminary data indicate suitability for chemoproteomic applications, and enantioselective cysteine&#8208;labelling. The reactivity of sulfoximine BCBs with electron withdrawing groups on nitrogen is comparable to acrylamides with low to moderate reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Iron(IV) Alkynylide Complexes and Their Reactivity to Form 1,3&#8208;diynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The isolation of thermally unstable and highly reactive organoiron(IV) complexes is a challenge for synthetic chemists. In particular, the number of examples where the C&#8208;based ligand is not part of the chelating ligand remains scarce. These compounds are of interest because they could pave the way to designing catalytic cycles of bond forming reactions proceeding via organoiron(IV) intermediates. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization, including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, of a family of alkynylferrates(III) and Fe(IV) alkynylide complexes. The alkynylferrates(III) are formed by transmetalation of the Fe(III) precursor [(N3N&#8217;)FeIII] (N3N&#8217; is tris(N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl&#8208;2&#8208;amidoethyl)amine)) with lithium alkynylides, and their further one&#8208;electron oxidation enables the synthesis of the corresponding Fe(IV) alkynylides. The electronic structure of this family of organometallic Fe(III) and Fe(IV) complexes has been thoroughly investigated by spectroscopic methods (EPR, NMR, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;Ray absorption (XAS) and emission (XES) spectroscopies) and theoretical calculations. While alkynylferrates(III) are sluggish to engage into C&#8211;C bond forming processes, the Fe(IV) alkynylides react to afford 1,3&#8208;diynes at room temperature. A bimolecular reductive elimination from a bimetallic iron(IV) intermediate to form the 1,3&#8208;diynes is proposed based on the mechanistic investigations performed.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired &#8220;Intermolecular Pocket&#8221; in Soft Molecular Crystal of Porous Organic Cage&#160;Exhibiting Reversible Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous Organic Cages (POCs) have gathered a lot of attention in sorts of fields. Previous studies often focused on the functionalization of their intrinsic porosity, while the utilization of the extrinsic porosity has been seldom reported. To date, the rational construction of functionalized extrinsic porosity in POCs is a serious challenge, which still relies on trial and error. Inspired by hydrophobic proteins, in the contribution, a POC (namely NKPOC&#8208;DS) is obtained with hydrophobic &#8220;intermolecular pocket&#8221; as extrinsic porosity constructed through the assembly of disulfide bonds with hydrophobic groups, facilitating strong supramolecular interactions as confirmed by Electrostatic Potential (ESP) maps and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Notably, NKPOC&#8208;DS exhibits a unique C2H6&#8208;selective "breathing behaviour" due to the presence of softness in its extrinsic porosity, which does not extend to other gases such as C2H4, CH4, CO2, N2, and H2. Such specific recognition of C2H6 thus provides NKPOC&#8208;DS with the ability to preferentially adsorb C2H6 from a C2H6/C2H4 mixture. The innovative approach of biomimicry in the design of functional POCs provides new insights into manipulating the packing of cages, paving the way for potential applications in guest recognition and adsorption separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Folding of Fluorinated Polyphenylene by Sulfur Fluorine Annulative Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that fluorinated polyphenylene P50 undergoes folding&#8208;like sulfur fluorine annulative substitution (SFAS) to form a well&#8208;defined tubular helix H50. This is achieved with atomic precision in an exceptionally efficient manner, involving the simultaneous transformation of 98 C&#8211;F bonds with the yield per reaction site approaching 99.9%. The desired product H50 features a fully fused dibenzothiophene skeleton of 5.8 helical turns in total. It is truly monodisperse (&#272; = 1.0) in nature, allowing for thorough spectroscopic characterizations. Unambiguous single crystal X&#8208;ray structure, distinct chiroptical properties, and intriguing through&#8208;cavity threading complexation are described. These results, in addition to those of H50&#8217;s lower congeners, H34 and H18, illustrate the great potential of folding&#8208;like SFAS in shaping random&#8208;coiled polymer chains into higher&#8208;order functional structures.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural channel proteins allow the selective permeation of ions, water or other nutritious entities across bilayer membranes, facilitating various essential physiological functions in living systems. Inspired by nature, chemists endeavor to simulate the structural features and transport behaviors of channel proteins through biomimetic strategies. In this review, we start from introducing the inherent traits of channel proteins such as their crystal structures, functions and mechanisms. Subsequently, different kind of synthetic ion channels including their design principles, dynamic regulations and therapeutic applications were carefully reviewed. Finally, the potential challenges and opportunities in this research field were also carefully discussed. It is anticipated that this review could provide some inspiring ideas and future directions towards the construction of novel bionic ion channels with higher&#8208;level structures, properties, functions and practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Heptannulated Perylene Diimides: Formation and Reactivity of Electron&#8208;Deficient Tropylium Cations and Heptafulvenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs opens pathways to previously unexplored classes of organic semiconductors and functional dyes. In this study, five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered carbocycles were fused at the ortho and bay regions of electron&#8208;deficient perylenes, starting from a common dialdehyde precursor. Structural analysis of the resulting perylene tetraesters, dianhydrides, and diimides (PDIs) revealed three distinct ring&#8208;fusion patterns and defined stereochemistry. The fused PDI cycloheptatrienes demonstrated susceptibility to acid&#8208;catalyzed transarylation, involving tropylium cation intermediates, which can be used preparatively. Under superacidic conditions, the PDI tropylium cations were directly observed and shown to undergo hydride&#8208;transfer reductions. Additionally, a fused PDI bis(heptafulvene) was synthesized by dehydrogenating a suitably substituted PDI cycloheptatriene. The final system contains two quinomethane units, which can be protonated to yield a stable tropylium&#8208;like dication.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezoionics is an emerging mechanical&#8208;electrical energy conversion paradigm that enables self&#8208;powered sensing systems for next&#8208;generation intelligent wearable electronics. However, there are currently no rational design approaches to enhance the stimulus response of piezoionic devices. Here, we present a strategy using crown ether as ion&#8208;selective mobility differential amplifiers for enhancing the pressured&#8208;induced voltage response in ionic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels. The crown ether grafted PVA (PVA&#8208;CE) hydrogel prototype achieves a 30&#8208;fold amplified piezoionic coefficient of 1490 nV Pa&#8722;1 within 0 &#8211; 1 kPa, compared to 49 nV Pa&#8722;1 of the unmodified PVA. The PVA&#8208;CE exhibits an ultra&#8208;low pressure detection limit of 0.2 Pa with a fast response time of 18.1 ms. Leveraging these properties, we further demonstrate a human somatosensory network analogous PVA&#8208;CE piezoionic skin using arrayed pressure sensing. These capabilities hold great promise for emerging healthcare applications such as synthetic biology, soft robotics, and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial and Temporal Visualization of Polymorphic Transformations in Pharmaceutical Tablets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>X&#8208;ray Diffraction Computed Tomography (XRD&#8208;CT) represents a cutting&#8208;edge method for non&#8208;destructive material analysis, offering the unique capability of providing molecular&#8208;level information with spatial resolution. In this study, we have applied XRD&#8208;CT to investigate pharmaceutically relevant tablets that have been subjected to a range of compression pressures typical in tablet manufacturing. By employing XRD&#8208;CT to pharmaceutical tablets, we reveal material changes without tablet destruction, thereby avoiding potential phase transformations during sample preparation that could lead to errors in the interpretation of the processes that have occurred. Utilizing a pressure&#8208;sensitive marker, glycolide, we have tracked changes within tablet structures induced by compression, pinpointing locations where glycolide undergoes pressure&#8208;induced transformation. Additionally, we conducted a follow&#8208;up study with analysis one month later, observing an in&#8208;situ hydrolysis reaction of glycolide within the tablets. Through the complementary use of electron diffraction, we have elucidated the structure of the hydrolysis product, further enhancing our understanding of temporal changes in the tablets.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Term&#160;Single&#8208;Molecule Tracking in Living Cells Using Weak&#8208;Affinity Protein Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;particle tracking (SPT) has become a powerful tool to monitor the dynamics of membrane proteins in living cells. However, permanent labeling strategies for SPT suffer from photobleaching as a major limitation, restricting observation times, and obstructing the study of long&#8208;term cellular processes within single living cells. Here, we use exchangeable HaloTag Ligands (xHTLs) as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;apply labeling approach for live&#8208;cell SPT and demonstrate extended observation times of individual live cells of up to 30 minutes. Using the xHTL/HaloTag7 labeling system, we measure the ligand&#8208;induced activation kinetics of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in single living cells. We generate spatial maps of receptor diffusion in cells, report non&#8208;uniform distributions of receptor activation, and the formation of spatially confined &#8216;hot spots&#8217; of EGFR activation. Furthermore, we measured the mobility of the ER&#8208;luminal protein calreticulin in living cells and found diffusion coefficients that correlated with the ER nano&#8208;structure. This approach represents a general strategy to monitor protein dynamics in a functional context and for extended observation times in single living cells.</dc:description>

Here, we use exchangeable HaloTag Ligands (xHTLs) as an easy-to-apply labeling approach for live-cell SPT and demonstrate extended observation times of individual live cells of up to 30 minutes. Using the xHTL/HaloTag7 labeling system, we measure the ligand-induced activation kinetics of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in single living cells. We generate spatial maps of receptor diffusion in cells, report non-uniform distributions of receptor activation, and the formation of spatially confined &#8216;hot spots&#8217; of EGFR activation. Furthermore, we measured the mobility of the ER-luminal protein calreticulin in living cells and found diffusion coefficients that correlated with the ER nano-structure. This approach represents a general strategy to monitor protein dynamics in a functional context and for extended observation times in single living cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>T&#8208;shaped 14 Electron Rhodium Complexes: Potential Active Species in C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two T&#8208;shaped 14&#8208;electron rhodium complexes 2a and 2b, "framed" and thus stabilized by PNP pincer ligands have been synthesized. The bis(t&#8208;butyl)phosphine derived PNPtBu&#8208;rhodium 2a was isolated from pentane as the more stable cyclometalated Rh(III) hydrido complex and found to be in equilibrium with the T&#8208;shaped 14e&#8208;Rh(I) complex 2aT which itself could be directly crystallized upon change of the solvent. The cyclometallation is suppressed using an adamantyl substituted PNPAd ligand to give the analogous T&#8208;shaped Rh(I) species 2b, stabilized through an agostic interaction with one of the adamantyl C&#8208;Hs. Depending on the solvent, complex 2a reacted with ethylene either by &#960;&#8208;coordination (4a) or C&#8208;H activation giving a hydrido&#8208;vinyl Rh(III) species 4b, both isomers being in equilibrium in solution. Complex 2b C&#8208;H was found to reversibly activate arenes to form the hydrido&#8208;aryl Rh(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Aeration&#8208;Free Photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction Mediated by Heterojunction Photocatalyst toward Efficient Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation by photo&#8208;assisted heterogeneous catalysis is under in&#8208;depth investigation with potential as a replaceable advanced oxidation process in water purification, yet it remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to construct polyethylene glycol (PEG) well&#8208;coupled dual&#8208;defect   VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx S&#8208;scheme heterojunction to degrade organic pollutants without aeration, which dramatically provides abundant active sites, excellent photo&#8208;thermal property, and distinct charge transport pathway for PMS activation. The degradation rate of VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx in anaerobic conditions shows a higher efficient rate (4.58 min&#8208;1 g&#8208;2) than in aerobic conditions (1.67 min&#8208;1 g&#8208;2). Experimental evidence reveals that VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx promotes more rapid redox conversion of photoexcited electrons induced by defects with PMS under anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic conditions. Additionally, in situ experiments and DFT provide mechanistic insights into the regulation pathway of PMS activation via synergistic defect&#8208;induced electron, revealing the competitive effect between O2 and PMS over VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx during the reaction process. The continuous flow reactor and flow cytometry results demonstrated that the VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx/PMS/Vis system has remarkably enhanced stability and purification capability for removing organic pollutants. This work provides valuable insights into regulating the heterologous catalysis oxidation process without aeration through the photoexcitation synergistic PMS activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Global Profiling Lysine Reactivity and Ligandability with Oxidant&#8208;Triggered Bioconjugation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the high abundance and diverse functions of lysine residues, both in the interior and on the surface of proteins, the development of new methods to characterize their reactivity and ligandability could significantly expand the pool of druggable targets. To date, only a limited number of aminophilic electrophiles have been assessed for interactions with the lysine proteome, resulting in a substantial fraction remaining inaccessible to current probes. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we report the first oxidant&#8208;triggered bioconjugation platform for in&#8208;depth profiling of lysines. We quantified over 7000 covalently modifiable lysine residues, which significantly expands the coverage of ligandable lysines in the whole proteome. Chemical proteomics enabled the mapping of more than 100 endogenous kinases, thus providing a comprehensive landscape of ligandable catalytic lysines within the kinome. Moreover, we identified a suite of new ligandable lysines such as K60 of ENO1 and K31 of PPIA, offering insights for exploring new functional and targetable residues. These findings could provide valuable clues for the development of novel targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs).</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation of ethanol/water or benzene/methanol azeotrope mixtures presents significant challenges, not only due to the limitations of conventional distillation techniques but also because of the constraints in developing and utilizing of new generation adsorbents. Porous organic molecular frameworks constructed via noncovalent &#960;&#8208;interactions are emerging as novel adsorbents with vast potential in gas adsorption and molecular separation. Herein, we report a permanent two&#8208;dimensional porous structure, namely TDTBA&#8208;1, which consists of two different kinds of pores through &#960;&#8208;stacking of a single organic molecule with highly&#160;Td&#160;symmetry. Activated TDTBA&#8208;1 exhibits excellent hydrophobicity, thermal stability, recoverability and high selectivity for ethanol over water, and benzene over methanol. Therefore, activated TDTBA&#8208;1 can be used as an efficient stationary phase for the separation of ethanol/water and benzene/methanol azeotropes by high&#8208;resolution gas chromatography.</dc:description>

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;hybridized Fused&#8208;ring Electron Acceptor with High Dielectric Constant and Isotropic Charge Transport for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel isotropic fullerene&#8208;hybridized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, designated C60&#8208;Y, has been synthesized via a mild [4+2] Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition reaction with fullerene C60 to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Comparative analysis shows that C60&#8208;Y significantly outperforms the control acceptor Me&#8208;Y, with a notable increase in the relative dielectric constant from 2.79 to 3.95. This improvement enhances exciton dissociation and reduces non&#8208;radiative energy losses. Additionally, the isotropic molecular packing of C60&#8208;Y, similar to fullerene, facilitates efficient interface formation with donor polymers and improves charge mobility. As a result, incorporating C60&#8208;Y as an electron acceptor increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary OSCs to 15.02%, surpassing the 13.31% achieved with Me&#8208;Y. Moreover, when integrated into a ternary blend system, an impressive PCE of 19.22% is achieved, top&#8208;performing among reported ternary OSCs utilizing fullerene derivatives as the third component. These results suggest that fullerene&#8208;hybridized acceptors like C60&#8208;Y hold great potential for advancing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs by enhancing exciton dissociation, reducing energy losses, and improving charge mobility.</dc:description>

         <title>Prolonging Charge Carrier lifetime via Intraband Defect Levels in S&#8208;scheme Heterojunctions for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>S&#8208;scheme heterostructure photocatalysts, distinguished by unique charge&#8208;transfer pathways and exceptional catalytic redox capabilities, have found widespread applications in addressing challenging chemical processes, including the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with a high reaction barrier. Nevertheless, the influence of intraband defect levels within S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions on charge separation, carrier lifetime, and surface catalytic reactions has, for the most part, been overlooked. Herein, we develop a tunable defect&#8208;level&#8208;assisted strategy to construct an electron reservoir, effectively prolonging the lifetime of charge carriers through the rapid capture and gradual release of photoelectrons within WO3&#8208;x/In2S3 S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, as authenticated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. The surface photoredox mechanism, unraveled by Gibbs free energy calculations, demonstrates that oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced defect states in WO3&#8208;x/In2S3 heterojunctions unlock the rate&#8208;determining H2O oxidation into free oxygen molecules by forming metastable oxygen intermediates, contributing to the facilitation of H2O photooxidation. This distinct role, combined with the extended carrier lifetime, results in boosted CO2 photoreduction with nearly 100% CO selectivity in the absence of any photosensitizer or scavenger. Our work sheds light on the role of controllable defect levels in governing charge transfer dynamics within S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, thereby inspiring the development of more advanced photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

Our work sheds light on the role of controllable defect levels in governing charge transfer dynamics within S-scheme heterojunctions, thereby inspiring the development of more advanced photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
