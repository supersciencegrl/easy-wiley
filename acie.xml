         <title>Pyridoxal&#8208;Inspired Photo&#8208;Decarboxylase Catalysis: Photochemical Decarboxylation of Unprotected Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photochemical organocatalytic method for the protodecarboxylation of unprotected amino acids is reported. Inspired by pyridoxal 5'&#8208;phosphate&#8208;dependent decarboxylase enzymes, the catalytic activation of amino acid substrates by 3&#8208;hydroxyisonicotinaldehyde enables a photochemical decarboxylation event, which can be leveraged in combination with a thiol co&#8208;catalyst. The necessary and sufficient structural features of the pyridoxal&#8208;like framework for photoactivity are determined using ultraviolet&#8208;visible absorption spectroscopy. A broad scope of unprotected amino acids can be decarboxylated in this system, with selectivity between multiple carboxylates realized on the possible basis of hyperconjugation. The ability to engage simple amino acids in decarboxylative functionalization at ambient conditions using a pyridoxal&#8208;mimicking organocatalyst enables new possibilities for the translation of biogenic amino acids into medicinally valuable amines.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating &#963;&#8208;Hole Interactions in Halogenated Additives for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells with 19.8% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of volatile solid additives has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the influence of the electronic structure of these additives on morphological evolution remains insufficiently understood. Herein, 1,4&#8208;Dibromobenzene (DBB) and 1,4&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;2,5&#8208;dibromobenzene (DFBB) are introduced as volatile additives into OSCs. Theoretical calculations indicate that DFBB has a higher electrostatic potential extremum and stronger &#963;&#8208;holes interaction compared to DBB, enabling more robust intermolecular interactions with acceptors. The synergistic halogen interactions between DFBB and the active layer matrix balances the differences in crystallinity between the donor and acceptor during the film formation process, promotes the formation of dense molecular packing and ordered orientation, optimizes the vertical composition distribution, and promotes the formation of domain sizes close to the exciton diffusion distance. Consequently, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device treated with DFBB achieves an efficiency of 19.2% with a fill factor (FF) of 80.8%, which is superior to the control and DBB. Further validation across various systems, including PM6:Y6, PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9, and D18:L8&#8208;BO, highlights similar efficiency enhancements, with the D18:L8&#8208;BO system achieving an outstanding PCE of 19.8%. This work demonstrates that the modulation of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions in volatile additives can effectively optimize multi&#8208;scale morphology for high&#8208;performance OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>An&#160;Azo Polymer with Abundant Active Sites and Extended Conjugation as a Stable Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing stable cathodes with high capacity and rapid redox kinetics is pivotal for aqueous zinc&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). A huge challenge lies in balancing the density of active sites and electronic conductivity of organic cathodes. Herein, an azo polymer from 4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrene&#8208;tetraone (PTAP) possessing high active components and extended conjugated structure was achieved. The extended conjugated system linked by the azo groups facilitates extensive electron delocalization and a low band gap, which endows the PTAP with enhanced electronic conductivity reaching 4.26&#215;10&#8315;3 S m&#8315;&#185;. The azo groups themselves serve as active centers for two&#8208;electron transfer, leading to a significant increase in the density of redox&#8208;active sites and charge storage efficiency. Moreover, strong intramolecular interactions and unique solvation structure bolster the anti&#8208;solubility of PTAP. Consequently, PTAP&#8208;based ZOBs exhibited high reversible capacities and rate performance, delivering 442.45 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 0.2 A g&#8315;&#185; and maintaining 248.61 mAh g&#8315;&#185; even at 10 A g&#8315;&#185;. Additionally, a ZOB showed remarkable long&#8208;term stability after cycling over 900 hours at 5 A g&#8315;&#185;. Mechanistic studies further revealed that multi&#8208;step coupling of carbonyl and azo groups accompanied by the Zn2+/H+ dual&#8208;ion insertion is responsible for rapid 12&#8208;electron transfer in PTAP.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Ethylene or Ethanol via Tuning *OH Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) into ethylene (C2H4) or ethanol (C2H5OH) is a high challenge. In this study, the rational manipulating of Cu defect sites was realized for the selective formation of C2H5OH and C2H4. Low&#8208;coordination amorphous and medium&#8208;coordination grain&#8208;boundary Cu defect sites with different *OH affinity were found to play a decisive role in the selective protonation of CH2CHO*. In particular, grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;rich Cu (denoted as Cu&#8208;1) that weakly adsorbed *OH and CH2CHO* favored the protonation on &#946;&#8208;C of CH2CHO*, leading to the selective production of C2H5OH. In contrast, amorphous Cu defect sites (denoted as Cu&#8208;3) showed strong *OH adsorption and then strong CH2CHO* adsorption, facilitating C&#8211;O breaking and C2H4 formation. In the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) configuration, a remarkably high full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (EE) of 29.0% for C2H5OH on Cu&#8208;1 and an impressive high full&#8208;cell EE of 25.6% for C2H4 on Cu&#8208;3 were observed. In addition, a C2H4 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 63.4&#177;1.5% was achieved on Cu&#8208;3 at a notable current of 12.5 A with a 25 cm&#8208;2 MEA configuration. These results provided crucial insights into the significance of defect sites in realizing the adsorption of *OH for the selective production of C2H4 or C2H5OH.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic&#160;Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation&#160;to Ethylene with High Energy Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation (EASH) provides a petroleum&#8208;independent strategy for ethylene production.&#160;However, the challenges of&#160;high overpotentials&#160;and strong hydrogen evolution competition reaction over conventional electrocatalysts at industrial current densities&#160;result in substantial&#160;energy consumption, limiting the practical application of EASH technology. Herein, zinc&#8208;doped copper&#160;catalysts are designed&#160;and prepared via a facile impregnation&#160;and electroreduction relay method. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;2.7Zn catalyst exhibits an ethylene partial current density of &#8722;0.29 A cm&#8722;2&#160;with a Faradaic&#160;efficiency of 96% and&#160;a reaction potential of &#8722;0.62 V&#160;versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing the previously reported electrocatalysts. The combined results of experimental tests and theoretical calculations demonstrate zinc doping significantly enhances acetylene adsorption and accelerates reaction kinetics, leading to a notable decrease&#160;in overpotential.&#160;Furthermore, the increased *H&#8208;*H binding energy barrier and the improved ethylene&#160;desorption on Cu&#8208;2.7Zn effectively suppress hydrogen evolution&#160;and acetylene over&#8208;hydrogenation, contributing to&#160;the enhancement of ethylene Faradaic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Metabolism&#8208;inspired chemical reaction networks for chemically driven dissipative oligoesterification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolism is a complex network of chemical reactions in which transient biomolecules are continuously produced and degraded. Mimicking this dynamic process in synthetic systems poses a considerable challenge, as it requires designs that enable the exchange of energy and matter among transient molecules. In this study, we explored a chemically driven oligoesterification process operating within a highly intricate reaction network and constructed a dynamic library of transient oligoesters. Our kinetic analysis uncovered an intriguing phenomenon: oligoesters undergo parasitic exchanges, consuming one another to sustain the system's dynamics before reaching thermodynamic equilibrium. This discovery opens new opportunities for designing synthetic systems that replicate the complexity and self&#8208;sustaining behavior of metabolic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Patternable and Healable Polymer Semiconductor Enabled by Dynamic Covalent Disulfide Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Apart from charge transport property, polymer semiconductors with patternable and healable functions are highly demanding for the fabrication of organic circuits. Herein, by leveraging the dynamic covalent disulfide bonding of thioctic acid (TA) groups, we successfully integrate photo&#8208;patterning and thermal&#8208;healing capabilities into a single diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer semiconductor for the first time. The results show that the thin film of DPP&#8208;based conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor polymer with TA groups in the side chains exhibits excellent photo&#8208;patterning capability under 365 nm UV light irradiation, with sensitivity (S) of 210 mJ&#183;cm&#8208;2 and contrast (&#947;) of 1.2. Importantly, the patterning process has minimal impact on thin film morphology, interchain stacking, and charge transport mobility. Moreover, the patterned thin films, which were initially scratched, can be well healed after exposure to chloroform vapor and further thermal annealing, and simultaneously the charge mobility can be restored. In comparison, the scratched thin film of PDPP4T without TA groups in the side chains achieves only 82.6% recovery of scratch depth and 54.5% recovery of charge mobility under the same conditions. These results demonstrate the feasibility of constructing multifunctional polymer semiconductors by incorporating TA groups in the side chains, offering a new pathway to lithography&#8208;compatible, self&#8208;healing smart flexible devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Low&#8208;Cytotoxic and Highly Efficient Type I Photoinitiators for Visible LED&#8208;/Sunlight&#8208;Induced Photopolymerization and High&#8208;Precision 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of photoinitiators (PIs) combining high initiation ability, low&#8208;toxicity, and availability for high&#8208;precision 3D printing is a key challenge in photopolymerization that has never been reported before. In this study, carbazole chalcone glyoxylate oxime ester derivatives (denoted as Cs, C1&#8208;C5) containing both glyoxylate and oxime ester moieties with good light absorption properties in the visible range have been designed as type I PIs. Subsequent experimental results clearly show that the photoinitiation ability of C5 outperforms that of the benchmark commercial PIs (methyl benzoylformate (MBF) and diphenyl (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl) phosphine oxide (TPO)) under the same conditions. In addition, C5 is successfully applied to 3D printing for the manufacture of large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;resolution object. The photochemical mechanism of C5 is systematically and comprehensively analyzed using a combination of steady state photolysis, decarboxylation reaction, fluorescence experiments, and electron spin resonance&#8208;spin trapping (ESR&#8208;ST) technology. Furthermore, the low&#8208;toxicity of C5 is evidenced by cytotoxicity assays. The comprehensive molecular modeling and experimental approach adopted in this research has led to the development of novel PIs that are highly efficient and low&#8208;toxic, and can be used for high&#8208;precision 3D printing, which offers broad application prospects in the fields of environmental sustainability, visible light curing, and biomedical science.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Efficient Upcycling of Polyesters from Waste Plastic Blends Enabled by a Rationally Designed&#160; Manganese Pincer Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a new class of earth&#8208;abundant pincer manganese catalysts that not only enable the efficient conversion of single&#8208;component post&#8208;consumer polyesters with a turnover number (TON) of up to 5300, but more importantly, allow the selective upcycling of polyesters from waste plastic blends (e.g., nylon, PA; polyethylene, PE; polyurethane, PU; polyvinyl chloride, PVC; cotton) or contaminants such as pigment, aluminum, or glass into highly valuable oxygenated products under mild conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies combined with DFT calculations revealed that the exceptional efficiency of this protocol is due to the use of rationally designed quinaldine&#8208;based PNNH&#8208;type Mn complexes with an extended &#960;&#8208;system and an N&#8208;H moiety on the side arm to simultaneously enhance the stability and reactivity of the catalyst. In addition, the incorporation of dual metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) relay catalysis more effectively facilitates the key steps of this transformation, including H2 activation and hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted hydride transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Enzyme&#8211;Micelle Self&#8208;Assembled Systems for Semi&#8208;Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular surfactants provide a versatile platform to construct systems for solar fuel synthesis, for example via the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic photosensitizers and catalysts into diverse supramolecular structures. However, the utilization of amphiphilic photosensitizers in solar fuel production has predominantly focused on yielding gaseous products, such as molecular hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4) with turnover number (TON) of synthetic catalysts typically in the range of hundreds to thousands. Inspired by biological lipid&#8211;protein interactions, we present herein a novel bio&#8208;hybrid assembly strategy that utilizes photosensitizers as surfactants to form micellar scaffolds that interface with enzymes, namely hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenases, for semi&#8208;artificial photosynthesis. Specifically, surfactants with a [ruthenium tris(2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine)]2+ head group provide high photocatalytic activity upon association with the enzymes as their positively charged [Ru]2+ center electrostatically interacts with the enzymes favorably to enable direct electron transfer at the micelle&#8208;enzyme interface. Time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy support the beneficial charge carrier dynamics of the reductively quenched [Ru]+ species when the enzymes are introduced in the micellar solution. Thus, a new concept is introduced for solar fuel synthesis using a biomimetic enzyme&#8211;micellar system, providing also a platform for other photocatalytic transformations using enzymes in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluoro&#8208;Fucosylation Enables the Interrogation of the Lea&#8208;LecB Interaction by BioNMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis antigen Lea is a selective ligand for Lectin B in P. aeruginosa. Interrogating a key hydrogen bond in this complex has important ramifications for antibiotic research. Through the development of stereoselective fluoro&#8208;fucosylation, it has been possible to design F&#8208;Lea as a structural biology tool. BioNMR analyses with both the native (Lea) and fluorinated (F&#8208;Lea) glycans have unequivocally established the importance of this interaction in the Lea&#8208;LecB complex.







Abstract
Fucosylation patterns in cell&#8208;surface glycans are essential mediators of recognition and signalling. Aberrations in these signatures serve as vital diagnostic markers of disease progression, and so understanding fucose&#8208;protein interactions at the molecular level is crucial. Molecular editing of l&#8208;fucose (Fuc) at C2 with fluorine provides a platform to reconcile the ubiquity of fucosylation with the paucity of strategies to interrogate site&#8208;specific interactions. Through judicious introduction of a pseudo&#8208;equatorial fluorine [C(sp3)&#8208;F] adjacent to the anomeric position, &#946;&#8208;selective fucosylation can be achieved with a range of diverse acceptors (&gt;50&#8201;:&#8201;1): the selectivity of this process can be inverted through changes in the donor scaffold. Reaction development was driven by the desire to construct a fluorinated analogue of Lewis antigen a (F&#8208;Lea), in which fluorine replaces a key OH group at C2. Lea is a ligand for Lectin B (LecB) in the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and thus delineating the importance of key interactions in this complex has ramifications for drug discovery. Independent syntheses of Lea and F&#8208;Lea, and systematic bioNMR analyses with both glycans has unequivocally established the essential role of O2 of fucose in the Lea&#8208;LecB complex.

         <title>Hydrogenation of Organic Molecules via Direct Mechanocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free, safe mechanochemical method for hydrogenation and dehalogenation is presented. Using catalyst&#8208;plated vessels and H2 gas, various functional groups are efficiently reduced at ambient conditions. Alkenes and alkynes are fully hydrogenated in 20&#8197;min (&gt;99&#8201;% yield). Carbonyls are converted to alcohols (95&#8211;99&#8201;% yield), while nitro groups are reduced to amines (&gt;95&#8201;% yield). Dehalogenation of chloro&#8208;, bromo&#8208;, and iodo&#8208;compounds proceeds efficiently. Choice of catalyst and reaction conditions enable chemoselective transformations. This versatile approach offers a cost&#8208;effective, recyclable system for hydrogenation reactions.







Abstract
Mechanochemical hydrogenation of unsaturated C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O, as well as N&#8722;O and C&#8722;X bonds is successfully achieved without the use of solvents, ligands, or catalyst powders via ball milling. A variety of catalysts are electroplated onto the walls of the milling vessel, allowing for simple recycling and reuse of the catalytic material. Hydrogen gas is directly introduced into the milling vessel, eliminating the need for hydrogen donor compounds which contribute to waste production and suboptimal atom economy. This approach enables the quantitative hydrogenation of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, achieving near&#8208;complete conversion within just 20 minutes at ambient temperature and pressures as low as 1.5&#8197;bar. Carbonyls, nitro groups, and organohalides were converted within reaction times of up to 12&#8197;hours. Mechanistic investigations suggest the reaction to be following established mechanisms for hydrogenation. Finally, chemoselective hydrogenation of various reducible functional groups was explored, demonstrating the versatility and efficiency of this solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical approach with simple catalyst recycling for hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Divergent Total Syntheses of Six Crinipellin&#8208;Type Diterpenoids through Tandem 4&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization/Dicycloexpansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A more straightforward approach to synthesize densely congested crinipellins has been accomplished in just 9&#8211;11 steps through strategic tandem 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization/dicycloexpansion cascade and a series of highly regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208;, and diastereoselective late&#8208;stage transformations without using protecting groups.







Abstract
Crinipellins are a significant class of naturally occurring highly congested tetraquinane diterpenoids, with many members exhibiting bio&#8208;important antibacterial and anticancer activities. However, their complex structures, particularly their dense 5/5/5/5 tetracyclic frameworks, have made efficient synthesis challenging, leading chemists to attempt to create highly efficient and divergent routes. This study presents a concise, divergent synthesis of six crinipellins, completed in just 9&#8211;11 steps using commercially available materials. Particular highlights include: (1) a vital one&#8208;step 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization/dicycloexpansion cascade that rapidly constructs the angular/fused tetraquinane scaffold with two contiguous quaternary carbons, and (2) strategic functionalizations through iso&#8208;propylation, methylation, and Wacker oxidation/dehydrogenation, enabling the divergent syntheses of the six crinipellin members without using protecting groups. This approach provides a versatile platform for accessing additional crinipellin derivatives, which we believe will benefit medicinal and biological research.

         <title>Reinventing the High&#8208;rate Energy Storage of Hard Carbon: the Order&#8208;degree Governs the Trade&#8208;off of Desolvation&#8208;Solid Electrolyte Interphase at Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrode/electrolyte interface processes involve two key steps: ion desolvation and ion transport through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and the determining factor of which one affects the performance of hard carbon is limited by the microstructure of the hard carbon. In a more disordered state, solvation and SEI work in concert; however, as the degree of order increases, the role of the solvation structure becomes more pronounced than that of the SEI.







Abstract
In alkali metal&#8208;ion battery systems, the electrolyte enables being decomposed on the electrode surface to form a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film. In principle, a thin, uniform SEI film facilitates the enhancement of the performance of the cell. Herein, we successfully distinguish the effects of desolvation behavior and SEI process on the kinetic behavior of hard carbon (HC) electrodes by adopting the strategy of switching the electrolyte interface model to modulate the properties of SEI film. Our findings reveal that although the SEI film is generally responsible for significantly affecting the HC's capacity, the equally crucial desolvation process must not be overlooked. The trade&#8208;off between the two factors is found to be determined by the structural features of HCs. Specifically, in the context of a more ordered HC, the desolvation of ions emerges as the rate&#8208;limiting step for Na+ transport across the electrode/electrolyte interface, exerting a more pronounced effect rather than the SEI. Thus, a close correlation was established between the SEI, solvation structure effects, hard carbon structure, and electrode performance. This linkage is thereof fundamental for the strategic design of electrolytes and the targeted enhancement of cell performance.

         <title>Insights into Co&#8208;Catalytic Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Support Interactions for Boosting Sulfur Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interactions between cobalt single&#8208;atom catalysts and graphitic carbon nitride (Co&#8208;GCN) facilitate strong binding with lithium polysulfides through the formation of Li&#8722;N and Co&#8722;S bonds. This co&#8208;contribution of Co&#8208;GCN significantly lowers the activation energy (Ea) for the sulfur reduction reactions, thereby inhibiting the shuttle effect and resulting in an enhanced electrochemical performances in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
The use of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with abundant electrocatalytic centers has been identified as the most desirable strategy to inhibit the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. However, the co&#8208;contribution from SAC and its support via their interactions for accelerating the sulfur reduction reactions (SRR) has so far received little attention, since the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Herein, guided by density functional theory calculations, Cobalt&#8208;SACs supported on a graphitic carbon nitride substrate (Co&#8208;GCN), are selected to elucidate the co&#8208;catalytic role in enhancing the SRR. The inherent high charge polarity of GCN, combined with its unique tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine structure, offers multiple binding sites for lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) through Li&#8722;N bonds, as well as N/C&#8208;coordinated frameworks for anchoring Co&#8208;SACs. This structural configuration further amplifies the interaction with LiPSs via Co&#8722;S bonds. Consequently, both Co&#8208;SACs and GCN actively participate in sulfur reduction electrocatalysis by binding LiPS intermediates, lowering the conversion energy barrier of SRR. Benefitting from such unique synergy, the battery demonstrates outstanding rate performance (718.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#8197;C) and yields a high areal capacity of up to 13.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (1584.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) under a high areal sulfur loading of 8.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 but a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1.

         <title>Localized Alkaline Microenvironments Enhanced upon Tip Effects for Efficient Antibacterial Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuO nanowires can effectively accumulate OH&#8722; in the solution through the tip&#8208;enhanced effect, creating a highly alkaline microenvironment and thereby providing conditions for electrochemical in situ disinfection.







Abstract
The electrochemical disinfection mechanism primarily relies on a high&#8208;voltage pulsed electric field and electrocatalytic generation of highly oxidative radicals but suffers from shortcomings of either high voltages (dozens of kV) or significant gas supply. This study proposes an in situ electrocatalytic sterilization strategy that forms localized alkaline microenvironments in neutral electrolytes under a constant current of &#8722;12&#8197;mA at a relatively lower voltage (&#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE). The nanowire cathode surface can effectively adsorb hydronium ions (H3O+) from the solution during H2 evolution, leading to a rapid increase in hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;) concentration in the surrounding solution. This leads to a high diffusion zone of OH&#8722;, creating a localized alkaline microenvironment. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and finite element analysis (FEA) reveal that the nanowire&#8208;derived tip&#8208;enhanced effect significantly enhances OH&#8722; accumulation around the cathode, effectively inactivating Escherichia coli (E. coli) at 107&#8197;CFU/mL within 3 minutes at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V. The resulting increase in OH&#8722; concentration drives rapid sterilization by inhibiting bacterial ATP synthesis and inducing oxidative stress. This method can efficiently inactivate microorganisms in a short time, while having minimal impact on the overall pH of the environment, making it a safe and environmentally friendly approach.

&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical disinfection mechanism primarily relies on a high-voltage pulsed electric field and electrocatalytic generation of highly oxidative radicals but suffers from shortcomings of either high voltages (dozens of kV) or significant gas supply. This study proposes an &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; electrocatalytic sterilization strategy that forms localized alkaline microenvironments in neutral electrolytes under a constant current of &#8722;12&#8197;mA at a relatively lower voltage (&#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs. RHE). The nanowire cathode surface can effectively adsorb hydronium ions (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) from the solution during H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution, leading to a rapid increase in hydroxide ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) concentration in the surrounding solution. This leads to a high diffusion zone of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, creating a localized alkaline microenvironment. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and finite element analysis (FEA) reveal that the nanowire-derived tip-enhanced effect significantly enhances OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; accumulation around the cathode, effectively inactivating &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;) at 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;CFU/mL within 3 minutes at &#8722;0.5&#8197;V. The resulting increase in OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; concentration drives rapid sterilization by inhibiting bacterial ATP synthesis and inducing oxidative stress. This method can efficiently inactivate microorganisms in a short time, while having minimal impact on the overall pH of the environment, making it a safe and environmentally friendly approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Preparation and Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkenyl Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facile preparation of alkenyl sulfoximines, monoaza analogues of sulfones, by condensation of alkyl sulfoximines with aldehydes and their palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling are reported. These alkenyl electrophiles underwent unique oxidative addition of the C&#8722;S bond to Pd to provide alkenes with three substituents. DFT calculations revealed the crucial role of the boronic acid in the transformation.







Abstract
Although numerous transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions of alkenyl electrophiles with a sulfur(VI) leaving group, mainly alkenyl sulfones, have been developed, most rely heavily on highly nucleophilic Grignard reagents, and the use of organoboron reagents remains challenging. We report herein facile preparation and the following Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction of alkenyl sulfoximine, a monoaza analog of sulfone. The condensation of alkyl sulfoximine with aldehydes, developed in this study, makes alkenyl sulfoximines more readily available. The resulting alkenes undergo an unprecedented oxidative addition of the C&#8722;S bond to the Pd center. This cross&#8208;coupling proceeds with retention of its original stereochemistry and provided alkenes bearing three different functionalities in a stereoselective fashion. DFT calculations highlight the critical role of boronic acid and in situ&#8208;generated boroxines in facilitating this transformation.

         <title>Tailoring Sodium Carboxymethylcellulose Binders for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 via Thermal Pulse Sintering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal pulse sintering is proposed to modify carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC) binder by converting carboxyl groups into ether linkages (&#8208;C&#8722;O&#8722;C&#8208;). This process produces uniform binder coatings on LiCoO2, forming protective layers and enhancing charge carrier pathways for high&#8208;voltage operation, paving the way for scalable and cost&#8208;effective multifunctional binder development.







Abstract
Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), as the commercial cathode binder for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, presents several practical challenges, including insufficient conductivity, weak adhesion to active materials, and the use of toxic N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone for slurry preparation. However, while most water&#8208;soluble binders can address the aforementioned issues, they fail to meet the requirements of high&#8208;voltage cathodes. In this work, we innovatively employed a thermal pulse sintering strategy to modify carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC), enabling their application in 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 (93&#8201;% capacity retention after 200 cycles). This strategy facilitates the decomposition of electrochemically active carboxyl groups, leading to ring opening reactions that generate numerous ether linkages (&#8208;C&#8722;O&#8722;C&#8208;) without introducing undesirable side effects on LiCoO2. The resulting components form additional charge carrier (i.e., Li+ and e&#8722;) pathways on the cathode surface. Additionally, the heating process also promotes uniform coating of the binder on the surface of LiCoO2, creating a protective layer that inhibits interfacial side reactions. Through proposing a scalable and economic manufacturing technology of multifunctional binder, this work enlightens the avenues for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Switchable Polymerization from Monomer Mixtures to Synthesize Oxygen&#8208;Rich Block Copolymers with Dual Recyclability and Degradability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable polymerization from mixtures of epoxide congeners can yield oxygenated block copolymers with diverse functionality, yet remains unexplored due to similar reactivities. Here, well&#8208;defined polyacetal/polycarbonate block copolymers were synthesized via switchable process from mixtures of terminal epoxides/internal epoxides/o&#8208;phthalaldehyde/CO2. The copolymers, with acid/base labile properties, enable sequence&#8208;controlled depolymerization.







Abstract
Switchable catalysis from monomer mixtures has been emerging as a powerful technique to synthesize various useful block copolymers, yet represents a significant challenge in polymer chemistry. Herein, we present the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polyacetal/polycarbonate block copolymers through switchable polymerization from mixtures of terminal epoxides, internal epoxides, o&#8208;phthalaldehyde (OPA) and CO2. The exclusive chemoselectivity of terminal epoxide or internal epoxide was achieved by controlling the reaction atmosphere. The dynamic equilibrium of acetal anion and alkoxy anion is the key to the successful switch from terminal epoxides/OPA copolymerization to internal epoxides/CO2 copolymerization. Computational studies elucidated the kinetic and thermodynamic preferences underlying this selective polymerization. The acid/base labile nature of the block copolymers enables their sequence&#8208;controlled chemical recycling/degradation. These novel polyacetal/polycarbonate block copolymers with facilely sequence&#8208;controlled polymerization/depolymerization capabilities will enable their further tailored applications and contribute to the development of a circular plastic economy.

         <title>Improving Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Iron Tetraphenylporphyrin with Triethanolamine as a CO2 Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of Fe porphyrins can be significantly enhanced with triethanolamine, which can function as a CO2 shuttle to capture CO2 and bring it to the Fe porphyrin site for binding and activation. The unique tripodal structure of triethanolamine is essential for capturing CO2 to form a zwitterionic alkylcarbonate. This work is significant to present a new strategy to promote the activation of CO2 in solutions.







Abstract
Delivering CO2 molecules to catalyst sites is a vital step in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Achievements have been made to develop efficient catalysts, but few efforts have been dedicated to improving CO2 delivering in solutions. Herein, we report on electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion using Fe tetraphenylporphyrin (FeTPP) as a catalyst and triethanolamine as a CO2 shuttle. Compared to ethanol, the electrocatalytic CO2RR current with triethanolamine increases by more than three times. We show that triethanolamine can effectively capture a CO2 molecule to form a zwitterionic alkylcarbonate through the collaboration between its tripodal alcohol and amine units. This alkylcarbonate can release the bound CO2 molecule for activation at the Fe site upon its interaction with FeTPP. In addition to shuttling CO2, alkylcarbonates can also provide protons to assist the C&#8722;O bond cleavage. Therefore, this work is significant to demonstrate a new strategy to improve electrocatalytic CO2RR by shuttling CO2.

A main&#8208;chain fluorinated polymer electrolyte that integrates high oxidative resistance of polytetrafluoroethylene with lithium metal compatibility of polyether (FEOP) was developed, enabling the practical 4.7&#8197;V solid&#8208;state lithium metal pouch cells with an energy density of 405.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and maintain stable cycling over 70 cycles.







Abstract
Polymer electrolytes are crucial for advancing safe, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries. Therefore, such electrolytes must possess stability with high&#8208;voltage cathodes and lithium metal, ensuring efficient interfacial contact and high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity. In this study, we present a novel main&#8208;chain fluorinated polymer electrolyte, FEOP, synthesized through cationic ring&#8208;opening polymerization. FEOP integrates high oxidative resistance of polytetrafluoroethylene with lithium metal compatibility of polyether, achieving an oxidation potential of up to 5.6&#8197;V and an anion&#8208;involved solvation structure. The exceptional stability enables NCM811 cells to deliver an impressive cycling life of 2000 cycles at 1&#8197;C up to 4.5&#8197;V. Furthermore, at ultra&#8208;high cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.7 and 4.9&#8197;V, both NCM811 and LNMO cells demonstrate stable cycling over 700 cycles, marking the longest lifespan for polymer&#8208;based batteries under these challenging conditions. Moreover, 4.7&#8197;V solid&#8208;state lithium metal pouch cells incorporating FEOP exhibit an energy density of 405.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and maintain stable cycling over 70 cycles, while successfully passing industry&#8208;standard nail penetration tests. Moreover, FEOP demonstrate excellent compatibility with ultra&#8208;high&#8208;loading electrode (70&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), achieving an exceptional areal capacity of 16.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. These results provide a solid foundation for designing practical electrolytes that enable next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;safety solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Desymmetrization of 1,4&#8208;Diynes by Allylic Alcohol&#8208;Triggered Redox Enyne Cycloisomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein an unprecedented desymmetrization of 1,4&#8208;diynes via a Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric redox cycloisomerization. This method operates through a novel mechanism involving initiation at the allylic alcohol moiety, and provides efficient access to multi&#8208;functional pyrrolidines and tetrahydrofurans in high to excellent stereoselectivities. Diverse derivatizations of the heterocyclic products including intriguing skeletal rearrangements have also been demonstrated.







Abstract
We report herein an unprecedented desymmetrization of 1,4&#8208;diynes via a Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric redox cycloisomerization. This method adopts allylic alcohol&#8208;containing diynes and provides efficient access to multi&#8208;functional pyrrolidines and tetrahydrofurans in high to excellent stereoselectivities. Mechanistic studies highlighted an innovative catalytic pathway that differs from the classical enyne cycloisomerization and involves initiation at the allylic alcohol moiety. Diverse derivatizations of the heterocyclic products including intriguing skeletal rearrangements have also been demonstrated.

         <title>Back Cover: Diastereoselective Polypseudorotaxane Formation with Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arenes via Co&#8208;crystallization Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diastereoselective polypseudorotaxane formation via co&#8208;crystallization of stereodynamic planar chiral pillar[5]arene and polyethylene glycol is reported by Tomoki Ogoshi et al. in their Research Article (e202420115). In the image, the bracelet represents the polypseudorotaxane, with blue and red stones depicting the pS and pR forms of the pillar[5]arene ring, respectively. The crystals between the stones imply the crystallization method. As the number of stones increases, the possible combinations multiply, making selection more difficult, but ultimately, you will find the bracelet that suits you best.

         <dc:description>
Oligophosphorylated peptides were prepared by Kevin Qian, Bj&#246;rn Hanf, Christopher Cummins, and Dorothea Fiedler in their Research Article (e202419147). Oligophosphorimidazolide reagents are presented that enable the conjugation of multiple phosphates to phosphopeptides, yielding derivatives with monodisperse phosphate chain lengths. The picture illustrates different peptides with varying phosphate chain lengths, bearing either a terminal protecting group or a free oligophosphate moiety.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Bridging Electrolyte Bulk and Interfacial Chemistry: Dynamic Protective Strategy Enable Ultra&#8208;Long Lifespan Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main bottleneck of rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) is their limited cycle lifespans stemming from the unhealthy electrolyte bulk and fragile interface. In their Research Article (e202418524), Jun Huang, Yiwang Chen et al. report a dynamic protective strategy to bridge electrolyte bulk and interfacial chemistry for ultra&#8208;long lifespan AZBs, which greatly unlocks the potential for an extended service lifespan for advanced AZBs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multidentate neutral halogen bonding catalysts based on iodinated icosahedral ortho&#8208;carborane moieties are introduced. Co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;studies, calorimetric measurements, and 1H NMR titrations demonstrate their strong binding to halides and neutral compounds, further underlined by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Thus, their superior Lewis acidity compared to traditional perfluorinated halogen&#8208;bond donors has been shown. The iodocarborane catalysts also outperformed the latter in a halide abstraction reaction and catalyzed a nitro&#8208;Michael addition reaction, which was previously out of reach for neutral halogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based organocatalysts.</dc:description>

Thus, their superior Lewis acidity compared to traditional perfluorinated halogen-bond donors has been shown. The iodocarborane catalysts also outperformed the latter in a halide abstraction reaction and catalyzed a nitro-Michael addition reaction, which was previously out of reach for neutral halogen-bonding-based organocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Infrared&#8208;Detecting Organic Semiconductors Featuring a Tetraheterocyclic Core with Reduced Ionization Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron acceptor containing an asymmetric tetraheterocyclic core with a reduced ionization potential has been shown to exhibit a narrow optical band gap of 1.00&#8197;eV and a remarkably low Urbach energy of 22.0&#8197;meV. The fabricated organic photodetectors demonstrate high specific detectivities comparable to those of germanium photodetectors at wavelengths below 1.2&#8197;&#956;m.







Abstract
Infrared organic semiconductors are crucial in organic optoelectronics, yet high&#8208;performance materials with photoresponse beyond 1.1&#8197;&#956;m (the limit of crystalline silicon) remain scarce due to the limit of building blocks including strong electron&#8208;donating units. Here, we report an asymmetric tetraheterocycle (TPCT) with a reduced ionization potential of 6.18&#8197;eV relative to those reported dithiophene&#8208;based electron&#8208;donating blocks, and TPCT&#8208;2F and TPCTO&#8208;2F constructed with TPCT as the core exhibit absorption onset up to 1&#8197;&#956;m and 1.4&#8197;&#956;m, respectively. Especially, TPCTO&#8208;2F possesses a narrow band gap of 1.00&#8197;eV and displays a small Urbach energy of 22.0&#8197;meV comparable to or even lower than those of some typical inorganic short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) semiconductors (13&#8211;44&#8197;meV). The organic photodetectors (OPDs) based on TPCT&#8208;2F achieve a peak detectivity (D*) of 2.2&#215;1013 Jones at 810&#8197;nm under zero bias, among the highest values for reported OPDs and on par with commercial silicon photodetectors. Impressively, TPCTO&#8208;2F&#8208;based OPDs demonstrate a wide response from 0.3 to 1.4&#8197;&#956;m and high D* comparable to germanium photodetector at wavelengths &lt;1.2&#8197;&#956;m with a maximum D* of 2.3&#215;1011 Jones at 1.06&#8197;&#956;m in SWIR region.

         <title>Enhanced Azo Dye Removal through Sequential Ultrasound&#8208;Assisted&#8208;Treatment and Photocatalysis Using CdZnS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sequential adsorption&#8208;photocatalytic system for the efficient degradation of complex dye mixtures in concentrated wastewater, showcasing enhanced removal kinetics and superior pollutant&#8208;catalyst interaction.







Abstract
The treatment of high&#8208;concentration azo dyes remains challenging due to the inherent limitations of conventional single&#8208;mode approaches. Here, we propose an integrated strategy that sequentially combines ultrasound&#8208;assisted adsorption with photocatalysis using CdZnS solid solutions to efficiently and rapidly remove high&#8208;concentration azo dyes. CdZnS exhibits high adsorption capacity and exceptional photocatalytic activity, enabling initial dye capture and enrichment, followed by significantly enhanced photocatalytic degradation. The adsorption of Congo Red (CR) on CdZnS solid solutions follows the Freundlich and pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order models, demonstrating a multilayer adsorption behavior involving physical and chemical interactions. Ultrasound assistance during the first stage not only significantly reduces equilibrium time, but also results in enhanced negative charges in CdZnS that extend to the subsequent photocatalysis stage. This charge enhancement substantially improves CR photodegradation performance, establishing synergistic interactions between ultrasonic treatment and photodegradation. The system demonstrates excellent performance in treating both concentrated single dyes and complex dye mixtures, maintaining high efficiency over multiple treatment cycles. This integrated approach provides new insights for developing more effective technologies for dye degradation and practical wastewater treatment applications.

         <title>Glucuronidase&#8208;Instructed Glycopeptide Self&#8208;Assembly for Selective Killing of Cancer Cells through Lysosomal Membrane Permeabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glucuronidase&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly of a glycopeptide induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization and apoptosis in cancer cells. This glycopeptide also synergizes with cisplatin and adriamycin to enhance cytotoxicity, including in drug&#8208;resistant cancer strains.







Abstract
Current cancer treatments face significant challenges, including limited tumor specificity and drug resistance. Enzyme&#8208;instructed supramolecular peptide assembly targeting lysosomes offers a promising strategy to address these issues; however, self&#8208;assembling units that withstand lysosomal conditions are still scarce. Herein, we present a versatile glycopeptide incorporating glucuronic acid and glucose that undergoes glucuronidase&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly to form nanofibers, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) in cancer cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that in glucuronidase&#8208;overexpressing HepG2 cells, glycopeptide assembly induces cytoskeletal disruption and apoptosis. The involvement of carbohydrate&#8208;binding receptor in enhancing the cellular entry of glycopeptides and improving proteolytic stability highlights the importance of glycan modification. Notably, combining this glycopeptide with cisplatin or Adriamycin results in synergistic cytotoxicity, including in drug&#8208;resistant cancer cell lines. These findings establish a novel, LMP&#8208;inducing glycopeptide scaffold for developing targeted approaches for cancer treatment.

         <title>Regulating the Spatially Folded Arrangement of Donor and Acceptor Units To Achieve Efficient Orange&#8208;Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of rigid orange&#8208;red emitters with &#8220;U&#8221;&#8208;shaped, folded &#8220;Z&#8221;&#8208;shaped and &#8220;W&#8221;&#8208;shaped configurations have been constructed. The excited state and photophysical properties of the emitters can be effectively regulated by changing the three&#8208;dimensional architectures. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on QX36 exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency of up to 32.3&#8201;%, the highest for solution&#8208;processed orange&#8208;red OLEDs.







Abstract
Achieving efficient long&#8208;wavelength organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a challenge due to the energy gap law, which leads to increased non&#8208;radiative decay rates as the emission wavelength shifts to longer regions. Herein, a strategy of constructing folded three&#8208;dimensional architectures is proposed to explore new orange&#8208;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with through&#8208;space charge transfer characteristics. Innovatively, naphthalene is selected as a bridge to connect O&#8208;bridged triphenylamine donor and planar dibenzo[a,c]phenazine acceptor respectively via simple Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Coupling. In this way, a series of rigid orange&#8208;red emitters with &#8220;U&#8221;&#8208;shaped, folded &#8220;Z&#8221;&#8208;shaped and &#8220;W&#8221;&#8208;shaped configurations are elaborately constructed by modifying end groups, adjusting the numbers of naphthalene and donor, and regulating the linkage sites. The excited state natures and photophysical properties of the emitters can be effectively regulated and optimized by changing three&#8208;dimensional architectures. Finally, the prepared emitter QX36 achieves a lower non&#8208;radiative transition rate, a higher radiative rate and a higher photoluminescence quantum efficiency. Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based QX36 present the excellent electroluminescent performance with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 32.3&#8201;% and EQE of 20.6&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, which are the leading values of solution&#8208;processed orange&#8208;red OLEDs. This work demonstrates the promising potential of folded TADF based naphthalene backbone as emitters for future efficient solution&#8208;processed long&#8208;wavelength OLEDs.

         <title>Multiple Deuterium Atom Transfer Perdeuteration of Unactivated Alkenes under Base&#8208;Assisted Cobalt/Photoredox Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical approach for hydrogenative perdeuteration of unactivated alkenes under cobalt/photoredox dual catalysis was developed. The addition of a suitable base plays a key role in controlling two competing pathways by switching the catalytic performance of cobalt/photoredox catalysis. A perdeutero&#8208;arylation was also demonstrated, giving a polydeuterated heterocyclic compound with a quaternary carbon.

         <title>Monitoring the Fate of Zn in the Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 Catalyst During CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Synthesis at High Conversions by Operando Spectroscopy</title>

Using an additively manufactured spectroscopic reactor to investigate the structure of a Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst with operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy during CO2 hydrogenation to methanol at high conversion. Restructuring of ZnO during high conversion and condensation was observed.







Abstract
In the frame of developing a sustainable chemical industry, heterogeneously catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation to methanol has attracted considerable interest. However, the Cu&#8722;Zn based catalyst system employed in this process is very dynamic, especially in the presence of the products methanol and water. Deactivation needs to be prevented, but its origin and mechanism are hardly investigated at high conversion where product condensation is possible. Here, we report on the structural dynamics of a Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 catalyst at 90&#8197;bar and 40&#8201;% CO2 conversion (at equilibrium conditions), investigated in a dedicated metal&#8208;based spectroscopic cell specially fabricated using additive manufacturing. This particular reactor configuration aims to mimic the high CO2 conversion part of the catalyst bed and can induce product condensation, which is monitored by operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. While Cu remained mostly stable throughout the experiment, Zn underwent strong restructuring. The chosen reaction conditions, including the use of CO2 as carbon source and in situ product condensation, were selected to provide insights under industrial conditions. This work is highlighting the importance of spectroscopic investigations at high conversion levels, offering insights into chemical transformations during deactivation, extending the concept of spatially resolved studies, and thus providing guidance for the design of more stable catalysts.

         <title>Robust Fully Screen&#8208;Printed Perovskite Solar Cells Based on Synergistic Ostwald Ripening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully screen&#8208;printed process for low&#8208;cost manufacturing significantly enhances the commercial competitiveness of perovskite solar cells. We found that a reversible and sustainable ripening process was activated by integrating MAPa/H2O in both externally and internally into perovskite crystals. The fully screen&#8208;printed PSCs exhibits an efficiency of 19.47&#8201;% and an operational stability over 1,000&#8197;h with maintaining 91.6&#8201;% of the highest efficiency.







Abstract
Fully screen&#8208;printed process for low&#8208;cost manufacturing significantly enhances the commercial competitiveness of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the controllable crystallization in screen&#8208;printed perovskite thin films using high&#8208;viscosity ionic liquids has been suggested to be difficult, which hampers further development of fully screen&#8208;printed perovskite devices in terms of application expansion and performance improvement. Here, we report a synergistic ripening strategy to fully control crystallization by employing methylamine propionate (MAPa) ionic liquid and water (H2O, moisture in the air). We found that a reversible and sustainable ripening process was activated by integrating MAPa/H2O in both externally and internally into perovskite crystals. MAPa effectively prevents the loss of organic salts and maintains the dispersion of Pb&#8208;I framework, preventing the perovskite component loss and decomposition. H2O and organic salts trends to form hydration complexes, which lowers the energy barrier and enhances the reactivity of the humidity&#8208;induced Ostwald ripening reaction. These improvements allow the screen&#8208;printed perovskite thin films achieve controlled secondary growth and ion exchange, thereby reducing defects and optimizing energy level alignment. The resulting fully screen&#8208;printed PSCs exhibits a record power conversion efficiency of 19.47&#8201;% and an operational stability over 1,000&#8197;h with maintaining 91.6&#8201;% of the highest efficiency under continuous light stress at maximum power point.

         <title>Conformationally Stable and Sterically Hindered Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium Modification of FAPbI3 Enhances the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ammonium moiety of the conformationally stable dicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium odide presents significant steric hindrance but boasts a high binding energy at the surface of FAPbI3 perovskite. The surface treatment with this salt leads to FAPbI3 film with smoother surface, lower charge trap densities, and higher iodine migration activation energy, ultimately enhancing both power conversion efficiency and operational stability of solar cells.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films frequently exhibit structural defects and impurities that impede the durable operation of solar cells. In this study, we introduced a conformationally stable, sterically bulky molecular passivator, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium iodide (BCPDAI), by spin&#8208;coating from an isopropanol solution onto the perovskite film surface, followed by thermal annealing. This treatment effectively converted PbI2 and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 into a two&#8208;dimensional perovskite structure and significantly enhanced the crystal quality of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. The BCPDAI&#8208;treated perovskite films exhibited smoother surface morphology and reduced trap densities for charge carriers, leading to improved power conversion efficiency in the solar cells. Notably, the BCPDAI&#8208;modified perovskite films provided the solar cells with enhanced operational stability. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the high positive charge density of BCPDA2+ confers greater binding energy at the perovskite surface and elevates the diffusion activation energy of the iodide anion.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Emissive Oligonucleotides Grafted &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers for Low&#8208;Temperature Photothermal and Gene Combined Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA is utilized as both the amphiphilic and functional molecule to modify &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and efficient photothermal properties. The resulting nanoparticles show unique and advantageous properties, including higher NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, more efficient cytoplasm delivery, and higher tissue penetration, ultimately realizing well&#8208;performed NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided low&#8208;temperature PTT&#8208;gene combined therapy.







Abstract
In order to address the strong hydrophobicity and function limitation of NIR&#8208;II emissive phototheranostic &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs), appropriate modifications are necessary to impart water dispersibility and functionality to CPs. This study uses DNA as the hydrophilic and functional unit to modify CPs, synthesizing CP&#8208;g&#8208;DNA amphiphilic copolymers and producing water&#8208;dispersible oligonucleotide&#8208;modified &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer nanoparticles (OCPNs) by self&#8208;assembly. In addition to DNA&#8242;s gene regulation abilities that can combine with the low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy of CPs for enhanced tumor therapy, OCPNs display unique characteristics as novel nanomaterials. On one side, DNA changes the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and results in a two&#8208;fold enhancement in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence emission, which greatly benefits tumor imaging. On the other side, DNA varies the surface properties of OCPNs and the nano&#8208;bio interactions. OCPNs exhibit multiple cellular internalization pathways, including caveolae/lipid raft&#8208;mediated uptake for cytoplasm delivery, which may enhance gene transfection combined with the photothermal&#8208;promoted lysosome escape. Moreover, OCPNs can quickly accumulate in tumors due to their higher tissue penetration capability. Taken together, a strategy of using DNA to enable and advance the phototheranostic applications of CPs has been demonstrated, and the distinct properties of OCPNs will open up new biological application opportunities in the future.

         <title>Extendable Synthesis of Organic Cations for In Situ Construction of Hybrid Metal Halides with Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence and Strong Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extendable synthetic strategy has been developed for in situ construction of a library of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIHMHs) with tailored sulfonium A&#8208;site organic cations. The template reaction with precise modular and regioselective control enables tuning of the reactants and reaction pathway, resulting in functional OIHMHs with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) or strong second harmonic generation (SHG).







Abstract
The A&#8208;site organic components of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIHMHs) significantly impact their crystal structure and optoelectronic properties. However, chemical modification of A&#8208;site cations has been mostly limited to commercial organic precursors, which restricts the structural variability of OIHMHs for optimal functionalities. Herein we have proposed an extendable synthesis approach to the direct procurability of various organic cations with desireable structures for the in situ construction of a library of OIHMH materials. The template condensation reaction between dimethyl sulfoxide and acetone derivatives yields A&#8208;site organic cations with exquisite control of modularization and regioselectivity within the OIHMH crystallization system. The as&#8208;fabricated OIHMHs demonstrated highly efficient linear optical photoluminescence or nonlinear optical second harmonic generation, promising potential applications in photonic devices. This in situ synthetic strategy offers a structural extension of OIHMHs and establishes a fundamental methodological platform for screening functional OIHMH materials.

         <title>Validation and Mechanistic Studies of the Headspace Effect in MOF Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a fixed vessel volume, the rate of metal&#8211;organic framework formation is shown to depend on the amount of solution employed. This headspace effect is demonstrated to arise only in the presence of oxygen. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that oxygen reacts with the formamide solvent and contributes to nitrosamine side products.







Abstract
The influence of headspace volume and composition on metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) synthesis has been largely overlooked with no mechanisms currently invoking these factors. Herein, we reveal that an increased volume of oxygen in the headspace during the synthesis of zinc carboxylate&#8208;based MOFs (MOF&#8208;5, MOF&#8208;177, and IRMOF&#8208;8) as well as UiO&#8208;66 and ZJU&#8208;28 accelerates crystal formation. Investigation into the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon elucidates the critical roles played by all reagents, and some of their byproducts, in MOF synthesis. These insights are the key to developing more efficient and sustainable synthetic strategies for MOF production.

         <title>An Amorphous Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer with Both High Charge Carrier Mobility and Luminescence Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the design and synthesis of a novel donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymer, TTIF&#8208;BT, which exhibits both high charge carrier mobility and luminescence quantum efficiency. With a &#934;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#956; value of approximately 0.084&#8197;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and enhanced interchain&#8208;mediated emissions compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art semiconducting polymer IDT&#8208;BT, TTIF&#8208;BT demonstrates significant potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Organic semiconducting polymers play a pivotal role in the development of field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) and organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, structural versatility, and solution processability. However, achieving polymers with both high charge carrier mobility (&#956;) and photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (&#934;) remains a challenge. In this work, we present the design and synthesis of a novel donor&#8208;acceptor &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer, TTIF&#8208;BT, featuring a di&#8208;Thioeno[3,2&#8208;b] ThioenoIndeno[1,2&#8208;b] Fluorene (TTIF) backbone as the donor component. TTIF&#8208;BT exhibits comparable hole mobility and enhanced interchain&#8208;mediated emissions compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art semiconducting IDT&#8208;BT, leading to a remarkable &#934;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#956; value of ~0.084&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. Through time&#8208;resolved absorption and PL techniques, we propose a model to extract the spectral weight of interchain&#8208;mediated emissions, yielding 62&#8201;% in TTIF&#8208;BT. Our results introduce a high&#8208;performance semiconducting polymer, which has potential use in next&#8208;generation organic optoelectronic devices, including electrically&#8208;driven polymer lasers and active&#8208;matrix display technologies.

         <title>Revealing the Potential of a Chimaera: a Peptide&#8208;Peptide Nucleic Acid Molecule Designed To Interact with the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can a chimeric molecule mimic RNA and bind an RNA&#8208;binding protein? We designed and synthesized a ligand with a dual nature within the same sequence: a pure peptide component and a peptide nucleic acid one. This chimaera is able to target the construct of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid protein, which comprises the RNA&#8208;binding globular domain and the two flanking disordered regions.







Abstract
Numerous RNA&#8208;binding proteins have modular structures with folded domains and intrinsically disordered regions, making their atomic characterization difficult. This severely limits the investigation of their modalities of interaction as well as the evaluation of possible ways to interfere with this process. We report herein a rational strategy for the design and synthesis of a ligand able to interfere with the protein function, monitoring the interaction through solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our approach employs a chimaera composed of two different fragments, a peptide and a peptide&#8208;nucleic acid, allowing to incorporate in the resulting molecule key features to address RNA&#8208;protein interactions. Focusing on two constructs of the Nucleocapsid protein from SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, the globular N&#8208;terminal domain and a more extended one comprising also two flanking intrinsically disordered regions, we demonstrate the enhanced affinity of the designed peptide&#8208;peptide nucleic acid chimaera for the protein compared to a related peptide lacking &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking contributions within the chain. Furthermore, we emphasize the increasingly recognized relevant and synergistic role of the intrinsically disordered regions in protein&#8208;ligand interaction.

         <title>H&#8208;Bonds in Carbon Quantum Dot&#8208;anchored C3N5 to Boost Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer for Piezoelectric&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A H&#8208;bond&#8208;driven proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process based on carbon quantum dot&#8208;anchored C3N5 (CQDs&#8208;C3N5) was constructed for piezo&#8208;catalytic H2O2 synthesis. The intermolecular H&#8208;bonds between CQDs and C3N5 accelerate PCET in the ORR, and this facilitated the adsorption of O2 onto the C sites adjacent to the carboxyl groups of CQDs, which in turn led to the formation of H2O2 through a rapidly protonated, indirect 2e&#8722; pathway.







Abstract
Tuning proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is a promising strategy to boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis, but the slow transmission rate of protons and electrons to active sites remains a significant bottleneck. To address this, we developed an H&#8208;bond&#8208;driven PCET process based on carbon quantum dot&#8208;anchored C3N5 (CQDs&#8208;C3N5) for piezo&#8208;catalytic H2O2 synthesis. CQDs&#8208;C3N5 exhibited a remarkable piezo&#8208;catalytic synthesis rate of 5025&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under ambient conditions, surpassing that of most reported piezoelectric materials. This efficiency is attributed to the intermolecular H&#8208;bonds between CQDs and C3N5, which significantly accelerate PCET in the ORR. The piezoelectric&#8208;generated charges, from the dipole field of the C3N5 plane, and protons in water, were rapidly transferred to the C rings of CQDs via H&#8208;bond networks. This process facilitated the adsorption of oxygen onto the C2 sites adjacent to the carboxyl groups of CQDs, which in turn led to the formation of H2O2 through a rapidly protonated, indirect 2e&#8722; pathway. Additionally, a piezo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton reaction system was constructed for oxytetracycline&#8208;rich wastewater purification, with effectively effects on chemical oxygen demand, antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria and antibiotic&#8208;resistant genes degradation, etc. This study highlights the critical role of H&#8208;bond networks for tuning PCET in the ORR and provides a comprehensive understanding for the precise control of catalytic reaction kinetics through molecular structural engineering.

The intermolecular H-bonds between CQDs and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; accelerate PCET in the ORR, and this facilitated the adsorption of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto the C sites adjacent to the carboxyl groups of CQDs, which in turn led to the formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through a rapidly protonated, indirect 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; pathway.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuning proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is a promising strategy to boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) synthesis, but the slow transmission rate of protons and electrons to active sites remains a significant bottleneck. To address this, we developed an H-bond-driven PCET process based on carbon quantum dot-anchored C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (CQDs-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) for piezo-catalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis. CQDs-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited a remarkable piezo-catalytic synthesis rate of 5025&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under ambient conditions, surpassing that of most reported piezoelectric materials. This efficiency is attributed to the intermolecular H-bonds between CQDs and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, which significantly accelerate PCET in the ORR. The piezoelectric-generated charges, from the dipole field of the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; plane, and protons in water, were rapidly transferred to the C rings of CQDs via H-bond networks. This process facilitated the adsorption of oxygen onto the C2 sites adjacent to the carboxyl groups of CQDs, which in turn led to the formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through a rapidly protonated, indirect 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; pathway. Additionally, a piezo-self-Fenton reaction system was constructed for oxytetracycline-rich wastewater purification, with effectively effects on chemical oxygen demand, antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic-resistant genes degradation, &lt;i&gt;etc&lt;/i&gt;. This study highlights the critical role of H-bond networks for tuning PCET in the ORR and provides a comprehensive understanding for the precise control of catalytic reaction kinetics through molecular structural engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsic Distortion against Jahn&#8208;Teller Distortion: A New Paradigm for High&#8208;Stability Na&#8208;Ion Layered Mn&#8208;Rich Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fire&#8208;new &#8220;intrinsic distortion against Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion&#8221; mechanism in Na&#8208;ion layered Mn&#8208;rich oxides, that is, counteracting the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion upon electrochemical cycling by introducing intrinsic structural distortion during the material synthesis due to their opposite deformation orientations, is unveiled to effectively stabilize the layered frameworks of the cathodes.







Abstract
Layered manganese&#8208;rich oxides (LMROs) are widely recognized as the leading cathode candidates for grid&#8208;scale sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high specific capacities and cost benefits, but the notorious Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) distortion of Mn3+ always induces severe structural degradation and consequent rapid cathode failure, impeding the practical implementation of such materials. Herein, we unveil the &#8220;intrinsic distortion against J&#8208;T distortion&#8221; mechanism to effectively stabilize the layered frameworks of LMRO cathodes. The intrinsic distortion simply constructed by introducing bulk oxygen vacancies is systematically confirmed by advanced synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques, atomic&#8208;scale imaging characterizations, and theoretical computations, which can counteract the J&#8208;T distortion during cycling due to their opposite deformation orientations. This greatly decreases and uniformizes the lattice strain within the ab plane and along the c axis of the material, thereby alleviating the P2&#8208;P&#8242;2 phase transition as well as suppressing the edge dislocation and intragranular crack formation upon repeated cycles. As a result, the tailored P2&#8208;Na0.72Mg0.1Mn0.9O2 cathode featuring intrinsic distortion delivers a considerably enhanced cycling durability (91.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 500&#8197;cycles) without sacrificing the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox capacity (186.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.3&#8197;C). This intrinsic distortion engineering paves a brand&#8208;new and prospective avenue toward achieving high&#8208;performance LMRO cathodes for SIBs.

&lt;p&gt;Layered manganese-rich oxides (LMROs) are widely recognized as the leading cathode candidates for grid-scale sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to their high specific capacities and cost benefits, but the notorious Jahn-Teller (J-T) distortion of Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; always induces severe structural degradation and consequent rapid cathode failure, impeding the practical implementation of such materials.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Nitric Oxide Generation via Thermal Decomposition of N&#8208;Trityl Dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;Oxazines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the design and performance of novel nitric oxide donors for gas flow release applications such as inhaled nitric oxide therapies. Dispersions of N&#8208;trityl dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazines in hyper cross&#8208;linked polymers are shown to yield consistent gas phase nitric oxide release at therapeutically relevant concentrations and are stable under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a promising therapy for a&#160;variety of pulmonary conditions but is limited by the cost, portability, and safety limitations of the compressed gas cylinders used in conventional iNO delivery systems. On&#8208;demand generation of iNO via thermally controlled decomposition of an NO&#8208;genic precursor is an attractive alternative to systems based on compressed gas cylinders. However, most NO&#8208;releasing materials, which would form the basis of such a system, are designed for in vivo applications, but not for gas flow release at elevated temperatures. Novel NO donors with tunable kinetics suited for simple thermal generation are needed to realize such iNO delivery systems. Here we report the development of a&#160;new class of NO donors based on N&#8208;trityl 3,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,2&#8208;oxazines. We show that amorphous solid dispersions of these molecules in porous polymers exhibit consistent, thermoresponsive NO release in good yields when heated above 90&#8201;&#176;C&#160;in the presence of a carrier gas. We further demonstrate that these donors undergo NO release in aqueous media at 37&#8201;&#176;C. Collectively, this work adds a new class of NO donor to the basis set of known NO&#8208;genic molecules and establishes a potential chemical basis for a low&#8208;power, small&#8208;footprint iNO delivery system.&#160;&#160;

         <title>Where Does the Proton Go? Structure and Dynamics of Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Switching in Aminophosphine Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminophosphine chalcogenides are relevant in many organocatalytic concepts and are the focus of prebiotic studies. Spectroscopy (IR, 1H DOSY, 15N NMR), MD simulations, and DFT calculations provide unique insight into their proton&#8208;binding affinity. All conceivable hydrogen&#8208;bonding modes can be formed and controlled. Fundamental principles of self&#8208;organization, proton&#8208;hopping, and of the behavior at the lower concentration threshold are revealed.







Abstract
Aminophosphates are the focus of research on prebiotic phosphorylation chemistry. Their bifunctional nature also makes them a powerful class of organocatalysts. However, the structural chemistry and dynamics of proton&#8208;binding in phosphorylation and organocatalytic mechanisms are still not fully understood. Aminophosphine chalcogenides, preserving the central H2N&#8722;P+&#8722;Ch&#8722; structural motif, represent well&#8208;suited molecular models that mimic proton&#8208;binding, hydrogen&#8208;bond switching and supramolecular self&#8208;assembling behavior of catalytically and prebiotically relevant molecules. Through spectroscopic (IR, 1H DOSY, 15N NMR), molecular dynamics, and computational investigations, the dynamic proton switching capability of aminophosphate analogs was demonstrated. It was shown under which conditions the amino (NH2) or chalcogen (Ch) functions in H2N&#8722;P+&#8722;Ch&#8722; structural units are protonated. In fact, all conceivable modes of hydrogen&#8208;bonding were identified, revealing substantial differences between the oxygen derivative and the heavier congeners. Using coordinating anions, supramolecular zigzag&#8208; and cube&#8208;shaped arrangements were found in the solid&#8208;state and in solution. After break&#8208;up of the cube structure, the sulfides and selenides no longer form stable interactions with HCl molecules. In the absence of coordinating anions, however, protonation of the chalcogen function is preferred. In contrast to the oxygen derivative, the heavier protonated congeners show dynamic intramolecular proton&#8208;hopping between the chalcogen and the amino function.

         <title>Unlocking the Power of Photothermal Agents: A Universal Platform for Smart Immune NIR&#8208;Agonists for Precise Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our research presents a versatile platform for developing photoimmunotherapy agents that selectively activate immunogenic cell death in tumor cells upon NIR light irradiation, priming an effective anti&#8208;tumor immune response.







Abstract
Selective ablation of tumor cells allows safe eradication, thereby minimizing off&#8208;target damage, while specifically inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) rather than commonly non&#8208;immunogenic apoptosis of tumor cells enables activation of anti&#8208;tumor immune response against residual cancer cells, including metastatic lesions. Herein, we present a general strategy leveraging a novel photothermal agent (PTA) that concomitantly enables precise tumor killing and activation of anti&#8208;tumor immunity. The unique PTA scaffold exhibits unexpected inherent endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeting capability and potent near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal activity, inducing NIR&#8208;controlled immunogenic pyroptosis in various tumor cell lines via targeting ER stress in an oxygen&#8208;independent manner. Moreover, both ER&#8208;targeting and NIR&#8208;activity of our scaffold can be modulated on demand by chemical caging/uncaging, allowing quick activation with diverse biological and bioorthogonal molecular triggers. The potency of this universal platform is demonstrated via its application to develop a membrane protein&#8208;activatable NIR&#8208;agonist that selectively activates ICD in tumor sites while priming anti&#8208;tumor immunity, minimizing off&#8208;target effects and enhancing efficacy against mouse breast tumors.

     alt="Unlocking the Power of Photothermal Agents: A Universal Platform for Smart Immune NIR-Agonists for Precise Cancer Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research presents a versatile platform for developing photoimmunotherapy agents that selectively activate immunogenic cell death in tumor cells upon NIR light irradiation, priming an effective anti-tumor immune response.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective ablation of tumor cells allows safe eradication, thereby minimizing off-target damage, while specifically inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) rather than commonly non-immunogenic apoptosis of tumor cells enables activation of anti-tumor immune response against residual cancer cells, including metastatic lesions. Herein, we present a general strategy leveraging a novel photothermal agent (PTA) that concomitantly enables precise tumor killing and activation of anti-tumor immunity. The unique PTA scaffold exhibits unexpected inherent endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeting capability and potent near-infrared (NIR) photothermal activity, inducing NIR-controlled immunogenic pyroptosis in various tumor cell lines via targeting ER stress in an oxygen-independent manner. Moreover, both ER-targeting and NIR-activity of our scaffold can be modulated on demand by chemical caging/uncaging, allowing quick activation with diverse biological and bioorthogonal molecular triggers. The potency of this universal platform is demonstrated via its application to develop a membrane protein-activatable NIR-agonist that selectively activates ICD in tumor sites while priming anti-tumor immunity, minimizing off-target effects and enhancing efficacy against mouse breast tumors. This versatile approach could lead to customization of various personalized and effective immune NIR-agonists for specific photoimmunotherapy applicable to diverse solid tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ether&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks Enable Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The embedded ether groups significantly enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons in COFs, and promote electron accumulation at the C=N imine bonds, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.







Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable solar fuels is a promising strategy for addressing energy crises and mitigating the greenhouse effect. However, the challenge of efficiently regulating photogenerated electrons to CO2 active sites remains a key hurdle for high&#8208;performance CO2 reduction. Herein, an embedded functional group, ether group is introduced into porphyrin&#8208;triazine COFs to regulate the transfer behavior of photogenerated electrons. The ether&#8208;embedded COFs (TOT&#8208;TAPP, BOD&#8208;TAPP and QOB&#8208;TAPP) demonstrate significantly faster charge transport and higher photoactivity compared with the corresponding non&#8208;ether&#8208;embedded counterpart COFs. The theoretical calculations and in situ characterizations reveal that the ether group could not only accelerate the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, but also lead to a more substantial accumulation of electrons at the CO2 adsorption region (C=N imine bond), thus greatly promoting the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>A Needle in a Haystack: Transient Porosity in a Closed Pore Square Lattice Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porosity &#8220;without pores&#8221;! We report a transiently porous coordination network that undergoes phase transformations between distinct closed pore phases in response to desolvation, humidity, or exposure to CO2 and C2H2 gases. Investigating its guest transport mechanism, we uncover a crystal engineering strategy with potential to enable the design of transient porosity in similar compounds.







Abstract
Guest transport through discrete voids (closed pores) in crystalline solids is poorly understood. Herein, we report the gas sorption properties of a nonporous coordination network, {[Co(bib)2Cl2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MeOH}n (sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#945;), featuring square lattice (sql) topology and the bent linker 1,3&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzene (bib). The as&#8208;synthesized sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#945; has 11.3&#8201;% (313&#8197;&#197;3) of its unit cell volume in closed pores occupied by methanol (MeOH). Upon desolvation and air exposure, sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#945; underwent a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) phase transformation to sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#946;&#8242;, wherein MeOH was replaced by water. Activation (vacuum or N2 flow) resulted in dehydration and retention of the closed pores, affording sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#946; with 7.7&#8201;% (194&#8197;&#197;3) guest&#8208;accessible space. sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl&#8208;&#946; was found to preferentially adsorb C2H2 (at 265&#8197;K) over CO2 (at 195&#8197;K) through gate&#8208;opening mechanisms, at gate&#8208;opening pressures of 59.8 and 27.7&#8197;kPa, respectively, while other C2 gases were excluded. PXRD was used to monitor transformations between the three phases of sql&#8208;bib&#8208;Co&#8208;Cl, while in situ DSC, in situ SCXRD under CO2 pressure, and computational studies provided insight into the guest transport mechanism, which we attribute to the angular, flexible nature of the bib ligand. Further, the preferential adsorption of C2H2 over CO2 and other C2 gases suggests that transiently porous sorbents might have utility in separations.

         <title>Preparation of Degradable and Sequence&#8208;Controlled Aliphatic Polysulfones by Group Transfer Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical SO2&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of aliphatic polysulfones utilizing the strategy of group transfer radical polymerization (GTRP) is disclosed. This novel method enables the precise construction of a diverse array of aliphatic polysulfones with ABC sequences. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the non&#8208;desulfonylative Smiles rearrangement pathway plays a key role in the GTRP process. The obtained polymer exhibits optical properties that are comparable to those of commercially used polycarbonate. It also demonstrates complete degradability under strong basic conditions at ambient temperature.







Abstract
The incorporation of sulfur atoms into polymer backbones for the synthesis of sulfur&#8208;containing polymers, such as aliphatic polysulfones, not only enhances degradability but also imparts many distinctive properties to these materials. Traditional synthetic methods encounter substantial challenges in achieving sequence&#8208;controlled aliphatic polysulfones with high molecular weights (MW), which significantly limits their applications. We report a novel approach for synthesizing aliphatic polysulfones using the strategy of sulfonyl radical&#8208;mediated group transfer radical polymerization (GTRP). This protocol employs a practical SO2&#8208;free pathway and produces a series of ABC sequence&#8208;defined high&#8208;MW polymers (up to 199.2&#8197;kg/mol). The resultant aliphatic polysulfone exhibits remarkable full&#8208;degradability at ambient temperature under strong basic conditions, and offers optical properties &#8211; including refractive index and Abbe number &#8211; comparable to those of commercially utilized polycarbonate. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been performed to corroborate the non&#8208;desulfonylative Smiles rearrangement mechanism implicated in the GTRP process.

         <title>Low Temperature Atomic Layer Deposition of (00l)&#8208;Oriented Elemental Bismuth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first successful growth of elemental bismuth (Bi) thin films via thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) using Bi(NMe2)3 and Sb(SiMe3)3 at 100&#8201;&#176;C, achieving a GPC of 0.31&#8211;0.34&#8197;&#197;/cycle, is demonstrated. Films transitioned from island to full coverage, with a preferential shift in growth orientation from the (012) to the (003) plane. Metallic Bi was confirmed by XPS and TEM. The 2500&#8208;cycle film exhibited semimetallic behavior with a resistivity of &#8776;200&#8197;&#956;&#937;cm.







Abstract
This study presents the first successful demonstration of growing elemental bismuth (Bi) thin films via thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) using Bi(NMe2)3 as the precursor and Sb(SiMe3)3 as the co&#8208;reactant. The films were deposited at a relatively low temperature of 100&#8201;&#176;C, with a growth per cycle (GPC) of 0.31&#8211;0.34&#8197;&#197;/cycle. Island formation marked the initial growth stages, with surface coverage reaching around 80&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles and full coverage between 2000 and 2500&#8197;cycles. Morphological analysis revealed that the Bi grains expanded and became more defined as the number of ALD cycles increased. This coalescence is further supported by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, which show a preferential shift in growth orientation from the (012) plane to the (003) plane as the film thickness increases. X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the presence of metallic Bi with minimal surface oxidation. Temperature&#8208;dependent sheet resistance measurements highlight the semimetallic nature of Bi, with a room temperature resistivity of &#8776;200&#8197;&#956;&#937;cm for the 2500&#8197;cycles Bi. Temperature&#8208;dependent sheet resistance was also associated with a transition in carrier&#8208;type dominance from holes at higher temperatures to electrones at lower temperatures.

X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the presence of metallic Bi with minimal surface oxidation. Temperature-dependent sheet resistance measurements highlight the semimetallic nature of Bi, with a room temperature resistivity of &#8776;200&#8197;&#956;&#937;cm for the 2500&#8197;cycles Bi. Temperature-dependent sheet resistance was also associated with a transition in carrier-type dominance from holes at higher temperatures to electrones at lower temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Back Cover: Air&#8208;Mediated Biomimetic Synthesis of Polyhydroxyalkanoate with C4 Diol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the biomimetic synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) using C4 diol and air, catalyzed by a synergistic catalyst, was presented by Qiuquan Cai and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202417660). The resulting PHA can reversibly convert back to a small&#8208;molecule monomer in the form of a five&#8208;membered ring, demonstrating excellent ecological sustainability. This study highlights the potential for large&#8208;scale synthesis of high&#8208;value PHAs from diverse non&#8208;grain&#8208;based diols.

         <title>Higher Contrast in 1H&#8208;Observed NMR Ligand Screening with the PEARLScreen Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For initial hit identification in fragment&#8208;based drug design, NMR is one of the preferred methods, with the well&#8208;established ligand screening experiments T1&#961;, waterLOGSY and STD. Here, we present a new, perfect echo&#8208;based experiment with superior binding sensitivity, the PEARLScreen. The sensitivity enhancement is based on longer relaxation delays as well as active exchange broadening, enabled by the perfect echo scheme. This allowed a reduction of the protein concentration by up to one order of magnitude in comparison to the conventional experiments on the same screening setup without losing binding sensitivity. The experiment was tested throughout the whole field range of commercially available spectrometers from 80 to 1200 MHz, where at the highest field even a reduction of the required protein amount by a factor of 40 is within reach, thanks to larger compound mixtures and enhanced exchange effects. Based on the superior performance already on standard NMR setups, we expect the PEARLScreen to become the standard screening experiment for 1H&#8208;detected ligand screening.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and&#160;Mechanistic Insight into the Enantioselectivity of (R)&#8208;Selective Styrene Monooxygenases: A Tug&#8208;of&#8208;War between Proximal and Distal Residues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Group E flavoprotein&#160;monooxygenases (GEMs) are well&#8208;known for catalyzing enantioselective epoxidation reactions. However, engineering their enantioselectivity remains a significant challenge, largely due to a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Among these enzymes, (R)&#8208;selective styrene monooxygenases ((R)&#8208;SMOs) stand out due to their unusual enantio&#8208;switch behavior when catalyzing&#160;p&#8208;substituted styrenes. This unique property provides an exceptional opportunity to investigate the enantiocontrol mechanisms within GEMs. In this study, we resolved the first crystal structure of an (R)&#8208;SMO,&#160;SeStyA, derived from&#160;Streptomyces. By integrating this structural information with molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified four key residues critical to enantiodivergency: two distal residues (S178 and A219) and two proximal residues (A59 and A312). Strikingly, a "tug&#8208;of&#8208;war" mechanism was revealed through saturation mutagenesis, wherein the side&#8208;chain sizes of proximal and distal residues exerted opposing influences on enantioselectivity at the C=C bond. Leveraging this mechanistic insight, we successfully engineered&#160;SMOs with excellent (R)&#8208; or (S)&#8208;enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Noble Gas Provides a Solution to the Synthesis&#8208;on&#8208;Inert&#8208;Surfaces Challenge for Extended Covalent Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A key milestone in the field of On&#8208;Surface Synthesis (OSS) is the development of generic protocols for covalent coupling on inert surfaces. Typically, metal surfaces are used in OSS, but the strong interactions distort the intrinsic properties of the synthesized nanostructures and therefore compromise their applicability. Inert surfaces, on the other hand, preserve the nanostructures&#8217; unique properties, but present challenges during synthesis: Activation energies are generally higher than on metal surfaces, hence thermally activated coupling on inert surfaces is severely hampered by competing premature desorption of the reactants. Using the coupling of 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;mercaptophenyl)benzene (TMB) via carbon&#8208;sulfur&#8208;carbon thioether bonds, we demonstrate that annealing in a noble gas atmosphere instead of in a vacuum kinetically inhibits desorption. This allows covalent coupling on both inert graphite and even more weakly interacting graphene surfaces. We anticipate generic potential for this approach, with future experiments exploring the extendability of ambient pressure annealing to a portfolio of other coupling protocols.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying the Key Photosensitizing Factors over Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Selective Control of 1O2 and O2&#8226;&#8722; Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction pathway, product selectivity and catalytic efficiency of photo&#8208;oxidation are highly dependent on the specific reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) and superoxide (O&#8322;&#8226;&#8722;), generated via the sensitization of O2 by photosensitizers. Studies on uncovering the role of photosensitizing factors on the selective control of &#185;O&#8322; and O&#8322;&#8226;&#8722; generation are significant but remain underexplored. Here, we constructed a photosensitizing metal&#8208;organic framework molecular platform (UiO&#8208;1 &#8211; UiO&#8208;4) by elaborately engineering Ir(III) complex ligands with pyrenyl group for modulating photosensitizing factors and elucidating their impact on ROS generation. Impressively, the ratios of 1O2 and O2&#8226;&#8722; generation varied from 0:100 for UiO&#8208;1 to 94:6 for UiO&#8208;4 by modulating photosensitizing factors. UiO&#8208;2 and UiO&#8208;4 were respectively immobilized in a continuous&#8208;flow reactor, achieving gram&#8208;scale photosynthesis of phenol and juglone with high purity (&gt; 94%) via O&#8322;&#8226;&#8722; and &#185;O&#8322; pathway, respectively. &#160;Investigations reveal that UiO&#8208;4 with ligand localized excited state and long excited state lifetime contributed to triggering energy transfer to afford 1O2, whereas UiO&#8208;1 with charge&#8208;transfer state and negative reduction potential facilitates charge transfer to produce O2&#8226;&#8722;. This work offers a novel insight into regulating ROS generation by modulating the photosensitizing factors at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanopore Confinement&#8208;driven Synchronous Enhancement of Thermal and Mechanical Properties of Phase Change Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phase change materials (PCM) need highly thermally conductive inorganic porous skeletons to encapsulate and shape to reduce their leakage and enhance their thermal conduction. With the pore size shrinking to nanoscale, the crystallization, kinematic and thermal transport behaviors of PCM would be significantly changed. This work experimentally corroborates an intriguing nanopore confinement space effect that synchronously enhances the thermal conductivity and Young&#8217;s modulus of representative PCM once encapsulated in nanoporous aluminum oxide using nanometer resolution thermal and mechanical mapping technique. Molecular dynamic simulation further reveals that the shortened hydrogen bond length due to the nanopore confinement facilitates the heat conduction of PCM, which refreshes the routine understanding that smaller space leads to reduction in thermal and mechanical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Redox Synergism&#8208;Enhanced Liquid Metal Locomotion for Unrestricted Circuit Substrate Patterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The critical challenge in advancing liquid metal circuits (LMCs) lies in achieving interfacial compatibility with diverse substrates while dynamically balancing fabrication efficiency and quality to ensure robust conductive stability. Here we introduce an electrochemical redox synergistic liquid metal (E&#8208;rsLM) that enables the controllable generation of diverse intermetallic bond transition layers (Cu, Au, or Fe&#8208;based) between liquid metal and unrestricted substrate surfaces, applicable in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes. It involves enhanced locomotion of the liquid metal, driven by synergistic electrochemical energy transduction from cyclic changes in gallium redox states. Characterized by expansion&#8208;contraction&#8208;expansion, it enables unique self&#8208;propelled bouncing, tuning spreading speed (up to ~26.8 mm/s) and elongation rate (up to 1192%) with a volume of only 80 &#956;L. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of E&#8208;rsLM fabrication across 30 different substrates, highlighting its versatility. The patterning displays the superimposed efficiency and self&#8208;indicated quality, leading to superior conductivity (with time&#8208;cost savings of 30.7% and 13.4% in heating&#8208;cooling cycles, and a nearly 90% reduction in output resistance). The practical viability of these circuits is further showcased by the assembly of integrated circuits, marking a significant step in expanding LMCs applications beyond laboratory&#8208;scale prototypes.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly effective and durable integrated&#8208;chainmail electrode for H2 production through H2S electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>H&#8322;S is a prevalent yet toxic gas commonly encountered during fossil fuel extraction, whose electrolysis not only addresses pollution concerns but also facilitates hydrogen production. However, the advancement of H&#8322;S electrolysis at high current density has been impeded by the lack of stable and highly active electrodes that can endure the corrosive effects of H&#8322;S poisoning. Herein, we present an integrated&#8208;chainmail electrode that features dual&#8208;level chainmail structure with graphene encapsulating nickel foam (Ni@NC foam) to enhance H&#8322;S electrolysis. The electrode comprises a primary chainmail, formed by graphene coating on the surface of nickel foam, and a secondary chainmail, created by graphene encapsulating nickel nanoparticles. This integrated&#8208;chainmail structure significantly enhances both the activity and stability of nickel foam, which delivers an industrial&#8208;scale high current density exceeding 1 A cm&#8315;&#178; at 1.12 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, above five times higher than nickel foam. Moreover, the Ni@NC foam remains stable over 300 hours of test, demonstrating a lifespan at least ten times longer than nickel foam. In a demo for H&#8322;S removal from simulated natural gas, the Ni@NC foam as the electrodes exhibits a hydrogen production rate of 272 ml min&#8315;&#185;, while reducing electricity consumption by 43% compared with traditional water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy for the Synthesis of Metal&#8208;Backboned Molecules with Different Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;backboned molecules have been recently explored as a new class of materials with remarkable physical and chemical properties. However, their backbones are mainly composed of Ni atoms and poses challenges in incorporating a wide range of metallic elemental species, which has severely hindered their further development. Herein, we have designed a general synthesis strategy and obtained new metal&#8208;backboned molecules with a variety of metals including Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag and Pt in the backbones through a ligand&#8208;assisted strategy under screening reaction conditions. The metal backbone with seven Cu atoms has been carefully demonstrated for the synthesis. The intriguing optical properties, electronic bandgaps and thermal properties for the metal&#8208;backboned molecules have been further explored. This work provides a new avenue on the synthesis of high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;backboned molecule materials for promising applications in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Enhanced Catalysis Stability in Acidic Oxygen Evolution: Structural Insights for PEM Applications under High&#8208;Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that demonstrate high current density and stability are essential. Herein, we synthesized La&#8208;doped RuO2 (La&#8208;RuO2@TM) nanorod composite catalysts in situ on titanium mesh (TM) using a one&#8208;step low&#8208;temperature pyrolysis method. La&#8208;RuO2@TM displays excellent catalytic performance (1.533 V at 100 mA cm&#8208;2) and remarkable stability, showing no significant degradation in performance over 450 hours of operation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the formation of the La&#8208;O&#8208;Ru local structure modulates the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates, alleviates metal (Ru) leaching, and reduces oxygen loss, significantly enhancing the material's durability in acidic OER. The PEM electrolyzer utilizing La&#8208;RuO2@TM operates at 1.815 V with a current density of 1.0 A cm&#8208;2, maintaining stable performance for 120 h at 60&#176;C. This study offers valuable insights for designing efficient and durable acidic OER catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold Self&#8208;Assembly on Copper Electrodes Promotes n&#8208;Propanol Formation in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising route to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by converting CO2 into valuable chemicals. Among multi&#8208;carbon products, n&#8208;propanol is particularly appealing due to its high energy density (~27 MJ/L) and broad industrial applications. However, achieving high selectivity for n&#8208;propanol remains a formidable challenge, requiring catalysts capable of facilitating complex reaction pathways and avoiding competing side reactions. In this study, we present a Cu/Cys/Au catalyst architecture that is prepared through a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) that significantly enhances the Faradaic efficiency for n&#8208;propanol production. Specifically, Cu substrates are modified with cysteamine SAMs to uniformly anchor a Au3+&#8208;dimercaptosuccinate complex, which enable uniform Au electrodeposition. The resulting Cu/Cys/Au electrode achieves a Faradaic efficiency of 29.1% for n&#8208;propanol at &#8722;1.2 V vs. RHE, representing a significant improvement over conventional Au&#8208;Cu electrocatalysts. Control studies reveal the necessity of both Au and Cu for selective n&#8208;propanol formation, while mixed SAMs with varying cysteamine and propanethiol ratios allow for precise tuning of Au coverage on Cu. These findings underscore the potential of SAM&#8208;based strategies for precise surface engineering, offering a pathway for selective CO2RR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Constraint Flexibility for Benchmark Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for adsorptive separations, but achieving a balance among flexibility, adsorption capacity, and selectivity remains challenging. Herein, we report a novel flexible MOF, Ni(bhdc)(ted)0.5 (ZUL&#8208;C6), incorporating hybrid three&#8208;dimensional alkane&#8208;bridged ligands, which realizes high&#8208;capacity molecular sieving for hexane isomer separation &#8208; a critical process in the petroleum industry. The alkyl&#8208;rich, confined pore system within the ZUL&#8208;C6 framework facilitated a strong affinity for n&#8208;hexane and 3&#8208;methylpentane. However, the narrow pore size and the constraint flexibility limited the uptake of 2,2&#8208;dimethylbutane (&lt; 4.0 mg/g), accompanied by a high gate&#8208;opening pressure. The gating behavior was elucidated by guest&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal (SC) X&#8208;ray diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which revealed a unique SC to SC transformation driven by the non&#8208;centrosymmetric rotation of the 3D bhdc linker and distortion of the metal cluster and pillar units, along with a high deformation energy barrier. As a result, ZUL&#8208;C6 exhibited not only significantly higher uptake and selectivity than the industrially used 5A molecular sieve, but also the record&#8208;high nHEX/3MP breakthrough uptake (92.8/73.9 mg/g) and unprecedented 22DMB producing time (309.2 min/g, corresponding to the productivity of 770 mmol/kg and yield of 92.8%) among reported MOFs.</dc:description>

However, the narrow pore size and the constraint flexibility limited the uptake of 2,2-dimethylbutane (&amp;lt; 4.0 mg/g), accompanied by a high gate-opening pressure. The gating behavior was elucidated by guest-loaded single-crystal (SC) X-ray diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, which revealed a unique SC to SC transformation driven by the non-centrosymmetric rotation of the 3D bhdc linker and distortion of the metal cluster and pillar units, along with a high deformation energy barrier. As a result, ZUL-C6 exhibited not only significantly higher uptake and selectivity than the industrially used 5A molecular sieve, but also the record-high nHEX/3MP breakthrough uptake (92.8/73.9 mg/g) and unprecedented 22DMB producing time (309.2 min/g, corresponding to the productivity of 770 mmol/kg and yield of 92.8%) among reported MOFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering surface tension of active layer solutions to form uniform films on water surface for large&#8208;area flexible organic photovoltaic modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating large&#8208;area uniform thin (about 100 nm) active layer films via solution processing is still challenging to realize efficient scalable organic photovoltaic (OPV) modules. In this work, we report a method to fabricate large&#8208;area active layer films with the help of Marangoni force via engineering the surface tension of their solutions. Silicone oil was first adopted as an additive to substantially reduce surface tension of the active layer solutions from 34.8 to 20.6 mN/m. Large&#8208;area (up to 700 cm2) thin active layer films spread spontaneously on water by Marangoni force due to the increased surface tension difference between the active layer solution and water. The films were then transferred onto charge transporting layer to fabricate devices. The active layer films fabricated by Marangoni force&#8208;assisted coating (MAC) displayed power conversion efficiencies (PCE), 17.4% &#177; 0.3% for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9, 17.9 &#177; 0.7% for D18:N3 and 16.4 &#177; 0.3% for PM6:QM&#8208;1. Furthermore, large&#8208;area (32.5 cm2) OPV modules were fabricated based on the MAC method with a PCE of 14.3%. This is the first example that MAC method is used to successfully fabricate efficient OPV modules via the surface tension engineering of active layer films with silicone oil used as a low surface tension additive.</dc:description>

         <title>Desymmetrization/Kinetic Resolution of Planar Chiral [2.2]Paracyclophanes by Bioinspired Peptide&#8208;Iminophosphorane Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophanes, particularly pseudo&#8208;disubstituted derivatives, are privileged scaffolds for chiral ligands and catalysts in asymmetric synthesis and have widespread applications in materials science. However, catalytic asymmetric approaches for the enantioselective synthesis of pseudo&#8208;disubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes remain underexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel class of peptide&#8208;iminophosphorane organosuperbases to induce planar chirality in spatially stacked [2.2]paracyclophanes. This efficient protocol enables the enantioselective synthesis of a diverse array of structurally distinct pseudo&#8208;gem, pseudo&#8208;ortho, and pseudo&#8208;para [2.2]paracyclophanes, achieving high yields and excellent enantioselectivities via desymmetrization or kinetic resolution. Moreover, the products can be readily diversified through various functional group transformations. Mechanistic investigations provide valuable insights into the unique stereocontrol exhibited by this peptide&#8208;iminophosphorane catalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasensitive Gas Sensor of Mixed&#8208;dimensional Heterostructures Combining Borophene and BC2N Quantum Dots: Enhanced Detection through Binary Cooperative Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of mixed&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures has inspired worldwide interests in recent years, opening up new avenues for potential nanotechnology applications. Herein, we proposed a mixed&#8208;dimensional heterostructure composed of borophene sheets and BC2N quantum dots. The gas sensing performance of the heterostructure was evaluated through a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental methods. Specifically, first&#8208;principles calculation results show that NO2 is the most strongly interacting molecule and induces the largest amount of charge transfer between the molecule and the heterostructure, suggesting exceptional sensitivity and selectivity of the heterostructure to NO2 gas. Following the theoretical insights, a borophene&#8208;BC2N heterostructure gas sensor was developed and its gas detection abilities were assessed with exposure to various gases at room temperature. Remarkably, this sensor displayed a sensitivity of 1170% to 30 ppm NO2 and remain a high sensitivity of 108% even to 0.2 ppm NO2. These results highlight borophene&#8208;BC2N heterostructure as a superior NO2 gas sensor, demonstrating enhanced sensing via BC2N quantum dots and integrated theoretical&#8208;experimental approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic High&#8208;Throughput Microarrays of Peptidoglycan Fragments as a Novel Sero&#8208;Diagnostic Tool for Patient Antibody Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a complex biopolymer crucial for cell wall integrity and function of all bacterial species. While the strong inflammatory properties of PGN and its derived muropeptides are well&#8208;documented in human innate immune responses, adaptive immunity, including antibody responses to PGN, remain inadequately characterized. Microarray technology represents a cost&#8208; and time&#8208;efficient method for studying such interactions. Our laser&#8208;based technology enables the high&#8208;throughput synthesis of biomolecules on functionalized glass slides. Here, this on&#8208;chip synthesis was developed for PGN fragments, to generate a variety of 216 stem peptides and attach six different glycan moieties that are major structural components of bacterial cell walls. Thereby, 864 PGN fragments from different Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive species were generated. The arrays were validated with four different monoclonal antibodies against PGN or poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine and identified their epitopes. Finally, proof of concept for antibody profiling in patient samples was performed by comparing a panel of well&#8208;characterized plasma samples of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) patients suffering from (chronic) wounds with Staphylococcus aureus infection. EB patients show an increased response to the muramyl dipeptide. Therefore, this novel high&#8208;throughput PGN glycopeptide microarray technology promises to identify distinct antibody profiles against human microbiomes in diseases, notably in those involving the intestine.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Assembly of Artificial Topological Nanostructures Enhances In Vivo Efficacy of PCSK9 Inhibitory Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimizing the stability and affinity of peptides in vivo is critical for their development as alternatives to approved monoclonal antibodies. In recent years, efforts in academia and industry have focused on modifying Pep2&#8208;8, a classical antagonistic peptide targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), to enhance its specificity and affinity. However, developing effective PCSK9 inhibitory peptides remains challenging, especially given the limited examples of their successful in vivo applications. Here, we designed transformable inhibitory peptide (TIP) against PCSK9 based on the modular structure of Pep2&#8208;8. Upon encountering PCSK9, TIP undergoes in situ self&#8208;assembly at the epidermal growth factor&#8208;like domain A (EGF&#8208;A) binding domain of PCSK9 to form artificial topological nanostructures (ATNs). The ATNs not only enhance peptide stability and prolong in vivo retention time but also strengthen PCSK9 binding through multivalent synergistic effects. We demonstrate that compared to Pep2&#8208;8, TIP forms ATNs which increasing its binding affinity for PCSK9 by approximately 18.7&#8208;fold in vitro. In high&#8208;fat diet mouse models, TIP significantly increase hepatic LDLR levels (2.0&#8208;fold) and reduced LDL&#8208;C and TC levels. We envision that the in situ formation of ATNs by peptides enhances in vivo stability and affinity, which offering an approach for development as antibody alternatives in clinical.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organic Crystalline Ternary Pseudo&#8208;Heterojunction with Contrasting Luminescent and Mechanical Properties Prepared by Thermotropic Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advancements in crystal engineering have enabled the precise tuning of the physical properties of organic crystals, thereby enhancing their potential in advanced optoelectronics. Here, we design an organic compound which crystallize into distinct polymorphs with contrasting luminescent and mechanical behaviors. Controlled growth conditions yield flexible (Cry&#8208;O: orange fluorescence) and brittle (Cry&#8208;Y: yellow fluorescence) crystals which exhibit unique fluorescence shifts and reversible spectral changes between room and low temperatures, alongside unidirectional phase transitions upon thermal stimulation. The optical and mechanical differences between the polymorphs O and Y stem from their distinct molecular packing arrangements and intermolecular interactions. Notably, Cry&#8208;O undergoes sequential phase transitions upon heating to 98 and 132&#176;C, enabling the creation of a ternary "pseudo&#8208;heterojunction" structure, facilitating the integration of multiple functional phases into a single material. These findings not only enhance the understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships of organic materials but also demonstrate the potential of polymorphism&#8208;driven property tuning for optoelectronic devices, thermal management systems, and optical sensors.</dc:description>

The optical and mechanical differences between the polymorphs O and Y stem from their distinct molecular packing arrangements and intermolecular interactions. Notably, Cry-O undergoes sequential phase transitions upon heating to 98 and 132&#176;C, enabling the creation of a ternary "pseudo-heterojunction" structure, facilitating the integration of multiple functional phases into a single material. These findings not only enhance the understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships of organic materials but also demonstrate the potential of polymorphism-driven property tuning for optoelectronic devices, thermal management systems, and optical sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Authentic Al=Si Double Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first example of a bona fide Al=Si double bond stabilized in a four&#8208;membered anionic AlSi3 cycle, which exhibits an unprecedentedly short Al&#8722;Si bond length of 2.283(1)&#8197;&#197; and a high Wiberg bond index (WBI) of 1.31. We illustrate the typical double bond reactivity through the intramolecular activation of C&#8722;H bonds of the Tip group (Tip=2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl), as well as through intermolecular reactions with sulfur sources.







Abstract
Aluminatasilenes are the elusive heavier counterparts of the well&#8208;known borataalkenes in which the B=C double bond is formally replaced by an Al=Si moiety. We report the isolation of a four&#8208;membered anionic AlSi3 cycle with a bona fide Al=Si double bond, which is obtained by the reaction of 2&#8197;eq. of disilenide Tip2Si=SiTipLi with H2AlCl (Tip=2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl). X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV/Vis spectroscopy and computational analysis confirm the double bond character with a very short Al&#8722;Si bond of 2.283(1)&#8197;&#197; and high Wiberg bond index (WBI) of 1.31. Intramolecular C&#8722;H activation by the Al=Si bond and the reactions with sulfur sources confirm typical double bond reactivity.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Free Solar&#8208;Driven Ammonia Coupled to C3&#8208;Dihydroxyacetone Production through Photoelectrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PEC integrated system consisting of CuPd/TSSS photocathode and Pd/BiVO4 photoanode is capable of producing ammonia and high value&#8208;added C3&#8208;DHA products from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater and biomass wastes by directly utilizing solar energy, which satisfies the increasing energy demand and reduces the environmental impact.







Abstract
Conversion of solar energy into value&#8208;added chemicals through photoelectrochemistry (PEC) holds great potential for advancing sustainable development but limits by high onset potential which affects energy conversion efficiencies. Herein, we utilized a CuPd cocatalyst&#8208;modified Sb2(S,Se)3 photocathode (CuPd/TSSS) to achieve an ultra&#8208;low onset potential of 0.83 VRHE for photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis. Meanwhile, we achieved unbiased NH3 production by synthesizing major value&#8208;added C3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone (DHA) through glycerol oxidation on the BiVO4 photoanode with the loading Pd cocatalyst, instead of a traditional solar water oxidation reaction. The PEC integrated system stably produced 11.98&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of NH3 and 201.9&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2 of DHA over 5&#8197;h with ~80&#8201;% faradaic efficiency without applying additional bias. In situ analysis and theoretical calculations confirmed high catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis at the CuPd/TSSS photocathode and enhanced selectivity for DHA at the Pd/BiVO4 photoanode. This design represents a breakthrough in directly utilizing solar energy, nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater, and biomass waste for ammonia and highly value&#8208;added C3 production, which addresses increasing energy demands while decreasing environmental impact.

         <title>High Pressure Synthesis of Pr2O5 &#8211; A Unique Lanthanoid(IV) Oxide Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of PrO2 and oxygen at 27&#8197;GPa in a diamond anvil cell afforded the unique oxide peroxide Pr2(O2)O3 in which praseodymium is found in its rare oxidation state of +IV. Pr2(O2)O3 constitutes the most oxygen rich binary phase of any lanthanoid and oxygen. It could be characterised by X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction analysis at various pressure points, Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Reacting praseodymium(IV) oxide with oxygen at 27&#8197;GPa in a diamond anvil cell yielded the oxide peroxide Pr2IV(O2)O3, which was characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction on multi&#8208;grain samples, Raman spectroscopy and quantum theoretical calculations at various pressure points. The presence of tetravalent praseodymium ions is supported by electronic structure calculations, showing a band gap of ca. 1.2&#8197;eV, which is consistent with the anticipated chemical model of an ionic solid. Pr2(O2)O3 thus far represents the most oxygen rich phase of any binary compound of a lanthanoid and oxygen and is the first example of a peroxide anion next to Pr4+. Additionally, these results demonstrate that instead of oxidizing the praseodymium ions past their +IV oxidation state, oxygen undergoes a comproportionation to form peroxide anions. Direct oxidation of the oxide anions by Pr4+&#8208;ions was ruled out by a control experiment in argon instead of oxygen, where no oxidation of oxide ions was observed.

         <title>Reaction of NHOs with Bisphosphanes &#8211; Designing Diradicaloids, Zwitterions and Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By linking N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins with a P&#8208;substituted indenyl heterocycle, it was possible to synthesize a very exciting new heterocyclic substance class that is both zwitterionic and diradical. The diradical character of these heterocycles can be adjusted by rotation within the molecule, which was achieved by rational design. The thermochromism of these heterocycles was studied by experimental and theoretical methods. Furthermore, we have shown that these heterocycles can activate small molecules. The mechanism of such an activation chemistry was studied and shown to be reversible in some case. Finally, we studied the electronic structure using multireference methods.







Abstract
The linkage of an imidazole&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO), containing a terminal CH2 donor group, with a phosphorus&#8208;centered diradical molecular fragment leads to an open&#8208;shell singlet diphospha&#8208;indenylide system, a new class of P&#8208;heterocycles, which can be interpreted both as a phosphorus&#8208;centered diradicaloid and as a zwitterion with a permanent, overall charge separation between the N&#8208; and P&#8208;heterocyclic ring systems. The rotation of the imidazole ring, which is thermally possible due to a central C&#8722;C bond with a weakened &#960;&#8208;component, changes both the charge separation and diradical character depending on the dihedral angle, as quantum mechanical calculations indicate. By varying the bulkiness of substituents at the imidazole&#8208;based NHO, it was possible to obtain different diphospha&#8208;indenylide species with different rotation angles in the solid state and hence varying diradical character. Imidazolium&#8208;diphospha&#8208;indenylides represent a new class of NHO&#8208;based zwitterions with diradical character. Their synthesis, structure, and activation chemistry are described, as well as the quantum mechanical description of the electronic structure in these unusual heterocycles. In addition, along the synthesis route to diphospha&#8208;indenylide, we also succeeded in isolating a highly reactive monoradical anion, which was also fully characterized.

         <dc:description>We evaluate the ability of machine learning to predict whether a hypothetical crystal structure can be synthesized and explain those predictions to scientists. Fine&#8208;tuned large language models (LLMs) trained on a human&#8208;readable text description of the target crystal structure perform comparably to previous bespoke convolutional graph neural network methods, but better prediction quality can be achieved by training a positive&#8208;unlabeled learning model on a text&#8208;embedding representation of the structure. An LLM&#8208;based workflow can then be used to generate human&#8208;readable explanations for the types of factors governing synthesizability, extract the underlying physical rules, and assess the veracity of those rules. These explanations can guide chemists in modifying or optimizing non&#8208;synthesizable hypothetical structures to make them more feasible for materials design.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding&#8208;Induced Inversion and Amplification of Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) in Supramolecular Assemblies of Axially Chiral Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the self&#8208;assembly and chiroptical properties of two axially chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated luminogens, R&#8208;NMI and S&#8208;NMI, each equipped with two pyridyl moieties for hydrogen (H)&#8208;bonding with chiral diacids. The two enantiomers display aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and increased CD and CPL signals in the self&#8208;assembled state with a high glum value of 1.5 (&#177;0.06) &#215; 10&#8208;2 in 1:9 dioxane:methylcyclohexane. Crystallographic analysis confirmed mirror&#8208;image helical structures for R&#8208;NMI and S&#8208;NMI involving both intra&#8208; and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, leading to elongated hexagonal platelets. Supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of R&#8208;NMI with D&#8208; and L&#8208;tartaric acids (D&#8208;TA and L&#8208;TA) could remarkably modulate and invert the chiroptical properties of R&#8208;NMI, which is unachievable with control chiral monoacids. The co&#8208;assembled structures were driven by pyridine&#8208;carboxylic acid H&#8208;bonding as revealed from the crystal structure analysis, which was also supported by computational studies. Strikingly, R&#8208;NMI+D&#8208;TA leads to an exceptionally high fourfold amplification in the glum value [5.4 (&#177;0.04) &#215; 10&#8315;&#178;] with an inverted sign, which additionally demonstrates intriguing temperature&#8208;dependent switching. In contrast, R&#8208;NMI+L&#8208;TA results in a threefold reduction in the glum value [0.54 (&#177;0.015) &#215; 10&#8315;3], also with an inverted sign compared to R&#8208;NMI alone, establishing a clear strategy for chiral discrimination between the two enantiomers of TA.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the Catalytic Cycle of Ru&#8208;Catalyzed Ammonia Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a mechanism of ammonia oxidation catalyzed by [RuII(NH3)][PF6]2 (Ru = Ru(tpy)(dmabpy)) complexes. All intermediates, including the elusive [RuIII(NH2)]2+ and [RuIV(NH)]2+, were detected, with several intermediates characterized spectroscopically. The catalytic cycle follows multiple reaction pathways branching at the key intermediates [RuIII(NH2)]2+ and [RuII(N2H4)]2+. The competition between the pathways is influenced by ammonia concentration and the local proton concentration generated during electrooxidation at the anode. In the N&#8211;N bond&#8208;forming steps, dimerization of [RuIII(NH2)]2+ and nucleophilic attack of [RuIV(NH)]2+ by ammonia compete, while in the subsequent [RuII(N2H4)]2+ oxidation, direct oxidation competes with proton&#8208;catalyzed disproportionation. These findings provide molecular&#8208;level insights into the catalytic cycle and offer guidance for developing more efficient ruthenium&#8208;based ammonia oxidation catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>An artificial copper&#8208;Michaelase featuring a genetically encoded bipyridine ligand for asymmetric additions to nitroalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are an attractive approach to achieving &#8220;new to nature&#8221; biocatalytic transformations. In this work, a novel copper&#8208;dependent artificial Michaelase (Cu_Michaelase) comprising a genetically encoded copper&#8208;binding ligand, i.e. (2,2&#8208;bipyridin&#8208;5&#8208;yl)alanine (BpyA), was developed. For the first time, such an ArM containing a non&#8208;canonical metal&#8208;binding amino acid was successfully optimized through directed evolution. The evolved Cu_Michaelase was applied in the copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Michael addition of 2&#8208;acetyl azaarenes to nitroalkenes, yielding various &#947;&#8208;nitro butyric acid derivatives, which are precursors for a range of high&#8208;value&#8208;added pharmaceutically relevant compounds, with good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% yield and 99% ee). Additionally, the evolved variant could be further used in a preparative&#8208;scale synthesis, providing chiral products for diverse derivatizations. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis confirmed the binding of Cu(II) ions to the BpyA residues and showed that, in principle, there is sufficient space for the 2&#8208;acetyl azaarene substrates to coordinate. Kinetic studies showed that the increased catalytic efficiency of the evolved enzyme is due to improvements in apparent KM for both substrates and a notable threefold increase in apparent kcat for 2&#8208;acetyl pyridine. This work illustrates the potential of artificial metalloenzymes exploiting non&#8208;canonical metal&#8208;binding ligands for new&#8208;to&#8208;nature biocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Carbonylative Approach to Ureas and Carbamates through Light Activated Nickel Catalyzed Formation of Aliphatic Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the development of a nickel&#8208;catalyzed route to prepare aliphatic isocyanates via carbonylation chemistry. Unlike thermal reactions, where the affinity of Ni(0) for carbon monoxide has traditionally limited its use in carbonylations, mechanistic studies suggest that visible light excitation of a Xantphos&#8208;bound nickel catalyst can enable a radical pathway for the carbonylation of alkyl halides, while the CO&#8208;bound nickel drives the formation of a reactive acyl azide product for rapid Curtius rearrangement. Coupling this transformation with subsequent nucleophilic reactions has opened a unique and modular pathway to apply carbonylations to the synthesis of an array of diversely substituted, unsymmetrical ureas and carbamates, including those of relevance to drug design.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Induced Reversible Martensitic Phase Transition and Self&#8208;Healing in Nickel Glycinamide Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Martensitic phase transitions and self&#8208;healing in molecular compounds are extremely rare, and while they carry potential for rapid energy transduction, they are currently found only by serendipity. Here, we report the observation of both phenomena in a coordination compound of glycinamide (Glyam), [Ni(H2O)2(Glyam)2]I2&#160;(1). Upon cooling to 205&#8211;213 K, the high&#8208;temperature polymorph of this material (1RT) transforms into twinned crystals of the low&#8208;temperature polymorph (1LT(twinned)), while upon heating, it is converted back to&#160;1RT&#160;in the temperature range 217&#8211;223 K. When this transformation occurs in single crystals, evolution of cracks is observed upon cooling that disappear upon heating. The forward transition&#160;1RT&#8594;1LT(twinned)&#160;is completed in a few seconds, while the reverse one,&#160;1LT(twinned)&#8594;1RT, proceeds up to several hours, contrary to the fast transition in polycrystalline samples. We determined the concomitant presence of&#160;1RT&#160;and&#160;1LT(twinned)&#160;in the same single crystal. The crystal structure analysis revealed complex inter&#8208; and intramolecular displacements of atoms during the transition. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second report where a thermally induced reversible martensitic phase transition and self&#8208;healing are observed in crystals of a coordination compound, and indicates the potential generality of these extraordinary phenomena.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Upcycling of Degraded LiCoO2 Towards High&#8208;performance Cathodes via a Multifunctional Organic Lithium Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct recycling of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is a promising technology for resource sustainability and environmental conservation. However, the lithium sources for cathode regeneration are typically mono&#8208;functional, resulting in low performance enhancement of the recycled material. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step direct upcycling method to recycling degraded lithium cobalt oxide (D&#8208;LCO) with lithium lignosulfonate (Li&#8208;L). Li&#8208;L as a multifunctional organic lithium salt can spontaneously attach to the surface of the D&#8208;LCO molecules, thus providing replenishment of Li and doping of elemental sodium and sulfur during the regeneration process. Benefiting from the more stable structure of regenerated LCO supported by Na and S elements, the diffusion efficiency of Li ions and electrons can be improved during charging/discharging. As a result, the cell with upcycling LCO cathode exhibits a high capacity of 220.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C and retention rate of 89.7% after 300 cycles at 10 C with a maximum cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V. More importantly, life&#8208;cycle analysis shows that the upcycling method performs optimally in environmental protection and energy conservation, as well as economic benefits, providing a prospective pathway for the large&#8208;scale application of recycling spent batteries.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Direct recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is a promising technology for resource sustainability and environmental conservation. However, the lithium sources for cathode regeneration are typically mono-functional, resulting in low performance enhancement of the recycled material. Herein, we report a one-step direct upcycling method to recycling degraded lithium cobalt oxide (D-LCO) with lithium lignosulfonate (Li-L). Li-L as a multifunctional organic lithium salt can spontaneously attach to the surface of the D-LCO molecules, thus providing replenishment of Li and doping of elemental sodium and sulfur during the regeneration process. Benefiting from the more stable structure of regenerated LCO supported by Na and S elements, the diffusion efficiency of Li ions and electrons can be improved during charging/discharging. As a result, the cell with upcycling LCO cathode exhibits a high capacity of 220.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C and retention rate of 89.7% after 300 cycles at 10 C with a maximum cut-off voltage of 4.6 V.

         <title>Afterglow Copper(I) Iodine Cluster Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper(I) iodine clusters have drawn intense attention due to their advantageous photophysical properties, such as a high luminescence efficiency, large Stokes shift, and tunable luminescence lifetimes. In this work, a copper(I) iodine cluster (Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN) was synthesized, which exhibits unique afterglow emission, ultrahigh quantum yield (90.1% in solid state) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior. It was found that thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and long&#8208;lifetime phosphorescence occur simultaneously in Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN. The unique photoluminescence properties of Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN were attributed to the large spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and long&#8208;term rigidity of the crystal. The high quantum efficiency, TADF characteristics, and heavy&#8208;atom composition of Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN endow it with excellent X&#8208;ray excited luminescence (XEL) properties, making it a promising X&#8208;ray scintillator. A flexible scintillator screen made of Cu2I2&#8208;CH3CN was successfully fabricated and used for X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution of 23.6 LP mm&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Self&#8208;Catalysis&#8221; Acceleration of Carrier Transport in One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks with Mortise&#8208;Tenon Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are promising in the field of photonic energy conversion. However, most efforts have been concentrated on the design of ligand geometric structures and chemical bonding relationships, while understanding the impact of stacking methods on photonic energy conversion remains a significant challenge. In this work, four COFs (1D&#8208;COF, 1D&#8208;MeCOF, 1D&#8208;tBuCOF&#160;and 2D&#8208;COF) with the same main&#8208;chain structure but different stacking methods are designed and synthesized, using photocatalytic hydrogen evolution as&#160;a&#160;model reaction. Mortise&#8208;tenon stacked 1D&#8208;MeCOF exhibits far superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance to other stacking methods,&#160;and it maintains high efficiency and stability in natural seawater systems. Extensive characterization demonstrates that such a unique mortise&#8208;tenon stacking structure of 1D&#8208;MeCOF inhibits interchain slippage, enhances &#960;&#8208;stacking, and maximizing&#160;light absorption capabilities. Furthermore, unidirectional carrier transport characteristics of one&#8208;dimensional structure can generate a strong photo&#8208;induced self&#8208;built electric field, which acts as "self&#8208;catalysis" to accelerate carrier transport. This work provides an effective design strategy and mechanistic&#160;insights on&#160;the stacking engineering of photonic energy conversion materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Elucidation of Lattice&#8208;Hydrogens in Copper Catalysts for Selective CO2 Electrochemical Conversion Toward C2 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper is the most efficient and practical electrocatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (ECR) to give multicarbon (C2+) products, but the mechanism by which such products are formed &#8212; though known to involve lattice&#8208;hydrogens &#8212; remains elusive, and the selectivity of the reaction is poor. Herein, we report the synthesis of [AuCu24(dppp)6H22]+, a copper hydride nanocluster bearing exposed Cu3H3 units in specific surface cavities, and our use of it to study the mechansim and selectivity of the reduction of CO2 to C2+ products. Results of in situ infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations showed that these Cu3H3 units can effectively lower the energy barrier to the formation of the *COCOH intermediate, which allowed te competition between the C1 and C2 pathways to be elucidated. Isotope labeling experiments and catalyst recrystallization studies corroborated the theoretical simulations, identifying the lattice&#8208;hydrogen (H&#8208;) in the Cu3H3 active unit as being indispensable for the formation of C2H4. The molecular design guidelines which this work has facilitated constitute a new approach towards the of copper&#8208;based catalysts that convert CO2 to C2+ products based on lattice&#8208;hydrogen engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Electroluminescence and Stability of Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although remarkable breakthroughs have been witnessed in the field of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), efficient and stable blue PeLEDs still remain&#160;as a critical challenge to towards commercial applications. Inspired by the protection effect and water&#8208;repellent properties of swan feathers, 2H,2H,3H,3H&#8208;heptadecafluoroundecanoic acid (HFUA) has been designed as adsorbed functional molecule for blue perovskites for&#160;simultaneously enhancing&#160;the electroluminescence performance and moisture stability. The HFUA molecule features a long&#8208;chain structure where the carboxylic acid group acts as an anchor, coordinating with undercoordinated lead atoms in blue perovskites. The fluorine atoms at the opposite end of the chain form ionic bonds with the halogen octahedron, thereby stabilizing the octahedral structure. In addition, HFUA adsorption lowers the adsorption energy of organic spacers on the perovskite lattice, optimizing the reduced&#8208;dimensional phase distribution to facilitate smooth exciton transfer. Furthermore, the unique molecular structure of HFUA, rich in fluorine atoms, enhances the hydrophobicity of the perovskite surface, effectively inhibiting moisture penetration and preventing perovskite hydrolysis. The target blue PeLEDs obtain a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.88% at 490 nm and exhibit greatly improved air stability under humid and high&#8208;temperature conditions. Our findings provide a unique and effective strategy for producing efficient and stable blue PeLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with a Boron&#8208;Doped Zigzag/Armchair Topology: A Boron&#8208;Edging Strategy for Organic Narrowband Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control over molecular topologies and/or heteroatom doping of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may alter their electronic structures and achieve desirable physical properties. Herein, this work challenges boron&#8208;doping and edge&#8208;transformation of &#960;&#8208;extended PAHs. We successfully synthesized a series of large&#8208;size PAHs featuring a boron&#8208;doped zigzag/armchair edge topology through one&#8208;pot multifold Scholl cyclization reaction. Two of them possess the desired C3&#8208;symmetric and unexpected unsymmetrical C54B3 nanographene frameworks, respectively, thus illustrating triply boron&#8208;edging manipulations of hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene. Detailed studies reveal that such boron&#8208;doped edge topology significantly inhibits their excited&#8208;state molecular vibrations and thereby produces narrowband emission characteristics. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of their fluorescence spectra are as small as 12&#8210;18 nm, which have never been observed for pristine boron&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;system and are among the smallest values reported for organic emitters. Their solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) display extremely narrowband electroluminescence, and additionally, the obtained FWHM of only 23 nm represents the narrowest one reported for red OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cost&#8208;effective micro&#8208;sized silicon (&#956;Si) anodes with high specific capacity are promising for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries but face significant volume changes during cycling. Constructing anion&#8208;derived, inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase by electrolyte engineering is considered a viable strategy for stabilizing &#956;Si anodes. However, at low temperatures, temperature&#8208;dependent anion&#8208;dominated solvation and sluggish Li+ desolvation hinder cyclability and capacity retention. Here we introduce a unique temperature&#8208;inert weakly solvating electrolyte (TIWSE) that preserves the anion&#8208;dominated solvation sheath and has weak solvent coordination capability, enabling stable cycling of &#956;Si anodes in subzero environments. The crucial role of NO3&#8722; anions with a high donor number in regulating competitive coordination in TIWSE is unveiled. As a result, &#956;Si||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cells with TIWSE demonstrate impressive capacity retention of 91.8% at &#8722;20 &#176;C and 80.8% at 30 &#176;C after 100 cycles, along with a high specific capacity of 137.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 6 C. Furthermore, a 1&#8208;Ah pouch cell of Si&#8208;C||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 shows remarkable cycling stability with 89.3% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 30 &#176;C and 77.3% retention at &#8722;20 &#176;C, demonstrating the practical applicability. This work highlights the importance of solvation chemistry in addressing low&#8208;temperature challenges and offers new insights into high&#8208;energy &#956;Si&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries operating under harsh conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme Controlled Transient Phospholipid Vesicles for Regulated Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolism in biological systems involves the continuous formation and breakdown of chemical and structural components, driven by chemical energy. In specific, metabolic processes on cellular membranes result in in situ formation and degradation of the constituent phospholipid molecules, by consuming fuel, to dynamically regulate the properties. Synthetic analogs of such chemically fueled phospholipid vesicles have been challenging. Here we report a bio&#8208;inspired approach for the in situ formation of phospholipids, from water soluble precursors, and their fuel driven self&#8208;assembly into vesicles. We show that the kinetic competition between anabolic and catabolic&#8208;like reactions leads to the formation and enzymatic degradation of the double&#8208;tailed, vesicle&#8208;forming phospholipid. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis demonstrate the formation of transient vesicles whose lifetime can be easily tuned from minutes to hours. Importantly, our design results in the formation of uniform sized (65 nm) vesicles simply by mixing the precursors, thus avoiding the traditional complex methods. Finally, our sub&#8208;100 nm vesicles are of the right size for application in drug delivery. We have demonstrated that the release kinetics of the incorporated cargo molecules can be dynamically regulated for potential applications in adaptive nanomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Closed&#8208;loop Recyclable Lithium and Sodium Conducting Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within the past two decades, covalent adaptable networks (CANs) have emerged as a novel class of dynamically crosslinked polymers, combining the benefits of thermosets and thermoplastics. Although some CANs with charged side chains have been reported, CANs with negatively charged backbones remain very limited. The integration of permanent charge into the backbones upon their formation could open up important new applications. Here, we introduce a series of aliphatic spiroborate&#8208;linked ionic covalent adaptable networks (ICANs), representing a new category of dynamic ionomer thermosets. These ICANs were synthesized using a catalyst&#8208;free, scalable, and environment&#8208;friendly method. Incorporating lithium or sodium as counter cations in these networks yielded promising ion conductivity without the need of plasticizers. The dynamic nature of the spiroborate linkages in these materials allows for rapid reprocessing and recycling under moderate conditions. Furthermore, their potential as flexible solid&#8208;state electrolytes is demonstrated in a device that maintained robust conducting performance under extreme physical deformation, coupled with effective self&#8208;healing properties. This research opens new possibilities for future development of dynamic ionomer thermosets and their potential applications in flexible electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating Tumor Immunotherapy Through a Synergistic Strategy of Increasing Throttle and Relaxing Brake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disodium hydrogen phosphate nanoparticles (Na2HPO4 NPs) release a large amount of ions within tumor cells, thereby activating pyroptosis and antitumor immune response, achieving &#8220;increasing throttle&#8221; of immunotherapy. Meanwhile, alkalescent Na2HPO4 NPs can further consume lactic acid and adenosine (Ado) to relieve two&#8208;tier immunosuppression, realizing &#8220;relaxing brake&#8221; on immunotherapy.







Abstract
Tumor immunotherapy has been widely used clinically, but it is still hindered by weak antitumor immunity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, a kind of simple disodium hydrogen phosphate nanoparticle (Na2HPO4 NP) is prepared to &#8220;accelerate&#8221; tumor immunotherapy by &#8220;increasing throttle&#8221; and &#8220;relaxing brake&#8221; simultaneously. The obtained Na2HPO4 NPs release a large amount of Na+ and HPO42&#8722; ions within tumor cells, thereby activating the caspase 1/GSDMD&#8208;mediated pyroptosis pathway to achieve immune activation. Meanwhile, alkalescent Na2HPO4 NPs can further consume lactic acid through acid&#8208;base neutralization, and regulate adenosine (Ado) metabolism via nanomaterial&#8208;induced biocatalytic process to relieve two&#8208;tier immunosuppression. Collectively, Na2HPO4 NPs effectively activate the antitumor immune process in vivo, and dramatically inhibit primary and distal tumor growth. This work will provide unique inspiration and strategy for the regulation of both positive and negative directions in immunotherapy.

         <title>Electrolyte Design Using &#8220;Porous Water&#8221; for High&#8208;purity Carbon Monoxide Electrosynthesis from Dilute Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous electrolyte with high CO2 physical adsorption capacity, was constructed to continuously produce high&#8208;purity CO from dilute CO2. Interfacial CO2 concentration gradient drives the spontaneously desorption of CO2 under reductive potential, excluding other gaseous species in product stream. Combined high CO2 concentration and surface exchange between K ions and Si&#8208;OH, gives continuous production of CO with purity of 97.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% from 15&#8201;% CO2.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of high&#8208;purity carbon monoxide (CO) from captured carbon dioxide (CO2) remains energy&#8208;intensive due to the unavoidable CO2 regeneration and post&#8208;purification stages. Here, we propose a direct high&#8208;purity CO electrosynthesis strategy employing an innovative electrolyte, termed porous electrolyte (PE), based on &#8220;porous water&#8221;. Zeolite nanocrystals within PE provide permanent pores in the liquid phase, enabling physical CO2 adsorption through an intraparticle diffusion model, as demonstrated by molecular dynamics simulations and in situ spectral analysis. Captured CO2 spontaneously desorbs under applied reductive potential, driven by the interfacial CO2 concentration gradient, and is subsequently reduced electrochemically. The high CO2 concentration in PE enhances mass transfer, and surface ion exchange between Si&#8722;OH groups and K+ ions on the zeolite surface generates a stronger interfacial electric field, promoting electron transfer steps. This optimized kinetics for mass and electron transfer confers heightened intrinsic activity toward CO2 electroreduction. The PE&#8208;based electrolysis system demonstrated superior CO Faradaic efficiency and partial current density compared to the conventional CO2&#8208;fed system. A circular system using PE and a Ni&#8722;N/C cathode realized continuous production of high&#8208;purity CO (97.0&#8197;wt&#8201;%) from dilute CO2 (15&#8201;%) and maintained &gt;90.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% under 150&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with significantly reduced energy consumption and costs.

Exploring the High&#8208;Pressure Induced Abnormal Blueshift in MnS@CdS QDs: Unlocking New Mechanisms for Optoelectronic Applications







Abstract
Mn d&#8722;d emission has been a star transition&#8208;metal activated phosphors that were extensively used in optoelectronic devices. However, due to the complex and elusive luminescence mechanism, the full potential of this material remains largely untapped. Here, we designed a core&#8211;shell structure of MnS@CdS quantum dots (QDs) to investigate the effect of the internal strain on the Mn emission. Upon pressure processing, an unexpected blueshift of Mn emission was achieved. When the pressure reached a pressure of 2.1&#8197;GPa, the conventional redshift of Mn emission reappeared. Remarkable color transition from red to orange and then back to red was observed during pressure treatment. Further analysis revealed that the application of external pressure facilitated the diffusion of Mn atoms into the CdS shell, strengthened host&#8208;dopant coupling and mitigated the lattice mismatch rate within the MnS@CdS QDs. These factors resulted in a reduction in phonon coupling strength and an increase in energy transfer efficiency from the exciton of the CdS host lattice to the Mn dopants, thus ultimately accounting for the abnormal blueshift of Mn d&#8722;d emission. Our findings represent a significant breakthrough in the quest for precise control and regulation of Mn&#8208;related emission, offering insights into the underlying luminescence mechanism of Mn emission.

         <title>Realizing a 3&#8197;C Fast&#8208;Charging Practical Sodium Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorus&#8208;sulfur synergistic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase has been constructed on the surface of hard carbon anode to reduce the energy barrier of both Na+ desolvation and diffusion. Consequently, a 126&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 Ah&#8208;level practical sodium pouch cell capable of 3&#8197;C fast charging has been achieved. Further, a power&#8208;type pouch cell with a record high charging C&#8208;rate up to 50&#8197;C has also been fabricated.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), endowed with relatively small Stokes radius and low desolvation energy of Na+, are reckoned as a promising candidate for fast&#8208;charging endeavors. However, the C&#8208;rate charging capability of practical energy&#8208;dense sodium&#8208;ion pouch cells is currently limited to &#8804;1&#8197;C, due to the high propensity for detrimental metallic Na plating on the hard carbon (HC) anode at elevated rates. Here, an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level sodium&#8208;ion pouch cell capable of 3&#8197;C charging is successfully developed via phosphorus (P)&#8208;sulfur (S) interphase chemistry. By rational electrolyte regulation, desired P&#8722;S constituents, namely, Na3PO4 and Na2SO4, are generated in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase with favorable Na+ interface kinetics. Specifically, Na+ desolvation energy barrier has been greatly lowered by the weak ion&#8208;solvent coordination near the inner Helmholtz plane on Na3PO4 interphase, while Na2SO4 expedites charge carrier mobility due to its intrinsically high ionic conductivity. Consequently, an energy&#8208;dense (126&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) O3&#8208;Na(Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3)O2||HC pouch cell capable of 3&#8197;C charging (100&#8201;% state of charge) without Na plating can be achieved, with a great capacity retention of 91.5&#8201;% over 200&#8197;cycles. Further, the assembled power&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)3||HC pouch cell displays an impressive fast&#8208;charging capability of 50&#8197;C, which surpasses that of previously reported high&#8208;power SIBs. This work serves as an enlightenment for developing fast&#8208;charging SIBs.

         <title>A &#8220;Flexible&#8221; Solvent Molecule Enabling High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the BTF diluent and the 2,5&#8208;THF solvent result in an expansion of the bond angle in the 2,5&#8208;THF molecules. This structural alteration increases the steric hindrance of 2,5&#8208;THF, while simultaneously reducing its polarity. Consequently, the anion ratio within the solvation structure of the electrolyte is elevated, which enhances the electrochemical performance of both the lithium metal anode and the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode.







Abstract
Electrolyte chemistries are crucial for achieving high cycling performance and high energy density in lithium metal batteries. The localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) exhibit good performance in lithium metal batteries. However, understanding how the intermolecular interactions between solvents and diluents in the electrolyte regulate the solvation structure and interfacial layer structure remains limited. Here, we reported a new LHCE in which strong hydrogen bonding between diluents and solvents alters the conformation and polarity of &#8220;flexible&#8221; solvent molecules, thereby effectively regulating the solvation structure of Li+ ion and promoting the formation of robust electrode interfaces. The endpoint H of the &#8220;flexible&#8221; chain O&#8208;CH&#8208;CH3 of the 2,5&#8208;dimethyltetrahydrofuran (2,5&#8208;THF) solvent and the F of the benzotrifluoride (BTF) diluent can form strong hydrogen bonds, which expand the maximum bond angle of the 2,5&#8208;THF molecule from 119&#176; to 123&#176;. The expanded bond angle increases the steric hindrance of the 2,5&#8208;THF molecule and decreases its polarity. This leads to an increase in the anion content within the solvation structure, which in turn enhances the performance of both the lithium metal anode and the sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) cathode. As a result, the lithium metal anode shows a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of as high as 99.4&#8201;%. The assembled Li||SPAN battery based on our developed LHCE exhibits impressive stability with an average CE of 99.8&#8201;% over 700 cycles. Moreover, the Li||SPAN pouch cell can be stably cycled with a high energy density of 301.4&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This molecular&#8208;level understanding of the correlation between molecular interactions and solvation structures provides new insights into the design of advanced LHCEs for high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries.

         <title>SN2&#8722;Reaction&#8722; Bonding&#8208;Heterointerface Strengthens Buried Adhesion and Orientation for Advanced Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a novel SN2&#8722;reaction&#8722;driven bonding&#8208;heterointerface to strengthen the buried adhesion and orientation of perovskite film by simultaneously functionalizing the underlying substrate and functionalizing [PbX6]4&#8722; octahedral framework. Benefiting from the reinforcement of buried adhesion and target&#8722;point&#8722;oriented crystallization, an all&#8208;air&#8208;processed carbon&#8722;based all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI2Br device achieves an enhanced efficiency of 15.14&#8201;% with improved stability.







Abstract
Traditionally weak buried interaction without customized chemical bonding always goes against the formation of high&#8208;&#8722;quality perovskite film that highly determines the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. To address this issue, herein, we propose a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2) driving strategy to idealize the robust buried interface by simultaneously decorating underlying substrate and functionalizing [PbX6]4&#8722; octahedral framework with iodoacetamide and thiol molecules, respectively. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that a strong SN2 reaction between exposed halogen and thiol group in two molecules occurs, which not only benefits the reinforcement of buried adhesion, but also triggers target&#8208;point&#8208;oriented crystallization, synergistically upgrading the upper perovskite film quality and accelerating interfacial charge extraction&#8211;transfer behavior. Benefiting from the suppressed nonradiative recombination, as a result, an all&#8208;air&#8208;processed carbon&#8211;based all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI2Br device achieves an enhanced efficiency of 15.14&#8201;%, more importantly, with significantly prolonged long&#8208;term stability under harsh conditions. This unique reaction&#8211;driven buried interface provides a new path for manipulating perovskite growth and obtaining advanced perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Accessing a Carboxyl&#8208;Anhydride Molecular Switch&#8208;Mediated Recyclable PECT Through Upcycling End&#8208;of&#8208;Use PET</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel recycling strategy, based on the principles of polycondensation, is proposed for upcycling waste PET to produce high&#8208;value recyclable poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) (PECT) containing molecular switches. Upon activation of the molecular switch, PECT undergoes rapid depolymerization to form a prepolymer. Conversely, the prepolymer can be efficiently polymerized back into high molecular weight PECT.







Abstract
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), with an annual production of exceeding 70 million tons, is mainly utilized in disposable fields and subsequently contribute to severe environmental pollution. Conventional chemical recycling, which typically involves depolymerizing polymer into monomers, is limited due to the intricate recycling process, excess using unrecyclable solvents and low polymer conversion. Inspired by protein's molecular switches, we propose a novel polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer recycling strategy based on polycondensation principles upcycling waste PET to high&#8208;value recyclable poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) derivatives containing molecular switches. Upon deactivating the molecular switch, an acidification reaction occurs within the system, leading to a rapid and controllable reduction in molecular weight due to the imbalance of reactive group. Conversely, activating the molecular switch triggers a ring&#8208;closing reaction that detaches acid anhydrides, bringing about equal molar ratio of groups and thereby facilitating an increase in molecular weight. By simply incorporating a molecular switch into condensation products based on melt polycondensation, closed&#8208;loop recycling capability is achieved without necessitating excessive organic solvents or complex depolymerization processes. The present study not only presents a novel pathway for end&#8208;of&#8208;use PET upcycling but also introduces an innovative concept of molecular switching for the closed&#8208;loop recyclability of condensation polymers, thereby demonstrating significant potential for large&#8208;scale implementation.

         <title>Divergent Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Sulfated Ganglio&#8208;Oligosaccharides for Probing Ligand Requirements of Glycan Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical synthesis of orthogonal protected tetra&#8208; and pentasaccharides combined with chemical sulfation and enzymatic sialylations gave a panel of sulfated ganglio&#8208;oligosaccharides that were printed as microarray and screened for binding to lectins, glycan binding proteins, and antibodies. It revealed that sulfation modulates recognition in complex manners.







Abstract
Sulfoglycolipids are an important class of acidic glycosphingolipids that have been implicated in a multitude of biological processes. Little is known about the interactome of sulfated gangliosides, and it is not well understood how a possible interplay between sialylation and sulfation influences molecular recognition. Here, we describe a chemoenzymatic strategy that readily provided a panel of twenty&#8208;one sulfated and sialylated ganglio&#8208;oligosaccharides. It is based on the chemical synthesis of a core tetra&#8208; and pentasaccharide that are equipped with the orthogonal protecting groups allyloxycarbonate (Alloc), levulinate ester (Lev) and t&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl ether (TBS). Selective removal of one or more protecting groups followed by sulfation of the resulting alcohol(s) and deprotecting gave several ganglio&#8208;oligosaccharides. Compound lacking an internal sialic acid could be prepared by exposing several derivatives to a sialidase. Compounds having an unmodified terminal galactoside could enzymatically be sialylated to give hybrid structures, which could be further extended to provide 2,8&#8208;sialosides. The synthetic glycans were printed as a microarray which was used to examine ligand requirements of a series of glycan&#8208;binding proteins including antibodies, toxins, galectins and siglecs. It was found that sulfation regulates protein binding in complex manners and in general sulfation and sialylation of C&#8208;3 of the terminal Gal influences protein binding in different ways.

         <title>Easily Water&#8208;Synthesisable Iron&#8208;Chloranilate Frameworks as High Energy and High&#8208;Power Cathodes for Sustainable Alkali&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;chloranilate frameworks can be easily synthesised in aqueous solution. Lattice and coordination water removal under mild heating leads to a 2D honeycomb neutral framework, without counterions or solvent molecules, that displays high energy density as a cathode for sustainable lithium, sodium and potassium ion rechargeable batteries.







Abstract
Achieving high battery performance from low&#8208;cost, easily synthesisable electrode materials is crucial for advancing energy storage technologies. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) combining inexpensive transition metals and organic ligands are promising candidates for high&#8208;capacity cathodes. Iron&#8208;chloranilate&#8208;water frameworks are herein reported to be produced in aqueous media under mild conditions. Removal of reticular water from known [Fe2(CAN)3(H2O)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O yields a new supramolecular metal&#8211;organic framework (SMOF), [Fe2(CAN)3(H2O)4]. Removing coordination water, a new 2D honeycomb&#8208;like MOF forms, Fe2(CAN)3, stable without counterions and solvent. This MOF adopts the unusual ABC layer&#8208;stacking, as determined using a combination of ab initio random structure searching, electron diffraction, and Rietveld refinement of powder XRD data. Magnetometry, Mossbauer and Raman spectroscopy confirm that all three [Fe2(CAN)3(H2O)x]&#8901;yH2O phases contain HS&#8208;Fe3+ and CAN2&#8722;, with magnetic ordering temperatures increasing (5&#8594;20&#8197;K) as the Fe&#8722;CAN connectivity increases. The SMOF and MOF show reversible (de)insertion of &gt;4Li+/f.u. at average 2,59&#8197;V and 2,76&#8197;V vs Li+/Li, respectively. [Fe2(CAN)3] achieves 146&#8197;mAh/g at 1&#8197;C, thus specific energy (563&#8197;Wh/kg) and power (446&#8197;W/kg) in Li half&#8208;cells competitive with conventional LiFePO4 (~580&#8197;Wh/kg and ~450&#8197;W/kg). Beyond Li, [Fe2(CAN)3] delivers 394&#8197;Wh/kg and 421&#8197;Wh/kg, for Na and K half&#8208;cells respectively, becoming a competitive cathode for sustainable batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Catalytic Sites Grafting on 2D&#8208;Metal Oxides for Acceptorless Alcohol Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implementing 2D&#8208;nanocofined metal atomic&#8208;site grafting strategy, involving the thermal conversion of catalyst precursor loaded single metal hydroxide layer within silica bilayer envelope, produced the high density single atomic catalytic sites stably and homogeneously embedded on isolated 1&#8197;nm&#8208;thin metal oxide nanosheets, which demonstrated outperforming activity in catalyzing acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation reaction.







Abstract
Installing well&#8208;defined high density single&#8208;atomic catalyst (SAC) sites is highly desired for the synergistic cooperative effect in efficient chemical synthesis but elusive to synthesize due to unavoidable atomic segregation into clusters or particulates. We implemented a 2D&#8208;nanoconfined SAC grafting strategy. Inside a bilayer silica envelope, single metal hydroxide layer, pre&#8208;loaded with the catalytic metal (Pt, Pd, Ir) precursors, underwent controlled thermal conversion to the homogeneously embedded SACs decorated onto the in&#8197;situ generated 1&#8197;nm&#8208;thin transition metal oxide (TMO) nanosheet. Ultranarrow confined slit&#8208;space exclusively availed laterally emerging cation vacancies of TMO host, as atomic scale sockets to capture SACs within 2D&#8208;plane while vertically restricting the atomic aggregation into nanoparticulates. High density SACs stably decorated on isolated TMO nanosheet, could be obtained in a controllable manner. Well&#8208;defined SACs on TMO were conveniently employed for acceptorless dehydrogenation of a variety of alcohols with quite high activities outperforming reported catalysts. In&#8208;depth, mechanistic investigation revealed the dramatic enhancement in acceptorless dehydrogenation reaction rates by following distinct reaction pathways (concerted or stepwise) depending on the density of SACs cooperativity effect. Such advantageous effect is distinct from the reactions on isolated metal sites in low&#8208;density SACs or nanoparticle surface.

         <title>Self&#8208;optimizing Cobalt Tungsten Oxide Electrocatalysts toward Enhanced Oxygen Evolution in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progressively enhanced oxygen evolution is achieved by self&#8208;optimization of cobalt tungsten oxide deposited on lab&#8208;synthesized copper oxide substrate. Experimental data proved dynamic compositional / structural evolution while theoretical calculation revealed active site adaptation. The strategic design concept could strengthen the emergence of self&#8208;improved electrocatalysts for a wide range of challenging energy conversion and storage reactions.

Self&#8208;optimizing mixed metal oxides represent a novel class of electrocatalysts for the advanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we report self&#8208;assembled cobalt tungsten oxide nanostructures on a lab&#8208;synthesized copper oxide substrate through a single&#8208;step deposition approach. The resulting composite exhibits remarkable self&#8208;optimization behavior, shown by significantly reduced overpotentials and enhanced current densities, accompanied with substantial increase in OER kinetics, electrocatalytically active surface area, surface wettability, and electrical conductivity. Under operating conditions, interfacial restructuring of the electrocatalyst reveals the in&#8197;situ formation of oxidized cobalt species as the true active site. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations further demonstrate the formation of *OOH intermediate as the rate&#8208;determining step of OER, and highlight the adaptive binding of oxygen intermediates, which transitions from tungsten to cobalt site during OER process. Our study provides a fundamental understanding of the self&#8208;optimization mechanism and advances the knowledge&#8208;driven design of efficient water&#8208;splitting electrocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Progressively enhanced oxygen evolution is achieved by self-optimization of cobalt tungsten oxide deposited on lab-synthesized copper oxide substrate. Experimental data proved dynamic compositional / structural evolution while theoretical calculation revealed active site adaptation. The strategic design concept could strengthen the emergence of self-improved electrocatalysts for a wide range of challenging energy conversion and storage reactions.

         <title>Helical Quintulene: Synthesis, Chirality, and Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helical, bowl&#8208;shaped extended quintulene (1) was synthesized by incomplete dehydrocyclization, revealing quintuple [5]helicenes fused at the rim. Chiroptical studies on 1 demonstrated strong dissymmetry in both the absorption and luminescence. The bowl shape of 1 enables supramolecular assembly between 1 and fullerene. These findings expand the structural diversity of quintulene and represent the first example of a cycloarene fused with helicenes.







Abstract
Quintulene is a quintuply symmetrical cycloarene with a positively curved molecular geometry. First described by Staab and Sauer in 1984, its successful synthesis was not achieved until 2020. Due to the challenges posed by its positive curvature, structural extensions of quintulene have been studied rarely. In this work, we report the synthesis of a chiral quintulene (1) featuring five [5]helicene units at its rim constructed through the introduction of steric hindrance. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis confirmed the structure of 1 that showcases a unique chirality combining helicity and rotational symmetry. The enantiomers of 1 were separated and their chiroptical properties were examined, revealing the dissymmetric absorption and luminescence. Additionally, the bowl shape facilitates supramolecular assembly between 1 and fullerenes, with a binding constant to C60 10&#8208;fold higher than to C70. This work expands the structural diversity of quintulene and bridges the structures of cycloarenes and multi&#8208;helicenes, paving the way for the structural design of chiral cycloarenes.

         <title>Low&#8208;Dimensional Hetero&#8208;Interlayer Enabling Sub&#8208;Bandgap Photovoltaic Conversion for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;dimensional hetero&#8208;interlayer of HQ2ZnI4 acts as the sensitizer actualizing additional near&#8208;infrared photovoltaic conversion, the buffer layer with strong interaction and suitable binding interval, the energy modification interface for facilitating carrier transfer, and the buffer preventing instability decomposition, making devices achieving sub&#8208;band gap photovoltaic gain and enhancement in photoelectric performance.







Abstract
Actualizing sub&#8208;band gap photovoltaic conversion is effective in remitting energy loss and pushing theoretical efficiency limits for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a zero&#8208;dimensional organic metal halide based on hydroxyquinoline (HQ) is developed to sensitize PSCs for near&#8208;infrared region gain to implement sub&#8208;band gap photovoltaic conversion for enhancing power&#8208;conversion&#8208;efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. [ZnI4]2&#8722; skeletons containing heavy atoms intensify the direct singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet state transition of organic chromophores HQ. Meanwhile, the triplet energy of HQ is close to resonance with perovskite band gap, favoring the energy transfer to perovskite and exciting the additional electron&#8208;hole pairs, which was observed by transient absorption spectroscopy, confirming the sensitization of perovskite to increase sub&#8208;band gap photocurrent. HQ2ZnI4 modifies electronic and crystal structure, optimizes energy&#8208;level arrangement, and acts as a protective layer, realizing considerable PCEs in small (6.25&#8197;mm2)&#8208;/larger&#8208;area (1&#8197;cm2) devices and excellent operational stability. This low&#8208;cost strategy brings vitality to the light management of PSCs and expands low&#8208;dimensional materials.

         <title>Tuning Atomically Dispersed Metal Sites in Nanozymes for Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning nanozymes with atomically dispersed metal sites efficiently enhances their catalytic activity and specificity, and multifunctionality by optimizing the electronic and geometric structures. Taking advantage of unique properties, these advanced nanozymes hold great promise in sensing applications, achieving the goals of high detection sensitivity, selectivity, and accuracy.







Abstract
Nanozymes with atomically dispersed metal sites (ADzymes), especially single&#8208;atom nanozymes, have attracted widespread attention in recent years due to their unique advantages in mimicking the active sites of natural enzymes. These nanozymes not only maximize exposure of catalytic sites but also possess superior catalytic activity performance, achieving challenging catalytic reactions. These advantages position ADzymes as highly promising candidates in the field of sensing and biosensing. This review summarizes the classification and properties of ADzymes, systematically highlighting some typical regulation strategies involving central metal, coordination environment, etc., to achieve their catalytical activity, specificity, and multifunctionality. Then, we present the recent advances of ADzymes in different sensing fields, including colorimetry, fluorescence, electrochemistry, chemiluminescence, photoelectrochemistry, and electrochemiluminescence. Taking advantage of their unique catalytic performance, the resultant ADzymes show great potential in achieving the goal of sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy for the detection of various targets. Specifically, the underlying mechanisms in terms of signal amplification were discussed in detail. Finally, the current challenges and perspectives on the development of advanced ADzymes are discussed.

         <title>Breaking the Limitation of Laminar Flow in Thrombolytic Therapy with Reconfigurable Vortexlike Nanobot Swarms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Laminar blood flow represents the normal physiological state of blood circulation, but it also acts as a natural physiological barrier for the effective diffusion of drugs to the lesion site. Here, we report a bioinspired strategy in which reconfigurable vortexlike swarms of magnetic swimming nanobots actively disrupt the laminar flow to deliver drugs in a manner similar to how bacteria seek food. The drug was released from the cavity of biodegradable, submicron pentosan flask&#8208;like nanobots, aggregates as the dynamic rotating drug fluid under a rotating magnetic field. The vortexlike nanobot swarm successfully overcame the laminar barrier near the thrombus in a rat inferior vena cava stenosis thrombosis model, which was observed by ultrasound blood flow imaging. Furthermore, the clinical feasibility of nanobots swarm for enhancing thrombolytic efficacy through drug aggregation after breaking the laminar flow was further confirmed in a rat deep vein thrombosis model. This bionic active targeting approach overcomes the laminar flow barrier and restricts the release of drugs by the swarm&#8208;induced vortex fluid to facilitate targeted drug delivery, which is expected to be an innovative method to enhance drug delivery efficiency.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanomaterials offer a transformative platform for photothermal therapy (PTT) due to their unique physicochemical properties and exceptional photothermal conversion efficiencies. This Minireview summarizes the photothermal mechanisms of common 2D nanomaterials and details their synthesis, surface modification, and optimization strategies. Recent advances leveraging 2D nanomaterials for enhanced PTT are highlighted, with particular emphasis on synergistic therapeutic modalities. Despite the significant potential of 2D nanomaterials in PTT, challenges persist, including scalable and reproducible manufacturing, precise targeted delivery, understanding of the underlying biological interactions, and comprehensive assessment of long&#8208;term biocompatibility and toxicity. Looking forward, emerging technologies such as machine learning are expected to play a crucial role in accelerating the design and optimization of 2D nanomaterials for PTT, enabling the prediction of optimal structures, properties, and therapeutic efficacy, and ultimately paving the way for personalized nanomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanotherapeutic Agent for Synergistic Tumor Therapy: Co&#8208;activation of Photochemical&#8208;Biological Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;mode photodynamic therapy (PDT) based on photochemical reactions is limited by the tumor microenvironment, which reduces the ablation efficiency for solid tumors. Making it vital to seek ways to improve the tumor therapeutic effect. Based on this, we propose a dual&#8208;mode intelligent nanotherapeutic system (HAP@BMPns) based on photochemical&#8208;biological effects. HAP@BMPns is composed of an acid&#8208;responsive high&#8208;calcium biomimetic nanomaterial (HAP) and photosensitizer (BMP), which can spontaneously activate photochemical (Type&#8208;I PDT) and biological effects for synergistic cancer therapy. HAP@BMPns breaks down upon entering tumor cells under acidic conditions, releasing a large amount of Ca2+ and BMP. Triggering intracellular Ca2+ overload, which induces mitochondrial damage, leading to apoptosis. Synchronously, Type&#8208;I PDT of BMP under two&#8208;photon (800 nm) laser irradiation becomes activated, resulting in enhanced destruction of tumor cells by the photochemical effect. Cell studies have indicated that HAP@BMPns (41.6 &#956;g/mL) exhibits a strong inhibitory efficiency on tumor cells growth, with low (22.4%) survival rate. However, the individual components, i.e. BMP (5.0 &#956;M) and HAP (41.6 &#956;g/mL) display low inhibitory efficiency with high survival rates (55.9% and 63.0% respectively). Therefore, this dual&#8208;mode synergistic treatment strategy using acid&#8208;triggered photochemical&#8208;biological effects significantly enhances the ablation of solid tumors, realizing the synergistic effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Marine Diterpenoids Caucanolide E and F by Alkyne gem&#8208;Hydrogenation: Rigorous Reassignment of Two Almost Indistinguishable Diastereomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the spectra of the diastereomeric marine seco&#8208;cembranoids caucanolide E and F are almost identical, the isolation team had not been able to firmly assign their stereostructure. The puzzle has now been solved by a synthetic approach predicated on biogenetic considerations, which suggested that both natural products are 10S configured but differ in the configuration of their C8 stereocenter. Under this proviso, they can be distinguished by comparison with synthetic samples that are deliberately 8S,10S and 8S,10R configured: only one natural product can match sign and magnitude of the [&#945;]D of one of these reference compounds; this particular caucanolide must be the 8S,10S isomer. Both reference compounds needed for this benchmarking exercise were accessible from a single precursor via ruthenium catalyzed gem&#8208;hydrogenation of an enyne to furnish an alkoxyfuran in the first place, followed by hydrolysis; this key transformation leverages the electrophilic character of the pianostool ruthenium carbene intermediates passed through. The recorded data showed that the assignment proposed in the literature is incorrect and needs to be reversed; this conclusion was independently confirmed by a combined NMR/DFT approach using a CP3 probability analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Zinc Halogen Aqueous Battery Exploiting [BrCl2]&#8722; Storage in Ketjenblack by Reconstructing Electrolyte Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogen redox couples offer distinct merits due to high redox potential and low cost, but they usually suffer from poor reversibility. Here, we report highly reversible [Br2Cl]&#8211;/Br&#8722; and [BrCl2]&#8211;/Cl&#8211; redox couples via harnessing interhalogen chemistry within nanoporous Ketjenblack (KB) carbon as a host for zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries. The tunable halogen reactions are facilitated by controllable coordinating chemistry of [ZnCl4&#8208;xBrx]2&#8722; in an aqueous deep eutectic solvent electrolyte comprising ZnCl2, ZnBr2, and choline chloride. In an optimized electrolyte, the KB electrode delivers a high discharge capacity of ~535 mAh gKB&#8211;1 or 215 mAh g&#8211;1 when the stored [BrCl2]&#8211; is counted at 100 mA g&#8722;1, with an average discharge voltage of ~1.6 V, and a record high energy density of 788 Wh kgKB&#8211;1 or 311 Wh kg&#8211;1, when considering the mass of [BrCl2]&#8211; as well. Benefiting from the interhalogen coordination chemistry and KB pore host, the pouch cell prototype delivers an areal capacity of ~2.3 mAh cm&#8211;2 at 0.5 mA cm&#8211;2, storing an energy density of ~80 Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the mass of both electrodes. This work offers a new strategy to enhance the reversibility of static aqueous halogen batteries for energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Alkylationof  &#946;&#8208;Ketocarbonyl Compounds with Simple Olefins by Photoredox&#8208;Nickel&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer Triple Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkylation of carbonyl compounds with activated olefins has already been established, extending this methodology to less activated or nonactivated olefins remains a significant challenge due to the polarity mismatch in these ionic processes. An alternative approach involves the activation of the parent carbonyl compounds into electrophilic &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals, which could potentially overcome this limitation. However, the lack of efficient catalytic systems has impeded the wide adoption of this strategy, particularly in realm of the catalytic asymmetric reactions. Here, we present a cooperative triple catalytic system that integrates photoredox, chiral Lewis acid, and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysts to achieve a direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyl compounds using simple olefins as alkylating agents. By combining a multifunctional chiral nickel Lewis acid with an iridium photoredox catalyst and a thiophenol catalyst under visible light, we have developed a highly efficient process that is temporally synchronized to facilitate a novel mechanism of electron and hydrogen transfer. This triple catalytic approach enables the intermolecular coupling of &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyl compounds with both less and non&#8208;activated olefins. This redox&#8208;neutral protocol provides an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic route to enantioselectively synthesize high&#8208;value molecules featuring an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter from feedstock chemicals, while only consuming photons.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of NIR&#8208;II Fluorophores by a C(sp2)&#8210;C(sp2/sp) Coupling Reaction Driven by Charge&#8208;Transfer Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report a C(sp2)&#8210;C(sp2/sp) coupling reaction driven by charge transfer interaction. Due to the strong intermolecular noncovalent interaction, an essential electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex is formed, confirmed solidly by absorption spectra, 1H NMR and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The EDA complex lowers the activation barrier (Ea = 9.17 kcal/mol) and facilitates the formation of the C&#8210;C bond, which is the rate&#8208;limiting step revealed by H/D and 12C/13C KIE studies. Kinetic investigations reveal that the reaction is a second&#8208;order reaction. Furthermore, high&#8208;level theoretical calculations support the proposed mechanism. The mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted products were obtained by varying the reaction conditions. A series of structurally diverse and novel NIR&#8208;II fluorophores based on benzo[1,2&#8208;c:4,5&#8208;c&#8217;]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) (BBTD) were synthesized by utilizing this coupling reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Expediting Glycospace Exploration: Therapeutic Glycans via Automated Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycans regulate a vast spectrum of disease&#8208;related processes, yet effectively leveraging these important mediators in a therapeutic context remains a frontier in contemporary medicine. Unlike many other classes of clinically important biopolymers, carbohydrates derive from discrete biosynthetic pathways and are not produced directly from genes. The conspicuous absence of a biological blueprint to achieve amplification creates a persistent challenge in obtaining well&#8208;defined glycostructures for therapeutic translation. Isolating purified sugars from biological sources is not without challenge, rendering synthetic organic chemistry the nexus of this advancing field. Chemical synthesis has proven to be an unfaltering pillar in the production of complex glycans, but laborious syntheses coupled with purification challenges frequently introduce reproducibility issues. In an effort to reconcile these preparative challenges with the societal importance of glycans, automated glycan synthesis was conceptualised at the start of the 21st century. This rapidly expanding, multifaceted field of scientific endeavor has effectively merged synthetic chemistry with technology and engineering to expedite the precision synthesis of target glycans. This minireview describes the structural diversity and function of glycans generated by automated glycan synthesis platforms over the last five years. The translational impact of these advances is discussed together with current limitations and future directions.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Entangled Hydrogels by Photoiniferter&#8208;Mediated&#160;Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight (UHMW) poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAm) hydrogels with extremely low crosslinking densities by &#160;trithiocarbonate photoiniferter&#8208;mediated reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP). Fixing the photoiniferter to crosslinker ratio and gradually increasing the targeted degree of polymerization (DPtarget) allowed for simultaneous control over the crosslinking density and the average molecular weight (Mn) of the primary chains, both below and above the critical molecular weight of entanglement (Mc). Interestingly, a plateau in storage moduli (G&#8217;) was observed for UHMW PDMAm hydrogels with a sufficiently high DPtarget (&gt; 5,000), indicating a transition to the entanglement&#8208;dominated regime, with no contribution from crosslinks to the overall modulus, thus indicating the formation of highly entangled hydrogels. These hydrogels exhibit enhanced properties such as high toughness and resistance to swelling despite their vanishingly small crosslinking densities. Furthermore, even when equipped with cleavable crosslinkers, the UHMW PDMAm hydrogels resist degradation due to dense entanglements which act as transient crosslinks preventing the gels from swelling, while sparse covalent crosslinks help to maintain their structural integrity and avoid chain disentanglement. This approach allows simple synthesis of elastic and tough hydrogels with a well&#8208;defined structure and tuneable contributions from both crosslinks and entanglements.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Recently we reported the synthesis and characterization of Bi(H3O)[B(SO4)2]4, at that time representing only the second tectosilicate analogous borosulfate. Inspired by this structure type, we herein present the first modular system within borosulfate chemistry. MIIIMI[B(SO4)2]4 (MIII = Bi3+, Sb3+, Lu3+; MI = H3O+, NO2+, Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+) were synthesised under solvothermal conditions and show a large variability towards their mono&#8208; and trivalent cation while retaining the same 3&#8208;dimensional anionic network. Based on their combination, the titled compounds crystallize in the tetragonal space groups I[[EQUATION]] (no. 82), P[[EQUATION]] (no. 81) and the monoclinic space group C2 (no. 5) all connected via group&#8208;subgroup relations. Our initial characterization includes single&#8208;crystal as well as powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopy and thermal analysis of the new compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein we report (3+2) cycloaddition reactions of halogenated donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (HDACs) as surrogates for donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropenes. Upon reaction with a variety of 2&#960;&#8208;components, cycloaddition followed by elimination generates the unsaturated five&#8208;membered ring products. A series of HDACs were shown to be effective in reactions with thioketones. Five further cycloaddition reactions were used to showcase the broad applicability of these donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropene surrogates. Kinetic studies allowed the proposal of a plausible mechanism for this reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>&#963;&#8208;&#960; Hyperconjugation as a Design Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Fluorescent Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing efficient solid&#8208;state fluorescence in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) represents a persistent and fundamental challenge in materials science, hindering their application in next&#8208;generation optoelectronics. Herein, a transformative strategy leveraging &#963;&#8208;&#960; hyperconjugation is introduced to enhance the fluorescence properties of COFs. The incorporation of a methyl group into a pyrene&#8208;based COF monomer yields an unprecedented fluorescence quantum yield increase of more than 100&#8208;fold, accompanied by significantly enhanced optoelectronic performance. This enhancement arises from &#963;&#8208;&#960; hyperconjugation, which redistributes electron density, converting pyrene from an electron donor to an electron acceptor and facilitating efficient electronic transitions. Additionally, a COF&#8208;based fluorescent acoustic sensor, fabricated via electrospinning, demonstrates real&#8208;time speech pattern recognition when integrated with machine learning algorithms, showcasing potential in language&#8208;assistive technologies. This study pioneers the exploration of hyperconjugation in COFs, offering a new paradigm for the precise modulation of optoelectronic properties and bridging fundamental research with real&#8208;world applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Building Localized NADP(H) Recycling Circuits to Advance Enzyme Cascadetronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A consequence of the high catalytic activities and selectivities of many enzymes is that cascades enclosed within a mesoporous conducting material using NADP(H) and intermediates as internal current carriers display the almost instantaneous information&#8208;transfer properties usually associated with electronic circuits. Such collective behavior of enzymes is demonstrated by incorporating a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing pair to compete against the external potential bias.







Abstract
The catalytic action of enzymes in a cascade trapped within a mesoporous electrode material is simultaneously energized, controlled and observed through the efficient, reversible electrochemical NAD(P)(H) recycling catalyzed by one of the enzymes. In their nanoconfined state, nicotinamide cofactors are tightly channeled current carriers, mediating multi&#8208;step reactions in either direction (oxidation or reduction) with a rapid response time. By incorporating a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing enzyme pair, the internal action of which opposes the external voltage bias driving oxidation or reduction, a reduction process can be performed under overall oxidizing conditions, and vice versa. The power of the method to control and resolve complex metabolic pathways is demonstrated using a non&#8208;linear, three&#8208;enzyme cascade extended by incorporating a fourth enzyme, urease. The latter generates in situ ammonia, which is enzymatically consumed in a reductive process, but the immediate current response to each addition of urea is observed, unusually, by applying an oxidizing potential. A practical consequence is that enzyme&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical reduction reactions requiring anaerobic conditions (to avoid O2 interference) can readily be studied under ambient aerobic conditions. The results illustrate how a complex enzyme cascade confined within a porous electrode and connected to an electrical power source manifests characteristics associated with electronic circuits.

         <title>Enantioselective Borylcupration/Cyclization of Alkene&#8208;Tethered Oxime Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric synthesis of boryl&#8208;functionalized 1&#8208;pyrrolines is reported. A range of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters are compatible in the reaction and the borylated products are shown to be used in the synthesis of novel prolinol derivatives through a directed reduction of the cyclic imines. Experimental and computational investigations reveal that the reaction likely proceeds via a stereoretentive cyclization of the benzylic copper intermediates.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of borylated 1&#8208;pyrrolines from &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters is reported. Twenty&#8208;four novel 1&#8208;pyrroline derivatives are reported in yields ranging from 26% to 96% and enantioselectivities from 74.5:25.5 er to 99:1 er. Examples derived from &#945;&#8208;unsubstituted, non&#8208;fluorinated oxime esters are reported. The hydroxyl group following oxidation of the Bpin moiety acts as a directing group in highly diastereoselective reductions of the pyrrolines to the corresponding prolinol derivatives. Additionally, the Bpin group can be retained in the products following a simplified, chromatography&#8208;free workup procedure. DFT supports a reaction mechanism which proceeds through the formation of an (R)&#8208;benzylic copper intermediate, followed by stereoretentive cyclization with respect to the configuration at the metalated carbon. The conclusions of the computational data are corroborated through control experiments and deuterium&#8208;labelling studies.

         <title>Full&#8208;Scale Regulation Enabled High&#8208;Performance Sodium O3&#8208;Type Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>O3&#8208;type cathodes hold considerable promise in achieving rapid commercialization due to high energy density. However, severe structural/interfacial deterioration, along with kinetic hindrance, typically resulting in rapid capacity fading and serious safety risk at elevated cut&#8208;off voltages. Herein, inspired from solubility limitation of hetero&#8208;elements, synchronous surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk multifunctionally full&#8208;scale modified O3&#8208;NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 is proposed to maintain its state of health (SOH). The perovskite&#8208;type CaZrO3 protective layer in&#8208;situ formed on the surface of primary particles, helps to construct a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase architecture, mitigate the unexpected interfacial side reactions and prevent transition metal dissolution. Simultaneously, Ca2+ pillars, robust Zr&#8208;O bonds and the highly electronegative F&#8208; are adequately anchored into ternary lattice sites of Na&#8208;TM&#8208;O, respectively, thereby reinforcing the TMO6 octahedra and facilitating Na+ diffusion. Notably, the intrinsic lattice strain is effectively alleviated due to an additional intergrowth phase transition of P3&#8208;OP2. More impressively, migration of Jahn&#8208;Teller distorted Fe4+O6 is further restrained, originating from the strengthened coordination environment under deep&#8208;desodiation state. Consequently, as&#8208;designed NFM&#8208;CZF achieves an impressive rate capability and a remarkable capacity retention of 83.8% after 300 cycles at 2 C. This elaborate work shed valuable insight into mechanism of regulating internal full Wyckoff&#8208;site and external surface structure for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with enhanced durability.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Resistant Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers have demonstrated significant potential for various applications due to their unique luminescent properties. However, most conventional RTP polymers are vulnerable to moisture and water, which can disrupt the hydrogen bonding network within the polymer and accelerate the non&#8208;radiative decay of triplet excitons of phosphors, leading to the quenching of RTP. Herein, we present a universal strategy to achieve water&#8208;resistant RTP polymers by designing amphiphilic block copolymers with microphase&#8208;separated structures. Specifically, the rigid hydrophilic phase, which is rich in carboxyl groups, forms hydrogen bonds that suppress non&#8208;radiative decay of the chromophores, resulting in RTP. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic phase effectively prevents water molecules from penetrating and disrupting the rigid polymer network. By combining the functions of both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic phases, the resulting RTP copolymers exhibit good water&#8208;resistant properties. Even after being immersed in water for one month, the copolymers maintain a green afterglow with a lifetime of 629 ms. Moreover, the water&#8208;resistant nature of these RTP polymers has also been demonstrated in potential applications of afterglow displays and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This research offers valuable insights into the design of RTP materials with stability in aqueous environments and broadens the scope of their potential applications in diverse settings.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulated &#960;&#8208;Bridge of Thioxothiazolidine Derivatives for Passivating Bilateral Interfaces and Grain Boundaries in n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Additive engineering has emerged as the predominant approach for enhancing the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) dyes with tailored configurations have proven to be a viable and effective strategy. In this study, we present two asymmetrical D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A dyes, designated as TZR and TNR. These dyes are designed and synthesized with identical hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting backbones but feature distinct &#960;&#8208;bridge groups. They are incorporated into the precursor solution of PbI2 to facilitate in&#8208;situ passivation of both interfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) during the formation of the perovskite film. These dyes effectively penetrate both buried and upper interfaces, allowing for the passivation of defects originating from the GBs, and both interfaces. This significantly reduces defects while enhancing charge transport properties. Notably, the &#960;&#8208;bridge composed of benzo[1,2,5]&#8208; thiadiazole in TZR contains unpaired electrons from nitrogen and sulfur atoms. An impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.11% is achieved. This performance significantly surpasses that of TNR&#8208;based and pristine devices, achieving PCEs of 24.47% and 22.88%, respectively. Furthermore, we observed a significant improvement in the stability of the unencapsulated device, attributed to the exceptional hydrophobicity of the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A dyes. This study offers valuable insights into achieving high&#8208;performance PSCs through careful molecular design.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mechanochromic Rotaxane that Releases Azetidine&#8208;Trityl&#8208;Maleimide, a Versatile Fluorescent Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Force sensing at the molecular level has enabled the study of materials failure and it offers great promises for the investigation of mechanobiological processes. Traditional force probes rely on the reversible or irreversible activation of mechanochromic precursors to assess transient or permanent changes in the polymer networks. A promising approach involves force&#8208;controlled release of sensing molecules, as the accumulation of chromic molecules at specific sites would enable the recording of deformation histories. However, many fluorescent probes are limited by environmental sensitivity, specific release conditions, or low release efficiency. Maleimide&#8208;based dyes, especially amino maleimides, offer a robust alternative due to their small size, structural versatility, and tuneable fluorescence properties. Here, we present a mechanochromic rotaxane device that releases an azetidine&#8208;trityl&#8208;maleimide (ATM) fluorescent probe via a retro&#8208;[4+2] cycloaddition reaction. ATM, is a rigidochromic, chemically stable, and environmentally insensitive probe, generated exclusively through rotaxane actuation, underscoring the unique mechanochemical properties of rotaxanes. This device holds potential for applications in material science and biology,&#160;such as&#160;the investigation of polymer networks&#160;and active tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>Lactate&#8208;Modulating Nanozyme&#8208;Mediated Mitochondrial Respiration Block for Tumor Immunosuppression Remodeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abnormal lactate metabolism in tumor cells leads to immune escape in the tumor microenvironment. Intervening in specific lactate metabolic pathways while blocking downstream pyruvate influx holds great promise for overcoming conventional lactate&#8208;targeted therapy limitations such as short half&#8208;life, insufficient lactate consumption, and pathological microenvironment elasticity. Herein, a nanocatalytic medicine based on carbondoping engineered copper nitride enzyme (Cu3N&#8208;C NE) with enhanced lactate oxidase (LOX) activity was carefully designed. Computational results revealed that the introduction of C favors activation of the hydroxyalkyl C&#8722;H bond in lactate by the polarization of adjacent hydroxyl groups, correspondingly facilitating the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from the desired &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H and &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;O&#8722;H groups in lactate via the hydrogen atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) process. The Cu3N&#8208;C NEs could downregulate lactate levels in tumor cells for robust remodeling of the immunosuppressive microenvironment and further block as&#8208;generated pyruvate to influx into the mitochondrial respiration, achieving lactate homeostasis reprogramming. Our study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept design of next&#8208;generation lactate&#8208;modulation nanomedicine via heteroatom&#8208;doping and evolution with the additional potential to expedite the industrial production of lactate to pyruvate.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Fused Cyanoindone: A Superior Building Block for Designing Ultra&#8208;Narrow Bandgap Electron Acceptor with Long&#8208;Range Ordered Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel benzothiadiazole&#8208;fused cyanoindone (BTC) unit with ultra&#8208;strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability was designed to synthesize an ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap acceptor BTC&#8208;2. Benefiting from long&#8208;range ordered stacking induced by BTC, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTC&#8208;2 based organic photovoltaic device delivered a 17.17&#8201;% efficiency with a photocurrent of 30.34&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and achieved a light utilization efficiency of 4.88&#8201;% in binary semi&#8208;transparent application.







Abstract
There are great demands of developing ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap electron acceptors for multifunctional electronic devices, particularly semi&#8208;transparent organic photovoltaics (OPVs) for building&#8208;integrated applications. However, current ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap materials applied in OPVs, primarily based on electron&#8208;rich cores, exhibit defects of high&#8208;lying energy levels and inferior performance. We herein proposed a novel strategy by designing the benzothiazole&#8208;fused cyanoindone (BTC) unit with ultra&#8208;strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability as the terminal to synthesize the acceptor BTC&#8208;2. The BTC unit imparts red&#8208;shifted absorption up to 1000&#8197;nm to BTC&#8208;2, attributed to enhanced intramolecular charge transfer and the quinoid resonance effect. Additionally, BTC&#8208;2 features deep&#8208;lying energy levels with the highest occupied molecular orbital level of &#8722;5.81&#8197;eV, due to the ultra&#8208;strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of BTC. Furthermore, BTC&#8208;2 exhibits long&#8208;range ordering in both molecular packing and macroscopic blend morphology, resulting from shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder packing of two BTC units, leading to an ultra&#8208;long exciton lifetime over 1.1&#8197;ns. These superiorities facilitated a 17.17&#8201;% efficiency in the binary OPV device with an extremely high photocurrent of 30.34&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, representing the best performance for ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap electron acceptors, and a record light utilization efficiency of 4.88&#8201;% in binary semi&#8208;transparent systems. Overall, BTC is a superior building block for designing ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap electron acceptors.

&lt;p&gt;A novel benzothiadiazole-fused cyanoindone (BTC) unit with ultra-strong electron-withdrawing ability was designed to synthesize an ultra-narrow bandgap acceptor BTC-2. Benefiting from long-range ordered stacking induced by BTC, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTC-2 based organic photovoltaic device delivered a 17.17&#8201;% efficiency with a photocurrent of 30.34&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and achieved a light utilization efficiency of 4.88&#8201;% in binary semi-transparent application.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are great demands of developing ultra-narrow bandgap electron acceptors for multifunctional electronic devices, particularly semi-transparent organic photovoltaics (OPVs) for building-integrated applications. However, current ultra-narrow bandgap materials applied in OPVs, primarily based on electron-rich cores, exhibit defects of high-lying energy levels and inferior performance. We herein proposed a novel strategy by designing the benzothiazole-fused cyanoindone (BTC) unit with ultra-strong electron-withdrawing ability as the terminal to synthesize the acceptor BTC-2. The BTC unit imparts red-shifted absorption up to 1000&#8197;nm to BTC-2, attributed to enhanced intramolecular charge transfer and the quinoid resonance effect. Additionally, BTC-2 features deep-lying energy levels with the highest occupied molecular orbital level of &#8722;5.81&#8197;eV, due to the ultra-strong electron-withdrawing ability of BTC. Furthermore, BTC-2 exhibits long-range ordering in both molecular packing and macroscopic blend morphology, resulting from shoulder-to-shoulder packing of two BTC units, leading to an ultra-long exciton lifetime over 1.1&#8197;ns. These superiorities facilitated a 17.17&#8201;% efficiency in the binary OPV device with an extremely high photocurrent of 30.34&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, representing the best performance for ultra-narrow bandgap electron acceptors, and a record light utilization efficiency of 4.88&#8201;% in binary semi-transparent systems.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction of Silacyclobutanes with Alkenes: Mimicking the Reactivity and Reversing the Selectivity Towards Late Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the first example of Ti&#8208;catalyzed reactions of SCBs with alkenes. Selective activation of the C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond was achieved in the case of benzosilacyclobutenes, a selectivity that has rarely been achieved using other metals. Even for silacyclobutanes with C(sp3)&#8722;Si bonds only, our system also shows complementary selectivity to give distinct products. Structurally varied SCBs and alkenes were reacted in our system to afford diverse silicon&#8208;containing products that are otherwise difficult to obtain.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed ring opening and expansion reactions of silacyclobutanes (SCBs) constitute an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical strategy to construct value&#8208;added silicon&#8208;containing chemicals. Despite extensive studies, the reaction of SCBs with simple alkenes has only one precedent. Moreover, most reported reactions of SCBs use late transition metals (Pd, Ni, Rh) as catalysts. By contrast, there are no reports of using early transition metals. Herein, we report the first example, to our knowledge, of early&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions of SCBs using earth's second abundant titanium as a catalyst. Notably, orthogonal selectivity was observed. Selective activation of the relatively inert C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond was achieved in the case of benzosilacyclobutenes, a selectivity that has rarely been achieved using other metals. Even for silacyclobutanes with C(sp3)&#8722;Si bonds only, our titanium system also shows complementary selectivity towards late transition metals to give distinct products. Thus, structurally varied SCBs and alkenes were reacted in our system to afford structurally diverse silicon&#8208;containing products that are otherwise difficult to obtain using other transition metals.

         <title>A Helical Tubular Dyad of [9]Cycloparaphenylene: Synthesis, Chiroptical Properties and Post&#8208;Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing the site&#8208;specific functionalization strategy, a radially conjugated, helical tubular molecule has been constructed by covalently connecting [9]cycloparaphenylenes with three sp&#8208;hybridized all&#8208;carbon linkers. This compound exhibits intriguing solid&#8208;state packing patterns, exceptional CPL characteristics, and facile post&#8208;functionalization.







Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of discrete tubular molecules that mimic the structural features of carbon nanotubes has been a long&#8208;standing pursuit for synthetic chemists. As the shortest segments of armchair&#8208;type carbon nanotubes, cycloparaphenylenes are regarded as ideal macrocyclic building blocks for achieving this goal. Here we report the synthesis of a helical tubular molecule featuring three diyne linkers between two site&#8208;specifically functionalized [9]cycloparaphenylenes. Its C3&#8208;symmetrical, radially conjugated structure and solid&#8208;state packing have been elucidated by spectroscopic and crystallographic characterizations. Notably, the resolved enantiomers display a circularly polarized luminescence brightness value of 1.47&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is among the highest values for chiral organic molecules. Furthermore, the diyne&#8208;linked molecule could be directly converted into a thiophene&#8208;linked helical molecule, demonstrating the post&#8208;functionalization approach for the construction of chiral tubular molecules from cycloparaphenylenes.

         <title>Heptannulated Perylene Diimides: Formation and Reactivity of Electron&#8208;Deficient Tropylium Cations and Heptafulvenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein are three ring fusion patterns from one chemical reaction. Carbocyclic heptannulation provides access to brightly fluorescent, chiral perylene diimides, which can be converted into highly electrophilic tropylium cations and functionalized by direct aromatic substitution reactions.







Abstract
The development of new &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs opens pathways to previously unexplored classes of organic semiconductors and functional dyes. In this study, five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered carbocycles were fused at the ortho and bay regions of electron&#8208;deficient perylenes, starting from a common dialdehyde precursor. Structural analysis of the resulting perylene tetraesters, dianhydrides, and diimides (PDIs) revealed three distinct ring&#8208;fusion patterns and defined stereochemistry. The fused PDI cycloheptatrienes demonstrated susceptibility to acid&#8208;catalyzed transarylation, involving tropylium cation intermediates, which can be used preparatively. Under superacidic conditions, the PDI tropylium cations were directly observed and shown to undergo hydride&#8208;transfer reductions. Additionally, a fused PDI bis(heptafulvene) was synthesized by dehydrogenating a suitably substituted PDI cycloheptatriene. The final system contains two quinomethane units, which can be protonated to yield a stable tropylium&#8208;like dication.

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linking of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons to &#960;&#8208;Extended Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalyst for H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystallinity were constructed using dimethyldiazapyrene as a newly developed monomer upon Knoevenagel condensation. Their &#960;&#8208;extended structures from vinylene linking of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons building blocks, rendered them with promising semiconducting properties, allowing for conducting exceptional visible&#8208;light photocatalytic generation of H2O2.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) hold the predominant role either as individual molecules or building blocks in the field of organic semiconductors or nanocarbons. Connecting PAHs via sp2&#8208;carbon bridges to form high&#8208;crystalline &#960;&#8208;extended structures is highly desired not only for enlarging the regimes of two&#8208;dimensional materials but also for achieving exceptional properties/functions. In this work, we developed 5,10&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,9&#8208;diazapyrene as a key monomer, whose two methyl groups at the positions adjacent to nitrogen atoms, can helpfully increase the solubility, and serve as the active connection sites. In the presence of organic acids, this monomer enables smoothly conducting Knoevenagel condensation to form two vinylene&#8208;linked PAH&#8208;cored COFs, which show high&#8208;crystalline honeycomb structures with large surface areas up to 1238&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. Owing to the direct connection mode of PAH building blocks with vinylene, the as&#8208;prepared COFs possess spatially extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and substantial semiconducting properties. Consequently, their visible&#8208;light photocatalysis with exceptional activity and durability was manifested to generate H2O2 up to 3820&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure water, and even 17080&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 using benzyl alcohol as a hole sacrificial agent.

&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high crystallinity were constructed using dimethyldiazapyrene as a newly developed monomer upon Knoevenagel condensation. Their &#960;-extended structures from vinylene linking of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons building blocks, rendered them with promising semiconducting properties, allowing for conducting exceptional visible-light photocatalytic generation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) hold the predominant role either as individual molecules or building blocks in the field of organic semiconductors or nanocarbons. Connecting PAHs via sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-carbon bridges to form high-crystalline &#960;-extended structures is highly desired not only for enlarging the regimes of two-dimensional materials but also for achieving exceptional properties/functions. In this work, we developed 5,10-dimethyl-4,9-diazapyrene as a key monomer, whose two methyl groups at the positions adjacent to nitrogen atoms, can helpfully increase the solubility, and serve as the active connection sites. In the presence of organic acids, this monomer enables smoothly conducting Knoevenagel condensation to form two vinylene-linked PAH-cored COFs, which show high-crystalline honeycomb structures with large surface areas up to 1238&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Owing to the direct connection mode of PAH building blocks with vinylene, the as-prepared COFs possess spatially extended &#960;-conjugation and substantial semiconducting properties. Consequently, their visible-light photocatalysis with exceptional activity and durability was manifested to generate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; up to 3820&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in pure water, and even 17080&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; using benzyl alcohol as a hole sacrificial agent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells by Introducing a Multifunctional Surface Modulator</title>

For the first time, we report an effective &#8220; three birds with one stone &#8221; strategy by utilizing sodium 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylenebis(oxy))bis(butane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate) (ZR3) containing sulfonic acid groups (SO3&#8722;) and Na+ ions as a multifunctional surface treatment modulator to address the iodide and Pb&#8208;related defects, and Li+ ions migration suppression simultaneously. Consequently, highly efficient and stable PSCs are achieved.







Abstract
Simultaneously passivating the perovskite surface defects and suppressing Li+ ions diffusion of hole transport layer (HTL) are still challenging issues. Herein, we report an effective &#8220; three birds with one stone &#8221; strategy by utilizing sodium 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylenebis(oxy))bis(butane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate) (ZR3) containing sulfonic acid groups (SO3&#8722;) and Na+ ions as a multifunctional surface treatment modulator to simultaneously address the above issues. It is found that ZR3 is not only capable of passivating the Pb&#8208;related defects at the surface of perovskite by the SO3&#8722; group, but also possesses the remarkable ability to passivate the halide defects with Na+ ions. Meanwhile, ZR3 treatment enables the enhanced exciton dissociation of perovskite, better energy level alignment with hole transport layer (HTL), improved hole extraction/transfer from perovskite layer into HTL, and reduced charge carrier recombination in device. Therefore, it results in the enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.34&#8201;% in ZR3&#8208;based n&#8208;i&#8208;p device from 22.97&#8201;% for the control device. Specifically, p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with ZR3 also achieves an improved PCE of 25.96&#8201;% with respect to the pristine one (23.99&#8201;%), proving the universality of ZR3 for PSCs. Moreover, the stabilities of ZR3&#8208;treated devices are significantly enhanced owing to Li+ ions migration suppressing and perovskite defects reduction.

         <title>A photosynthesis&#8208;derived bionic system for sustainable biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural photosynthesis process, a light&#8208;driven bionic system composed of three modules including photo&#8208;induced electron module, electron transfer channel module and proton gradient module was proposed for supply of NADPH and ATP in cell factory. The proposed new strategy enables facilitating both CO2 fixation and biomanufacturing and opens the possibility of manufacturing industry revolution driven by sustainable solar energy.







Abstract
&#8220;Cell factory&#8221; strategy based on microbial anabolism pathways offers an intriguing alternative to relieve the dependence on fossil fuels, which are recognized as the main sources of CO2 emission. Typically, anabolism of intracellular substance in cell factory requires the consumption of sufficient reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide /nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAD(P)H and adenosine triphosphate ATP. However, it is of great challenge to modify the natural limited anabolism and to increase the insufficient level of NAD(P)H and ATP to optimum concentrations without causing metabolic disorder. Inspired by the natural photosynthesis process in which NAD(P)H and ATP can both be produced through the coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer processes driven by sunlight, herein we designed a light&#8208;driven bionic system composed of three modules including photo&#8208;induced electron module, electron transfer channel module and proton gradient module. The proposed strategy of light&#8208;driven bionic system enables for achieving simultaneous and controllable supplies of NAD(P)H and ATP, thus facilitating both highly efficient CO2 fixation and biomanufacturing. The proposed light&#8208;driven bionic system design strategy in this work might pave new sustainable ways for reducing power and energy regeneration to optimize microbial metabolism, offering intriguing alternatives for CO2 emission mitigation and high&#8208;value chemical biomanufacturing.

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Chemically Recyclable Polyethylene&#8208;Like Multiblock Polymers by Modulating the Branch Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platform for recyclable multiblock polymers has been explored, facilitating the production of various polyethylene&#8208;like multiblock polymers with adjustable side chain mobility. This approach allows for tuning of thermal and mechanical properties while preserving high melting temperatures and consistent morphology. Additionally, this method advances the research of recyclable adhesive materials and selective recycling processes.







Abstract
Developing plastics that fill the need of polyolefins yet are more easily recyclable is a critical need to address the plastic waste crisis. However, most efforts in this vein have focused on high&#8208;density polyethylene (PE), while many different types of PE exist. To create broadly sustainable PE with modular properties, we present the synthesis, characterization, and demonstration of materials applications for chemically recyclable PE&#8208;like multiblock polymers prepared from distinct hard and soft blocks using ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative polymerization. By altering the branching pattern within the soft blocks, a series of PE&#8208;like multiblock polymers were synthesized with tunable glass transition temperatures (Tg) while maintaining consistent high melting temperatures (Tm). A clear U&#8208;shape trend between Tg and mechanical properties was found, showcasing their potential as sustainable materials with tailored properties spanning commercial linear low&#8208;density polyethylene (LLDPE) and low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE). These materials offer adjustable adhesive strength to metal and demonstrate chemical recyclability and selective depolymerization in mixed plastic streams, promoting circularity and separation.

         <title>Organoboron&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Nanosheets for Highly Efficient CO2 Fixation Mediated by Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>

An organoboron functionalized ultra&#8208;thin metal&#8208;organic nanosheet, termed TCPB&#8208;Zr&#8208;NS, featuring highly exposed Lewis acidic B and formate sites, and efficient substrates/products diffusion ability, which presents dramatically improved CO2 conversion to bioactive benzimidazoles via formate&#8208;assisted FLP&#8208;mediated catalysis pathway than the parent TCPB&#8208;Zr&#8208;3D counterpart.







Abstract
Converting CO2 to high&#8208;value fine chemicals represents one of the most promising approaches to combat global warming and subsequently achieve a sustainable carbon cycle. Herein, we contribute an organoboron functionalized ultra&#8208;thin metal&#8208;organic nanosheet (MON), termed TCPB&#8208;Zr&#8208;NS, featuring an abundance of exposed Lewis acidic B and formate sites, which can effectively promote CO2 conversion upon the addition of Lewis basic o&#8208;phenylenediamines. Compared with the prototypical 3D analogue TCPB&#8208;Zr&#8208;3D, the resultant TCPB&#8208;Zr&#8208;NS showcases dramatically improved catalytic activity for the cyclization of o&#8208;phenylenediamine as a result of the highly exposed active sites and efficient substrates/products diffusion. Strikingly, the incorporation of Lewis acidic B sites into ultra&#8208;thin Zr&#8208;based MON (Zr&#8208;MON) not only promotes the highly efficient CO2 conversion, but also enhances the recyclability/durability of catalysts. Additionally, the underlying catalytic mechanism has been well established by the comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations, unveiling a formate&#8208;assisted frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) mediated catalytic pathway. This work opens up a new avenue to heterogeneous FLP&#8208;based catalysts for small molecule activation and beyond.

Herein, we contribute an organoboron functionalized ultra-thin metal-organic nanosheet (MON), termed TCPB-Zr-NS, featuring an abundance of exposed Lewis acidic B and formate sites, which can effectively promote CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion upon the addition of Lewis basic o-phenylenediamines. Compared with the prototypical 3D analogue TCPB-Zr-3D, the resultant TCPB-Zr-NS showcases dramatically improved catalytic activity for the cyclization of o-phenylenediamine as a result of the highly exposed active sites and efficient substrates/products diffusion. Strikingly, the incorporation of Lewis acidic B sites into ultra-thin Zr-based MON (Zr-MON) not only promotes the highly efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion, but also enhances the recyclability/durability of catalysts. Additionally, the underlying catalytic mechanism has been well established by the comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations, unveiling a formate-assisted frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) mediated catalytic pathway. This work opens up a new avenue to heterogeneous FLP-based catalysts for small molecule activation and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tandem&#8208;Controlled Dynamic DNA Assembly Enables Temporally&#8208;Selective Orthogonal Regulation of cGAS&#8211;STING Stimulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An endogenous and exogenous tandem&#8208;regulated DNA assembly strategy is designed to achieve on&#8208;demand orthogonally controlled stimulation of cGAS&#8211;STING signaling. The approach utilizes an engineered DNA motif with an enzymatically responsive moiety and a photocleavable linker into DNA motif, enabling enzyme&#8208;mediated activation and light&#8208;triggered termination of cGAS stimulation through dynamic DNA assembly.







Abstract
Despite advances in the controlled reconfiguration of DNA structures for biological applications, the dearth of strategies that allow for orthogonal regulation of immune pathways remains a challenge. Here, we report for the first time an endogenous and exogenous tandem&#8208;regulated DNA assembly strategy that enables orthogonally controlled stimulation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. A DNA motif containing two palindromic sequences is engineered with an abasic site (AP)&#8208;connected blocking sequence to inhibit its self&#8208;assembly function, while apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1)&#8208;triggered enzymatic cleavage of the AP site enables the reconfiguration and self&#8208;assembly of DNA motif into long double&#8208;stranded structures, thus realizing allosteric activation of the catalytic activity of cGAS to produce 2&#8217;3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic&#8208;GMP&#8208;AMP for STING stimulation. Importantly, we demonstrate that APE1&#8208;regulated DNA assembly allows for cell&#8208;selective activation of cGAS&#8211;STING signaling. Furthermore, by re&#8208;engineering the DNA motif with a photocleavable group, enzyme&#8208;triggered DNA assembly allows the cGAS&#8211;STING stimulation to operate (switched &#8220;ON&#8221;), whereas light&#8208;mediated fragmentation of the double&#8208;stranded DNA enables termination of such stimulation (switched &#8220;OFF&#8221;), thereby achieving orthogonal control over immune regulation. This work highlights an endogenous and exogenous tandem regulated strategy to modulate the cGAS&#8211;STING pathway in an orthogonally controlled manner.

         <title>Ethane Triggered Gate&#8208;Opening in a Flexible&#8208;Robust Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Ultra&#8208;High Purity Ethylene Purification</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a flexible&#8208;robust MOF Zn(ad)(min) that features a unique localized flexible gate to priority adsorb the cross&#8208;section well&#8208;matched ethane molecules, thus achieving the unprecedented ethane adsorption capacity (62.6&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1), ethane/ethylene uptake ratio 3.34 (298&#8197;K and 0.1&#8197;bar), and the remarkable ultra&#8208;high purity ethylene (&gt;99.995&#8201;%) productivity up to 39.2&#8197;L/kg at ambient condition.







Abstract
Priority recognition separation of inert and larger ethane molecules from high&#8208;concentration ethylene mixtures instead of the traditional thermodynamic or size sieving strategy is a fundamental challenge. Herein, we report ethane triggered gate&#8208;opening in the flexible&#8208;robust metal&#8208;organic framework Zn(ad)(min), the 3&#8208;methylisonicotinic acid ligand can spin as a flexible gate when adsorbing the cross&#8208;section well&#8208;matched ethane molecule, achieving an unprecedented ethane adsorption capacity (62.6&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1) and ethane/ethylene uptake ratio (3.34) under low&#8208;pressure region (0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K). The ethane&#8208;induced structural transition behavior has been uncovered by a collaboration of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, in situ variable pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction and theoretical calculations, elucidating the synergetic mechanism of cross&#8208;section matching and multiple supramolecular interactions within the tailor&#8208;made pore channels. Dynamic breakthrough experiments have revealed the outstanding separation performance of Zn(ad)(min) during the production of ultra&#8208;high purity ethylene (&gt;99.995&#8201;%) with a productivity of up to 39.2&#8197;L/kg under ambient conditions.

         <title>The Spin&#8208;Selective Channels in Fully&#8208;Exposed PtFe Clusters Enable Fast Cathodic Kinetics of Li&#8208;O2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin&#8208;dependent transition between triplet O2 and singlet Li2O2 is studied on a fully&#8208;exposed PtFe cluster catalyst. The fast spin&#8208;conserved electron transfer enabled by the directional e&#8208;spins at Fe&#8722;Fe sites, markedly accelerates the kinetics of O2/Li2O2 redox reaction. This work provides new insights into enhancing the cathodic kinetics of Li&#8208;O2 battery through spintronic electrocatalysis and constructing spin catalysts at atomic level.







Abstract
In Li&#8208;O2 batteries (LOBs), the electron transfer between triplet O2 and singlet Li2O2 possesses a spin&#8208;dependent character but is still neglected, while the spin&#8208;conserved electron transfer without losing phase information should guarantee fast kinetics and reduced energy barriers. Here, we provide a paradigm of spin&#8208;selective catalysis for LOB that the ferromagnetic quantum spin exchange interactions between Pt and Fe atoms in fully&#8208;exposed PtFe clusters filter directional e&#8208;spins for spin&#8208;conserved electron transfer at Fe&#8722;Fe sites. The kinetics of O2/Li2O2 redox reaction is markedly accelerated as predicted by theoretical calculations, showing dramatically decreased relaxation time of the rate determining step for more than one order of magnitude, compared with the Fe clusters without spin&#8208;selective behavior. In consequence, the assembled LOB provides ultrahigh energy conversion efficiency of 89.6&#8201;% at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 under a discharge&#8208;charge overpotential of only 0.32&#8197;V. This work provides new insights into the spin&#8208;dependent mechanisms of O2/Li2O2 redox reaction, and the strategy of constructing spin catalysts at atomic level.

         <title>Tillandsia&#8208;Inspired Asymmetric Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Unidirectional Low&#8208;Friction Water Collection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Tillandsia leaves, an unidirectional hydrophobic membrane characterized by a hydrophilic rough surface and nm&#8208;sized hydrophobic internal pore channels is successfully synthesized. The low&#8208;frictional resistance within the synthesized asymmetric COF membrane&#8242;s pore channels is quantified using low&#8208;field NMR. Ultimately, the resulting COF membranes efficiently capture fog from the air while simultaneously filtering small molecular pollutants.







Abstract
Friction plays a pivotal role in many phenomena of physical chemistry and has long been in the focus of research thereof. As a crucial parameter, friction in membranes&#8217; inner and/or outer surface can be minimized to reduce solvent inlet resistance and enlarge inner pore fluid flux, ideally reaching near frictionless transport of water at nanoscale. Inspired by the leaf structure of Tillandsia, a porous membrane with a rough surface and a hydrophilic inlet together with hydrophobic pore channels was designed and fabricated, based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Combined with COFs&#8217; inherent highly oriented pore structures, the as&#8208;made asymmetric membranes through chemical etching can minimize the solvent critical intrusion pressure and enable inner pore low friction water transport. Ultimately, obtained COF membranes succeeded in trapping fog from air and achieved a water harvesting rate (WHR) of 1570&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, together with small molecular pollutants filtrated off in the meantime. Intriguingly, the synthesized asymmetric COF membranes illustrated unidirectional low friction water collecting and transporting features, the successful imitation of T. macdougallii. This work presents a practical strategy to construct functional porous membranes for low friction water collection and transport, and created a model paradigm to design fluid transporting pore channels.

Combined with COFs&#8217; inherent highly oriented pore structures, the as-made asymmetric membranes through chemical etching can minimize the solvent critical intrusion pressure and enable inner pore low friction water transport. Ultimately, obtained COF membranes succeeded in trapping fog from air and achieved a water harvesting rate (WHR) of 1570&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, together with small molecular pollutants filtrated off in the meantime. Intriguingly, the synthesized asymmetric COF membranes illustrated unidirectional low friction water collecting and transporting features, the successful imitation of &lt;i&gt;T. macdougallii&lt;/i&gt;. This work presents a practical strategy to construct functional porous membranes for low friction water collection and transport, and created a model paradigm to design fluid transporting pore channels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Open Pyrene Sites Isolated by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Helical Chains for Efficient Separation of Xenon and Krypton</title>

The first microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) incorporating hydrogen&#8208;bonded helical chains, which are functionalized by open pyrene sites, thereby exhibits exceptional Xe/Kr separation performance surpassing all previously reported HOF materials under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Achieving efficient xenon/krypton (Xe/Kr) separation in emerging hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is highly challenging because of the lack of gas&#8208;binding sites on their pore surfaces. Herein, we report the first microporous HOF (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168) based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded helical chains, which prevent self&#8208;aggregation of the pyrene core, thereby preserving open pyrene sites on the pore surfaces. Its activated form, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168a is capable of separating Xe/Kr under ambient conditions while achieving an excellent balance between adsorption capacity and selectivity. At 296&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, the Xe adsorption capacity of HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168a reached 78.31&#8197;cm3/g, with an Xe/Kr IAST selectivity of 22.0; both values surpass those of currently known top&#8208;performing HOFs. Breakthrough experiments confirmed its superior separation performance with a separation factor of 8.6 and a yield of high&#8208;purity Kr (&gt;99.5&#8201;%) of 184&#8197;mL/g. Furthermore HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;168 exhibits excellent thermal and chemical stability, as well as renewability. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular modeling revealed that the unique electrostatic surface potential around the open pyrene sites creates a micro&#8208;electric field, exerting a stronger polarizing effect on Xe than on Kr, thereby enhancing host&#8208;Xe interactions.

         <title>Topotactic Transformation in Fe3O4 Induces Spontaneous Growth of Compositionally Diverse Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under ambient conditions, the surface of magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) inevitably transforms into maghemite (&#947;&#8208;Fe2O3). Instead of allowing an oxidation reaction, we use these topotactically transforming Fe3O4 NPs as reducing agents. Merely mixing the Fe3O4 solution with various oxidative metal salts spontaneously generates a variety of compositionally diverse nanostructures under mild conditions.







Abstract
Topotactic transformation is an emerging strategy for synthesizing materials with exotic functional properties. In this report, instead of producing new crystals with related structures, we exploited the topotactic transformation phenomenon to spontaneously produce compositionally diverse nanostructures on the transforming substrate. The surface of magnetite nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) is topotactically transformed into maghemite (&#947;&#8208;Fe2O3). Benefiting from such oxidation susceptibility of ultrasmall Fe3O4 NPs, we achieved spontaneous growth of metals (Ag, Au, Pt, and Pd), a non&#8208;metal (Se), and a metal oxide (MnO2) based nanostructures onto the surface of Fe3O4. No spontaneous growth of nanostructures was observed when the oxidized Fe3O4 NPs were tested, likely due to the loss of the Fe2+&#8208;associated mobile electrons. The obtained nanostructures displayed appreciable antioxidant activities, which we utilized to effectively treat inflammation in the intestines. It is anticipated that this synthetic route, based on topotactic transformation, represents a significant advancement in synthesizing various chemically diverse hetero&#8208;nanostructures.

         <title>Suppressing Exciton&#8211;Vibration Coupling via Intramolecular Noncovalent Interactions for Low&#8208;Energy&#8208;Loss Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minimizing energy loss is crucial for overcoming the efficiency bottleneck of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, tuning intramolecular noncovalent interactions is utilized to enhance molecular rigidity, suppress structural relaxation, and weakens exciton&#8211;vibration coupling strength. Therefore, the OSC devices based on Y&#8208;SeSe, featuring dual strong intramolecular Se&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O noncovalent interactions, achieve outstanding photovoltaic performance and extremely small &#916;Enr.







Abstract
Minimizing energy loss is crucial for breaking through the efficiency bottleneck of organic solar cells (OSCs). The main mechanism of energy loss can be attributed to non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss (&#916;Enr) that occurs due to exciton&#8211;vibration coupling. To tackle this challenge, tuning intramolecular noncovalent interactions is strategically utilized to tailor novel fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Upon comprehensive analysis of both theoretical and experimental results, this approach can effectively enhance molecular rigidity, suppress structural relaxation, reduce exciton reorganization energy, and weakens exciton&#8211;vibration coupling strength. Consequently, the binary OSC device based on Y&#8208;SeSe, which features dual strong intramolecular Se&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O noncovalent interactions, achieves an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.49&#8201;%, accompanied by an extremely small &#916;Enr of 0.184&#8197;eV, much lower than those of Y&#8208;SS and Y&#8208;SSe based devices with weaker intramolecular noncovalent interactions. These achievements not only set an efficiency record for selenium&#8208;containing OSCs, but also mark the lowest reported &#916;Enr value among high&#8208;performance binary devices. Furthermore, the ternary blend device showcases a remarkable PCE of 20.51&#8201;%, one of the highest PCEs for single&#8208;junction OSCs. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of intramolecular noncovalent interactions in suppressing exciton&#8211;vibration coupling, thereby achieving low&#8208;energy&#8208;loss and high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.

         <title>Towards Highly Stable Sn2+ Electrolyte for Aqueous Tin Batteries Using Hydroquinone Antioxidant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adding antioxidant (hydroquinone) additives to acidic Sn2+ electrolyte, Sn2+ oxidation was suppressed due to the fact that hydroquinone is able to react with dissolved oxygen. Meanwhile, hydroquinone molecules tend to adsorb on electrode surface, resulted in refined deposition Sn particles and inhibition on dendrite growth. Finally, high Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% for Sn electrode can be obtained. This work can provide guidance for high stable Sn2+ electrolyte with high reversibility.







Abstract
Sn redox chemistry in aqueous acidic electrolyte was characterized with high reversibility and kinetics, which is considered as competitive anode material for aqueous batteries. Unfortunately, divalent Sn2+ is unstable in aqueous electrolyte. It was revealed that Sn2+ is easy to be oxidized to tetravalent Sn4+ by dissolved oxygen and then forms precipitate through hydrolysis process, leading to serious performance decay. Here, hydroquinone (HQ) was employed as antioxidant to prevent Sn2+ oxidation. With addition of HQ, Sn2+ electrolyte can maintain transparent and colorless after long&#8208;time exposure under air atmosphere, while large amounts of sediment were observed in the electrolyte without HQ. Moreover, HQ can adsorb on electrode surface to regulate Sn deposition and suppress Sn dendrite formation. With the difunctional HQ additive, Sn anode shows a stable cycling performance more than 1500 cycles with a high average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.9&#8201;%. And the organic||Sn cell shows high cycling stability for 10,000 cycles with 71&#8201;% capacity retention. The hydroquinone antioxidant strategy provides a facile and cost&#8208;effective way to develop highly stable Sn2+&#8208;based electrolyte.

It was revealed that Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is easy to be oxidized to tetravalent Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; by dissolved oxygen and then forms precipitate through hydrolysis process, leading to serious performance decay. Here, hydroquinone (HQ) was employed as antioxidant to prevent Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation. With addition of HQ, Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; electrolyte can maintain transparent and colorless after long-time exposure under air atmosphere, while large amounts of sediment were observed in the electrolyte without HQ. Moreover, HQ can adsorb on electrode surface to regulate Sn deposition and suppress Sn dendrite formation. With the difunctional HQ additive, Sn anode shows a stable cycling performance more than 1500 cycles with a high average coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.9&#8201;%. And the organic||Sn cell shows high cycling stability for 10,000 cycles with 71&#8201;% capacity retention. The hydroquinone antioxidant strategy provides a facile and cost-effective way to develop highly stable Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-based electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sugar Auxiliary Group Assisted Diversity&#8208;Oriented Enzymatic Modular Synthesis of 0&#8208;Series Ganglioside Glycans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sugar auxiliary group assisted chain&#8208;elongation strategy was developed to overcome the limitation of bacterial &#946;1&#8211;4&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosaminyltransferase CjCgtA for the enzymatic synthesis of extended 0&#8208;series ganglioside core structures. These core structures were then applied in the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of the hard&#8208;to&#8208;obtain 0&#8208;series of ganglioside glycans by sequential glycosylation with a total of 8 enzyme modules.







Abstract
Owing to the inaccessibility of &#946;1&#8211;4&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosaminyltransferase for direct glycan chain elongation, the enzymatic synthesis of 0&#8208;series gangliosides with extended backbones has not been explored. In this study, sialic acid was enzymatically introduced as an auxiliary group to overcome the limitation of substrate specificity of Campylobacter jejuni &#946;1&#8211;4&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (CjCgtA) to achieve the synthesis of desired extended 0&#8208;series ganglioside core structures, and the sialic acid auxiliary group could be removed by sialidase at appropriate stages. A bacterial &#945;2&#8211;6&#8208;sialyltransferase from Photobacterium damselae (Pd2,6ST) exhibited unexpected acceptor substrate specificity for 0&#8208;series ganglioside core structures, providing ready access to complex gangliosides bearing the sialyl N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine unit. The 0&#8208;series ganglioside core structures as the key acceptor substrates were further diversified by sequential enzymatic modular assembly to generate a collection of 31&#8197;complex 0&#8208;series ganglioside glycans after removal of the sugar auxiliary group of sialic acid at the appropriate stage.

         <title>Heterochiral Self&#8208;Discrimination Driven Dimerization of Polynuclear Gold(I)&#8208;Sulfido Complexes with Enhanced Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An achiral heterodimer icosanuclear meso&#8208;cluster (mesoSDP&#8208;Au20) has been obtained by simply mixing decanuclear chiral gold(I) sulfido clusters (SSDP&#8208;Au10 and RSDP&#8208;Au10) in a 1:1 ratio. The dimerization process with heterochiral self&#8208;discrimination has been found to be sensitive to the solvent polarity and configuration of the diphosphine ligand.







Abstract
Decanuclear chiral gold(I) sulfido clusters (SSDP&#8208;Au10 and RSDP&#8208;Au10) have been assembled by taking advantage of the judiciously selected SDP ligands (SDP = 7,7&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;spirobiindane). Interestingly, an achiral heterodimer icosanuclear meso&#8208;cluster (mesoSDP&#8208;Au20) has been obtained by simply mixing SSDP&#8208;Au10 and RSDP&#8208;Au10 in a 1:1 ratio. These gold(I) complexes have been found to display intense near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence with an emission maximum at around 750&#8197;nm in the solid state. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of mesoSDP&#8208;Au20 in drop&#8208;cast solid&#8208;state thin film has been found to show a significant enhancement from 8&#8201;% in the SSDP&#8208;Au10 and RSDP&#8208;Au10 to 25&#8201;%. In addition, the dimerization process with heterochiral self&#8208;discrimination has been found to be sensitive to the solvent polarity and configuration of the diphosphine ligand. This work has provided a platform for the investigation and mechanistic understanding of heterochiral self&#8208;sorting and assembly processes.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Guanylation Reaction for Removing MACl Residual and In&#8208;Situ Forming 2D Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl carbamimidothioate hydroiodide (MCH) was added into perovskite precursor to solve the issues of methylammonium chloride (MACl) residual and in situ form two&#8208;dimensional perovskite by guanylation reaction between MCH and MACl, thus yielding high quality three&#8208;dimensional perovskite. The MCH&#8208;treated inverted perovskite solar cells realized a 26.81&#8201;%&#8208;efficiency (certified 26.02&#8201;%) with excellent device stability.







Abstract
The thermodynamical deprotonation of methylammonium chloride (MACl) has several detrimental influences on the quality of formamidinium (FA+)&#8208;based perovskite, which limits both efficiency and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). Herein, a new additive strategy was developed by introducing methyl carbamimidothioate hydroiodide (MCH) into perovskite precursor, where guanylation reaction occurred between MCH and MACl to form a new intermediate of methyl&#8208;substituted guanidine (MSG). MSG could then bond with undercoordinated Pb2+ to in situ form a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite, which would promote the growth and crystallization of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite with higher crystallinity, lower defect&#8208;states density and superior stability. Finally, the MCH&#8208;treated IPSC with a small area (0.09&#8197;cm2) achieved an impressive power conversation efficiency (PCE) of 26.81&#8201;% (certified as 26.02&#8201;%), which is one of the highest PCEs reported to date. The large area MCH&#8208;treated device (1.00&#8197;cm2) also obtained a high PCE of 24.36&#8201;%. Moreover, the unencapsulated and MCH&#8208;treated device exhibited excellent operational stability, maintaining 91.95&#8201;% and 97.06&#8201;% of their initial efficiencies after aging in air and a nitrogen&#8208;filled atmosphere at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 1200&#8197;h. The encapsulated MCH&#8208;treated devices retained 94.25&#8201;% of its initial efficiency after continuously tracking at the maximum power&#8208;point for 1200&#8197;h in air.

         <title>Iron Oxide Clusters as Electron Donors Under Light Enhance Oxygen Reduction Kinetics at Atomically Dispersed Fe for Photocatalytic CH4 Partial Oxidation</title>

Fe SA&#8722;NC/C3N4 demonstrates an excellent CH3OH productivity for photocatalytic methane partial oxidation. Fe2O3 nanoclusters play a similar role as NADH coenzyme in soluble methane monooxygenase that continuously provide electrons under the illumination to the satellite Fe single atom sites, promoting O2 activation and subsequent CH4 oxidation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to CH3OH emerges as a promising strategy to sustainably utilize natural gas and mitigate the greenhouse effect. However, there remains a significant challenge for the synthesis of methanol by using O2 at low temperature. Inspired by the catalytic structure in soluble methane monooxygenase (MMO) and the corresponding reaction mechanism, we prepared a biomimetic photocatalyst with the decoration of Fe2O3 nanoclusters and satellite Fe single atoms immobilized on carbon nitride. The catalyst demonstrates an excellent CH3OH productivity of 5.02&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with CH3OH selectivity of 98.5&#8201;%. Mechanism studies reveal that the synergy between Fe2O3 nanoclusters and Fe single atoms establishes a dual&#8208;Fe site as MMO for O2 activation and subsequent CH4 partial oxidation. Moreover, the light excitation of Fe2O3 nanoclusters with a relative narrow band gap could deliver the electrons and protons to atomic Fe that facilitating the oxygen reduction kinetics for the robust of CH3OH synthesis.

         <title>Oriented Growth of Highly Emissive Manganese Halide Microrods for Dual&#8208;Mode Low&#8208;Loss Optical Waveguides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emissive organic&#8211;inorganic manganese(II) halide microrod crystals (TPS2MnCl4) are synthesized via a facile chloride ion (Cl&#8722;) induced oriented growth method. Owing to their high PLQY, smooth crystal surface, and negligible self&#8208;absorption, these TPS2MnCl4 microrods are well suited not only for optical waveguides but can serve as dual&#8208;mode optical waveguides, combining active and passive light transmission functionalities in a single crystal.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structured lead&#8208;free metal halides have recently attracted widespread attention due to their high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and negligible self&#8208;absorption, showing enormous potential as optical waveguides towards miniaturized photonic devices. However, due to the great difficulty in growth of rod&#8208;like nano/micro&#8208;sized morphologies, such applications have been less explored. Herein, a new&#8208;type emissive organic&#8211;inorganic manganese (II) halide crystal (TPS2MnCl4, TPS=C18H15S, triphenylsulfonium) in the form of microrods is synthesized via a facile chloride ion (Cl&#8722;) induced oriented growth method. Due to a combination of attractive features such as a high PLQY of 86&#8201;%, negligible self&#8208;absorption and smooth crystal surface, TPS2MnCl4 microrods are well suited for use in optical waveguide with an ultra&#8208;low optical loss coefficient of 1.20&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;4&#8197;dB&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;1, superior to that of most organic&#8211;inorganic metal halide hybrids, organic materials, polymers and metal nanoclusters to the best of our knowledge. Importantly, TPS2MnCl4 microrods can further work as dual&#8208;mode optical waveguides, combining active and passive light transmission functionalities in one single crystal. In addition, TPS2MnCl4 microrods also display remarkable performance in lighting and anti&#8208;counterfeiting due to their distinct optical properties and commendable stability.

         <title>Molecular Trapdoor in HEU Zeolite Enables Inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sr&#8208;exchanged K&#8208;type clinoptilolite (Sr/K&#8208;HEU) zeolite exhibits molecular trapdoor effect and thereby achieves inverse separation of CO2&#8208;C2H2 with benchmark selectivity, which provides new thoughts for gas separation by zeolites and improves current understanding of molecular trapdoor mechanism.







Abstract
The adsorptive separation of molecules with very similar physical properties is always a challenging task. Reported herein is the design and tailoring of zeolite adsorbent for the precise discrimination and separation of CO2&#8208;C2H2 mixture through the pronounced trapdoor effect. Typically, Sr exchanged K&#8208;type clinoptilolite, namely Sr/K&#8208;HEU, is developed as a robust zeolite adsorbent for inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 separation, showing the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dynamic CO2/C2H2 selectivity of 48.0 and sustainable CO2 dynamic uptake of 0.96&#8197;mmol/g at the same time. The perfect recyclability and the intrinsic low&#8208;cost nature of Sr/K&#8208;HEU make it a promising candidate for practical applications. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction determines the precise structure of Sr/K&#8208;HEU and density functional theory calculations reveal the intricate interplay between guest molecules and the gate&#8208;keeping extraframework cations. Briefly, extraframework Sr2+ cations from the ten&#8208;membered rings of HEU zeolites act as the molecular trapdoor, allowing the entry of CO2 molecules while excluding C2H2. This work presents a new example of molecular trapdoor in zeolite and its successful application in the challenging inverse CO2&#8208;C2H2 separation, which not only expands the scope of molecular trapdoor concept but also improves current understanding on the nature of molecular trapdoor.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of the Cyclopiane Family of Diterpenoid Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoenzymatic synthesis of cyclopiane and related diterpenes has been achieved in a three&#8208;stage manner. Ten cyclopiane diterpenes were obtained by skeleton construction with an engineered heterologous host, followed by late&#8208;stage functionalization of rings A, B and D by direct redox operations, directed C&#8722;H activation and enzymatic oxidation. Varied cyclopiane&#8208;related skeletons were further obtained by chemical transformation and genome mining.







Abstract
A three&#8208;stage chemoenzymatic synthesis of the cyclopiane family and related diterpenes is reported. Deoxyconidiogenol with a 6/5/5/5&#8208;fused tetracyclic cyclopiane skeleton was first produced by an engineered E. coli host harboring the corresponding terpene cyclase PchDS. Ten cyclopiane diterpenes were synthesized by late&#8208;stage functionalization of rings A, B and D of the cyclopiane skeleton through direct redox operations, directed C&#8722;H activation, and enzymatic hydroxylation, respectively. Skeletal diversification was achieved by taking advantage of the selective 1,2&#8208;alkyl migration of a cyclopiane cation generated chemically or enzymatically. Three cyclopiane&#8208;related skeletons, including the spiro 5/5/5/5&#8208;tetracyclic skeleton of spiroviolene, the angular 5/6/5/5&#8208;fused ring system of phomopsene, and the new linear 5/6/5/5&#8208;fused tetracyclic ring system of amycolatene, were produced either by chemical skeletal transformation from the cyclopiane skeleton, or by terpene cyclases discovered by genome mining.

         <title>Progressive Fabrication of a Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Catalyst toward Highly Efficient Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy catalyst (PtCuSnAuPd/SiO2) with greatly improved catalytic properties toward propane dehydrogenation (PDH) was progressively designed and fabricated. The well&#8208;balanced alloying effects and high configurational entropy (&#916;Smix) concertedly created abundant isolated Pt sites, conducive to striking activity, high selectivity, and superior stability.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as burgeoning heterogeneous catalysts due to their vast material space, unique structure, and superior stability. However, the dominant trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches hamper the exploration of efficient catalysts, necessitating the development of rational design strategies. Here, we report a progressive approach to the design and fabrication of HEA catalysts guided by alloying effects toward propane dehydrogenation. Cu, Sn, Au, and Pd are selected and demonstrated to induce dilution, encapsulation, surface enrichment, and inhomogeneity effects on Pt. The fabricated HEA, PtCuSnAuPd/SiO2, exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability. The propylene formation rates reach 256 and 390 molC3H6 gPt&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 550 and 600&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. Systematic characterizations reveal that the random elemental mixing, structural stability, and high Pt exposure promote the exposure of abundant stable isolated Pt sites. This work comprehensively explores the rational design and fabrication of HEA catalysts from a unique perspective, offering opportunities for developing advanced catalysts.

         <title>A Base&#8208;Free Two&#8208;Coordinate Oxoborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A base&#8208;free, two coordinate oxoborane (R&#8208;BO) has been isolated as a Lewis adduct with AlCl3 and shown to react in a unique way with PhN3. In contrast to the parent oxoborane, the oxoborane&#8594;AlCl3 adduct is stable towards oligomerisation and C&#8722;H cleavage of the Mes* group as AlCl3 coordination provides thermodynamic stabilization while also reducing the basicity of the oxygen unit thus reducing the biphilic character of the BO unit.







Abstract
Oxoboranes (R&#8208;BO) are transient species that rapidly trimerise to form boroxines. To date, the only method used to stabilise oxoboranes is to add a Lewis base, but this forms a three&#8208;coordinate at boron oxoborane that has a different bonding/reactivity profile. Herein we report a base&#8208;free, two&#8208;coordinate oxoborane that is isolated as a Lewis adduct with AlCl3. This species, Mes*BO&#8208;AlCl3 (Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2), has a &#957;11&#914;&#927; stretching frequency of 1843&#8197;cm&#8722;1, indicating a strong BO bond. Computational analysis indicates this is due to a highly polarised BO bonding interaction combined with modest BO multiple bond character. While the polarisation of the BO bond on AlCl3 coordination enhances the Lewis acidity at boron it also reduces the basicity at oxygen and the latter is key to accessing a base&#8208;free oxoborane. Finally, this oxoborane reacts with PhN3 in a unique way to form an unprecedented boron heterocycle.

         <title>Switching Residues: A Platform for the Synthesis of Fidaxomicin Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching residues: Adding new substituents to natural products increases their molecular weight and often their lipophilicity. We developed a Pd&#8208;catalysed protocol to directly replace the rhamnoside&#8208;arene fragment of the antibiotic fidaxomicin with simple amines in 1 step from the unprotected natural product. This enabled direct access to Fdx derivatives of reduced complexity with activity against RNA polymerase and various bacteria.







Abstract
Peripheral modification is often the main approach to optimize natural products for improved biological activity or desired physicochemical properties. This procedure inevitably increases molecular weight, often accompanied by undesired increased lipophilicity. Removing structural elements from natural products is not always tolerated. This is also the case for the antibiotic fidaxomicin (Fdx), where every structural component has been shown to be crucial for antibiotic activity. In this work, we demonstrate how the residue switching approach can maintain biological activity of Fdx derivatives by replacing the rhamnoside&#8208;dichlorohomoorsellinate moiety of Fdx with smaller, more polar building blocks. We used palladium&#8208;catalysed allylic substitution to selectively install N&#8208;nucleophiles on the core of Fdx. The new derivatives were designed to mimic the binding of Fdx to the bacterial RNA polymerase. Evaluation against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Clostridioides difficile, and the Gram&#8208;negative model organism Caulobacter crescentus demonstrated that the newly introduced residues can restore antibiotic activity, which was further supported by on&#8208;target RNA polymerase assays. We combined the allylic substitution with an organocatalysed novioside acylation protocol to enable the functionalisation of two vectors on Fdx in one pot. This platform greatly expands the accessible chemical space for Fdx derivatives and enables the future development of systemic Fdx antibiotics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing 2D Anion&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Low&#8208;Temperature Water Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing halogen anions as connecting nodes, new 2D reticulate honeycomb anion&#8208;organic frameworks were synthesized through a simple, green in situ protonation and crystallization method using pyridine&#8208;functionalized triphenylamine derivatives. These frameworks feature well&#8208;defined hexagonal channels and exhibit excellent self&#8208;healing properties, high water uptake, and low water release onset temperatures.







Abstract
Molecular frameworks have recently shown a great potential in atmospheric water harvesting, in which the water release at low temperatures is challenging. Anion&#8208;organic frameworks based on anion&#8208;coordination chemistry are presented herein to meet this challenge. These frameworks are prepared as tubular single crystals in pure water from the in situ protonation and crystallization of pyridine&#8208;terminated triphenylamine derivatives with hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid. They possess a 2D honeycombed porous structure and carry halogen anions confined within 1D hexagonal nanochannels with a modular size of 1.7&#8211;2.3&#8197;nm. They exhibit a high water uptake of up to 0.87&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a water release onset temperature as low as &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C. The water uptake and release induce significant changes in the crystal morphology and absorption and emission properties of these framework crystals, providing a visual indication of their hydration states over a wide temperature range. The kinetics of dehydration at subglacial temperatures is successfully determined by emission spectral shifts. These framework crystals show a high water&#8208;stability and can be used for repeated water capture and release thanks to a rapid and robust self&#8208;healing capability. This discovery opens opportunities for the design and synthesis of flexible and self&#8208;healing frameworks for porosity&#8208;related applications.

Sn&#8208;based perovskites have emerged as one of the most promising environmentally&#8208;friendly photovoltaic materials owing to their low toxicity and exceptional optoelectronic properties. Nonetheless, the low&#8208;cost production and stable operation of Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still largely limited by the costly hole transport materials and the under&#8208;optimized interfaces between hole transport layer (HTL) and Sn perovskite layer. Here, we innovatively developed a chlorine radical chemical bridging (Cl&#8208;RCB) strategy that enabled to remove the HTL and optimize the indium tin oxide (ITO)/perovskite heterointerface for constructing high&#8208;performance Sn&#8208;based PSCs with simplified structures. The key is to modify the commercially&#8208;purchased ITO electrode with highly active chlorine radicals that could effectively mitigate the surface oxygen vacancies, alter the chemical constitutions, and favorably down&#8208;shifted the work function of ITO surface to be close to the valence band of perovskites. As a result, the interfacial energy barrier has been largely reduced by 0.20&#8197;eV and the interfacial carrier dynamics have been optimized at the ITO/perovskite heterointerface. Encouragingly, the efficiency of HTL&#8208;free Sn&#8208;based PSCs has been enhanced from 6.79&#8201;% to 14.20&#8201;%, which is on par with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conventional HTL&#8208;containing counterparts (normally &gt;14&#8201;% efficiency) and representing the record performance for the Sn perovskite photovoltaics in the absence of HTL. Notably, the target device exhibited enhanced stability for up to 2000&#8197;h. The Cl&#8208;RCB strategy is also versatile to be used in Pb&#8208;based and mixed Sn&#8722;Pb HTL&#8208;free PSCs, achieving efficiencies of 22.27&#8201;% and 21.13&#8201;%, respectively, all representing the advanced device performances for the carrier transport layer&#8208;free PSCs with simplified device architectures.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Level Alignment at TiO2@NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 Interface for High&#8208;Performance Gas Sensing</title>

Metal oxide&#8208;based chemiresistive sensors suffer from high operating temperatures and poor selectivity. The TiO2@(NH2)x&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (x = 0, 1, or 2) heterojunctions enhance sensing performance through energy level modulation. TiO2@NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 detects NO2 at 1 ppb in &lt; 0.3&#8197;min at room temperature, exhibiting high selectivity and stability, thereby underscoring the role of energy band engineering in the advancement of sensor performance.







Abstract
Metal oxide (MO)&#8208;based chemiresistive sensors have great potential in environmental monitoring, security protection, and disease diagnosis. However, the thermally activated sensing mechanism in pristine MOs leads to high working temperature and poor selectivity, which are the main challenges impeding practical applications. Precise modulation of the band structure at the heterojunction interfaces of MOs offers the opportunity to unlock unique electrical and optical properties, enabling us to overcome these challenges. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable structures are promising materials for aligning the energy levels at the heterojunctions of MOs. Herein, we report the energy&#8208;level structural engineering of MO@MOF heterojunctions to optimize chemiresistive sensing performance. The interface was flexibly modulated from a straddling gap to a staggered gap by &#8208;NH2 functionalization of TiO2@(NH2)x&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, varying x from 0 to 1 and 2, respectively. TiO2@(NH2)x&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 combines the advantages of MOs and MOFs to synergistically improve gas&#8208;sensing properties. As a result, TiO2@NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 is the first light&#8208;activated material to detect NO2 at 1 ppb with a response time of &lt; 0.3&#8197;min at room temperature. It also exhibited excellent selectivity and long&#8208;term stability. Our study underscores the potential of energy band engineering in creating high&#8208;performance sensors, offering a strategy to overcome current material limits.

         <title>Photoinduced Energy/Electron Transfer within Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced energy/electron transfer (PET) is critically enhanced by confining the reactive molecules within a single&#8208;chain nanoparticle (SCNP) environment.







Abstract
We demonstrate that single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) &#8211; compact covalently folded single polymer chains &#8211; can increase photocatalytic performance of an embedded catalytic center, compared to the comparable catalytic system in free solution. In particular, we demonstrate that the degree of compaction allows to finely tailor the catalytic activity, thus evidencing that molecular confinement is a key factor in controlling photocatalysis. Specifically, we decorate a linear parent polymer with both photoreactive chalcone moieties as well as Ru(bpy)3 catalytic centers. We initially construct a SCNP via a photosensitized [2+2] cycloaddition at 510&#8197;nm and demonstrate that the SCNP formation is substantially more efficient when the Ru(bpy)3 units are part of the polymer chain instead of as free molecules in solution. Subsequently, we employ the same Ru(bpy)3 units as photocatalysts in a model reaction employing pyrene units as charge transfer moieties. We establish that the photocatalytic activity increases as the polymer becomes more compact, reaching peak efficiency, followed by a subsequent decline as the SCNP becomes too compact. Thus, we identify a goldilocks regime of catalyst confinement via SCNP compaction for use in photocatalysis.

         <title>Quinoline Substituted Anthracene Isomers: A Case Study for Simultaneously Optimizing High Mobility and Strong Luminescence in Herringbone&#8208;Packed Organic Semiconductors</title>

         <dc:description>
The structure&#8211;property relationship in high mobility emissive materials was revealed that a centroid distance of about 7&#8211;7.5&#8197;&#197; along CH&#8208;&#960; direction and 6&#8211;6.5&#8197;&#197; along &#960;&#8211;&#960; direction is beneficial for achieving high mobility and strong emission in herringbone&#8208;packed aggregates simultaneously based on four quinoline&#8208;anthracene isomers. This relationship also demonstrates the broad applicability and universal potential in other organic semiconductors.







Abstract
The development of high mobility emissive organic semiconductors is significant for advancing optoelectronic devices with simplified architecture and enhanced performance. The herringbone&#8208;packed structure is regarded as the ideal arrangement for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission in organic semiconductors. However, it remains a great challenge that the relationship between molecular structure and optoelectronic property is still elusive. Herein, four quinoline&#8208;substituted anthracene isomers were designed and synthesized by introducing quinoline groups to anthracene core. Their intermolecular interactions and packing mode in the herringbone&#8208;packed structures were regularly tuning by subtle changing the nitrogen position on quinoline group, resulting in the superior integration of optoelectronic properties. Through a comprehensive analysis of aggregation states and optoelectronic properties, we revealed that in herringbone&#8208;packed aggregates, a centroid distance of approximately 7&#8211;7.5&#8197;&#197; along CH&#8208;&#960; direction and 6&#8211;6.5&#8197;&#197; along &#960;&#8211;&#960; direction is beneficial for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission. These properties are closely related to the molecular twist angles, which are influenced by intramolecular interactions. This structure&#8211;property relationship has been further validated in other herringbone&#8208;packed high mobility emissive organic semiconductors, demonstrating its broad applicability and universal potential. This work figures out the practical molecular design principle for high mobility emissive organic semiconductors.

The strategy of linker mediated electronic&#8208;state regulation was proposed to construct a CP with multi&#8208;channel charge transfer. This strategy reduced carrier losses resulting from recombination or quenching, enhanced the efficiency of charge separation and transfer. The semiconductive detector achieves the high mobility&#8208;lifetime product and the low detectable X&#8208;ray dose rate, which makes the record for CPs&#8208;based direct radiation detection.







Abstract
Coordination polymers (CPs) are promising for direct X&#8208;ray detection and imaging owing to higher designability and outstanding stability, however, it remains a challenge to achieve highly X&#8208;ray detection performance, particularly both high sensitivity and low detection limit at the same operating voltage. Herein, we construct a new conjugated CP {[Co(BPTTz)(DIPA)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMA}n (1, BPTTz=2,5&#8208;bis(pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole, H2DIPA=2,5&#8208;diiodoterephthalic acid, DMA=N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethylacetamide), with multi&#8208;channel charge transfer by regulating the linker mediated electronic&#8208;state, which reduces carrier losses resulting from recombination or quenching, enhances the efficiency of charge separation and transfer, thus further optimizes X&#8208;ray detection performance. The semiconductor prepared based on this strategy achieves record values including the highest mobility&#8208;lifetime product (&#956;&#964;, 8.05&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1) and the lowest detectable X&#8208;ray dose rate (128&#8197;nGyair&#8201;S&#8722;1, 35&#8197;V) among CP&#8208;based direct radiation detectors, as well as a high sensitivity (172&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 35&#8197;V) at the same operating voltage. This detector shows excellent long&#8208;time air stability under ambient conditions for over three months and operational stability. These findings demonstrate a rational structural design method to enhance the photoelectronic efficiency and stability of semiconductive CPs.

         <title>Negative Thermal Expansion Behavior Enabling Good Electrochemical&#8208;Energy&#8208;Storage Performance at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical energy&#8208;storage materials with negative&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (NTE) behavior can enable good low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, which becomes a new and effective strategy to tackle the low&#8208;temperature issue of metal&#8208;ion batteries. When the operation temperature decreases, the lattice parameters of an NTE material increases, leading to its fast ion diffusivity, high electrochemical kinetics, high rate capability, and good cycling stability at low temperatures.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;ion batteries (such as lithium&#8208;ion batteries) are very popular energy&#8208;storage devices nowadays. However, low temperatures cause their poor electrochemical kinetics and performance, significantly limiting their wide applications in cold environments. Here, we propose that electrochemical energy&#8208;storage materials with negative&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (NTE) behavior can enable good low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, which becomes a new strategy to tackle the low&#8208;temperature issues of metal&#8208;ion batteries. LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP) with an a&#8208;direction thermal expansion coefficient of &#8722;1.1&#215;10&#8722;&#8197;K&#8722;1 is used as a model material. As the temperature decreases, the transverse vibration of O atoms not only increases the transverse distances among O atoms connected to Li/Ti atoms, but also widens the Li+&#8208;transport channels and enlarges the Li+&#8208;insertion sites along the [12

1&#8254;

 ${\bar{1}}$



] direction, which are mainly controlled by the lattice parameter a. Consequently, carbon&#8208;coated LTP (C&#8211;LTP) retains good electrochemical performance at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C, including fast Li+ diffusivity (84&#8201;% of that at 25&#8201;&#176;C), large capacity (96&#8201;% of the theoretical capacity), and superior rate capability (83&#8201;% capacity retention at 5&#8197;C vs. 0.5&#8197;C). Moreover, the more open crystal structure of LTP at the lower temperature allows smaller maximum unit&#8208;cell&#8208;volume expansion, resulting in better cycling stability of C&#8211;LTP at &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C (96.8&#8201;% capacity retention over 1000&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C).

         <title>Self&#8208;adaptive Coordination Evolution Mediated Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partition in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Boosting SF6/N2 Separation</title>

         <dc:description>
Pore space partition (PSP) has been successfully achieved in two isomorphic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) mediated by an unprecedented self&#8208;adaptive coordination evolution (SACE) on low&#8208;symmetric M4 clusters, which provides new perspectives for MOF structural regulation and designing more advanced porous adsorbents.







Abstract
The controllable and precise structural regulation of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on isoreticular chemistry is an effective strategy for creating functional material platforms, such as efficient porous adsorbents. Herein, for the first time, mediated by an unprecedented self&#8208;adaptive coordination evolution (SACE) on pseudo&#8208;D2h&#8208;symmetric [M4(&#956;3&#8208;O)2(COO)6] (M=Mn/Fe) clusters, two pore space partitioned MOFs (CTGU&#8208;47&#8208;Mn/Fe, CTGU=China Three Gorges University) have been successfully constructed. Owing to the more confined adsorption space and dense binding sites produced by pore space partitioning (PSP), the CTGU&#8208;47&#8208;Mn/Fe exhibit significantly enhanced performance in the capture or recovery SF6 (greenhouse/electronic specialty gas) from SF6/N2 mixture compared to their non&#8208;partitioned homologous structures (CTGU&#8208;46&#8208;Mn/Fe) with adsorption selectivity increased from 37/72 to 634/157 (v/v, 10/90, 100&#8197;kPa). The theoretical calculations also elucidated that the implementation of PSP within CTGU&#8208;47&#8208;Mn/Fe leads to dramatically strengthened binding affinity for SF6 over N2 through extra multiple F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions. This study represents a valuable advance in crystal engineering field: the SACE of polynuclear metal clusters is expected to be useful in the structural regulation of MOFs and the fabrication of advanced porous adsorbents.

We discovered that the non&#8208;conjugated piperazine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione unit fully tautomerizes into the conjugated 3,6&#8208;dihydropyrazine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diol unit via a long&#8208;range vinylogous effect, driven by energy minimization through &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization along the polymer backbone. This fully conjugated backbone enhances charge transport, while lactim units strongly interact with fluoride ions, making this polymer effective in water&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect transistor fluoride sensors.







Abstract
Piperazine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione (glycine anhydride, GA) has recently emerged as a valuable precursor for high&#8208;performance &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer semiconductors in organic electronics. We utilized GA to design a novel bisindolin&#8208;dihydropiperazine (IDHP)&#8208;based conjugated polymer, PIDHPTT, for aqueous chemical sensing. In the isatin&#8208;flanked monomer, GA exists as a non&#8208;conjugated lactam (DHP&#8208;NH) but converts to a conjugated lactim (DHP&#8208;OH) form within the polymer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that this conversion is driven by energy minimization via extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Neighboring DHP units in the lactim form facilitate this process through &#960;&#8208;bridges, demonstrating a vinylogous effect, which has previously only been observed in small molecules. This is the first study to report such a long&#8208;range vinylogous effect in a polymer due to the collective synergy of numerous functional groups. The OH groups in the lactim DHP interact more strongly with fluoride ions than other halides. PIDHPTT exhibits significant changes in optical absorption, electrochemical impedance, and charge transport in response to fluoride ions, which differ from responses to other halides. A water&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistor based on PIDHPTT shows excellent sensitivity and selectivity for fluoride ions, demonstrating the potential of this polymer design for chemical sensing applications.

A water-gated organic field-effect transistor based on PIDHPTT shows excellent sensitivity and selectivity for fluoride ions, demonstrating the potential of this polymer design for chemical sensing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Interstitial Boron Inserted Metastable Hexagonal Rh Nanocrystal for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metastable hexagonal Rh nanocrystal catalyst is synthesized via interstitial boron insertion for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The insertion of boron atoms into Rh lattice not only induces phase transition from face&#8208;centered cubic to hexagonal close&#8208;packed, but also optimized adsorbed behaviors of reaction intermediates, leading to improved connectivity of hydrogen&#8208;bond networks and enhanced HOR performance.







Abstract
Constructing metastable phase structure plays an important role in changing the physicochemical properties and improving the catalytic performance of nanocrystals. Unfortunately, the synthesis of metastable phase metallic nanocrystals is highly challenging, mainly due to the thermodynamically unstable ground&#8208;state. Here, we report a synthesis of unconventional metastable hexagonal rhodium nanocrystal (Bint&#8722;Rhhcp/C) via interstitial boron insertion. The insertion of boron atoms into the interstitial sites of cubic Rh lattice not only induces the atomic arrangements from face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) to hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp), but also stabilizes the metastable hexagonal Rh structure. Benefiting from the phase transition and interstitial boron doping, the Bint&#8722;Rhhcp/C catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic performance toward hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) under alkaline media, with a mass activity of 1.413&#8197;mA&#8201;&#956;gPGM&#8722;1. Experimental measurements including in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the strengthened adsorption of hydroxyl species on the electrode surface of Bint&#8722;Rhhcp/C is responsible for the reconstruction of interfacial water structure and increased water proportions in the gap region in the electric double layers. As a result, the increased water connectivity and hydrogen bond network facilitate high&#8208;efficiency hydrogen transfer across the interface, thereby boost the alkaline HOR performance.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Stokes Emission Utilizing Reverse Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative mechanism of photon&#8208;upconversion using a spin&#8208;flip process was proposed and demonstrated by combining a triplet sensitizer and a thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) molecule. The triplet energy transfer from the green phosphorescent emitter (Ir(ppy)3) to the blue TADF emitter (CzBSe) results in anti&#8208;Stokes emission with an anti&#8208;Stokes energy of 0.18&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Photon&#8208;upconversion (PUC) processes in organic molecular systems, such as triplet&#8208;triplet upconversion and hot&#8208;band absorption, are promising technologies for future energy harvesting. Although these processes can generate high&#8208;energy excitons compared to excitation energy, a PUC process with a high yield and no energy loss has not been established and, therefore, is highly desired. Here, we propose an alternative PUC mechanism that uses reverse intersystem crossing on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules. This process combines a triplet sensitizer and a TADF molecule, generating a triplet in the former and transferring it to the latter. Specifically, the triplet energy transfer from Ir(ppy)3 (sensitizer) to CzBSe (TADF) results in anti&#8208;Stokes emission with an anti&#8208;Stokes energy of 0.18&#8197;eV. We found that the triplet energy transfer rate strongly depends on the triplet radiative decay rate of TADF molecules and the difference in Gibbs energy between the energy acceptor and donor. Our findings will contribute to understanding triplet energy transfer dynamics in organic energy donor&#8208;acceptor systems and will lead to various applications, such as future optical cooling systems.

         <title>Pseudohalide Anions Driven Structural Modulation in Distorted Tetrahedral Manganese(II) Hybrids Toward Tunable Green&#8208;Red Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahedral Mn(II) pseudohalide hybrids, (RPh3P)2MnBrxNCS4&#8722;x are introduced with R=phenyl, pentyl, or methyl, and x=1&#8211;3, synthesized by gradually substituting bromides with pseudohalides (NCS&#8722;). These hybrids show significant Stokes shifts and red&#8208;shifted emission (549&#8211;613&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Mn(II)&#8208;based halides have recently garnered significant interest as emerging luminescence materials for diverse photonic applications. Generally, Mn(II) hybrids with tetrahedral coordination show green emission, however, ones with octahedral coordination give red emission. Herein, we design the synthesis of tetrahedral Mn(II) pseudohalide hybrids, (RPh3P)2MnBrxNCS4&#8722;x (R=phenyl, pentyl or methyl; Ph3P=triphenylphosphine; x=1&#8211;3), achieved by gradually substituting bromides with pseudohalides (NCS&#8722;). Compared to the green&#8208;emitting A2MnBr4 (512&#8197;nm), the mixed hybrids exhibit significantly distorted [MnBrxNCS4&#8722;X] tetrahedra with high dipole moment, thus leading to the distinct Stokes shift energies and noticeable red shift emission in the range of 549&#8211;613&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of these hybrids correlates strongly with the pair correlation function of Mn(II) ions, specifically the Mn&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Mn distance. These findings highlight the critical role of dipole moments in determining the emission properties and expand the luminescent family of Mn(II) pseudohalide hybrids.

         <title>Cationic Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Delivers siRNAs to Overcome Radioresistance and Potentiate Cancer Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hafnium&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based cationic metal&#8208;organic layer (CMOL) delivers small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to enhance radiotherapy. CMOL@siRNAs not only increases energy deposition from X&#8208;rays and reactive oxygen species generation, but also effectively delivers an siRNA cocktail to downregulate survivin expression and ameliorate radioresistance of cancer cells. CMOL@siRNAs plus X&#8208;ray irradiation shows remarkable antitumor efficacy in murine colorectal carcinoma and triple&#8208;negative breast cancer models.







Abstract
Radiotherapy plays an important role in modern oncology, but its treatment efficacy is limited by the radioresistance of tumor cells. As a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, survivin plays a key role in developing radioresistance by mediating apoptosis evasion, promoting epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, and modulating cell cycle dynamics. Efficient downregulation of survivin expression presents a promising strategy to enhance the antitumor effects of radiotherapy. Herein, we report the design of a hafnium&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based cationic metal&#8208;organic layer (CMOL) with quaternary ammonium capping groups to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for enhanced radiotherapy. The CMOL@siRNA nanoplatform not only increased energy deposition from X&#8208;rays and reactive oxygen species generation via a unique radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy process, but also effectively delivered siRNAs to downregulate survivin expression and ameliorate radioresistance of cancer cells. Consequently, CMOL@siRNA in combination with low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation demonstrated remarkable antitumor efficacy with 96.9&#8201;% and 91.4&#8201;% tumor growth inhibition in murine colorectal carcinoma and triple&#8208;negative breast cancer models, respectively.

         <title>Photoredox Activation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes: Distonic Radical Cation Reactivity in [3+2] Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoredox activation of D&#8722;A cyclopropanes is unlocked, leading to distonic radical cations for a traditionally polarity&#8208;mismatched [3+2] cycloaddition with unactivated olefins. Further extension leads to facile access of cyclopentenes as well as bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes by [&#963;+&#960;] and [&#963;+&#963;] cycloaddition respectively.







Abstract
Altering the reactivity model of a molecule can potentially eliminate limitations existing in its current paradigm. When it comes to the activation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes (DACs), Lewis acids have been the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Although a variety of polarized 2&#960; components have been successfully coupled with DACs for [3+2] cycloaddition, unpolarized alkenes prove to be a roadblock due to an inherent polarity mismatch with the Lewis acid&#8208;mediated 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediate. Hereby, harnessing the distonic radical cation mode of cleavage by photoredox catalysis overcomes this mismatched reactivity of the zwitterionic intermediate, providing a unique route to highly substituted cyclopentanes and cyclopentenes. Expansion of this strategy to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes enables access to bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (BCHs) through a facile [3&#963;+2&#963;] cycloaddition. Detailed mechanistic insights are also provided using dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory.

         <title>Twisted&#8208;Planar Molecular Engineering with Sonication&#8208;Induced J&#8208;Aggregation To Design Near&#8208;Infrared J&#8208;Aggregates for Enhanced Phototherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A twisted&#8208;planar molecular design together with a sonication&#8208;induced J&#8208;aggregation strategy has been used to develop MTSIC J&#8208;aggregates, with the absorption red&#8208;shifting from 620&#8197;nm to 790&#8197;nm. MTSIC undergoes kinetic assembly from amorphous aggregates to H&#8208;intermediates, and eventually to stable J&#8208;aggregates. MTSIC J&#8208;dots showed enhanced fluorescence as well as photodynamic and photothermal effects for cancer phototherapy.







Abstract
J&#8208;aggregates show great promise in phototherapy, but are limited to specific molecular skeletons and poor molecular self&#8208;assembly controllability. Herein, we report a twisted&#8208;planar molecular strategy with sonication&#8208;induced J&#8208;aggregation to develop donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type J&#8208;aggregates for phototherapy. With propeller aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) moieties as the twisted subunits and thiophene as the planar &#960;&#8208;bridge, the optimal twisted&#8208;planar &#960;&#8208;interaction in MTSIC induces appropriate slip angle and J&#8208;aggregates formation, redshifting the absorption from 624&#8197;nm to 790&#8197;nm. In contrast, shorter &#960;&#8208;planarity results in amorphous aggregates, and elongation promotes charge transfer (CT) coupled J&#8208;aggregates. Sonication was demonstrated to be effective in controlling self&#8208;assembly behaviors of MTSIC, which enables the transformation from amorphous aggregates to H&#8208;intermediates, and finally to stable J&#8208;aggregates. After encapsulation with lipid&#8208;PEG, the resultant J&#8208;dots show enhanced phototherapeutic effects over amorphous dots, including brightness, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and photothermal conversion, delivering superior cancer phototherapy performance. This work not only advances D&#8211;A type J&#8208;aggregates design but also provides a promising strategy for supramolecular assembly development.

         <title>Chiral Rotaxane&#8208;Branched Dendrimers as Relays in Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems with Boosted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral artificial light&#8208;harvesting system that shows sequentially amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performances has been constructed from chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers. This approach not only leads to efficient amplification of the CPL performances but will also allow the construction of novel chiral luminescent materials.







Abstract
Starting from AIEgen&#8208;functionalized chiral [2]rotaxane building block, we have successfully synthesized a new class of chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers through controllable divergent strategy for the first time, based on which novel chiral artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems (LHSs) were successfully constructed in aqueous phase by sequentially introducing achiral donor and acceptor. More importantly, accompanied by the two&#8208;step F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process in the resultant artificial LHSs, the sequentially amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performances were achieved, highlighting that the chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers could serve as excellent relay for both energy transfer and chirality transmission. Impressively, compared with the sole chiral rotaxane&#8208;branched dendrimers, the dissymmetry factors (glum) values of the resultant artificial LHSs were amplified by one order of magnitude up to 0.038, enabling their further applications in information storage and encryption. The proof&#8208;of concept study provides not only a feasible approach for the efficient amplification of CPL performances but also a novel platform for the construction of novel chiral luminescent materials.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;level Modulation of N, S&#8208;Co&#8208;Doped Mesoporous Carbon Nanospheres for Selective Aqueous Catalytic Oxidation of Ethylbenzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile emulsion&#8208;assisted interface self&#8208;assembly method is observed to synthesize nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres with controllable active heteroatom species at molecular level. It is proposed that the doping of pyridinic&#8208;N and thiophene&#8208;S can notably change the charge and spin densities, promoting the chemical reactivity of adjacent carbon atoms and reducing the reaction energy barrier effectively.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of aromatic alkanes into high value&#8208;added products through benzylic C&#8722;H bond activation is one of the main reactions in chemical industry. On account of the constantly increasing demand for mass production, efficient, eco&#8208;friendly and sustainable catalysts are urgently needed. Herein, we describe a facile and versatile emulsion&#8208;assisted interface self&#8208;assembly strategy towards molecular&#8208;level fabrication of co&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres with controllable active N and S species. The method enables a high degree of control over nanoparticle sizes, mesoporous nanostructures, contents of heteroatoms and the chemical composition. The optimized catalyst exhibits high catalytic performance of 97&#8201;% ethylbenzene conversion and 98&#8201;% selectivity to acetophenone. Density functional theory simulations reveal that N, S&#8208;co&#8208;doping leads to the redistribution of charge and spin densities, introducing more active carbon atoms and realizing aerobic oxidation of ethylbenzene efficiently. This work presents a general strategy for molecular&#8208;level design of carbon&#8208;based catalysts, and also provides new insight into the influence of heteroatom&#8208;doping on catalytic properties.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Rich Norbornadiene&#8208;Derived Infrared Transparent Polymers by Inverse Vulcanization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports on the synthesis of infrared (IR) transmission polymers via inverse vulcanization of a novel norbornadiene derivative cross&#8208;linker (DMMD) with elemental sulfur. The resulting polymers exhibit high thermal stability and exceptional IR transmittance, The feasibility of large&#8208;scale free&#8208;standing Fresnel lens fabrication underscores their potential for IR optical applications, offering a promising strategy for achieving balanced thermal and optical properties in IR transparent polymer materials.







Abstract
Infrared (IR) transparent polymer materials prepared by inverse vulcanization, as a promising candidate to replace inorganic materials, are new materials for constructing key devices in IR optics.

&lt;p&gt;Infrared (IR) transparent polymer materials prepared by inverse vulcanization, as a promising candidate to replace inorganic materials, are new materials for constructing key devices in IR optics. However, it is difficult to achieve a balance between infrared optical and thermal properties in polymers due to the intrinsic infrared absorption of organic materials. Herein, our strategy is to construct a high boiling point symmetrical molecular norbornadiene derivative cross-linking agent (DMMD) which can be inverse vulcanized with molten sulfur, and obtain Poly (S-r-DMMD) with different sulfur content by controlling the feed ratio of sulfur. With the rigid core and low IR activity in DMMD, the prepared polymers exhibit tunable thermal properties (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Aliphatic Amines Unlocked for Selective Transformations through Diazotization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the established state of knowledge, synthetically useful diazotation of aliphatic amines is possible. The key of this process is the use of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol as a solvent. It improves the selectivity of the process and enables the transformation of the intermediates into the desired Friedel&#8211;Crafts products. In this way, after more than 150&#8197;years, also the diazotation of aliphatic amines is gaining its place in synthesis.







Abstract
While aromatic diazonium salts are important reagents in organic synthesis, &#8216;Diazonium ions generated from ordinary aliphatic primary amines are usually useless for preparative purposes, since they lead to a mixture of products giving not only substitution by any nucleophile present, but also elimination and rearrangements if the substrate permits.&#8217;1 In this work, we report that this statement is no longer valid, and it is now possible to control diazotization of aliphatic amines by utilizing isopentyl nitrite in HFIP. This transformation enabled electrophilic aromatic substitution with these highly abundant and commercially available alkyl reagents, as well as transforming them into building blocks typically employed in organic synthesis. The methodology opens an avenue for reactions involving aliphatic amines, even such demanding substrates as amino acids, as a source of carbocations thus expanding the degree of chemical space.

         <title>Reaction Pathway Regulation for Gaseous and Liquid Products of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction under Adsorbate Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction pathways of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction for gaseous and liquid products were regulated on well&#8208;defined Ag/Cu catalysts with controlled chlorination, influenced by the lateral adsorbate of *OCHO intermediate. The Ag/AgCl can convert CO2 into CO with a high selectivity, while Cl&#8722;Ag/Cu catalyst enables the conversion of CO2 into liquid products including formate and ethanol with a total Faradaic efficiency nearing 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Halide anion adsorption on transition metals can improve the performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), while the specific reaction mechanisms governing selective CO2RR pathways remain unclear. In this study, we reveal for the first time the distinct pathway switching between gaseous (CO) and liquid products (formate and ethanol) on the well&#8208;defined Ag&#8722;Cu nanostructures with controlled chlorination. We show that CO2 conversion to CO on Ag/AgCl can be tuned by adjusting the thickness of AgCl layer, achieving a high selectivity over a broad potential range in a 0.5&#8197;M KHCO3 using flow cell. In contrast, the optimized Cl&#8722;Ag/Cu system enables the conversion of CO2 into liquid products including formate and ethanol with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) nearing 100&#8201;%, delivering high current densities of 136.3 and 20.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.3&#8197;V, respectively. In situ infrared experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the lateral adsorbate of *OCHO intermediate facilitates the thermodynamics of both the CO pathway on Cl&#8722;Ag(111) and the formate pathway on Cl&#8722;Ag/Cu(111) by reducing Gibbs free energy barriers of each potential&#8208;limit step. This work uncovers the role of chlorination in the tuning of C&#8208;bound or O&#8208;bound intermediates during CO2RR on Ag&#8722;Cu catalysts, determining the reaction pathway under lateral adsorbate effects.

         <title>Zwitterionic 2&#8208;Phosphaethene&#8208;thiolates [(LC)P=CS(LC/P)]+ as PCS Building Blocks (LC=NHC, LP=PR3)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PCS building blocks: This work presents the facile synthesis of zwitterionic salts [(LC)P=CS(LC/P)][OTf], which function as convenient, regioselective and multifaceted synthons of the PCS moiety. DFT calculations support a zwitterionic composition with a negative PCS moiety and two cationic P&#8208; and C&#8208;bound substituents. Depending on the nature of the C&#8208;bound substituent, different reactivity can be addressed in cycloaddition and reduction reactions.







Abstract
The zwitterionic compounds [(LC)P=CS(LC/P)]+ (3+, LC=NHC, LP=PR3), featuring cationic substituents at the phosphorus and carbon atoms, are synthesized as their triflate salts at a multi&#8208;gram scale from the reaction of Lewis base adducts of CS2, namely LC/P&#8722;CS2 (4), with a combination of [(LCP)4][OTf]4 (1[OTf]4) and Ph3P. The feasibility of using 3+ as PCS building blocks is showcased in their reactions with representative electrophiles (MeOTf) and nucleophiles (MesMgBr, Ph3PCH2), leading to selective functionalization of the PCS core at the S&#8208; and P&#8208;terminus, respectively. Additionally, it is reported that 3+ can function as ambident nucleophiles with AgOTf (2 equivalents), affording unprecedented linear coordination polymer [Ag2(OTf)3&#8208;&#956;2:&#954;P,&#954;S&#8722;((LC)P=CS(PCy3))]+ (6&#8201;b), where the PCS moiety acts as a bridging ligand in transition metal complexes for the first time. Reduction of 3+ facilitates the cleavage of the P&#8208; and C&#8208;bound substituents leading to the formation of the [PCS]&#8722; anion. Moreover, cycloaddition reactions of 3+ with 1[OTf]4 are shown to selectively yield five&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered polyphosphorus heterocycles. Preliminary results suggest the possibility of activating the C&#8722;S bond in [(LC)P=CS(LC)]+, resulting in the formation of [(LC)P=C(LC)&#8722;P(LC)][OTf]2, 12[OTf]2, which may serve as a synthon for the PCP unit in future studies.

         <title>Klebsiella pneumoniae Glycoconjugate Vaccine Leads Based on Semi&#8208;Synthetic O1 and O2ac Antigens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycans resembling lipopolysaccharides of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) strains O1 and O2ac were chemically synthesized. The 27 glycans were used to screen the sera of infected patients and controls for antibody binding. The glycan array study identified epitopes for the development of semi&#8208;synthetic glycoconjugate vaccines against K. pneumoniae.







Abstract
Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) is a common opportunistic pathogen that emerged as a new critical threat to human health, due to its hypervirulence and widespread resistance against many antibiotics, including carbapenems. Alternative intervention strategies such as vaccines are not available. Cell&#8208;surface lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and capsular polysaccharides (CPS) are attractive targets for vaccine development. We present a method to synthesize LPS substructures, covering over 70&#8201;% of virulent KP strains that were used to characterize the antibody repertoire of infected patients. Thereby, glycoconjugate vaccine leads against the Klebsiella pneumoniae serotypes O1, O2a, O2afg and O2ac have been identified.

Operationally convenient one&#8208;pot one&#8208;step cobalt&#8208;catalyzed and enantioselective one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation/hydroboration of arylidenecylcopropanes are developed to prepare racemic and enantioenriched 1,4&#8208;borylsilylalkanes with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, respectively.

Abstract
An operationally convenient cobalt&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot one&#8208;step hydrosilylation/hydroboration reaction of arylidenecyclopropanes is developed to access racemic 1,4&#8208;borylsilylalkanes. In addition, the corresponding asymmetric reaction is developed with a chiral copper catalyst to prepare 1,4&#8208;borylsilylalkanes with high enantioselectivity by a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step procedure. Mechanistic studies reveal that this difunctionalization process begins with metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydrosilylation of arylidenecyclopropanes to generate homoallylsilane intermediates, followed by regio&#8208; or enantioselective metal&#8208;hydride&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of homoallylsilanes to produce skipped borylsilylalkanes. Selective transformations of C&#8722;B and Si&#8722;H bonds in skipped borylsilylalkane products are also demonstrated.

         <title>Controlled Lipid Domain Positioning and Polarization in Confined Minimal Cell Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic confinement of phase&#8208;separating giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) directs the accumulation of the minority&#8208;phase domains in the free regions where they fuse to minimize their line energy. This results in the localization of lipid domains at prescribed positions and the possibility to build polarized cell models with a control over the number and position of the poles.







Abstract
Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are widely used minimal cell models where essential biological features can be reproduced, isolated and studied. Although precise spatio&#8208;temporal distribution of membrane domains is a process of crucial importance in living cells, it is still highly challenging to generate anisotropic GUVs with domains at user&#8208;defined positions. Here we describe a novel and robust method to control the spatial position of lipid domains of liquid&#8208;ordered (Lo)/liquid&#8208;disordered (Ld) phase in giant unilamellar vesicles. Our strategy consists in confining Lo/Ld phase&#8208;separating GUVs in microfluidic channels to define free curved regions where the minority&#8208;phase domains localize and coalesce by decreasing the line energy through domain fusion. We show that this process is governed by the respective fraction of the two phases, and not by the chemical nature of the lipids involved. The spatial position and number of domains are controlled by the design of the confining microchannel and could result in polarized GUVs with a controllable number of poles. The developed method is versatile and user&#8208;friendly, while allowing multiple single&#8208;vesicle experiments in parallel.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Spiropyran Exchange for Rapid Structural Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spiropyrans engage in exchange equilibria with indolinium salts that lead to exchange of the indoline fragments or catalyze spiropyran cross exchange, thereby providing a powerful tool for rapid structural diversification and access to novel spiropyran derivatives.







Abstract
Here we disclose that spiropyrans are able to undergo dynamic covalent exchange via their corresponding merocyanine isomers. In the latter, the indolinium moieties can be exchanged by a Michael&#8208;type addition&#8208;elimination sequence, in which a methylene indoline attacks a merocyanine and subsequently the initial indoline fragment is cleaved. The rate and position of the exchange equilibrium strongly depend on the reaction conditions as well as the substitution pattern on the methylene indoline fragments. Importantly, spiropyran cross exchange is catalyzed by indolinium salts and provides the opportunity for rapid in situ structural diversification of spiropyrans. This was used as synthetic tool to access various, hitherto inaccessible spiropyrans as potential dual&#8208;color photoinitiators for xolography. Moreover, we foresee application to screen dynamic covalent libraries of spiropyrans for photochromic properties and to exploit their light&#8208;sensitivity to bias the thermal equilibrium.

         <title>Structural and Functional Characterization of an Amidase Targeting a Polyurethane for Sustainable Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Global plastic production has surged in recent decades, leading to significant environmental waste. With a focus on polyurethane (PUR), the high&#8208;resolution crystal structure of the metagenomic urethanase SP3 in a product&#8208;bound state has been solved. Kinetic studies and enzyme engineering guided by the structure identified key structural elements that enhance urethanase activity, thereby supporting future PUR degradation and sustainable recycling efforts.







Abstract
Global plastic production exceeded 400 million tons in 2022, urgently demanding improved waste management and recycling strategies for a circular plastic economy. While the enzymatic hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has become feasible on industrial scales, efficient enzymes targeting other hydrolyzable plastic types, such as polyurethanes (PURs), are lacking. Recently, enzymes of the amidase signature (AS) family, capable of cleaving urethane bonds in a polyether&#8208;PUR analog and a linear polyester&#8208;PUR, have been identified. Herein, we present high&#8208;resolution crystal structures of the AS enzyme UMG&#8208;SP3 in three states: ligand&#8208;free, bound with a suicidal inhibitor mimicking the transition state, and bound with a monomeric PUR degradation product. Besides revealing the conserved core and catalytic triad akin to other AS family members, the UMG&#8208;SP3 structures show remarkable flexibility of loop regions. Particularly, Arg209 in loop 3 adopts two induced&#8208;fit conformations upon ligand binding. Through structure&#8208;guided kinetic studies and enzyme engineering, we mapped structural key elements that determine the enhanced hydrolysis of urethane and amide bonds in various small molecules, including a linear PUR fragment analog. Our findings contribute critical insights into urethanase activity, aiding PUR degradation campaigns and sustainable plastic recycling efforts in the future.

         <title>Organic Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Achieving 4.8&#8197;V LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ionic liquid electrolyte with high donor number additive is introduced, presenting a new concept of organic cathode electrolyte interphase to inhibit the harmful reactions of high voltage LiCoO2. It provides reversible cathodic electrochemistry at ultra&#8208;high voltage, offering new possibilities for addressing the typical challenges faced by high&#8208;voltage cathodes in current energy storage systems.







Abstract
Developing high&#8208;voltage electrolytes to stabilize LiCoO2 (LCO) cycling remains a challenge in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Constructing a high&#8208;quality cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) is essential to mitigate adverse reactions at high voltages. However, conventional inorganic CEIs dominated by LiF have shown limited performance for high&#8208;voltage LCO. Here, we propose an ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) with a high donor number additive, enabling Li//LCO cells to achieve a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.7&#8197;V/4.8&#8197;V and a high&#8208;capacity retention of 86.9&#8201;%/74.2&#8201;% after 100 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. During this process, a groundbreaking phenomenon was discovered: the construction of a stable organic CEI rich in C&#8722;F bonds by the high donor number additive under high voltage. These strong polar C&#8722;F bonds exhibit excellent electrochemical inertness and film&#8208;forming properties, resulting in optimal passivation of the cathode. This organic C&#8722;F bond&#8208;dominated CEI significantly suppresses phase transitions, cobalt dissolution, and gas evolution in LCO at high voltage. Additionally, the 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;class Li//LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 and 4.95&#8197;V&#8208;class Li//LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cells also demonstrate outstanding cycling stability. Even at 60&#8201;&#176;C, the ILE&#8208;constructed organic CEI maintains superior performance. Our findings highlight the potential of organic CEI to enhance high&#8208;voltage cathode stability, paving the way for more efficient lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Screened d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization in Turing Structure of Confined Nickel for Sulfion Oxidation Accelerated Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The constructed Turing structure, composed of lamellar stacking carbon&#8208;confined nickel nanosheets, screens the direct d&#8208;p orbit coupling between TM and S2&#8722; and activates optimized p&#8208;p orbit hybridization between electron&#8208;injected carbon and S2&#8722;, enabling exceptional catalytic activity and stability for sulfion degradation and energy&#8208;efficient yet value&#8208;added H2 production.







Abstract
The sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) could offer an energy&#8208;efficient and tech&#8208;economically favorable alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for H2 production. Transition metal (TM) based catalysts have been considered promising candidates for SOR but suffer from limited activity due to the excessive bond strength from TM&#8208;S2&#8722; d&#8208;p orbit coupling. Herein, we propose a feasible strategy of screening direct d&#8208;p orbit hybridization between TM and S2&#8722; by constructing the Turing structure composed of lamellar stacking carbon&#8208;confined nickel nanosheets. The optimized p&#8208;p orbit coupling between electron&#8208;injected carbon and S2&#8722; enables exceptional catalytic activity and stability for sulfion degradation and energy&#8208;efficient yet value&#8208;added H2 production. Specifically, it achieves a current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an ultralow potential of 0.67&#8197;V vs. RHE for alkaline SOR. Theoretical calculations indicate that the electron transfer from Ni imparts metallicity and a higher p&#8208;band center to carbon shells, thereby contributing to optimized p&#8208;p orbit hybridization and a thermodynamically favorable stepwise sulfion degradation. Practically, a two&#8208;electrode flow cell achieves an industrial current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an unprecedented low voltage of 0.91&#8197;V while maintaining stability for over 300&#8197;hours, and exhibits high productivities of 3.83 and 0.32&#8197;kg h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 for sulfur and H2, respectively.

         <title>Sabatier Optimal of Mn&#8208;N4 Single Atom Catalysts for Selective Oxidative Desulfurization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new Sabatier relationship was realized by a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon catalyst with metal single atoms for regulating adsorption energies of two reactants in selective oxidative desulfurization. This relationship revealed reactivity descriptors of H2S&#8208;ODH for high performance in a wide range of O2 concentrations.







Abstract
Understanding the relationship of competitive adsorption between reactants is the prerequisite for high activity and selectivity in heterogeneous catalysis, especially the difference between the adsorption energies (Eads) of two reactive intermediates in Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood (L&#8722;H) models. Using oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S&#8208;ODH) as a probe, we develop various metal single atoms on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (M&#8208;NDC) catalysts for controlling Eads&#8208;H2S, Eads&#8208;O2 and investigating the difference in activity and selectivity. Combining theoretical and experimental results, a Sabatier relationship between the catalytic performance and Eads&#8208;O2/Eads&#8208;H2S emerges. Mn&#8208;NDC as the optimal catalyst shows excellent H2S conversion (&gt;90&#8201;%) and sulfur selectivity (&gt;90&#8201;%) in a wide range of O2 concentrations over 100&#8197;h. Such a high&#8208;efficiency performance is attributed to appropriate Eads&#8208;H2S and Eads&#8208;O2 on Mn&#8208;N4 sites, boosting redox cycle between Mn2+ and Mn3+, as well as preferential formation of sulfur. This work provides a fundamental guidance for designing Sabatier optimal catalysts in L&#8722;H models.

This work invented a new rechargeable battery chemistry: Li metal&#8208;hydrogen gas (Li&#8722;H), with a concept novelty based on two of the lightest elements, Li and H. The Li&#8722;H battery operates through redox of H2/H+ on the cathode and Li/Li+ on the anode.







Abstract
The global clean energy transition and carbon neutrality call for developing high&#8208;performance batteries. Here we report a rechargeable lithium metal &#8208; catalytic hydrogen gas (Li&#8722;H) battery utilizing two of the lightest elements, Li and H. The Li&#8722;H battery operates through redox of H2/H+ on the cathode and Li/Li+ on the anode. The universal properties of the H2 cathode enable the battery to demonstrate attractive electrochemical performance, including high theoretical specific energy up to 2825&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, discharge voltage of 3&#8197;V, round&#8208;trip efficiency of 99.7&#8201;%, reversible areal capacity of 5&#8211;20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, all&#8208;climate characteristics with a wide operational temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C, and high utilization of active materials. A rechargeable anode&#8208;free Li&#8722;H battery is further constructed by plating Li metal from cost&#8208;effective lithium salts under a low catalyst loading of &lt;0.1&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work presents a route to design batteries based on catalytic hydrogen gas cathode for high&#8208;performance energy storage applications.

The universal properties of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode enable the battery to demonstrate attractive electrochemical performance, including high theoretical specific energy up to 2825&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, discharge voltage of 3&#8197;V, round-trip efficiency of 99.7&#8201;%, reversible areal capacity of 5&#8211;20&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, all-climate characteristics with a wide operational temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C, and high utilization of active materials. A rechargeable anode-free Li&#8722;H battery is further constructed by plating Li metal from cost-effective lithium salts under a low catalyst loading of &amp;lt;0.1&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work presents a route to design batteries based on catalytic hydrogen gas cathode for high-performance energy storage applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aeration&#8208;Free Photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction Mediated by Heterojunction Photocatalyst toward Efficient Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;vacancy VO&#8722;M&#8722;Co3O4@CNx S&#8208;Scheme heterostructure with optimized defect concentration was successfully constructed, displaying excellent PMS activation ability synergized with photoexcitation for degrading organic pollutants without aeration. Emphasizing the competitive interaction between O2 and PMS within the catalyst is pivotal for controlling the synergistic photoexcitation of PMS for the first time.







Abstract
The regulation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation by photo&#8208;assisted heterogeneous catalysis is under in&#8208;depth investigation with potential as a replaceable advanced oxidation process in water purification, yet it remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to construct polyethylene glycol (PEG) well&#8208;coupled dual&#8208;defect VO&#8722;M&#8211;Co3O4@CNx S&#8208;scheme heterojunction to degrade organic pollutants without aeration, which dramatically provides abundant active sites, excellent photo&#8208;thermal property, and distinct charge transport pathway for PMS activation. The degradation rate of VO&#8722;M&#8722;Co3O4@CNx in anaerobic conditions shows a higher efficient rate (4.58&#8197;min&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;2) than in aerobic conditions (1.67&#8197;min&#8722;1 g&#8722;2). Experimental evidence reveals that VO&#8722;M&#8722;Co3O4@CNx promotes more rapid redox conversion of photoexcited electrons induced by defects with PMS under anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic conditions. Additionally, in situ experiments and DFT provide mechanistic insights into the regulation pathway of PMS activation via synergistic defect&#8208;induced electron, revealing the competitive effect between O2 and PMS over VO&#8722;M&#8722;Co3O4@CNx during the reaction process. The continuous flow reactor and flow cytometry results demonstrated that the VO&#8722;M&#8722;Co3O4@CNx/PMS/Vis system has remarkably enhanced stability and purification capability for removing organic pollutants. This work provides valuable insights into regulating the heterologous catalysis oxidation process without aeration through the photoexcitation synergistic PMS activation.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Trifluoromethyl&#8208;Methionine Incorporation into Cyclophilin A by Cell&#8208;Free Synthesis for 19F NMR Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;complete incorporation of trifluoromethyl methionine (tfmM) into Cyclophilin A (CypA) was achieved by cell&#8208;free synthesis, preserving its substrate binding affinity and enzymatic activity. Availability of the highly responsive and sensitive tfmM probe paves the way for studying protein&#8208;protein/ligand interactions and protein dynamics by 19F NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;19 NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for studying protein structure, dynamics, and interactions. Of particular interest is the exploitation of trifluoromethyl (tfm) groups, given their high sensitivity and superior transverse relaxation properties, compared to single fluorine atoms. However, biosynthetic incorporation of tfm&#8208;bearing amino acids remains challenging due to cytotoxicity and incompatibility with natural tRNA synthetases. Here, we report on overcoming this challenge using cell&#8208;free synthesis, incorporating trifluoromethyl&#8208;methionine (tfmM) into the protein Cyclophilin A (CypA) with remarkably high efficiency, impossible via biosynthetic means. Importantly, we demonstrate that tfmM CypA binds a native substrate, the N&#8208;terminal domain of HIV&#8208;1 capsid protein (HIV&#8208;1 CA&#8208;NTD), and retains peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity. It also binds the peptide inhibitor Cyclosporine A (CsA) with the same affinity as non&#8208;labeled, wild&#8208;type CypA. Furthermore, we show that 19F isotope shifts and 19F solvent paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) provide valuable structural information on surface exposure. Taken together, our study illustrates that tfmM can be readily incorporated into proteins at very high levels by cell&#8208;free synthesis without disturbing protein structure and function, significantly expanding the scope of 19F NMR spectroscopy for studying protein structure and dynamics.

         <title>Sb&#8208;to&#8208;P Metathesis: A Direct Route to Structurally Constrained, Cationic PIII Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structurally constrained, cationic PIII compound with the OCO dianionic pincer&#8208;type ligand [LP][SbCl4] was prepared in a single step via the Sb&#8208;to&#8208;P metathesis reaction of the LSb&#8208;Cl with PCl3. The preliminary reactivity of [LP][SbCl4] with water, ammonia, and amines showed that the [SbCl4]&#8722; is not innocent in these reactions. Changing the [SbCl4]&#8722; to [Cb]&#8722; anion, rerouted the reactivity of the resulting [LP][Cb] with water, alcohols, ammonia, and amines to the [LP]+ cation only. In the case of PhOH and PhNH2 activation, the reactions were found to be thermoneutral.







Abstract
Structurally constrained, cationic PIII compound [LP][SbCl4] with an OCO pincer&#8208;type ligand (L) having a central carbene donor was directly synthesized via an Sb&#8208;to&#8208;P metathesis reaction between PCl3 and LSb&#8208;Cl. [LP][SbCl4] was isolated and its reactivity with small molecules (ROH and RNH2) was studied, showing that [SbCl4]&#8722; is not an innocent counter anion, but an active participant in these reactions. When the [SbCl4]&#8722; was replaced with the [CB11H12]&#8722; ([Cb]&#8722;) anion, the reactions were redirected to [LP]+ cation only. The reactions with alcohols and amines led to the equilibrium between the products of the formal E&#8722;H (E=O, N) bond oxidative addition to the P&#8208;center and products of the P&#8208;center/ligand&#8208;assisted bond activation. Remarkably, [LP]+ activated the PhO&#8722;H and PhN(H)&#8722;H bonds in a reversible, thermoneutral fashion.

         <title>Towards the Use of Low&#8208;Concentration CO2 Sources by Direct Selective Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>

High active catalysts and buffered electrolytes are suggested as a prerequisite to performing CO2 reduction at low CO2 concentrations of 2&#8201;%. The suggested strategy not only enables high CO production and favorable CO2RR metrics but also contributes to decarbonization.







Abstract
The direct CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) from simulated flue gas of various CO2 concentrations could minimize extra energy for pre&#8208;concentration processes to highly concentrated CO2 as a feedstock. We investigate the challenges for CO2RR caused by low CO2 concentrations and provide strategies concerning the impact of the chosen electrocatalyst material and the selection of the electrolyte to attain high CO selectivity. We continuously feed CO2 mixed with N2 (the typical dilutant in flue gas) in various ratios to gas diffusion electrodes in a model flow&#8208;through electrolyzer. Operating the CO2RR at lower CO2 concentrations results in an overpotential shift to more cathodic values. We show that higher active catalysts can maintain high CO selectivity down to 5&#8201;% CO2 by using NiCu&#8208;based catalysts. NiCu reached its limit when the CO2 concentration was lowered to 2&#8201;%, due to low CO2 availability and competition of carbonate formation. Employing near&#8208;neutral electrolytes with buffering capacity, we maintained high Faradaic efficiency at low overpotentials and higher CO2 utilization at low CO2 concentration.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly Enhanced Linear and Nonlinear Chiroptical Properties of Chiral Manganese Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chiral self&#8208;assembly strategy has been demonstrated to effectively boost the linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic manganese halides. Ultimately, a near&#8208;unity green light emission is achieved. These chiral samples not only feature intense circularly polarized luminescence (glum~4.2&#215;10&#8722;2), but also showcase a strengthened capability to discriminate circularly polarized laser (gSHG&#8208;CD~1.8) that ranks among the highest reported values.







Abstract
Chiral hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides (HOMHs) hold great promise in broad applications ranging from ferroelectrics, spintronics to nonlinear optics, owing to their broken inversion symmetry and tunable chiroptoelectronic properties. Typically, chiral HOMHs are constructed by chiral organic cations and metal anion polyhedra, with the latter regarded as optoelectronic active units. However, the primary design approaches are largely constrained to regulation of general components within structural formula. Herein, supramolecular approaches have been taken for the functionalization of chiral enantiomers by anchoring chiral cations with crown ether hosting molecules. Chiral HOMHs of R&#8208;/S&#8208;(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6@ClMBA)2MnBr4 have been thus obtained with boosted linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties. The self&#8208;assembled cations lead to enhanced structural rigidity, which promote near&#8208;unity green light emission and strong circularly polarized luminescence with a high asymmetry factor, along with high efficiency second&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses. In particular, these chiral HOMH single crystals demonstrate a sensitive discrimination for circularly polarized laser in the near&#8208;infrared region with the nonlinear optical asymmetry factor (gSHG&#8208;CD) as high as 1.8. This work highlights the contribution of supramolecular assembly in improving chiroptical performances, offering valuable insights for the design of new chiral HOMH materials with promising application potentials as linear and nonlinear CPL emitters and detectors.

         <title>Toward Rhenium&#8208;Based Circularly Polarized OLEDs Using Tailored Chiral Re(CO)3 Emitters</title>

         <dc:description>
Chiral Re(I) emitters exhibiting strong circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with enhanced dissymmetry factors and PLQYs are tailored and exploited to develop the the first examples of rhenium&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs. The latter exhibit gEL factors of up to 6.2&#215;10&#8722;3 along with a good device performance. This work highlights potential of chiral Re(I) emitters for CP&#8208;OLED applications, and provides a new shortcut to CPP&#8208;active emitters.







Abstract
Chiral rhenium(I) emitters exhibiting circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) are an attractive mainstay for CP organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). However, the efficiency of such emitters is not ideal, and they have never been explored for circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) applications. Here, we have tailored robust chiral Re(I) complexes with improved CPP properties, and demonstrated CPEL from rhenium emitters for the first time. Two pairs of enantiomeric Re(I) complexes have been synthesized by introducing of one or two chiral menthol groups into 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline unit (phen) of archetypical emitters [ReBr(CO)3(phen)]. The designed complexes exhibit a yellow CPP with enhanced |glum| factors (up to 2.5&#215;10&#8722;2) and a good quantum efficiency. The pioneering Re(I)&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs (based on the obtained emitters) exhibit yellow CPEL with |gEL| factors of up to 6.2&#215;10&#8722;3 and a maximal external quantum efficiency of 13.2&#8201;%. This work highlights the good potential of chiral Re(I) emitters for CPEL applications, and opens up a new shortcut to CPP&#8208;active Re(I) complexes.

         <title>Ce3+/Ce4+ Ion Redox Shuttle Stabilized Cu&#948;+ for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a simple solvothermal strategy to obtain Ce/CuOx catalyst for the CO2 conversion to multi&#8208;carbon products, which exhibits high C2 selectivity (at &#8722;1.2&#8197;V vs. RHE, 40&#8201;% for C2H4, 6&#8201;% for CH3COOH and 14&#8201;% for CH3CH2OH) and durability over 25&#8197;h. The excellent performance of Ce/CuOx may be attributed to the following factors: 1)&#8197;The dispersed Ce stabilizes Cu&#948;+ species under the reduction condition. 2)&#8197;The presence of Cu&#948;+ reduces the free energy of forming *COCO intermediate and decreases the energy barrier of the C&#8722;C coupling reaction, resulting in the high activity and selectivity of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4.







Abstract
The CO2 electroreduction reaction has advantages in clean and pollution&#8208;free carbon conversion, but it still faces challenges in carbon utilization efficiency and improving the selectivity of C2 products. Although the dynamic Cu&#948;+ state is known to favor the C&#8722;C coupling process, the suitable Cu&#948;+ species for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 are difficult to maintain under the conditions of strong reduction and large current. Herein, we propose a Ce doping strategy to stabilize the Cu&#948;+ state (Ce/CuOx) during the CO2RR process, which enables a high Faradaic efficiency of 60&#8201;% for multi&#8208;carbon products (40&#8201;% for C2H4, 14&#8201;% for CH3CH2OH, and 6&#8201;% for CH3COOH), and 25&#8197;h stability at &#8722;1.2&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. In&#8197;situ infrared spectroscopy, in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu&#948;+ is stabilized by the redox ion pairs of Ce, which reduces the energy barrier of *CO coupling, and improves the Faraday efficiency of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction of C2H4. This work provides a new idea to make full use of lanthanide variable value metals for advanced catalysis and clean energy conversion.

&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate a simple solvothermal strategy to obtain Ce/CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to multi-carbon products, which exhibits high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity (at &#8722;1.2&#8197;V vs. RHE, 40&#8201;% for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 6&#8201;% for CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH and 14&#8201;% for CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH) and durability over 25&#8197;h. The excellent performance of Ce/CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; may be attributed to the following factors: 1)&#8197;The dispersed Ce stabilizes Cu&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; species under the reduction condition. 2)&#8197;The presence of Cu&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; reduces the free energy of forming *COCO intermediate and decreases the energy barrier of the C&#8722;C coupling reaction, resulting in the high activity and selectivity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Piezoelectric Covalent Triazine&#8208;based Nanotube for Hydrogen Peroxide Production from Water and Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fully conjugated covalent triazine&#8208;based hollow nanotube (CTN&#8208;1) with rich active sites and high surface areas has been prepared for piezocatalytic H2O2 evolution. Benefiting from piezoelectric response and fully conjugated framework, CTN&#8208;1 facilitated piezoelectric carrier separation, leading to highly efficient H2O2 production with a rate of 4115&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is superior to other piezoelectric materials.







Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are nanoscale tubular materials with superior mechanical strength and electronic properties. However, the conventional CNTs are inherently non&#8208;piezoelectric, mainly due to the lack of polar structures with pure carbon elements. The direct synthesis of fully conjugated and polarized organic nanotubes with desired piezoelectric properties remains a challenge. Herein, we report the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of a new type of covalent triazine&#8208;based nanotube (CTN&#8208;1) as a novel piezoelectric material. The CTN&#8208;1 comprises of high surface area, nitrogen&#8208;rich and fully conjugated structure, which provides a series of merits for piezoelectric catalytic processes. These structural features combined with one&#8208;dimensional tubular morphology endow CTN&#8208;1 with excellent mechanical stimuli response and thus displaying prominent piezoelectric properties via pronounced nanocurvature effect. We further show that the CTN&#8208;1 enables the efficient synthesis of H2O2 from water in the air via mechanical energy conversion, with an excellent piezocatalytic H2O2 evolution rate of 4115&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which exceeds other reported piezoelectric materials. The piezocatalysis by the CTN&#8208;1 can be practically integrated into a self&#8208;Fenton system, which exhibits excellent pollutant degradation capability. This work demonstrates the enormous potential of a new type of piezoelectric synthetic nanotube from organic frameworks for the in situ synthesis valuable chemicals.

         <title>Reversible and Ultrasensitive Detection of Nitric Oxide Using a Conductive Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8211;organic framework, copper3(hexaiminobenzene)2 (Cu3(HIB)2), has been obtained through strategic synthetic modification. The Cu3(HIB)2 device shows ultrasensitive, highly selective, reversible, and low&#8208;power chemiresistive sensor for nitric oxide. Mechanistic investigation reveals the contribution of Cu&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid) functionality of Cu3(HIB)2) for highly sensitive and reversible NO binding sites.







Abstract
This paper describes the use of a highly crystalline conductive 2D copper3(hexaiminobenzene)2 (Cu3(HIB)2) as an ultrasensitive (limit of detection of 1.8 part&#8208;per&#8208;billion), highly selective, reversible, and low power chemiresistive sensor for nitric oxide (NO) at room temperature. The Cu3(HIB)2&#8208;based sensors retain their sensing performance in the presence of humidity, and exhibit strong signal enhancement towards NO over other highly toxic reactive gases, such as NO2, H2S, SO2, NH3, CO, as well as CO2. Mechanistic investigations of the Cu3(HIB)2&#8208;NO interaction through spectroscopic analyses and density functional theory revealed that the Cu&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid) moieties serve as the binding sites for NO sensing, while the Ni&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid) MOF analog shows no noticeable response to NO. Overall, these findings provide a significant advance in the development of crystalline metal&#8208;bis(iminobenzosemiquinoid)&#8208;based conductive 2D MOFs as highly sensitive, selective, and reversible sensing materials for the low&#8208;power detection of toxic gases.

         <title>Skeletal Rearrangement of Azo Compounds Enables Low&#8208;Potential, High&#8208;capacity Organic Anodes for Rechargeable Alkaline Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skeletal rearrangement strategy is used to optimize the planarity and aromaticity of conventional azo compounds. Benefitted from the fused&#8208;ring structure and inherent basicity, the novel azo compounds exhibit low potential, intrinsic insolubility, and high capacity, serving as promising anode materials for rechargeable alkaline batteries.







Abstract
The widespread adoption of rechargeable alkaline batteries is plagued by the performance&#8208;limiting metal anodes, which are prone to (electro)chemical corrosion and raise environmental or economic concerns. Organic redox&#8208;active materials offer a potential solution, but they typically struggle with dissolution&#8208;induced degradation and insufficiently negative reduction potentials. Herein, we introduce benzo[c]cinnoline and its derivatives (collectively referred to as BCCs), a class of aromatic azo compounds with fused&#8208;ring structure, as promising organic anode materials. BCCs exhibit pronounced aromaticity and Br&#248;nsted basicity, conferring low reduction potentials and intrinsic insolubility in alkaline solutions. Paired with the industrially established nickel hydroxide cathode, these batteries deliver excellent capacity (297&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1anode), high output voltage of 1.3&#8197;V, and extended cycle life (&#8776;16000 cycles). Notably, they also operate efficiently at extremely low temperatures down to &#8722;85&#8201;&#176;C with an 8&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. We further explore the feasibility for all&#8208;organic alkaline batteries by paring BCCs with the dihydro form of 4,4&#8217;&#8208;azopyridine, utilizing azo compounds for both anode and cathodes. This chemistry harnesses the unique properties of small organic molecules to enable all&#8208;organic batteries with high capacity of 236&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8211;1, fast charging at 1200&#8197;C, and easy recyclability.

         <title>Vacuum&#8208;Assisted Confined Growth of MOF@COF Composite Membranes with Enhanced Hydrogen Permselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confined growth of MOF into COF pores to prepare MOF@COF composite not only reduces the pore size of the COF membrane, but also forms a well&#8208;defined 1D nanoscale transport channel for gas permeation, thus significantly enhancing the molecular sieving property of the COF membrane for hydrogen separation. This synthesis strategy has been demonstrated with the formation of highly hydrogen permselective ZIF&#8208;8@TB&#8208;COF and ZIF&#8208;67@TB&#8208;COF membranes.







Abstract
With ordered and periodic network structures, adjustable pore sizes and high chemical stability, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have drawn much attention for the fabrication of superior separation membranes. However, it is challenging to prepare COF membranes with a molecular sieving property for gas separation due to their relatively large pore size. In this work, we develop the MOF&#8208;in&#8208;COF concept for vacuum&#8208;assisted synthesis of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) ZIF&#8208;8 inside the pores of TB&#8208;COF formed from trihydroxy&#8208;benzene&#8208;tricarbaldehyde (T) and diamino&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;disulfonic acid (B), thus constructing a novel ZIF&#8208;8@TB&#8208;COF membrane. Attributing to the formation of a well&#8208;defined one&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanoscale transport channel, the ZIF&#8208;8@TB&#8208;COF membrane displays a high hydrogen permselectivity. At 100&#8201;&#176;C and 200&#8197;kPa, the mixture separation factors of H2/CO2, H2/CH4 and H2/C3H8 are 21.9, 63.1 and 134.4, respectively, which are much higher than those of the pristine TB&#8208;COF membrane due to the precise size sieving channels brought about by the incorporated MOF. The synthesis of ZIF&#8208;67@TB&#8208;COF membrane demonstrates the versatility of the synthesis strategy.

         <title>Single Solid&#8208;State Emissive Carbon Quantum Dots for Multicolor, Bright and Efficient Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and universal strategy for producing efficient solid&#8208;state emissive carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with a distinctive non&#8208;planar spatial structure and significant steric hindrance has been developed. Using this new type of single solid&#8208;state emissive CQDs, bright, multicolor electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with tunable emission peaks ranging from 535 to 640&#8197;nm have been successfully fabricated.







Abstract
Color&#8208;tunable electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on quantum dots (QDs) are rapidly emerging as a key technology for next&#8208;generation full&#8208;color displays and solid&#8208;state lighting. However, achieving broad color tunability in LEDs that utilize a single QD emissive material continues to pose significant challenges. Here, we present the first example of bright, multicolor electroluminescent LEDs with tunable emission peaks spanning from 535 to 640&#8197;nm, utilizing a new type of single red solid&#8208;state emissive carbon quantum dots (R&#8208;SSCQDs). Unlike conventional CQDs, which often exhibit weak or negligible emission in solid&#8208;state form, R&#8208;SSCQDs demonstrate bright red emission in solid state and green emission in diluted state. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the unique non&#8208;planar spatial structure and significant steric hindrance of R&#8208;SSCQDs effectively suppress &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, resulting in efficient solid&#8208;state fluorescence emission. By adjusting the weight ratios of R&#8208;SSCQDs doped in host materials, we showcase bright, efficient and multicolor CQD&#8208;based LEDs that emit green, yellow, orange, and red light, achieving a record&#8208;high luminance of 15,834&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and current efficiency of 10.3&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1. This work presents a straightforward and universal strategy for creating efficient solid&#8208;state emissive CQDs, showcasing significant potential for color&#8208;tunable LED applications.

         <title>Two&#8208;Electron Oxidative Atom and Group Transfer Reactions at a Well&#8208;Defined Uranium(II) Center</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of two&#8208;electron oxidative atom and group transfers were accomplished at a well&#8208;defined uranium(II) center. This strategy provides a convenient entry to access a variety of uranium(IV)&#8722;element multiple bonds. Moreover, these results highlight the unique ability of the tris(amido)arene ligand framework in stabilizing reactive intermediates and unusual structural motifs for metal complexes.







Abstract
The multi&#8208;electron redox chemistry of uranium(II) compounds remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report a series of two&#8208;electron oxidative atom and group transfer reactions at a well&#8208;defined uranium(II) center. The reactions of uranium(II) complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)U] (M=K(2,2,2&#8208;cryptand) and K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)(THF)) with pyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxide or nitrosobenzene, elemental sulfur/selenium or triphenylphosphine sulfide/selenide, and ditellurium salt led to the isolation of uranium(IV) terminal oxo and chalcogenido complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)UX] (X=O, S, Se, Te). In addition, the reactions of [M][(AdTPBN3)U] with aryl azides ArN3 or diazoalkanes R2CN2 quantitatively yielded uranium(IV) terminal imido [M][(AdTPBN3)UNAr] or hydrazonido(2&#8722;) complexes [M][(AdTPBN3)UN2CR2], respectively. Notably, the low&#8208;temperature reaction between [M][(AdTPBN3)U] and mesityl azide allowed the isolation of the first uranium(IV) aryldiazenylimido complex as an intermediate. These uranium(IV)&#8722;element multiply bound compounds were fully characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, 1H NMR spectroscopy, absorption spectroscopy, solution and solid&#8208;state magnetometry, and elemental analysis. The controlled two&#8208;electron oxidative reactions at a uranium(II) center not only expand the redox reactivity of uranium(II) but also offer a convenient new route to access uranium&#8722;element multiply bound compounds.

         <title>Stabilizing SPAN in Non&#8208;Flammable Acetonitrile Electrolytes for Long&#8208;Life Graphite||SPAN Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we proposed a nonflammable acetonitrile (AN)&#8208;based electrolyte for safe SPAN batteries for the first time. We first identified the irreversible cleavage of C&#8722;S bonds of SPAN as the main reason for the failure of SPAN in conventional AN electrolyte. We further demonstrated fluoroethylene carbonate additive could avoid the structure deterioration of SPAN in conventional AN electrolyte by inhibiting the cleavage of C&#8722;S bonds, suppressing the transformation from SPAN to elemental sulfur, and forming uniform solid electrolyte interface on the surface of SPAN. With the newly&#8208;formulated electrolyte, excellent cycling stability and high safety are obtained in both Li||SPAN and Gr||SPAN cells. The present exploitation broadens the electrolyte choices for SPAN cathodes and promises the practical applications of SPAN batteries.







Abstract
Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) presents an opportunity to replace elemental sulfur as a &#8220;shuttle&#8208;free&#8221; cathode for secondary Li&#8722;S batteries, which can be an ideal choice for stationary energy storage due to its abundance, low cost, and sustainability. The electrolyte options for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SPAN batteries have been limited to the flammable carbonate and ether ones, which raises safety concerns. Here, we explored the use of a non&#8208;flammable acetonitrile (AN) electrolyte for SPAN battery for the first time and identified the irreversible cleavage of C&#8722;S bonds of SPAN as the main reason for the failure of SPAN in AN electrolyte. Fortunately, by introducing 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% fluoroethylene carbonate into the AN electrolyte, the bond cleavage in SPAN is suppressed and a stable cathode electrolyte interface is formed, both contributing to stabilizing the structure of SPAN during electrochemical process. Consequently, we achieved a stable cycling for 900&#8197;cycles in Li||SPAN cells. Moreover, by pairing with a pre&#8208;lithiated graphite (pGr) anode, the newly formulated electrolyte enables extended cycle life for 1500&#8197;cycles with a capacity retention of 91&#8201;% and superb safety in pGr||SPAN full cell. The present exploitation broadens the electrolyte choices of SPAN&#8208;based batteries and paves the way for future applications for these batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly and Biological Properties of Highly Fluorinated Oligonucleotide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and cost&#8208;effective strategy for developing highly fluorinated DNA amphiphiles functionalized with one or more branched, highly fluorinated residues. Fluorination is used as a tool to drive nucleic acid self&#8208;assembly and fine&#8208;tune the interactions of the resulting spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) with proteins, as well as their gene&#8208;silencing properties. This allows the development of fluorinated SNAs as efficient delivery vehicles for therapeutic nucleic acids.







Abstract
Nucleic acids, used as therapeutics to silence disease&#8208;related genes, offer significant advantages over small molecule drugs: they provide high specificity, the ability to target &#8220;undruggable&#8221; molecules, and adaptability to a wide range of disease phenotypes. However, their instability in biological media, as well their rapid clearance from the organism limit their applicability, necessitating the use of nanocarriers to overcome these challenges. Among these strategies, spherical nucleic acids (SNA)&#8212;composed of a densely packed corona of oligonucleotides around a nanoparticle&#8212;have emerged as a powerful tool, in particular when self&#8208;assembled from DNA amphiphiles. This non&#8208;covalent strategy however has caveats, especially when it comes to stability in complex biological media, where these SNAs disassemble in contact to serum proteins. Here, we developed highly fluorinated DNA amphiphiles that readily self&#8208;assemble into SNAs and have tunable stability profiles in biological media. They are made of branched fluorinated moieties with potentially improved biodegradability as compared to their linear counterparts. Depending on the number of fluorophilic interactions, the self&#8208;assembled SNAs can have excellent serum stabilities&#8212;up to days&#8212;and readily deliver nucleic acid therapeutics for gene silencing applications. These systems show great potential as promising candidates for nucleic acid&#8208;based therapies.

         <title>Hydrogen Radical Enabling Industrial&#8208;Level Oxygen Electroreduction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enhanced two&#8208;electron ORR performance was achieved by a rationally designed system incorporating cobalt (II) clusters onto oxidized carbon nanotube composites. This enhancement is attributed to the cooperative dual&#8208;active sites and high local proton availability, and enables effective conversion of ethylene glycol to oxalic acid by coupling with an electro&#8208;Fenton process.







Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from oxygen and water, powered by renewable electricity, provides a highly attractive alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive autoxidation process presently used in industry, but much remains unknown about this two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;ORR), especially the local proton effect. Here, we have investigated the function of hydrogen&#8208;associated intermediates in the 2e&#8208;ORR using a rationally designed cooperative electrode material with cobalt (II) clusters embedded onto the oxidized carbon nanotube composites (Co&#8208;OCNT). We found that the local proton availability can determine both the reaction kinetics and selectivity. A 2e&#8208;ORR process involving hydrogen radical transfer is confirmed. Specifically, the carbon sites from the OCNTs promote proton production, and the cobalt sites from the Co cluster facilitate ORR intermediate formation. The high local proton availability and the cooperative dual&#8208;active sites both contribute to the superior reaction kinetics and selectivity of the Co&#8208;OCNT, reaching an H2O2 production rate of ~40.6&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a faradaic efficiency of 90&#8201;% at a current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Further cascading the 2e&#8208;ORR with the electro&#8208;Fenton process shows a high selectivity of oxalic acid up to 97&#8201;% for the valorization of ethylene glycol.

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared to Blue Photon Upconversion by Ultrafast Spin Flip and Triplet Energy Transfer at Organic/2D Semiconductor Interface</title>

A 2D organic/inorganic bilayer heterostructure with atomically thin monolayer semiconductor and 9,10&#8208;bis((triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl)anthracene exhibits efficient and low threshold NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue light upconversion, dirven by ultrafast spin flip, interfacial exciton transfer and triplet&#8208;triple annihilation. This work demonstrates 2D monolayers as superior sensitizers for photon upconversion and reveals the fundamental photoexcitation dynamics.







Abstract
Solid state photon upconversion by triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA), particularly near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion, holds instant promise for enhancing optoelectronic and photochemical applications. Despite extensive studies, NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion has remained particularly challenging and elusive due to inherent multiple energy&#8208;downhill processes in TTA upconversion. In this study, using atomically thin two dimensional (2D) monolayer semiconductor as a triplet sensitizer, we demonstrate an efficient and robust solid&#8208;state NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion system. The ultrathin and flexible organic/2D bilayer heterostructure exhibits a NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue upconversion with high quantum yield (&#934;UC=1.2&#8201;%, out of 50&#8201;%), low threshold power density (Ith=110&#8197;mW/cm2) and a record&#8208;high apparent anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 1.12&#8197;eV. Further spin&#8208; and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast (&lt;500&#8197;fs) electron spin flip to triplet&#8208;like excitons in semiconductor sensitizer and subsequent picosecond (~6&#215;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1) interfacial Dexter energy transfer to annihilator molecules. The triplet energy transfer rate and efficiency depend strongly on driving force, exhibiting Marcus normal region behavior. This work demonstrates 2D monolayer semiconductor as a superior ultrathin light harvesting and triplet sensitization layer and reveals the key knob to overcome the compromise between upconversion efficiency and energy loss, offering a viable pathway to efficient solid state NIR&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion and implementation.

         <title>Unusual Endotaxy Growth of Hexagonal Nanosheets by the Self&#8208;Assembly of a Homopolymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented in this study is an unusual endotaxy growth manner of a crystalline azobenzene containing homopolymer (PAzoPMA) to form hexagonal nanosheets. The amphiphilic PAzoPMA is first annealed in isopropanol to form a hexagonal nut&#8208;like structure. Then, the PAzoPMA crystallizes from the inner wall to the center to form a thin bottom, which grows upwards along the bottom, leading to the formation of the evenly hexagonal nanosheets.







Abstract
A classical crystallization usually grows epitaxially from a crystal nucleus. Presented in this study is an unusual endotaxy growth manner of a crystalline homopolymer to form hexagonal nanosheets. The amphiphilic homopolymer, poly(3&#8208;(4&#8208;(phenyldiazenyl)phenoxy)propyl methacrylate) (PAzoPMA), is first annealed in isopropanol to afford a hexagonal nut&#8208;like structure. Then, the PAzoPMA crystallizes from the inner wall to the center to form a thin bottom, which grows upwards along the bottom, leading to the formation of the evenly hexagonal nanosheets. The energy fluctuation by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation during self&#8208;assembly confirms the packing state of PAzoPMA chains in different solvents. In isopropanol, the total energy is the lowest, demonstrating the tight regular arrangement of polymer chains. In addition, the non&#8208;bonding interaction energy is also the lowest, leading to the favorable contact with solvent molecules and the formation of hexagonal nanosheets. Otherwise, nanowires and giant large compound micelles are formed in ethanol and n&#8208;butanol, respectively. Overall, an unusual endotaxy crystallization manner of an amphiphilic homopolymer is observed during the preparation of hexagonal nanosheets, which brings fresh insight for understanding the crystallization behavior of polymers and preparing functional soft nanomaterials.

         <title>Regularly Arranged Heterogeneous Pores in Gas Separation Membranes Constructed by Cocrystallization of Porous Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we adopted the cocrystallization strategy for fabricating heterogeneous pore membranes from a series of [4+6] imine cage pairs, which vary in cavity sizes and include cages with fluorescence properties. The co&#8208;crystal membranes, featuring alternating small pore&#8208;large pore structure, exhibited good H2/CO2 gas separation performance by overcoming the selectivity&#8208;permeability trade&#8208;off.







Abstract
Integrating two or more materials to construct membranes with heterogeneous pore structures is an effective strategy for enhancing separation performance. Regularly arranging these heterogeneous pores can significantly optimize the combined effect of the introduced components. Porous Organic Cages (POCs), an emerging subclass of porous materials composed of discrete molecules, assemble to form interconnected pores and exhibit permanent porosity in the solid state. A unique feature of POCs is their modularity, enabling a &#8220;mix and match&#8221; approach to create co&#8208;crystal structures driven by the intermolecular interactions. Herein, we adopted the cocrystallization strategy for fabricating gas separation membranes. We prepared membranes from a series of [4+6] imine cage pairs, which vary in cavity sizes and include cages with fluorescence properties. By optimizing the cocrystalization conditions, we successfully fabricated continuous, defect&#8208;free gas membranes, benefiting from chiral recognition interactions. By introducing regularly alternating small and large pores, we addressed challenges such as the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity in gas separation membrane. Moreover, the cocrystallization strategy has been proven effective for other molecular systems besides POCs, such as macrocycles, for the preparation of co&#8208;crystal membranes. This method broadens the scope for fabricating high&#8208;performance gas separation membranes with ordered heterogeneous pores.

         <title>Hollow Pt&#8208;Encrusted RuCu Nanocages Optimizing OH Adsorption for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow nanocages with Pt epitaxy grown on RuCu have been successfully synthesized as efficient electrocatalysts via a galvanic replacement strategy, exploiting the distinct electrochemical potentials of Pt, Ru, and Cu. The optimized Pt8.7&#8208;RuCu NCs/C catalysts not only exhibite exceptional HOR performance, but achieve a significantly higher specific peak power density (15.9&#8197;W&#8201;mgPt+Ru&#8722;1) under fuel cell conditions, making them a promising high&#8208;efficiency anode nanocatalyst for practical AEMFC applications.







Abstract
As one of the best candidates for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), ruthenium (Ru) has attracted significant attention for anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), although it suffers from sluggish kinetics under alkaline conditions due to its strong hydroxide affinity. In this work, we develop ternary hollow nanocages with Pt epitaxy on RuCu (Pt&#8208;RuCu NCs) as efficient HOR catalysts for application in AEMFCs. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that the synergy in optimized Pt8.7&#8208;RuCu NCs significantly modifies the electronic structure and coordination environment of Ru, thereby balancing the binding strengths of H* and OH* species, which leads to a markedly enhanced HOR performance. Specifically, the optimized Pt8.7&#8208;RuCu NCs/C achieves a mass activity of 5.91&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt+Ru&#8722;1, which is ~3.3, ~2.2, and ~15.0 times higher than that of RuCu NCs/C (1.38&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1), PtRu/C (1.83&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt+Ru&#8722;1) and Pt/C (0.37&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1), respectively. Impressively, the specific peak power density of fuel cells reaches 15.9&#8197;W mgPt+Ru&#8722;1, significantly higher than those of most reported PtRu&#8208;based fuel cells.

         <title>Alkene Epoxidation with Water by Confined Active Co Sites on BiVO4 Photoanodes under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin cobalt molecule with a closed Co site was loaded onto a BiVO4 photoanode to drive the epoxidation of olefins. The selectivity and conversion of the product exceeded the results of other photoanode studies. It can also be synthesized on a gram scale at room temperature. Multiple characterizations confirm that the Co species reacts with H2O to form Co&#8722;O* intermediates, thereby facilitating the epoxidation reaction via a one&#8208;electron process.







Abstract
Heterogeneous photoelectrocatalysis systems have recently seen significant growth in organic transformations, but are limited by the inherent physicochemical properties of electrode materials. To enhance selectivity in these processes, we propose an innovative advancement in the rational design of photoanodes. Specifically, we incorporated cobalt porphyrin co&#8208;catalysts with confined Co sites onto bismuth vanadate films as a photoanode. This photoanode significantly enhances the efficacy of styrene epoxidation, achieving selectivity and conversion rates of 90&#8201;% and 99&#8201;%, respectively. Notably, the reaction utilizes water as the sole oxygen source, operates at room temperature, and is easily scalable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis. The developed photoanode demonstrates robust performance across various alkene substrates. Operando characterizations reveal that during the epoxidation reaction, the confined Co sites within the porphyrin structure catalyze the oxidation of H2O to form Co&#8722;O*, serving as critical intermediates that facilitate cyclization reactions via one&#8208;electron processes. This study introduces an innovative heterogeneous photoelectrocatalysis strategy with customizable active sites tailored for selective catalytic organic transformations.

         <title>Masked Divalent Reactivity of Heterobimetallic Lanthanide Isocarbonyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a mildly reducing organo&#8208;iron ligand allows trivalent yttrium and dysprosium to react as though they were present in their less common divalent oxidation state. This masked divalent reactivity is used to reduce a series of N&#8208;heterocycles, resulting in the formation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208; or trimetallic lanthanide complexes of the reduced ligands.







Abstract
A new rare&#8208;earth reduction system is described in which trivalent yttrium and dysprosium react as though present in their unstable divalent oxidation state. This masked divalent reactivity is achieved using the isocarbonyl&#8208;bridged dimers [(

The reactivity of 1Y and 1Dy is showcased by reducing the N&#8208;heterocycles 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl (bipy), phenazine (phnz) and hexaazatrinaphthylene (HAN) to give corresponding mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri&#8208;metallic rare&#8208;earth complexes, respectively, with the heterocyclic ligands present in their singly, doubly and triply reduced forms, respectively.

         <title>Dynamic Co&#8208;Clustering and Self&#8208;Sorting in Interactive Protocell Populations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temporal control over co&#8208;clustering and self&#8208;sorting in binary populations of hairy protocells comprising chitosan (red)&#8208; or alginate (green)&#8208;functionalized membranes is achieved by endogenous enzyme&#8208;mediated decreases in pH. Reorganization of the protocell community mitigates signal attenuation in an inter&#8208;protocellular cascade reaction (A+B&#8594;C) when undertaken with a deactivating agent (D).







Abstract
The design and implementation of collective actions in model protocell communities is an on&#8208;going challenge in synthetic protobiology. Herein, we covalently graft alginate or chitosan onto the outer surface of semipermeable enzyme&#8208;containing silica colloidosomes to produce hairy catalytic protocells with pH&#8208;switchable membrane surface charge. Binary populations of the enzymatically active protocells exhibit self&#8208;initiated stimulus&#8208;responsive changes in spatial organization such that the mixed community undergoes alternative modes of electrostatically induced self&#8208;sorting and reversible co&#8208;clustering. We demonstrate that co&#8208;clustering, but not self&#8208;sorting, mitigates signal attenuation in a binary community of enzyme&#8208;containing sender and receiver protocells due to increased proximity effects. The level of signal attenuation is correlated with a time&#8208;dependent pH&#8208;mediated switch in the spatial organization of the sender and receiver populations. Our results pave the way towards the development of programmable networks of adaptive life&#8208;like objects and could have implications for the development of interactive cytomimetic materials and agent&#8208;based robotics.

         <title>Versatile Strategy for the Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Branched Human Milk Oligosaccharides Containing the Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;Biose Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal core saccharide was prepared on a hundred&#8208;milligram scale by glycosyltransferases and amino protecting group (APG) conversions. This core saccharide was further extended into branched precursors with specific APGs, enabling controlled glycosylations, which allowed the facile synthesis of diversified branched human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). Glycan microarray analysis showed that these HMOs, featuring a type&#8197;1 glycan, specifically bound to certain lectins.







Abstract
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) exhibit prebiotic, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory properties and confer significant benefits to infants. Branched HMOs are constructed through diverse glycosidic linkages and prominently feature the lacto&#8208;N&#8208;biose (LNB, Gal&#8208;&#946;1,3&#8208;GlcNAc) motif with fucose and/or sialic acid modifications, displaying structural complexity that surpasses that of N&#8208; and O&#8208;glycans. However, synthesizing comprehensive libraries of branched HMO is challenging due to this complexity. Although a few systematic synthetic strategies have emerged, many of them rely on labor&#8208;intensive chemical methodologies or exploit the substrate specificity of human N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (hGCNT2). In this study, we capitalized on the substrate promiscuities of hGCNT2 and bacterial glycosyltransferases (GTs) to construct a universal tetrasaccharide core in a highly efficient manner. This core was systematically and flexibly extended to generate diverse branched HMOs utilizing the promiscuity of bacterial GTs coupled with N&#8208;trifluoroacetyl glucosamine (GlcNTFA), which facilitated sugar chain elongation. The GlcNTFA residues were subsequently converted into various N&#8208;modified glucosamines through straightforward chemical manipulations to modulate the activities of additional GTs during glycan extension. These masked amino groups were ultimately reverted to N&#8208;acetyl groups, facilitating the synthesis of a broad range of asymmetric and multiantennary HMOs featuring LNB moieties, including many previously inaccessible structures.

         <title>O&#8722;O Radical Coupling in Ultrathin Reconstructed Co6.8Se8 Nanosheets for Effective Oxygen Evolution and Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance and the underlying catalytic mechanisms are still not clearly distinguished toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we synthesized ultrathin Co6.8Se8 nanosheets with subnanometer thickness by incorporating catalytically inactive selenium into ultrathin Co(OH)2, thereby switching the OER reaction pathway from adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to oxide path mechanism (OPM).







Abstract
Designing ultrathin transition metal electrocatalysts with optimal surface chemistry state is crucial for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the structure&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance and the underlying catalytic mechanisms are still not clearly distinguished. Herein, we synthesize ultrathin Co6.8Se8 nanosheets (NSs) with subnanometer thickness by incorporating catalytically inactive selenium (Se) into ultrathin Co(OH)2, thereby switching the OER reaction pathway from adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to oxide path mechanism (OPM). The prepared ultrathin Co6.8Se8 NSs exhibit an overpotential of 253&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA/cm2, outperforming the mostly reported Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Advanced operando synchrotron spectroscopies and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal the ultrathin Co6.8Se8 NSs, whose surface is reconstructed into Se&#8208;doped Co(OH)2 during the OER process, could trigger direct O*&#8722;O* radical coupling rather than OOH* intermediates within AEM pathway thus lowering the energy input. Density functional theory calculations confirm that Co6.8Se8 NSs with shorter Co&#8722;Co bond length and stable Co&#8722;Se bond could optimize the rate&#8208;determining step barrier via OPM pathway. Besides, rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries based on Co6.8Se8 NSs exhibit excellent stability for more than 500&#8197;h of continuous charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 4&#8197;mA/cm2. The present study highlights the structural&#8208;dependent switch of OER pathways and provides valuable insights for further development of ultrathin OER catalysts.

Metabolic acidity and H2O2 dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive smart probe for image&#8208;guided primary and metastasis breast tumor resection and its clinical application.







Abstract
Fluorescence imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) is crucial for accurate tumor diagnosis, offering superior resolution and penetration capabilities. Current NIR&#8208;II probes are limited by either being &#8220;always on&#8221; or responding to one stimulus, leading to low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and potential false positives. We introduced a dual&#8208;lock&#8208;controlled probe, HN&#8208;PBA, activated by both H2O2 and tumor acidic environment. This dual response ensures bright fluorescence at tumor sites, leading to higher tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal tissue ratios (T/NT) compared to conventional &#8220;always on&#8221; probes and probes activated only by H2O2. This strategy allows precise tumor identification and removal of primary and metastatic tumors, achieving superior T/NT ratios (24.3/6.4 for orthotopic and lung metastasis, respectively). Our probe also effectively detected lung metastatic foci as small as&#8804;0.7&#8197;mm and showed the capability for accurate lesion localization in clinical breast cancer specimens. This dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive strategy could aid future diagnostic probe design.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Synthesis of Urea from co&#8208;Reduction of N2 and CO2 on Z&#8208;Schematic SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Z&#8208;schematic SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4 catalyst is efficient for urea photosynthesis from CO2 and N2 reduction. It has dual active sites for adsorption and activation of CO2 and N2 and the accelerated kinetics for C&#8722;N coupling reaction. The energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step is reduced on SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4.







Abstract
The photocatalytic co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and N2 is a sustainable method for urea synthesis under mild conditions. However, high&#8208;yield synthesis of urea is a challenge due to the sluggish kinetics of the C&#8722;N coupling reaction. Herein, we have successfully engineered a Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst, SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4, for boosting photocatalytic urea synthesis via enhancing the initial CO2 and N2 adsorption step and reducing the energy barrier for the C&#8722;N coupling reaction. A high urea yield of 8054.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved on SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4, which was significantly higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The SrTiO3&#8208;FeS&#8208;CoWO4 Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst, with accelerated charge transfer by FeS, not only had dual active sites for the chemical adsorption and activation of CO2 and N2, but also retained the high conduction band (&#8722;1.50&#8197;eV) and accelerated supply of electrons and protons, which are responsible for its good photoreduction activity and significantly reduced energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of C&#8722;N coupling reaction.

         <title>Weakly Solvating Cyclic Ether&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Electrolytes for Stable High&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we reported a deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) based on a weakly solvating solvent which is constructed by the anion effect. Due to the effective anchoring of the free solvents and the improvement of the solvation structure, the DEE is compatible with both lithium metal anode and transition metal oxide cathode (e.g. LiMn2O4) over a wide temperature range.







Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEE) have emerged as an innovative approach to address the instability and safety issues of lithium metal batteries at elevated temperatures. However, in practice, there is often an undesirable incompatibility between the eutectic mixture and electrodes, and also an insufficient reduction stability of DEE due to the increased Li+ concentration. Herein, we designed a new DEE by utilizing weakly solvating tetrahydropyran (THP) solvent. Due to the high reduction resistance of THP and concentrated lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), this DEE demonstrates enhanced compatibility with Li metal anode and high temperature tolerance with LiMn2O4 cathode. The Li||LiMn2O4 cell (1.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) shows a high capacity retention of 96.02&#8201;% after 600 cycles at room temperature. More importantly, this Li||LiMn2O4 cell achieves a remarkable high&#8208;temperature performance with a high capacity retention of 91.72&#8201;% after 120 cycles and low self&#8208;discharge after storage for 240&#8197;hours at a high temperature of 55&#8201;&#176;C, which is critical for LiMn2O4 cathode. Overall, this electrolyte design provides an alternative pathway for the development of DEEs for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries, which can also be expanded to other batteries.

         <title>Side Chain Phenyl Isomerization&#8208;Induced Spatial Conjugation for Achieving Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared II Phototheranostic Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Side chain phenyl positional isomerization induces strong intermolecular spatial conjugation, simultaneously improving the fluorescence brightness and photothermal properties of phototheranostic agents in the near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) window. The obtained o&#8208;ITNP NPs excels in high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise NIR&#8208;II angiography, tumor localization, and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided tumor photothermal therapy.







Abstract
The contradiction of near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) emission and photothermal effects limits the development of phototheranostic agents (PTAs) in many emerging cutting&#8208;edge applications. Organic aggregates present a promising opportunity for the balance of competitive relaxation processes through the manipulation of molecular structure and packing. Herein, side chain phenyl isomerization&#8208;induced spatial conjugation was proposed for constructing A&#8208;D&#8208;A type NIR&#8208;II PTAs with simultaneous enhancement of fluorescence brightness and photothermal properties. Three pairs of mutually isomeric fluorophores, whose phenyls respectively located at the outside (o&#8208;series) and inside (i&#8208;series) of the side chain, were designed and synthesized. The positional isomerization of the phenyl endows the o&#8208;series crystals with strong spatial conjugation between the phenyl group on the side chain and the backbone, as well as interlocked planar network, which is different to that observed in the i&#8208;series. Thus, all o&#8208;series nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption, enhanced NIR&#8208;II emission, and superior photothermal properties than their i&#8208;series counterparts. A prominent member of the o&#8208;series, o&#8208;ITNP NPs, demonstrated efficacy in facilitating NIR&#8208;II angiography, tumor localization, and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided tumor photothermal therapy. The success of this side chain phenyl isomerization strategy paves the way for precise control of the aggregation behavior and for further development of efficient NIR&#8208;II PTAs.

Abstract
Cordycicadins A&#8722;D are four C20 polyketides, all containing a &#947;&#8208;lactone fused to a 10&#8208;membered lactone. The proposed biosynthetic pathway for the cordycicadins anticipates the formation of two more natural products which are unknown. We report the total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;cordycicadin D and the two anticipated natural products 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;cordycicadins A and B. The targets were convergently assembled, in a biomimetic fashion, via an efficient ketene trapping&#8208;intramolecular Michael addition sequence that delivered the requisite 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;fused framework with high diastereoselectivity, enabled by the synthesis of complex dioxenones that serve as in situ ketene precursors. Recognition of the embedded polyketide symmetry enabled the use of a divergent&#8208;convergent synthetic strategy, based on the use of two products from an early&#8208;stage enzymatic resolution. The synthetic routes afforded (&#8211;)&#8208;cordycicadin D in 14 steps and 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;cordycicadins A and B in 13 steps (longest linear sequence). This work confirms the structure of (&#8722;)&#8208;cordycicadin D and the observed instability of the anticipated natural product 3,4&#8208;trans&#8208;cordycicadin B during purification may explain why it is yet to be isolated.

         <title>In Situ Generation of Microwire Heterojunctions with Flexible Optical Waveguide and Hydration&#8208;Mediated Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydration&#8208;mediated molecular engineering strategy has been used for the in situ generation of flexible heterojunctions that display ultralow&#8208;loss optical waveguides, high flexibility and controllable emission sequences. This integration of the benefits of flexibility and heterojunctions approach offers the possibility for developing photonic information encryption systems.







Abstract
Flexible heterojunctions based on molecular systems are in high demand for applications in photonics, electronics, and smart materials, but fabrication challenges have hindered progress. Herein, we present an in situ approach to creating optical heterojunctions using hydration&#8208;mediated flexible molecular crystals. These hydrated multi&#8208;component molecular solids display strong blue emitting optical waveguides with minimal optical loss (0.005 dB/&#956;m) and excellent flexibility (elastic modulus: 3.87&#8197;GPa). The water&#8208;mediated process enables the molecular microwires with tunable elastic and plastic deformation, as well as reversible uptake and release of lattice water, facilitating the formation of flexible heterojunctions. Spectral analysis and theoretical modeling reveal that these microwires exhibit both photochromism and color&#8208;tunable dual emission (fluorescence and phosphorescence), expanding their utility in photonic information encoding. Therefore, this work introduces a hydration&#8208;mediated molecular engineering strategy for fabricating crystalline heterojunctions with on&#8208;demand processability and controllable emission sequences, enabling optical signal manipulation at the micro/nanoscale.

         <title>Tailored Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Nanozymes for Enhanced Enzyme&#8208;Like Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>

This work developed a novel metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;based nanozyme that effectively blocks bacterial energy metabolism pathways through finely tuned catalytic center and substrate channel structures, demonstrating excellent antimicrobial properties and the potential to promote infected wound healing.







Abstract
The global crisis of bacterial infections is exacerbated by the escalating threat of microbial antibiotic resistance. Nanozymes promise to provide ingenious solutions. Here, we reported a homogeneous catalytic structure of Pt nanoclusters with finely tuned metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) channel structures for the treatment of infected wounds. Catalytic site normalization showed that the active site of the Pt aggregates structure with fine&#8208;tuned pore modifications structure had a catalytic capacity of 14.903&#215;105&#8197;min&#8722;1, which was 18.7&#8197;times higher than that of the Pt particles in monodisperse state in ZIF&#8208;8 (0.793&#215;105&#8197;min&#8722;1). In situ tests revealed that the change from homocleavage to heterocleavage of hydrogen peroxide at the interface of the nanozyme was one of the key reasons for the improvement of nanozyme activity. Density&#8208;functional theory and kinetic simulations of the reaction interface jointly determine the role of the catalytic center and the substrate channel together. Metabolomics analysis showed that the developed nanozyme, working in conjunction with reactive oxygen species, could effectively block energy metabolic pathways within bacteria, leading to spontaneous apoptosis and bacterial rupture. This pioneering study elucidates new ideas for the regulation of artificial enzyme activity and provides new perspectives for the development of efficient antibiotic substitutes.

The cover picture illustrates a water&#8208;soluble aromatic nanobelt that can be synthesized by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of methylene&#8208;bridged [6]cycloparaphenylene ([6]MCPP). Cell&#8208;imaging experiments on the synthesized nanobelt in HeLa cells revealed stop&#8208;and&#8208;go cellular uptake dynamics, which are likely derived from the belt&#8208;shaped structure. Details of the study are reported by Akiko Yagi, Kazuma Amaike, Kenichiro Itami et al. in their Communication (e202414645).

The intricate interactions between surface&#8208;near species, OH and water are illustrated in the cover picture. While water and OH form hydrogen bonds, this does not fully capture the interaction. Electrons can delocalize across adjacent adsorbates, leading to a more complex electronic structure than anticipated. The cover displays the dilemma of a hydrogen atom situated between two oxygen atoms, as is the case with adjacent OH and water. Which oxygen atom will hydrogen form a bond with? The answer is both, as detailed by Jan Rossmeisl et al. in their Communication (e202417308).

         <dc:description>
Spatiotemporally controlled orthogonal regulation of cGAS&#8211;STING stimulation has been achieved in the Research Article (e202417916) by Xiangfei Li, Fangzhi Yu and Lele Li. In the approach, enzyme&#8208;triggered DNA assembly allows the cGAS&#8211;STING stimulation, while light&#8208;induced fragmentation of the double&#8208;stranded DNA enables termination of such stimulation, thereby achieving orthogonal control over the immune regulation.

&lt;p&gt;Spatiotemporally controlled orthogonal regulation of cGAS&#8211;STING stimulation has been achieved in the Research Article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202417916"&gt;(e202417916)&lt;/a&gt; by Xiangfei Li, Fangzhi Yu and Lele Li. In the approach, enzyme-triggered DNA assembly allows the cGAS&#8211;STING stimulation, while light-induced fragmentation of the double-stranded DNA enables termination of such stimulation, thereby achieving orthogonal control over the immune regulation.

Polymers with intrinsic microporosity have been pioneered by Huaqiang Zeng et al. in their Research Article (e202418304) as a compelling platform for constructing artificial lithium ion channels. These Li+ channels achieve exceptionally high Li+ transport rates coupled with exceptional selectivity. Remarkably, their transport properties can be precisely tuned by adjusting the synthesis temperature, presenting a versatile strategy for optimizing performance.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors: Molecular Design Strategies, Applications and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the latest progress in conjugated polymers (CPs) for high&#8208;performance organic electro&#8208;chemical transistors (OECTs) via trying to extract the molecular design strategies, briefly presenting the applications of CP&#8208;based OECTs, and giving perspectives in this field.







Abstract
The last decade has witnessed significant progress in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) due to their enormous potential applications in various bioelectronic devices, such as artificial synapses, biological interfaces, and biosensors. The remarkable advance in this field is highly powered by the development of novel organic mixed ionic/electronic conductors (OMIECs). &#960;&#8208;Conjugated polymers (CPs), which are widely used in various optoelectronics, are emerging as key channel materials for OECTs. In this review, after briefly introducing OECT, we then mainly focus on the latest progress in CPs for high&#8208;performance OECTs. The correlations of their structure, basic physicochemical properties, and device performance are elucidated by evaluating their electronic characters, optoelectronic properties, and OECT performance. Then, the applications of CP&#8208;based OECTs are briefly presented. Finally, we discuss several remaining issues or challenges in this field and give our insights into advancing CPs for enhanced OECT performance.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Aromatic Nanobelt with Unique Cellular Internalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble aromatic nanobelt was synthesized by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of [6]MCPP. Cell&#8208;imaging experiments on the synthesized nanobelt in HeLa cells revealed stop&#8208;and&#8208;go cellular uptake dynamics, which are likely derived from the belt&#8208;shaped structure.







Abstract
A water&#8208;soluble aromatic nanobelt was synthesized, and its cellular uptake behavior in HeLa cells was investigated. The late&#8208;stage functionalization of the parent methylene&#8208;bridged [6]cycloparaphenylene ([6]MCPP) provided an easily accessible alkyne&#8208;functionalized nanobelt in a single reaction step. The alkyne&#8208;substituted [6]MCPP was subjected to Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition by using a dye&#8208;attached azide to obtain a water&#8208;soluble aromatic nanobelt. Cell&#8208;imaging experiments on the synthesized nanobelt in HeLa cells revealed stop&#8208;and&#8208;go cellular uptake dynamics. Similar experiments with control molecules and theoretical studies indicated that the unique dynamics of the nanobelt was derived from the belt&#8208;shaped structure.

         <title>Artificial Lithium Channels Built from Polymers with Intrinsic Microporosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers with intrinsic microporosity have been used to construct artificial lithium channels. Record&#8208;high transmembrane Li+ transport rates (&#947;Li+ &gt;40 pS) and high Li+ transport selectivity relative to both Na+ and K+ ions (selectivity&gt;10) have been determined using these ion channels. The transport properties can be tuned by adjusting the temperature at which the microporous polymers are synthesized







Abstract
In sharp contrast to numerous artificial potassium channels developed over the past decade, the study of artificial lithium&#8208;transporting channels has remained limited. We demonstrate here the use of an interesting class of polymers with intrinsic microporosity (PIM) for constructing artificial lithium channels. These PIM&#8208;derived lithium channels show exceptionally efficient (&#947;Li+&gt;40 pS) and highly selective transport of Li+ ions, with selectivity factors of&gt;10 against both Na+ and K+. By simply adjusting the initial reaction temperature, we can tune the transport property in a way that PIMs synthesized at initial reaction temperatures of 60&#8201;&#176;C and 80&#8201;&#176;C exhibit improved transport efficiency and selectivity, respectively, in the dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine membrane.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenolysis Rearrangement of Allylic Esters to Access Axially Chiral Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenolysis rearrangement of allylic acetates using (s&#8208;Bu)3BHK has been established, achieving the enantioselective synthesis of non&#8208;atropisomeric axially chiral alkylidene cycloalkanes with excellent chemo and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). This methodology not only offers a powerful tool for the synthesis of these challenging non&#8208;atropisomeric axially chiral olefins structures, which remain vastly underexplored, but also expands the scope and utility of asymmetric hydrogenolysis reactions, highlighting their versatility and effectiveness in synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenolysis rearrangement of allylic acetates using (s&#8208;Bu)3BHK has been described, achieving the synthesis of axially chiral alkylidene cycloalkanes with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) and a wide substrate scope (30 examples of cyclohexanes and cyclobutanes). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to achieve synthesis of axially chiral olefins via asymmetric hydrogenolysis of allylic acetates. This methodology not only offers a novel synthetic pathway for non&#8208;atropisomeric axially chiral structures but also highlights the potential of asymmetric hydrogenolysis as a powerful tool in synthetic organic chemistry.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Releasing Polymer Tubesomes: Boosting Gas Delivery of Nanovehicles via Membrane Stretching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;spherical tubesomes are first function as gas&#8208;releasing nanovehicles. By shaping the polymersomes via membrane stretching, one can regulate their length&#8208;diameter ratio (L/D). Such tubesomes can respond to endogenous cysteine to release H2S gas, and an unexpected discovery is that as compared to the spherical carriers, the tubular ones behave far better gas releasing capacity. More importantly, the L/D parameter of tubesomes can dictate the gas releasing kinetics and gas therapeutic efficacy on cancer.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), one of the three gas signaling molecules, not only plays a vital role in mediating a series of cellular activities but also manifests exciting applications in clinical therapy. However, one main obstacle in using H2S as a gaseous therapeutic agent is to realize on&#8208;demand storage and delivery of gas, and thus, it is of great importance to develop H2S&#8208;donating vehicle platforms. Although a variety of polymer&#8208;based gas&#8208;releasing carriers have been designed, almost all the systems are limited to spherical structures. Here we explore the role of polymer self&#8208;assembled morphologies, especially toward those non&#8208;spherical nanostructures, on the H2S release capacity. A kind of tubular polymersomes (i.e. tubesomes), formed by the membrane stretching of polythionoester&#8208;containing block copolymer vesicles, exhibit enhanced cysteine&#8208;responsive H2S&#8208;releasing behavior in contrast to their spherical counterparts. Moreover, we found that the amount and rate of H2S release from diverse polymersomes is relied on the extent of membrane elongation, which allows us to regulate the gas releasing kinetics through tailoring the membrane geometries. More importantly, it is demonstrated that the tubesomes as polymer&#8208;type H2S donors have better anticancer performance than those spherical polymersomes. This would inspire new possibilities to boost gas therapeutic efficacy through shaping the morphology of gas nanovehicles.

         <title>Physical Isolation of Single Protein Molecules within Well&#8208;Defined Coordination Cages to Enhance Their Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unimolecular protein encapsulation in well&#8208;defined coordination cages is demonstrated. 15 Different proteins of varying sizes (3&#8211;6&#8197;nm) and properties were isolated within uniform cavities of size&#8208;tunable cages, 10 of which exhibited enhanced stability against denaturants. Isolation of single proteins in coordination cages thus holds the potential for precise functional control and structural analysis within the well&#8208;defined nanospace.







Abstract
Encapsulation of a single protein within a confined space can lead to distinct properties compared to bulk solutions, but controlling the number of encapsulated proteins and their environment remains challenging. This study demonstrates the encapsulation of single proteins within well&#8208;defined, tunable cavities of self&#8208;assembled coordination cages, thereby enhancing protein stability. Within uniform cavities of size&#8208;tunable coordination cages, 15 different proteins of varying sizes (3&#8211;6&#8197;nm in diameter) and properties (e.g., isoelectric points and hydrophobicity) were successfully confined. Various analytical techniques confirmed that the proteins maintained their secondary structures and enzymatic activities under denaturing conditions such as exposure to organic solvents, heat, and buffers. These findings suggest that such coordination cages have the potential to serve as synthetic hosts for precisely controlling protein functions within their customizable cavities.

         <title>Boosting Propane Dehydrogenation to Propylene via Electron Hole&#8208;Hydrogen Coupling on Cobalt Metal Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hole&#8208;H coupled Co surface induced by introducing a trace amount of separated Pt metals as both hydrogen atoms and holes donors on the same nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon supports could help to avoid deep hydrogenolysis and coke deposition, breaking the activity&#8208;stability tradeoff for nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation.







Abstract
Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane is useful for the high selectivity to propylene but is suffering from the heavy coke deposition on the catalyst surface. Herein, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application of a hole&#8208;hydrogen (H) couple on a metallic cobalt surface to decrease the deactivation rate. The coupled H atoms on the Cobalt (Co) surface, partially resulting from propane dehydrogenation, enabled the desorption of propylene to avoid deep hydrogenolysis and coke deposition and realize selective and durable propylene production, while conventional Co metal&#8208;based catalysts do not generate propylene. The optimized hole&#8208;H coupled Co catalyst provided a low deactivation rate (0.0036&#8197;h&#8722;1) and a high turnover frequency (55.6&#8197;h&#8722;1) for propylene production with a high propane flux (48 vol.% C3H8 in gas feeds) at 550&#8201;&#176;C.

Incorporating dynamic hydrogen bonds into liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) created a supramolecular network and enabled modular and reversible LCE assembly under gently temperatures. The behavior of the LCE actuator can be reconfigured and reprogramed on demand. This efficient LCE&#8208;based evolutionary robots is capable of continuous operation in complex environments.







Abstract
In nature, many organisms augment chances of survival by reprogramming their structures to evolving environment, among which sea squirts being a prime example. Such reprogramming has been demonstrated in liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuator assembled with heat assistance. However, the required temperature being higher than the actuation temperature limits its application. Here, we reported a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular network LCE to construct soft modular and reprogrammable actuator by assembling with a gentle heat treatment. Leveraging the Michael addition reaction, we introduced hydrogen bonding to the LCE matrix with functionalized pyridine monomers. Experimental and molecular dynamics modeling proved the efficient dynamic hydrogen bond exchange at 60&#8201;&#176;C, significantly lower than the actuating temperature of the LCE. This gave rise to the reversible and robust adhesion of the same collection of LCE modules capable of being built into different bilayers and performing various morphing upon a short thermal stimulation. Therefore, we demonstrated that these comparatively weak cross&#8208;links enabled reconfiguration of the LCE actuator. With the developed hydrogen&#8208;bonding LCEs, we built proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept modular reprogrammable robot, performing crawling, sailing, and microcircuit repair tasks. This bioinspired and efficient method for evolutionary LCE robot offers a viable path for further development of intelligent actuators sustainable in complex environments.

         <title>Modular Photoswitchable Molecular Glues for Chemo&#8208;Optogenetic Control of Protein Function in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a versatile chemo&#8208;optogenetic system using modular photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) that undergo repeated cycles of optical control to switch protein function on and off. This system can be used to reversibly control protein localization, organelle positioning, protein&#8208;fragment complementation as well as posttranslational protein levels by light with high spatiotemporal precision.







Abstract
Optogenetic systems using photosensitive proteins and chemically induced dimerization/proximity (CID/CIP) approaches enabled by chemical dimerizers (also termed molecular glues), are powerful tools to elucidate the dynamics of biological systems and to dissect complex biological regulatory networks. Here, we report a versatile chemo&#8208;optogenetic system using modular, photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) that can undergo repeated cycles of optical control to switch protein function on and off. We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to rationally design the sMGs and further expand their scope by incorporating different photoswitches, resulting in sMGs with customizable properties. We demonstrate that this system can be used to reversibly control protein localization, organelle positioning, protein&#8208;fragment complementation as well as posttranslational protein levels by light with high spatiotemporal precision. This system enables sophisticated optical manipulation of cellular processes and thus opens up a new avenue for chemo&#8208;optogenetics.

         <title>Batrachopolyenes: Volatile Norsteroids from Femoral Scent Glands of Frogs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of volatile steroidal natural products, the batrachopolyenes, have been isolated and identified from torrent frogs. A total synthesis established their structure. These norsteroids contain a unique contracted A&#8208;ring and unusual functionalization across the structural core, which were installed along a divergent total synthetic sequence.







Abstract
Steroid hormones are C18&#8208;C21&#8208;sterane derivatives, featuring the typical 6&#8211;6&#8211;6&#8211;5 ring system. Here we report on a novel C18&#8208;steroid ring system named batrachane with a contracted A&#8208;ring resulting in a 5&#8211;6&#8211;6&#8211;5 ring arrangement. The isolation, structural elucidation, and total synthesis of three members of the novel batrachopolyene family occurring in the tropical frog genus Odontobatrachus is reported. The batrachopolyenes represent an entirely new collection of volatile steroidal natural products produced by anuran amphibians. Alongside the contracted A&#8208;ring, each member contains a &#916;16&#8208;17 double bond but differs in the central belt of the steroidal structure. To create these atypical structural features, syntheses featuring a combination of Breslow radical chain relay chlorination, Favorskii ring contraction, and Clemmensen reduction proved successful. The occurrence of such compounds in another distal anuran group, the Mantellinae, suggests a more widespread distribution of the batrachane&#8208;type compounds among frogs. The new structural steroid type raises questions concerning steroid biosynthesis and reception, as well as distribution in frogs in general and the structures of their hormones.

         <title>Organic Molecule Functionalization Enables Selective Electrochemical Reduction of Dilute CO2 Feedstock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an organic molecule functionalization strategy to boost selectivity towards CO2R and suppress HER over a range of catalysts including Bi, Cu and Zn. With a functionalized Bi catalyst, we attained a formate Faradaic efficiency of 85.8&#8201;% with dilute feedstock (15&#8201;% CO2) at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Using an electrolyzer with a porous solid electrolyte layer, we successfully showcase 30&#8197;h of continuous high&#8208;purity formic acid production from dilute CO2.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 feedstock to value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is a promising pathway for achieving direct valorization of waste gas streams. However, this is challenging due to significant competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and lowered CO2 reduction (CO2R) kinetics as compared to systems that employ pure CO2. Here we show that terephthalic acid (TPA) functionalization can boost selectivity towards CO2R and suppress HER over a range of catalysts including Bi, Cu and Zn. For instance, TPA functionalized Bi attained a formate Faradaic efficiency (FEHCOO&#8208;) of 96.3&#8201;% at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with pure CO2 feedstock. Density functional theory simulations indicate that this is because TPA functionalization modulates the binding energies of the key reaction intermediates *OCHO and *H. With low&#8208;concentration feedstock (15&#8201;% CO2) at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, we achieved a high FEHCOO&#8208; of 85.8&#8201;%, which was double that of an unmodified Bi catalyst. Using an electrolyzer with a porous solid electrolyte layer, we successfully showcase 30&#8197;h of continuous high&#8208;purity formic acid production with a 5&#8201;% CO2 feed. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that molecular tuning of a catalyst can be an effective strategy for enabling selective CO2R using low&#8208;concentration feedstock.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence/Photoacoustic Dual Ratiometric Probes with Unique Recognition Site for Quantitatively Visualizing H2S2 in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have described a unique H2S2&#8208;mediated dithiole formation reaction under physiological conditions. Based on this reaction, we construct the first NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic dual&#8208;ratiometric probe (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;H2S2) for quantitatively and precisely visualizing H2S2 fluctuations in LPS/MET&#8208;induced liver injury.







Abstract
Hydrogen persulfide (H2S2) plays a significant role in redox biology and signal transduction; therefore, quantitative visualization of H2S2 in the deep tissue of living organisms is essential for obtaining reliable information about relevant pathophysiological processes directly. However, currently reported H2S2 probes are unsuitable for this purpose because of their poor selectivity for many polysulfide species or their short wavelength, which hinders precise imaging in deep tissues. Herein, for the first time, we report a unique H2S2&#8208;mediated dithiole formation reaction. Based on this reaction, we construct the first NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FL) and photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;ratiometric probe (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;H2S2) for quantitatively visualizing H2S2 in vivo. This probe shows dual&#8208;ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (I840/I1000, 107&#8208;fold) and photoacoustic (PA800/PA900, 6.5&#8208;fold) responses towards Na2S2 species with high specificity, excellent sensitivity (1.8&#8197;nM), improved water solubility, and deep&#8208;tissue penetration. More importantly, using NIR&#8208;II dual&#8208;ratiometric FL/PA imaging, we successfully demonstrated that the probe could be used to accurately quantify the fluctuating H2S2 levels in the liver&#8208;injury mouse models induced by lipopolysaccharides or metformin drugs. Overall, this study not only presents a promising tool for H2S2&#8208;related pathological research, but also provides a unique recognition site that may be generalized for designing more useful H2S2 imaging agents in the future.

&lt;p&gt;We have described a unique H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated dithiole formation reaction under physiological conditions. Based on this reaction, we construct the first NIR-II fluorescence and photoacoustic dual-ratiometric probe (&lt;b&gt;NIR-II-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) for quantitatively and precisely visualizing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fluctuations in LPS/MET-induced liver injury.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen persulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) plays a significant role in redox biology and signal transduction; therefore, quantitative visualization of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the deep tissue of living organisms is essential for obtaining reliable information about relevant pathophysiological processes directly. However, currently reported H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; probes are unsuitable for this purpose because of their poor selectivity for many polysulfide species or their short wavelength, which hinders precise imaging in deep tissues. Herein, for the first time, we report a unique H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated dithiole formation reaction. Based on this reaction, we construct the first NIR-II fluorescence (FL) and photoacoustic (PA) dual-ratiometric probe (&lt;b&gt;NIR-II-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) for quantitatively visualizing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in vivo. This probe shows dual-ratiometric NIR-II fluorescence (I&lt;sub&gt;840&lt;/sub&gt;/I&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt;, 107-fold) and photoacoustic (PA&lt;sub&gt;800&lt;/sub&gt;/PA&lt;sub&gt;900&lt;/sub&gt;, 6.5-fold) responses towards Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species with high specificity, excellent sensitivity (1.8&#8197;nM), improved water solubility, and deep-tissue penetration. More importantly, using NIR-II dual-ratiometric FL/PA imaging, we successfully demonstrated that the probe could be used to accurately quantify the fluctuating H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in the liver-injury mouse models induced by lipopolysaccharides or metformin drugs. Overall, this study not only presents a promising tool for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-related pathological research, but also provides a unique recognition site that may be generalized for designing more useful H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; imaging agents in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Universal Design of Lithium Anode via Dynamic Stability Strategy for Practical All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable electroplating technique engineers thin Li metal anode (LMA) with a dual&#8208;layered interphase&#8212;solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and composite&#8208;polymer interphase (CPI)&#8212;which enhances ionic conductivity and suppresses dendrite formation. This design enables rapid Li+ transport and reduce resistance in solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs), thus leading to exceptional battery performance and paving the way for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density SSB with LMA.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal battery (ASSLB) chemistry with thin solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) membranes features high energy density and intrinsic safety but suffers from severe dendrite formation and poor interface contact during cycling, which hampers the practical application of rechargeable ASSLB. Here, we propose a universal design of thin Li&#8208;metal anode (LMA) via a dynamic stability strategy to address these issues. The ultra&#8208;thin LMA (20&#8197;&#956;m) is in situ constructed with uniform highly Li&#8208;ion conductive solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase and composite&#8208;polymer interphase (CPI) via electroplating process. As a result, the passivation layer with poor Li&#8208;ion conduction on Li anode can be dissolved and small surface resistance can be achieved due to the good compatibility of CPI to SSEs. The cycling of Li symmetric cell with Li6PS5Cl thin film electrolyte (&lt;100&#8197;&#956;m) shows a high critical current density of &gt;2.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with excellent cycling stability at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The ASSLBs paring with Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 cathode demonstrated the feasibility of engineered LMA design by presenting good rate capability from 0.1&#8197;C to 1.0&#8197;C at room temperature, as well as long&#8208;term cycling stability (81&#8201;% retention after 100&#8197;cycles). This work represents a general pathway to make thin dendrite&#8208;free LMA available for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSLBs.

         <title>Urea/Thiourea Imine Linkages Provide Accessible Holes in Flexible Covalent Organic Frameworks and Dominates Self&#8208;Adaptivity and Exciton Dissociation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8208;flexible covalent organic frameworks (mf&#8208;COFs) with thio(urea)&#8208;basis&#8208;dominated linkage have been successfully synthesized, exhibiting intralayer contraction/expansion behavior in response to guest molecule. Compared with pure imine bonds, the presence of thio(urea) basis in mf&#8208;COFs improve mass transfer, self&#8208;adaptivity and electronic interactions, significantly enhancing their efficiency in micropollutant elimination in wastewater.







Abstract
Unraveling the robust self&#8208;adaptivity and minimal energy&#8208;dissipation of soft reticular materials for environmental catalysis presents a compelling yet unexplored avenue. Herein, a top&#8208;down strategy, tailoring from the unique linkage basis, flexibility degree, skeleton electronics to trace&#8208;guest adaptability, is proposed to fill the understanding gap between micro&#8208;soft covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and photocatalytic performance. The thio(urea)&#8208;basis&#8208;dominated linkage within benzotrithiophene&#8208;based COFs induce the framework contraction/swelling (intralayer micro&#8208;flexibility) in response to tetrahydrofuran or water. Adaptability of micro&#8208;flexible thiourea&#8208;COF with pore hydrophilicity not only contributes to the favorable mass transfer, but also enhances the accessible redox active sites, culminating in nearly 100&#8201;% removal of micropollutant with low&#8208;energy dissipation in wastewater. The incorporating urea/thiourea into imine linkage facilitates polarization reduction and exciton dissociation within skeleton wall, inducing strong localization for holes. This transformation facilitates interchain charge transport and unbalanced distribution conducive to oxidative holes&#8208;mediated micropollutant decomposition.

         <title>Imperfections Immobilization and Regeneration in Perovskite with Redox&#8208;Active Supramolecular Assembly for Stable Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that redox&#8208;active supramolecular assembly of nickel octaethylporphyrin in perovskite films serves a dual function: acting as an immobilizer for volatile iodine produced by iodide oxidation and as a redox shuttle to regenerate impurities such as elemental lead and iodine. Modified devices without encapsulation exhibit significantly enhanced performance and stability. These findings highlight the potential of redox&#8208;active supramolecular assembly in improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite photovoltaics.







Abstract
Imperfections in metal halide perovskites, such as those induced by light exposure or thermal stress, compromise device performance and stability. A key challenge is immobilizing volatile iodine produced by iodide oxidation and regenerating impurities like elemental lead and iodine. Here, we address this by integrating a redox&#8208;active supramolecular assembly of nickel octaethylporphyrin into perovskite film, functioning as both an immobilizer and redox shuttle. Decorated ethyl groups in porphyrin distorts the &#960; ring, increasing the axial ligand adsorption capacity of central metal ion, while reducing intermolecular interactions and promoting iodine adsorption achieving a maximum uptake of 3.83&#8197;mg&#8201;mg&#8722;1 to iodine. Adsorbed iodine transfers more electrons to Ni ions, leading to a weakened interaction within I&#8722;I bond and facilitating the production of iodide ions. Such a situation further enables selective oxidation of metallic lead defects to Pb2+. Porphyrin supramolecule facilitates hole transport across perovskite grain boundaries, leading to a champion device efficiency of 25.37&#8201;% for a 0.10&#8197;cm2 active area, outperforms the value of control device being 23.96&#8201;%. Modified devices without encapsulation exhibit significantly enhanced stability, maintaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial performance after 1,000&#8197;hours of continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination at maximum power point at 65&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Functional Characterization and Molecular Basis of a Multi&#8208;Site Halogenase in Naphthacemycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
FasV&#8208;catalyzed multiple halogenations in naphthacemycin biosynthesis were elucidated, which led to the discovery of previously unrecognized amino acid residues critical for controlling regioselectivity and substrate specificity. These findings suggest a novel dual&#8208;activation mechanism and demonstrate its biocatalytic potential for a broader range of phenolic hydroxy&#8208;containing substrates with diverse structural frameworks.







Abstract
Halogenases are spurring a growing interest in the fields of biosynthesis and biocatalysis. Although various halogenases have been identified in numerous natural product biosynthetic pathways, the mechanisms for multiple halogenations and site&#8208;selectivity remain largely unclear. In this study, we biochemically characterized FasV, a flavin&#8208;dependent halogenase (FDH) that catalyzes five successive chlorinations in the biosynthesis of the naphthacene&#8208;containing aromatic polyketide naphthacemycin. This multiple halogenation reaction was elucidated to occur in an orderly fashion, as evidenced by enzyme kinetics, time&#8208;course assays, and computational simulations. Crystallographic analyses and mutagenesis studies revealed previously unrecognized amino acid residues, including T53, L81, F93, and I212, that are crucial for controlling regioselectivity and substrate specificity. Based on this, a I212T mutant was generated to exclusively catalyze selective monohalogenation. We propose a novel dual&#8208;activation mechanism and demonstrate that the larger binding pocket of FasV makes it a valuable biocatalyst for other substrates with diverse structures. Therefore, this study provides new insight into multi&#8208;site polyhalogenases and highlights the potential for engineering FasV&#8208;like FDHs for biocatalytic applications.

&lt;p&gt;FasV-catalyzed multiple halogenations in naphthacemycin biosynthesis were elucidated, which led to the discovery of previously unrecognized amino acid residues critical for controlling regioselectivity and substrate specificity. These findings suggest a novel dual-activation mechanism and demonstrate its biocatalytic potential for a broader range of phenolic hydroxy-containing substrates with diverse structural frameworks.

Spirocycles: Spirocyclic azetidines serve as valuable isosteres of pharmaceutically relevant building blocks. This work describes the first extended library of previously rare &#8220;angular&#8221; spirocyclic azetidines, from synthesis protocols to structural, physicochemical, and biochemical properties.







Abstract
The previously neglected &#8220;angular&#8221; spirocyclic azetidines have been synthesized, characterized, and validated in drug discovery. We have shown that these compounds could act as bioisosteres for common saturated six&#8208;membered heterocycles. Their incorporation into the structure of the anticancer drug Sonidegib (instead of morpholine), and Danofloxacine (instead of piperazine) provided novel patent&#8208;free analogs with similar physicochemical properties and high activity.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Boron&#8208;Stereogenic and Axially Chiral BODIPYs via Rhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H (Hetero) Arylation with Diazonaphthoquinones and Diazoindenines</title>

         <dc:description>
The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction between boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) and a variety of naphthodiazoquinones and diazoindenines via C&#8722;H (hetero)arylation pathways selectively leads to 2&#8208;(hetero)arylated boron&#8208;stereogenic and axially chiral BODIPYs in high yields and excellent stereoselectivities. The synthetic value of the procedures is showcased by BODIPY&#8208;derived functional molecule construction and scaffold diversification. Bioapplications of tailored BODIPYs indicate their promising properties in multidisciplinary research.







Abstract
The molecular engineering of boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) has garnered widespread attention due to their structural diversity enabling tailored physicochemical properties for optimal applications. However, catalytic enantioselective synthesis of structurally diverse boron&#8208;stereogenic BODIPYs through intermolecular desymmetrization and BODIPYs with atroposelectivity remains elusive. Here, we showcase rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;specific C&#8722;H (hetero)arylations of prochiral BODIPYs and polysubstituted BODIPYs with diazonaphthoquinonesand diazoindenines, providing efficient pathways for the rapid assembly of versatile (hetero)arylated boron&#8208;stereogenic and axially chiral BODIPYs through long&#8208;range desymmetrization and axial rotational restriction modes. The synthetic application of the procedures has been emphasized by the efficient synthesis of BODIPY derivatives with various functions. Photophysical properties, bioimaging, and lipid droplet&#8208;specific targeting capability of tailored BODIPYs are also demonstrated, indicating their promising applications in biomedical research, medicinal chemistry, and material science.

         <title>Enhanced Antitumor Immunity of a Globo H&#8208;Based Vaccine Enabled by the Combination Adjuvants of 3D&#8208;MPL and QS&#8208;21</title>

An adjuvant&#8208;assisted Globo H&#8208;based vaccine platform has been established including semi&#8208;synthetic Globo H&#8208;CRM197 glycoconjugate vaccines formulated with synthetic 3&#8208;O&#8208;deacyl&#8208;monophosphoryl lipid A (3D&#8208;MPL), saponin QS&#8208;21, &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide derivative S34 and their combinations. Immunological evaluations suggest that Globo H&#8208;based vaccine formulated with the combination adjuvants of 3D&#8208;MPL and QS&#8208;21 exhibited an enhanced antitumor immunity.







Abstract
Globo H, a specific carbohydrate antigen overexpressed on various human malignancies, has attracted considerable interest as an antigenic target for anticancer vaccine development. Despite several Globo H&#8208;based carbohydrate vaccines that have been designed, efficient access to Globo H hexasaccharide antigen and development of powerful adjuvants for enhancing antitumor immunity remain challenging. Herein, we reported a streamlined chemoenzymatic approach to prepare this hexasaccharide antigen, relying on chemical synthesis of Gb5 pentasaccharide by a stereoconvergent [2+3] strategy and subsequent enzymatic &#945;&#8208;fucosylation to easily install &#945;1,2&#8208;fucose residue. Separately, a modular assembly approach to efficiently synthesize 3&#8208;O&#8208;deacyl&#8208;monophosphoryl lipid A (3D&#8208;MPL) was developed by the integration of stereocontrolled glycosylation, regioselective acylation, site&#8208;specific phosphorylation, and facile global deprotection. After efficient construction of Globo H&#8208;CRM197 conjugate, we conducted systematic immunological evaluations of Globo H&#8208;CRM197 formulated with various adjuvants and adjuvant combinations, comprising saponin QS&#8208;21, synthetic 3D&#8208;MPL and &#945;&#8208;galactosylceramide derivative S34. The results revealed that Globo H&#8208;CRM197 conjugate adjuvanted with QS&#8208;21 and 3D&#8208;MPL elicited robust IgG2a and IgG3 antibody responses and Th1 cellular immunity in mice. Moreover, antibodies induced by this formulation effectively bound to Globo H&#8208;positive MCF&#8208;7 cancer cells and exhibited superior complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity and antibody&#8208;dependent cellular phagocytosis, holding promise for further development of effective anticancer vaccines.

         <title>Optically Modulated Nanofluidic Ionic Transistor for Neuromorphic Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanofluidic neuromorphic device based on metal&#8211;organic framework membrane (MOFM) was presented, which can be controllably modulated by the light stimulation for emulating biological synaptic behaviors. This work opens up an avenue toward advanced applications using nanofluidic iontronic systems, such as brain&#8208;mimicking computing and brain&#8208;computer interfaces.







Abstract
Neuromorphic systems that can emulate the behavior of neurons have garnered increasing interest across interdisciplinary fields due to their potential applications in neuromorphic computing, artificial intelligence and brain&#8208;machine interfaces. However, the optical modulation of nanofluidic ion transport for neuromorphic functions has been scarcely reported. Herein, inspired by biological systems that rely on ions as signal carriers for information perception and processing, we present a nanofluidic transistor based on a metal&#8211;organic framework membrane (MOFM) with optically modulated ion transport properties, which can mimic the functions of biological synapses. Through the dynamic modulation of synaptic weight, we successfully replicate intricate learning&#8208;experience behaviors and Pavlovian associate learning processes by employing sequential optical stimuli. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of the International Morse Code with the nanofluidic device using patterned optical pulse signals, showing its encoding and decoding capabilities in information processing process. This study would largely advance the development of nanofluidic neuromorphic devices for biomimetic iontronics integrated with sensing, memory and computing functions.

         <title>Stereospecific 3&#8208;Aza&#8208;Cope Rearrangement Interrupted Asymmetric Allylic Substitution&#8208;Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present herein a stereospecific 3&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement interrupted asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization (Int&#8208;AASI). Both enantioenriched allylic arylation products and axially chiral alkenes could be readily obtained in high enantioselectivities by means of enantioselective allylic arylation and atroposelective alkenylation, respectively.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution with alkyl and heteroaryl carbon nucleophiles has been well&#8208;established. However, the asymmetric allylic arylation of acyclic internal alkenes with aryl nucleophiles remains challenging and underdeveloped. Herein we report a stereospecific 3&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement interrupted asymmetric allylic substitution&#8208;isomerization (Int&#8208;AASI) that enables asymmetric allylic arylation. By means of this stepwise strategy, both enantioenriched allylic arylation products and axially chiral alkenes could be readily obtained in high enantioselectivities. Experimental studies support a mechanism involving a cascade of asymmetric allylic amination, stereospecific 3&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement and alkene isomerization. Density functional theory studies detailed the reasons of achieving the high chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, stereoselectivity and stereospecificity, respectively.

         <title>An Expeditious Synthesis of Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Imide&#8208;Based Graphene Nanoribbons and Their Photothermal Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying the bay region of polyperylene with mono and diimide functional groups has enabled the synthesis of robust graphene nanoribbons. These nanoribbons are solution&#8208;processable and show good NIR absorption and photothermal conversion.







Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with low band gap and strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption are potential candidates for optoelectronic and biomedical applications. In this context, imide&#8208;based GNRs are promising, but there are no rational design principles that yield these robust GNRs with strong NIR absorption. Here, we demonstrate a rational synthesis route to achieve NIR&#8208;absorbing imide&#8208;based robust GNRs by exploring the bay region of polyperylene (PP). Using the oxidative Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, we have successfully introduced mono and diimide functional groups on PP. After cyclodehydrogenation, the resultant GNRs, benzoperylene imide GNR (BPI&#8208;GNR) and coronene diimide GNR (CDI&#8208;GNR), show oscillatory edge geometry with strong NIR absorption (up to 1000&#8197;nm) and optical band gap of ~1.3&#8197;eV. Computational studies also indicate that imide substituents play an important role in fine&#8208;tuning the optoelectronic properties of GNRs. Moreover, these GNRs are solution&#8208;processable and can be made into thin films via spray coating. Owing to the strong NIR absorption and imide substitutions, BPI and CDI&#8208;GNRs show good photothermal conversion with excellent cyclic stability.

         <title>Rapid Na+ Transport Pathway and Stable Interface Design Enabling Ultralong Life Solid&#8208;State Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium metal batteries using succinonitrile&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes are developed by finely modulating the Na+ transfer pathway and SEI composition. Benefit from the rational design of the polymer network in this electrolyte. The &#8220;biphase coexistence&#8221; Na+ transfer channel was constructed and the SEI composition was optimized. Thus, the Na+ migration kinetics in the electrolyte and the SEI are simultaneously improved.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) using solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) show impressive superiority in energy density and safety. As promising candidates for SPEs, solid&#8208;state plastic crystal electrolytes (SPCE) based on succinonitrile (SN) plastic crystal could achieve high ion conductivity and wide voltage window. Nonetheless, the notorious SN decomposition reaction on the electrode/electrolyte interface seriously challenges the stable operation of the battery. To address this drawback, we commence with the structural engineering of the polymer chain segments in SPCE and employ intermolecular interactions to optimize the composition of solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Moreover, this study emphasizes the importance of polymer network design in optimizing the migration behavior of sodium ions in SPCE. The assembled sodium symmetric cells display a high critical current density of up to 2.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling performance for 700&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the Na/SPCE&#8208;9/Na3V2(PO4)3 maintains a discharge specific capacity of up to 76.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;C and shows impressive long&#8208;cycle stability, retaining 86.2&#8201;% of initial capacity over 5000&#8197;cycles with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;%. Our work presents a high&#8208;performance SPCE with intrinsic safety, providing valuable insights for the future design of solid&#8208;state SMBs.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Pt Loaded on MOF&#8208;Derived Porous TiO2 with Maxim&#8208;Ized Pt Atom Utilization for Selective Hydrogenation of Halonitro&#8208;benzene</title>

         <dc:description>
The precise location control of single atoms relative to supports remains a great challenge in the fabrication of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Herein, through a simple &#8220;sequential thermal transition&#8221; process, the preferential dispersion of single&#8208;atom Pt species outside TiO2 is realzied by decoupling the themolysis of a typical Ti&#8208;based MOF and thermal atomization of PtNPs. The resulting Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600, with 100&#8201;% Pt accessibility, exhibits excellent activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene (p&#8208;CNB) to p&#8208;chloroaniline (p&#8208;CAN).







Abstract
The location control of single atoms relative to supports is challenging for single&#8208;atom catalysts, leading to a large proportion of inaccessible single atoms buried under supports. Herein, a &#8220;sequential thermal transition&#8221; strategy is developed to afford single&#8208;atom Pt preferentially dispersed on the outer surface of TiO2. Specifically, a Ti&#8208;MOF confining Pt nanoparticles is converted to PtNPs and TiO2 composite coated by carbon (PtNPs&amp;TiO2@C&#8208;800) at 800&#8201;&#176;C in N2. Subsequent thermal&#8208;driven atomization of PtNPs at 600&#8201;&#176;C in air produce single&#8208;atom Pt decorated TiO2 (Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600). The resulting Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600 exhibits superior p&#8208;chloroaniline (p&#8208;CAN) selectivity (99&#8201;%) to PtNPs/TiO2&#8208;400 (45&#8201;%) and much better activity than Pt1@TiO2&#8208;600 with randomly dispersed Pt1 both outside and inside TiO2 in the hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene (p&#8208;CNB). Mechanism investigations reveal that Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600 achieves 100&#8201;% accessibility of Pt1 and preferably adsorbs the &#8211;NO2 group of p&#8208;CNB while weakly adsorbs &#8211;Cl group of p&#8208;CNB and p&#8208;CAN, promoting catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <title>Methanolation of Olefins: Low&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Alcohols by the Formal Addition of Methanol to Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methanolation of olefins&#8212;the one&#8208;pot 100&#8201;% atom efficient addition of methanol to olefins yielding C1 elongated alcohols&#8212;is achieved using an integrated catalytic system based on the combination of organometallic Mn/pincer and Rh/phosphine catalysts.







Abstract
Methanolation of olefins is introduced as a new low&#8208;pressure synthetic pathway to C1 elongated alcohols. Formally, H3COH is added to the C=C bond in a 100&#8201;% atom efficient manner. Mechanistically, the overall transformation occurs as a tandem reaction sequence by combining the dehydrogenation of methanol to syngas at a CO&#8201;:&#8201;H2 ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 with subsequent hydroformylation to the corresponding aldehyde and its final hydrogenation to the alcohol. The dehydrogenation and hydrogenation steps are catalyzed by a Mn/pincer complex, while the hydroformylation is accomplished by a Rh/phosphine catalyst. Using 1&#8208;octene as prototypical substrate, a yield of 80&#8201;% nonanol was achieved with a ratio of 93&#8201;:&#8201;7 of linear to branched alcohols and turnover numbers (TONRh) of more than 17 000 could be obtained in relation to the precious metal Rhodium. The integrated catalytic system provides direct access to alcohols from olefins and &#8220;green&#8221; methanol, avoiding the handling of pressurized CO and H2 and the use of specialized high&#8208;pressure equipment as the process conditions do not exceed 10&#8197;bar with partial pressures of syngas in the range of only 1&#8211;2&#8197;bar.

         <title>Molecular Chain Rearrangement of Natural Cellulose&#8208;Based Artificial Interphase for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural cellulose&#8208;based artificial interphase constructed by molecular chain rearrangement strategy is proposed to achieve ultra&#8208;stable Zn metal anodes (e.g., an outstanding cycling lifespan of over 8000&#8197;hours at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.) This designed interphase, featuring a synergistically optimized structure and surface chemistry, demonstrate a huge potential of natural polymers materials for advanced energy storage applications.







Abstract
The unstable electrolyte&#8208;anode interface, plagued by parasitic side reactions and uncontrollable dendrite growth, severely hampers the practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. To address these challenges, we developed a regenerated cellulose&#8208;based artificial interphase with synergistically optimized structure and surface chemistry on the Zn anode (RC@Zn), using a facile molecular chain rearrangement strategy. This RC interphase features a drastically increased amorphous region and more exposed active hydroxyl groups, facilitating rapid Zn2+ diffusion and homogeneous Zn2+ interface distribution, thereby enabling dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. Additionally, the compact texture and abundant negatively charged surface of the RC interphase effectively shield water molecules and harmful anions, completely preventing H2 evolution and Zn corrosion. The superior mechanical strength and adhesion of the RC interphase also accommodate the substantial volume changes of Zn anodes even under deep cycling conditions. Consequently, the RC@Zn electrode demonstrates an outstanding cycling lifespan of over 8000&#8197;hours at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Significantly, the electrode maintains stable cycling even at a 90&#8201;% depth of discharge and ensures stable operation of full cells with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.6. This study provides new solution to construct highly stable and deep cycling Zn metal anodes through interface engineering.

         <title>Enhanced Chirality Transfer in Self&#8208;Assembled Nanocomposites Powered by A Trace Amount of Chiral Dimeric Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsically chiral dimeric molecules can achieve high chirality transfer efficiency when co&#8208;assembled with monomeric counterparts or inorganic nanomaterials, regardless of their packing structures. This process enables the fabrication of chiral materials with modulated chiroptical properties, which are otherwise difficult to access.







Abstract
Chiral&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembly has markedly advanced the development of chiral materials. While the Sergeant and Soldiers principle allows for chirality amplification, it necessitates precise shape&#8208;matching between chiral and achiral molecules, leading to a low chirality transfer efficiency&#8208;where one chiral molecule influences the chirality of a limited number of achiral molecules. Here, we show that this efficiency can be markedly enhanced by introducing chiral dimeric molecules. In this work, a single chiral molecule can control the chirality of up to 200 achiral molecules and even direct the assembly of inorganic nanoparticles into chiral nanocomposites through a sequential chirality transfer process. Moreover, this approach exhibits remarkable robustness, operating effectively without necessitating a precise match between chiral and achiral molecules. Consequently, using the same chiral molecules at an exceptionally low molar fraction (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) allows for the chiral&#8208;selective assembly of achiral molecules over a broad spectrum, regardless of their packing habits, thus facilitating the creation of otherwise inaccessible chiral materials with modulated chiroptical properties. Last but not least, even a trace amount of chiral molecules can enhance the elastic modulus of the self&#8208;assembled nanocomposites by a factor of eight.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer in Hybrid Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte Enables Boosted Interface Stability and Ion Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on the surface of LLZTO powders is constructed to inhibit the Li+/H+ exchange reaction and provide extra Lewis acid&#8208;base site, which achieving the establishment of a long&#8208;term local conducive microenvironment of Li+ conduction on the surface of LLZTO. This work emphasizes the importance of modulating solvation structure for the hybrid quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte.







Abstract
Complex interactions between the inorganic solid electrolyte (ISE) and the liquid electrolyte (LE) give rise to challenges of achieving durable interface stability in hybrid quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes (HQSE), and the influence on the involved ISE surface ionic conductivity also needs to be investigated. Here, 4&#8208;chlorobenzenesulfonic acid (CBSA) is utilized to establish a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) on the surface of Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO), which is then incorporated into PEGDA&#8208;based in situ polymerized HQSE. The results show that the introduction of CBSA significantly improves the LLZTO/LE interface stability with the optimized solvation structure, resulting in a favorable ionic conductivity (1.19 mS&#8901;cm&#8722;1) and an increasing Li+ transference number (0.647). Mechanisms for the promotion of ionic conduction and interfacial stability of SAM&#8208;HQSE are unveiled through the density functional theory (DFT) combined with Raman spectra and 7Li solid&#8208;state nuclear&#8208;magnetic&#8208;resonance. There are no short&#8208;circuits in the Li|SAM&#8208;HQSE|Li cells after 1000&#8197;h. The LFP|SAM&#8208;HQSE|Li cells or LFP|SAM&#8208;HQSE|Graphite pouch cells respectively achieve the capacity retention of 91.2&#8201;% and 87.0&#8201;% with the 0.5.C&#8208;rate for 500 and 300&#8197;cycles. This facile and effective strategy proposed in this work make it accessible for constructing the stable surface micro&#8208;environments of LLZTO where boost and homogenize the Li+ conduction in a hybrid quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte system.

There are no short-circuits in the Li|SAM-HQSE|Li cells after 1000&#8197;h. The LFP|SAM-HQSE|Li cells or LFP|SAM-HQSE|Graphite pouch cells respectively achieve the capacity retention of 91.2&#8201;% and 87.0&#8201;% with the 0.5.C-rate for 500 and 300&#8197;cycles. This facile and effective strategy proposed in this work make it accessible for constructing the stable surface micro-environments of LLZTO where boost and homogenize the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conduction in a hybrid quasi-solid electrolyte system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Liquid Crystalline Nanorods by Synchronized Polymerization, Self&#8208;Assembly and Oriented Attachment for Utilization in Magnetically Responsive Displays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step strategy based on oriented attachment, synchronized with polymerization and self&#8208;assembly was reported to achieve single&#8208;domain smectic liquid crystalline (LC) homopolymer nanorods. The strategy was realized by developing a novel stabilizer derived from a thermo&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte system. The resulting LC nanorods further form hierarchical colloidal LCs, which show much larger light transmittance than that of non&#8208;LC nanorods.







Abstract
The creation of anisotropic nanoparticles (NPs) by polymerization and/or self&#8208;assembly (SA) has significantly promoted the applications of polymer nanomaterials in many fields. However, polymer nanorods are not easily accessible via conventional polymerization or SA. Here we report a one&#8208;step route to synthesize single&#8208;domain smectic liquid crystalline (LC) nanorods utilizing oriented attachment (OA) that was usually found in the synthesis of inorganic NPs, synchronized with polymerization and SA. The synchronization was achieved by developing a novel stabilizer derived from a thermo&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte system. Mechanistic studies reveal that controlling the thermo&#8208;responsive behavior and the distribution of stabilizers on NPs enabled OA. The LC nanorods can further form hierarchical colloidal LCs, which show much larger light transmittance than that of non&#8208;LC nanorods. Moreover, we demonstrate that this LC system can be manipulated by an external magnetic field, thus providing a candidate material for magnetic&#8208;responsive display.

A novel flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106) can achieve dynamic structural changes from closed to open under the stimulation of gas molecules. Through gas adsorption isotherms, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a exhibits adaptive adsorption for C3H6 and C3H8, and exhibiting temperature&#8208;dependent gate opening phenomenon, which realized the gas adsorption and separation performance enhancement for the binary C3H6/C3H8 mixtures.







Abstract
The separation of propylene (C3H6) and propane (C3H8) is of great significance in the chemical industry, which poses a challenge due to their almost identical kinetic diameters and similar physical properties. In this work, we synthesized an ultramicroporous flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (named HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106) by using molecule 2,3,6,7&#8208;tetra (4&#8208;cyanophenyl) tetrathiafulvalene (TTF&#8208;4CN). The formation of the dimer causes the TTF&#8208;4CN molecular to bend and weaken &#960;&#8208;stacked interactions, coupled with the flexibility of C&#8801;N

H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds, which leads to reversible conversion between open and closed frameworks through the mutual slip of adjacent layers/columns under activation and stimulation of gas molecules. Through gas adsorption isotherms and adsorption enthalpy, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a exhibited adaptive adsorption and stronger binding affinity for C3H6, and presented a recorded gas uptake ratio of C3H6/C3H8 (23.77) among presentative HOF materials at room temperature to date. Importantly, the flexible HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a shows an interesting phenomenon about the reversible gate pressure control under variable temperature, which realized the gas adsorption and separation performance enhancement for the binary C3H6/C3H8 mixtures. This strategy through designing HOFs with thermoregulatory gating effect is a powerful way to maximize the performance of materials.

Utilizing seawater as an electrolyte enables efficient hydrogen peroxide production for coastal applications. The NO&#8208;DC700 catalyst, synthesized via pyrolysis of silk, achieves 4997&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1 H2O2 with a faradaic efficiency of 96.5&#8201;%, offering a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective method for on&#8208;site production in coastal region.







Abstract
Developing seawater&#8208;compatible hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electroproduction technologies is crucial for advancing marine resource utilization in coastal regions. However, designing efficient and highly stable non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) in seawater environment remains a challenging task due to the corrosive and toxic nature of chloride ions (Cl&#8722;). Herein, we present, for the first time, a novel nitrogen and oxygen self&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich nanocarbon (NO&#8208;DC700) catalyst, derived from silk fiber, which addresses these challenges with low toxicity, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and high adaptability. The obtained NO&#8208;DC700 catalyst demonstrates an impressive H2O2 production rate of up to 4997&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, a high Faradaic efficiency of 96.5&#8201;%, and produces 4.3&#8197;wt&#8201;% H2O2 after 20&#8197;hours of stable operation, placing it among the highest&#8208;performing catalysts reported in neutral electrolytes. Theoretical calculations reveal that NO&#8208;DC700&#8242;s superior 2e&#8722; ORR performance is due to the synergistic effect of graphitic nitrogen and C&#8208;OH, which inhibits Cl&#8722; adsorption and promotes *OOH adsorption. Additionally, integrating 2e&#8722; ORR with Fenton&#8208;like technology enables rapid degradation of organic pollutants and effective inactivation of seawater algae, offering significant potential for mitigating coastal eutrophication and red tide pollution. This work provides valuable insights into H2O2 electrosynthesis in seawater solution and promises advancements in ocean&#8208;energy applications.

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction between Pt and TiO2 over High&#8208;Temperature CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, Pt nanoparticles (NP) without oxidic overlayer on rutile (Ptex/R) and the encapsulated Pt NP on rutile (Pten/R) were synthesized based on the difference of support properties. Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction (SMSI) was modulated on rutile supported Pt NP over high&#8208;temperature CO2 hydrogenation. The encapsulation of Pt NP surfaces with TiO2&#8211;x overlayers is precisely controlled by the defects. It was found that oxygen vacancy (Ov) defects significantly enhance the catalytic stability of Pt/rutile under high&#8208;temperature reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction by modulating the metal&#8208;support interaction. Through a combination of DFT calculations, it is found that electron transfer from Pt NP to rutile was reduced by Ov on Pt/R, preserving the metallic nature of Pt species, which hinders the adsorption of Pt NP on the oxidic overlayer and prevents the formation of SMSI.







Abstract
The catalytic activities and stability of oxide&#8208;supported metal catalysts are significantly affected by metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI) between oxidic supports and supported metals. The surface properties of the support, such as its phase and defects, are crucial in MSI, including both the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) and electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI). In this study, modulation of SMSI was achieved on rutile&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles (NP) over high&#8208;temperature CO2 hydrogenation. The encapsulation of Pt NP surfaces with TiO2&#8211;x overlayers is precisely controlled by the defects. It is found that oxygen vacancy defects significantly enhance the catalytic stability of Pt/rutile under high&#8208;temperature reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction by inhibiting the occurrence of SMSI.

     alt="Strong Metal-Support Interaction between Pt and TiO2 over High-Temperature CO2 Hydrogenation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, Pt nanoparticles (NP) without oxidic overlayer on rutile (Pt&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt;/R) and the encapsulated Pt NP on rutile (Pt&lt;sub&gt;en&lt;/sub&gt;/R) were synthesized based on the difference of support properties. Strong Metal-Support Interaction (SMSI) was modulated on rutile supported Pt NP over high-temperature CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation. The encapsulation of Pt NP surfaces with TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8211;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; overlayers is precisely controlled by the defects. It was found that oxygen vacancy (O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) defects significantly enhance the catalytic stability of Pt/rutile under high-temperature reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction by modulating the metal-support interaction. Through a combination of DFT calculations, it is found that electron transfer from Pt NP to rutile was reduced by O&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; on Pt/R, preserving the metallic nature of Pt species, which hinders the adsorption of Pt NP on the oxidic overlayer and prevents the formation of SMSI.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catalytic activities and stability of oxide-supported metal catalysts are significantly affected by metal-support interactions (MSI) between oxidic supports and supported metals. The surface properties of the support, such as its phase and defects, are crucial in MSI, including both the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) and electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI). In this study, modulation of SMSI was achieved on rutile-supported Pt nanoparticles (NP) over high-temperature CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation. The encapsulation of Pt NP surfaces with TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8211;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; overlayers is precisely controlled by the defects. It is found that oxygen vacancy defects significantly enhance the catalytic stability of Pt/rutile under high-temperature reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction by inhibiting the occurrence of SMSI. Pt/rutile with oxygen vacancies achieves a 301 mol&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; space time yield and considerably catalytic stability (decreased by 8&#8201;%) at 800&#8201;&#176;C over 100&#8197;h time-on-stream. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the adsorption capacity of Pt NP on the rutile overlayer can be reduced by increasing electron density. Experimental results combined with DFT calculations show that electron transfer from Pt NP to rutile is reduced by the oxygen vacancy defects on Pt/R, preserving the metallic nature of Pt species during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation, thereby preventing the formation of SMSI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A directing group&#8208;controlled, palladium&#8208;catalyzed, regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantiospecific anti&#8208;carboxylation of unactivated, internal allenes has been developed via the synergistic interplay of a rationally designed bidentate directing group, palladium catalyst, and a multifunctional acetate ligand. The corresponding trans allyl ester was obtained in excellent yields with exclusive &#948;&#8208;regioselectivity and anti&#8208;carboxypalladation stereocontrol.







Abstract
We report herein a directing group&#8208;controlled, palladium&#8208;catalyzed, regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208;, and enantiospecific anti&#8208;carboxylation of unactivated, internal allenes enabled via the synergistic interplay of a rationally designed bidentate directing group, palladium catalyst, and a multifunctional acetate ligand. The corresponding trans allyl ester was obtained in excellent yields with exclusive &#948;&#8208;regioselectivity and anti&#8208;carboxypalladation stereocontrol. The acetate ligand of the palladium catalyst controls the regio&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity in the desired transformation. The potential of this concept has been demonstrated by the development of the chiral version of this transformation by using axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer with good yields and enantioselectivities. Detailed investigations, including kinetic studies, order studies, and DFT studies, were performed to validate the ligand&#8208;assisted nucleopalladation process and the rationale behind the observed racemization of chiral allenes. The studies also indicated that the anti&#8208;carboxypalladation step was the rate&#8208;limiting as well as the stereo&#8208; and enantiodetermining step.

         <title>Azopyridine Polymers in Organic Phase Change Materials for High Energy Density Photothermal Storage and Controlled Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The meta&#8208;azopyridine polymer (3&#8208;PAZOPY with an unprecedented untra&#8208;high energy density of 430&#8197;J/g forms a stable uniform two&#8208;phase hybrid composite system with the organic phase change material octanoic acid (OA) through a combination of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. This system, serving as a noval solar photothermal fuels (STFs), is capable of simultaneously storing both photochemical and phase change energy, which holds significant potential for applications in household consumers energy distribution and utilization systems, as well as in photothermal&#8208;assisted insulation strategies.







Abstract
Azo&#8208;compounds molecules and phase change materials offer potential applications for sustainable energy systems through the storage and controllable release photochemical and phase change energy. Developing novel and highly efficient Azo&#8208;based solar thermal fuels (STFs) for photothermal energy storage and synergistic cooperation with organic phase change materials present significant challenges. Herein, three types of (ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;) azopyridine polymers hinged with flexible alkyl chain are synthesized, in which meta&#8208;azopyridine polymer exhibits striking photothermal storage capacity of 430&#8197;J/g, providing a feasibility solution for developing high energy density Azo&#8208;based STFs. Furthermore, a stable two&#8208;phase hybrid system was innovatively constructed by combining the meta&#8208;azopyridine polymer with organic phase change materials leveraging hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions to collectively harness phase change energy and photothermal energy. The organic phase change material not only supplies additional phase change latent heat but also serves as a solvent, offering abundant free volume for the photo&#8208;induced isomerization of the azopyridine chromophores, which successfully circumvents the low charging efficiency in the condensed state and reliance on solvent&#8208;assisted charging in traditional Azo&#8208;based STFs. This study demonstrates the energy distribution and utilization for household consumers and the photothermal&#8208;assisted insulation strategy, achieving more extensive potential implementation for STFs.

         <title>Visible Light Excitation of Poly&#8208;(para&#8208;Phenylene Ethynylene) Enables Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Oxidations of Amines in Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available poly&#8208;(para&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) acts as a strong oxidant under visible light irradiation. This excited&#8208;state reactivity provides a potent manifold to perform heterogeneous photocatalytic oxidation of amines into imines under flow conditions with straightforward photocatalyst recycling. The inline generation of imine can be telescoped to Ugi&#8208;3CR under batch and flow conditions toward biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;acylaminoamides.







Abstract
Heterogeneous visible light photocatalysis is a compelling approach to address sustainability in synthetic photochemistry. However, the use of solid&#8208;state photocatalysts remains very unpopular in organic synthesis because of their limited accessibility and the black&#8208;box effect associated to the lack of rational between their molecular structure and their photochemical properties. Herein, we disclose the synthesis, characterization, photocatalytic properties and synthetic applications of a simple and readily available solid&#8208;state conjugated organic polymer, poly&#8208;(para&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) 1, which exhibits a strong oxidative power upon irradiation with visible light (E(1*/1&#8901;&#8722;)=+1.67&#8197;V vs SCE). Comparisons with structural analogues highlighted the superior photocatalytic activity of this linear semiconductor, on account of its fully conjugated architecture. The associated excited&#8208;state reactivity enabled the transformation of various amines into imines in batch and continuous flow reactors together with straightforward photocatalyst recycling. Mechanistic investigations revealed concomitant photoredox and energy transfer pathways, that led to the formation of the desired products. Ultimately, the inline generation of imines was exploited in telescoped three&#8208;component Ugi reactions (3CR) in batch and flow toward biologically relevant &#945;&#8208;acylaminoamides.

         <title>The Amplification of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein Amyloid Fibrils is Suppressed under Fully Quiescent Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digital seed amplification assays in microemulsion droplets for the diagnostics of Parkinson's disease would be highly valuable. However, such assays are rendered challenging by the fact that fibril amplification by fragmentation or secondary nucleation is strongly suppressed under the fully quiescent conditions inside the droplets. Ultrasonic agitation allowed the successful amplification of pre&#8208;formed seeds and those from PD brains inside microemulsion droplets under acidic solution conditions.







Abstract
Seed amplification assays (SAAs) are a promising avenue for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, when amplifying fibrils from patient&#8208;derived samples in multiwell plates, it is currently highly challenging to accurately quantify the aggregates. It is therefore desirable to transfer such assays into a digital format in microemulsion droplets to enable direct quantification of aggregate numbers. To achieve transfer from conventional plate&#8208;based to the microfluidic digital format, effective seed amplification needs to be achieved inside the microdroplets. Therefore, we establish a new set of assay conditions that enable highly efficient seed amplification in plates without any shaking. However, the same set of conditions displayed a very different behavior upon transfer to a microfluidic platform where no amplification was observed. We demonstrate that this is caused by the suppression of all secondary processes that could amplify the seeds in the complete absence of mechanical perturbations inside the microdroplets. We further show that the amplification inside droplets can be achieved by subjecting the microemulsions to high&#8208;frequency vibrations using a piezo device.

     alt="The Amplification of Alpha-Synuclein Amyloid Fibrils is Suppressed under Fully Quiescent Conditions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital seed amplification assays in microemulsion droplets for the diagnostics of Parkinson's disease would be highly valuable. However, such assays are rendered challenging by the fact that fibril amplification by fragmentation or secondary nucleation is strongly suppressed under the fully quiescent conditions inside the droplets. Ultrasonic agitation allowed the successful amplification of pre-formed seeds and those from PD brains inside microemulsion droplets under acidic solution conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed amplification assays (SAAs) are a promising avenue for the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. However, when amplifying fibrils from patient-derived samples in multiwell plates, it is currently highly challenging to accurately quantify the aggregates. It is therefore desirable to transfer such assays into a digital format in microemulsion droplets to enable direct quantification of aggregate numbers. To achieve transfer from conventional plate-based to the microfluidic digital format, effective seed amplification needs to be achieved inside the microdroplets. Therefore, we establish a new set of assay conditions that enable highly efficient seed amplification in plates without any shaking. However, the same set of conditions displayed a very different behavior upon transfer to a microfluidic platform where no amplification was observed. We demonstrate that this is caused by the suppression of all secondary processes that could amplify the seeds in the complete absence of mechanical perturbations inside the microdroplets. We further show that the amplification inside droplets can be achieved by subjecting the microemulsions to high-frequency vibrations using a piezo device. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the physical requirements of alpha-synuclein seed amplification and demonstrate a pathway towards the development of effective digital SAAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating the Coverage of Adsorbed Hydrogen via Hydrogen Spillover Enables Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Phenol to Cyclohexanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We modulated the surface coverage of adsorbed hydrogen species (Hads) on Pt via hydrogen spillover in an anatase TiO2&#8208;supported Pt catalyst (Pt/TiO2), which exhibited a high selectivity (94&#8201;%) and good Faradaic efficiency (FE, 63&#8201;%) for cyclohexanone. We revealed that TiO2&#8208;induced hydrogen spillover contributed to low adsorbed hydrogen species coverage over Pt, which effectively hindered over&#8208;hydrogenation of cyclohexanone and HER.







Abstract
Selective electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of phenol is a sustainable route to produce cyclohexanone, an industrially important feedstock for polymer synthesis. However, attaining high selectivity and faradaic efficiency (FE) for cyclohexanone remain challenging, owning to over&#8208;hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanol and competition of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, by employing hydrogen spillover effect, we modulate adsorbed hydrogen species (Hads) coverage on Pt surface via migration to TiO2 in an anatase TiO2&#8208;supported Pt catalyst. In ECH of phenol, a high selectivity (94&#8201;%) and good FE (63&#8201;%) for cyclohexanone are obtained, showing more advantageous performance compared with previous reports. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests and electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveal that Hads migrated from Pt to TiO2. We propose that TiO2&#8208;induced hydrogen spillover contributes to low Hads coverage over Pt, which effectively hinders over&#8208;hydrogenation of cyclohexanone and HER. We establish a scaling relationship between the intensity of hydrogen spillover and cyclohexanone selectivity by varying the types of anatase TiO2, and show the universality of the strategy over other reducible metal oxides as the support (rutile TiO2, CeO2 and WO3). This work showcases an effective strategy for tuning hydrogenation selectivity in electro&#8208;catalysis, by taking advantage of thermo&#8208;catalytically well&#8208;documented hydrogen spillover effect.

         <title>Thermal Bistability of Magnetic Susceptibility, Light Absorption, Second Harmonic Generation, and Dielectric Properties in a Polar Spin&#8208;Crossover Iron&#8211;Rhenium Chain Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of iron(II) centers with phenyl isonicotinate and octacyanidorhenate(V) leads to a polar molecule&#8208;based material incorporating heterometallic Fe(II)&#8722;Re(V) cyanido&#8208;bridged chains. It exhibits a thermally induced cooperative spin crossover (high&#8208;spin&#8208;to&#8208;low&#8208;spin) transition on Fe(II) sites which results in remarkable thermal bistability of magnetic, visible&#8208;light absorption, second&#8208;harmonic generation, and dielectric properties.







Abstract
The bistability of multiple physical properties driven by external stimuli in a solid is a desired prerequisite for its application in memory devices with convenient data readout. We present a pathway for thermal bistability detectable in four physical properties: magnetic, light absorption, second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), and dielectric. We report a novel heterometallic (TBA){[FeII(phIN)4][ReV(CN)8]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(phIN) (1) (TBA=tetrabutylammonium cation, phIN=phenyl isonicotinate) cyanido&#8208;bridged chain material. Owing to an appropriate {N6} coordination sphere of Fe(II) centers, 1 reveals a thermal spin crossover (SCO) effect which is complete and cooperative providing a distinct thermal hysteresis loop in magnetic measurements. Moreover, it exhibits simultaneous thermal bistability in (a) visible&#8208;light absorption due to the presence of efficient d&#8208;d electronic transitions in the low&#8208;spin (LS) state, (b) SHG activity as it crystallizes in a polar Cc space group due to the bulky substituent on phIN ligands, and (c) dielectric parameters, including dielectric constant, which can be correlated with subtle changes in polarity between LS and HS (high spin) phases. Thus, we present a remarkable thermally controlled hysteretic behavior in four physical functionalities realized by properly functionalizing an SCO&#8208;active coordination compound.

         <title>Freestanding Phosphonium Covalent Organic Frameworks with Efficient Hydroxide Conduction for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkaline&#8208;stable phosphonium&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) work as durable and efficient hydroxide conductors for zinc&#8211;air battery applications. Especially, the COFs with a minimal ion exchange capacity of 1.17&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 resulted in 126&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C, and batteries with the COF electrolytes demonstrated stable operation over 2,300&#8197;min.







Abstract
Owing to their well&#8208;defined crystalline pore structures and ordered functional ionic groups along the skeleton, ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) exhibit excellent performance and have significant potential for use in energy storage and conversion devices. Herein, we for the first time developed cationic phosphonium COFs with high hydroxide conduction even with low ion exchange capacity (IEC). Specifically, we synthesized COFs containing quaternary phosphonium groups as excellent ion transport moieties. Then, we fabricated freestanding phosphonium membranes through a vapor&#8208;assisted method, which exhibited high hydroxide conductivity of 126&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C from a minimal IEC of 1.17&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1. The resulting film was successfully applied to zinc&#8211;air batteries, demonstrating energy density of 96.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, specific capacity of 95.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stable operation over 2,300&#8197;min. Overall, in addition to investigating a novel cationic functional group, we demonstrated a freestanding film formation method of COF&#8208;based materials. The findings can provide a solid foundation for advancing the field of iCOFs to ion transport and promoting electrochemical applications.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic CH4&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Conversion by Limiting Interfacial Hydroxyl Radicals Using Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
BiVO4 with surface Au nanoparticle&#8208;functionalization (BiVO4@Au) was fabricated to enable both photogeneration and in situ consumption of &#8901;OH radicals near the photocatalytic interface, leading to a much enhanced &#8901;CH3/&#8901;OH ratio for C&#8722;C coupling toward direct and efficient photocatalytic CH4&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CH4 oxidation to ethanol with high selectivity is attractive but substantially challenging. The activation of inert C&#8722;H bonds at ambient conditions requires highly reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH), while the presence of those oxidative species also facilitates fast formation of C1 products, instead of the kinetically sluggish C&#8722;C coupling to produce ethanol. Herein, we developed a BiVO4 photocatalyst with surface functionalization of Au nanoparticles (BiVO4@Au), which not only enables photogeneration of &#8901;OH to activate CH4 into &#8901;CH3, but also in situ consumes those &#8901;OH species to retard their further attack on &#8901;CH3, resulting in an enhanced &#8901;CH3/&#8901;OH ratio and facilitating C&#8722;C coupling toward ethanol. The &#8901;CH3/&#8901;OH ratio is further improved by transporting CH4 via a gas&#8208;diffusion layer to the photocatalytic interface, leading to even higher ethanol selectivity and production rates. At ambient conditions and without photosensitizers or sacrificial agents, the BiVO4@Au photocatalyst exhibited an outstanding CH4&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion performance, including a peak ethanol yield of 680&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, a high selectivity of 86&#8201;%, and a stable photoconversion of &gt;100&#8197;h, substantially exceeding most of the previous reports. Our work suggests an attractive approach of in situ generation and modulation of the &#8901;OH levels for photocatalytic CH4 conversion toward multi&#8208;carbon products.

&lt;p&gt;BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with surface Au nanoparticle-functionalization (BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@Au) was fabricated to enable both photogeneration and in situ consumption of &#8901;OH radicals near the photocatalytic interface, leading to a much enhanced &#8901;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/&#8901;OH ratio for C&#8722;C coupling toward direct and efficient photocatalytic CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-to-ethanol conversion.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; oxidation to ethanol with high selectivity is attractive but substantially challenging. The activation of inert C&#8722;H bonds at ambient conditions requires highly reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH), while the presence of those oxidative species also facilitates fast formation of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; products, instead of the kinetically sluggish C&#8722;C coupling to produce ethanol. Herein, we developed a BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalyst with surface functionalization of Au nanoparticles (BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@Au), which not only enables photogeneration of &#8901;OH to activate CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; into &#8901;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, but also in situ consumes those &#8901;OH species to retard their further attack on &#8901;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in an enhanced &#8901;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/&#8901;OH ratio and facilitating C&#8722;C coupling toward ethanol. The &#8901;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/&#8901;OH ratio is further improved by transporting CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; via a gas-diffusion layer to the photocatalytic interface, leading to even higher ethanol selectivity and production rates. At ambient conditions and without photosensitizers or sacrificial agents, the BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@Au photocatalyst exhibited an outstanding CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-to-ethanol conversion performance, including a peak ethanol yield of 680&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a high selectivity of 86&#8201;%, and a stable photoconversion of &amp;gt;100&#8197;h, substantially exceeding most of the previous reports. Our work suggests an attractive approach of in situ generation and modulation of the &#8901;OH levels for photocatalytic CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion toward multi-carbon products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bowl&#8208;Shaped Anthracene&#8208;Fused Antiaromatic Ni(II) Norcorrole: Synthesis, Structure, Assembly with C60, and Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triple fusion of a Ni(II) norcorrole unit with anthracene units deforms the antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;conjugated core into a bowl&#8208;shaped conformation, which enables effective fullerene binding in the solution and solid states via convex&#8211;concave interactions. The extension of &#960;&#8208;conjugation by the anthracene moieties enhances the absorption bands into the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) region. The NIR&#8208;absorbing properties of the fused anthrylnorcorroles together with their antiaromatic character induce effective photothermal&#8208;conversion properties.







Abstract
The synthesis of bowl&#8208;shaped antiaromatic molecules is challenging because the molecular distortion further destabilizes these already inherently reactive molecules. Here, we report the synthesis and properties of bowl&#8208;shaped fused anthrylnorcorroles that exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption reaching 1900&#8197;nm. The oxidation of meso&#8208;anthryldibromodipyrrin provides fused anthryldibromodipyrrin, which was converted to the fused mono&#8208; and bisanthrylnorcorroles through Ni(0)&#8208;mediated intramolecular coupling with a bis(dibromodipyrrin) Ni(II) complex. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses revealed bowl&#8208;shaped structures for the fused mono&#8208; and bisanthrylnorcorroles, which enables them to act as suitable receptors for C60 with bonding constants of 2.89&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 and 1.59&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1, respectively. The formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex between the fused monoanthrylnorcorrole and C60 was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The effective expansion of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation through the triple fusion of the norcorrole with the anthracene units substantially enhances the near&#8208;infrared absorption bands, which endows these anthrylnorcorroles with effective photothermal conversion.

         <title>Harnessing of Cooperative Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H Interactions for Luminescent Low&#8208;Coordinate Copper(I) Complexes towards Stable OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular anagostic Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions are leveraged for the design of luminescent low&#8208;coordinate copper(I) complexes. Without using sterically bulky substituents on the carbene ligand, the copper(I) complexes exhibit excellent thermal stability. Featuring with high&#8208;efficiency and short&#8208;lived thermally activated delayed fluorescence, the copper(I) complexes demonstrate exceptional electroluminescence properties with high external quantum efficiency, little efficiency roll&#8208;off and long operational lifetimes.







Abstract
Although two&#8208;coordinate Cu(I) complexes are highly promising low&#8208;cost emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), the exposed metal center in the linear coordination geometry makes them suffer from poor stability. Herein, we describe a strategy to develop stable carbene&#8208;Cu&#8208;amide complexes through installing intramolecular noncovalent Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions. The employment of 13H&#8208;dibenzo[a,i]carbazole (DBC) as the amide ligand leads to short Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H distances in addition to the Cu&#8722;N coordination bond. The resultant Cu(I) complexes exhibit yellow thermally activated delayed fluorescence with photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 86&#8201;% and radiative decay rate constants on the order of 106&#8197;s&#8722;1. Comparing with the analogues without Cu&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H interactions, the pincer complexes have significantly improved stability. The vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs show high&#8208;performance electroluminescence with maximum external quantum efficiencies of up to 29.5&#8201;% and extremely small roll&#8208;offs of only 3.5&#8201;% at 10,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Remarkably, the operational lifetimes (LT90) are up to 68&#8197;h with an initial luminance of 3000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This work proves a feasible design of robust low&#8208;coordinate metal complexes by leveraging secondary coordination interactions, which helps to overcome the long&#8208;standing stability problem.

         <title>Programmable Modular Assembly of Homochiral Ir(III)&#8208;Metallohelices to Reverse Metallodrug Resistance by Inhibiting CDK1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel programmable modular assembly approach was developed for the construction of homochiral, luminescent dinuclear Ir(III) metallohelices with flexible dithiourea linkages. The metallohelices exhibit significant chirality&#8208;dependent photocytotoxicities and CDK1&#8208;specific targeting ability, offering innovative insights into the design of chiral helical metallodrugs aimed at reversing metallodrug resistance.







Abstract
Drug resistance is a major cause of cancer recurrence and poor prognosis. The innovative design and synthesis of inhibitors to target drug&#8208;resistance&#8208;specific proteins is highly desirable. However, challenges remain in precisely adjusting their conformation and stereochemistry to adapt the chiral regions of target proteins. Herein, using a stepwise programmable modular assembly approach, we precisely engineered two pairs of homochiral dinuclear Ir(III) metallohelices (&#923;2S4&#8208;Hbpy and &#916;2R4&#8208;Hbpy, &#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpy and &#923;2R4&#8208;Hbpy) functionalized with flexible dithiourea linkages. The resulting homochiral metallohelices exhibited significant chirality&#8208;dependent photocytotoxicities, and the enhanced structural compatibility of &#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpy with the target cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase&#8197;1 (CDK1) contributed to its superior photodynamic therapy efficacy, achieving an outstanding photocytotoxicity index (PI) value of 2.3&#215;104. Interestingly, emerging as a critical mediator in the development of oxaliplatin resistance, CDK1 targeting by &#916;2S4&#8208;Hbpy achieved enhanced cellular uptake, anticancer activity, and oncosis&#8208;mediated cell death in oxaliplatin&#8208;resistant HCT&#8208;8/L cells. Mechanistic investigations, including proteomic profiling and CDK1 gene silencing, confirmed the pivotal role of chirality&#8208;selective CDK1 targeting in reversing metallodrug resistance. This study introduces a promising platform for constructing and customizing flexible metallohelices with precise conformation and stereochemistry to target drug&#8208;resistance&#8208;specific proteins, offering innovative insights into the designability of metallodrugs to overcome drug resistance.

&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;bpy&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with the target cyclin-dependent kinase&#8197;1 (CDK1) contributed to its superior photodynamic therapy efficacy, achieving an outstanding photocytotoxicity index (PI) value of 2.3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;

   &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-H&lt;sub&gt;bpy&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; achieved enhanced cellular uptake, anticancer activity, and oncosis-mediated cell death in oxaliplatin-resistant HCT-8/L cells. Mechanistic investigations, including proteomic profiling and CDK1 gene silencing, confirmed the pivotal role of chirality-selective CDK1 targeting in reversing metallodrug resistance. This study introduces a promising platform for constructing and customizing flexible metallohelices with precise conformation and stereochemistry to target drug-resistance-specific proteins, offering innovative insights into the designability of metallodrugs to overcome drug resistance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Using Near&#8208;Infrared Irradiation for Heating Mechanochemical Reactions in Organic&#8208;Dye&#8208;Doped Epoxy Milling Jars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New milling jars, made of epoxy resin doped with an organic dye, were manufactured to perform heat&#8208;controlled organic transformations upon NIR irradiation. Reactions that require external heat even under solvent&#8208;free ball&#8208;milling conditions could then be performed efficiently.







Abstract
Albeit mechanochemistry is a novel promising technology that gives access to reactivity under solvent&#8208;free conditions, heating such reactions is sometimes compulsory to obtain satisfactory results in terms of conversion, selectivity and/or yield. In this work, we developed a novel approach using a dye that absorbs NIR photons and release the energy as heat. Hence, de novo milling jars in epoxy resin doped with the dye were thus produced to obtain reactors that would produce heat upon irradiation at 850&#8197;nm. Temperature profiles were recorded, depending on the irradiance, dye charge in the resin, and milling frequency, showing an excellent control of the temperature. The usefulness of the heating jar was then demonstrated in mechanochemical reactions that are known to require heat to yield the desired product, namely Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with high activation energies and the newly developed rearrangement of a sydnone into corresponding 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one.

         <title>Modulating Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Phenothiazine Dioxide via External Heavy Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
External halogen&#8208;&#960; interactions have been demonstrated to be a key feature for the development of ultralong phosphorescent material. A phenothiazine dioxide (DOPTZ) featuring a chloride atom linked through a flexible alkyl chain (DOPTZ&#8208;C3Cl) exhibits an ultralong phosphorescence lifetime of 1351&#8197;ms and a phosphorescence quantum yield of 10.1&#8201;%, the highest values among phenothiazine&#8208;based phosphorescent substances.







Abstract
Developing pure organic materials with ultralong lifetimes and balanced quantum efficiency is attractive but challenging. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to investigate external heavy atoms by linking molecular emitters with halogen through a flexible alkyl chain. X&#8208;ray crystal analysis clearly reveal the halogen C&#8722;X&#8208;&#960; interactions, which can be tuned by halogen donors, as well as the distance and geometry between them. Impressively, DOPTZ&#8208;C3Cl featuring a chloride atom as donor, exhibits a balanced long phosphorescence lifetime of 1351&#8197;ms and a phosphorescence quantum yield of 10.1&#8201;%. We also first demonstrate that Cl can induce more positive effect than heavier halogens (Br and I) on prolonging the lifetime. We envisage that the present study will expedite new molecular design to manipulate the room temperature phosphorescence via external heavy atom effect, and highlight a special C&#8722;Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction for the development of ultralong phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Engineering d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization in a Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

A novel electrocatalytic strategy in composite solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (CPEs) is presented. By tuning the coupling strength between d and p orbitals of inorganic fillers, identified by the newly developed &#955; descriptor through density functional theory calculations and machine learning, the incorporation of titanium single atoms into ZIF&#8208;8 significantly promotes lithium salt dissociation and enhances CPEs&#8217; electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Regulating lithium salt dissociation kinetics by enhancing the interaction between inorganic fillers and lithium salts is vital for enhancing the ionic conductivity in solid&#8208;state composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). However, the influence of fillers&#8217; external electronic environments on lithium salt dissociation dynamics remains unclear. Here, we design single&#8208;atom sites in metal&#8211;organic framework fillers for poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based CPEs, boosting lithium salt dissociation through an electrocatalytic strategy. This strategy enhances lithium&#8208;ion conductivity by tuning the coupling strength between the d and p orbitals of the fillers, as captured by a newly identified descriptor (&#955;) via high&#8208;throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning. The optimal single atom (Ti) sites are incorporated into a ZIF&#8208;8 matrix for PEO&#8208;based CPEs, achieving an ionic conductivity exceeding 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C. Additionally, the electrolyte forms a robust solid electrolyte interphase and is compatible with LiCoO2, LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2, and sulfur cathodes. Consequently, the solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery with the electrolyte demonstrates excellent cycling stability, maintaining performance over 5000 cycles at 10&#8197;C with LiFePO4 cathodes and stable operation at &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C. These findings highlight the transformative potential of engineering d&#8208;p orbital hybridization by incorporating single&#8208;atom sites into inorganic fillers for designing highly ion&#8208;conductive CPEs.

         <title>Methylthio Substituent in SAM Constructing Regulatory Bridge with Photovoltaic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we introduced the MeS&#8208; substituent into SAM HTL materials, which enables stronger interactions with the buried perovskite interface, and offers better HOMO energy level alignment compared to the methoxy group. MeS&#8722;CbzPh based inverted perovskite photovoltaics achieved a champion efficiency of 26.01&#8201;%, along with exceptional stability. Notably, the MeS&#8208; group demonstrated remarkable versatility. These findings present a novel strategy for designing new SAM materials to enhance the performance of inverted PSCs.







Abstract
Inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have experienced remarkable advancements in recent years, which is largely attributed to the development of novel hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) materials. Methoxy (MeO&#8722;) groups are typically introduced into SAM materials to enhance their wettability and effectively passivate the perovskite buried interface. However, MeO&#8208;based SAM materials exhibit a mismatch in highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels with perovskite layer due to the strong electron&#8208;donating capability of methoxy group. In this work, we introduced a methylthio (MeS&#8722;) substituent that is superior to methoxy as a highly versatile self&#8208;assembled molecular design strategy. As a soft base, sulfur atom forms a stronger Pb&#8722;S bond than oxygen. Additionally, within the CbzPh series of SAM materials, MeS&#8722;CbzPh demonstrates a more optimal HOMO level and enhanced hole transport properties. Consequently, the MeS&#8722;CbzPh HTL based device achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.01&#8201;% and demonstrated high stability, retaining 93.3&#8201;% efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Moreover, in comparison with the commonly used 4PACz&#8208;based SAM molecular series, MeS&#8208;4PACz also exhibited the best performance among its peers. Our work provides valuable insights for the molecular design of SAM materials, offering a highly versatile functional substituent group.

Consequently, the MeS&#8722;CbzPh HTL based device achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.01&#8201;% and demonstrated high stability, retaining 93.3&#8201;% efficiency after 1000&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Moreover, in comparison with the commonly used 4PACz-based SAM molecular series, MeS-4PACz also exhibited the best performance among its peers. Our work provides valuable insights for the molecular design of SAM materials, offering a highly versatile functional substituent group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalytic Alkaline Water Splitting by Porous Macrocyclic Proton Sponges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superbasic aza&#8208;calixarene&#8208;based triamine (CalixNH2) with a tripyridinic core was designed to enhance alkaline HER by facilitating proton abstraction and water splitting. Porous polymers TpCalix and DhaCalix, synthesized using CalixNH2, showed distinct performance, with TpCalix achieving an overpotential of 112(&#177;2) mV for HER and 290(&#177;2) mV for OER at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A two&#8208;electrode system using TpCalix operated at 1.73&#8197;V with 12&#8197;hours of stability.







Abstract
Macrocycles are unique as they encapsulate and transfer guest molecules or ions and facilitate catalytic processes. Although metalated macrocycles are pivotal in electrocatalytic processes, using metal&#8208;free analogs has been rare. Following the strategy of Kanbara et&#8197;al., we synthesized an azacalixarene macrocycle&#8208;N, N&#8217;, N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;tris(p&#8208;aminophenyl)azacalix[3](2,6)pyridine (CalixNH2). The macrocycle encapsulates a proton in its cavity, maintaining the protonation even in highly alkaline media. Notably, it retains almost 50&#8201;% protonated form in 1&#8197;M KOH (~pH&#8197;14)&#8208;acting as a proton sponge. As hydrogen evolution is complex in alkaline media owing to sluggish water dissociation, we implemented the proton sponge (CalixNH2) in an alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. Conjugated Porous polymers, TpCalix and DhaCalix, have been synthesized from the triamine&#8208;CalixNH2. The most efficient catalyst, TpCalix, has shown excellent performance in alkaline HER and OER in 1&#8197;M KOH (~pH&#8197;14), with low overpotentials of only 112(&#177;2) and 290(&#177;2) mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and durable up to 24&#8197;hours. A full&#8208;cell reaction using TpCalix in both the cathode and anode exhibited a low full&#8208;cell voltage of 1.73&#8197;V and was stable for 12&#8197;hours. DFT calculations verified the tripyridinic core, which acts as the principal site for proton abstraction and binding.

         <title>Stimulating the Potential of Zn Anodes to Operate in Low pH and Harsh Environments forHighly Sustainable Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a conversion&#8208;type interphase strategy for Zn anodes using phosphate, sulfate precipitation, and phytic acid modification layers to enable stable operation in acidic electrolytes (pH = 2.2). This approach achieves over 3,600 hours of stable Zn stripping/plating and enables Zn||Mn batteries to operate with high voltage output. Notably, seawater&#8208;based pouch cells demonstrate a practical energy density of 57.4 Wh/kg, highlighting seawater&#8242;s potential as an economical electrolyte solvent for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.







Abstract
Compared to near&#8208;neutral electrolytes (pH=3&#8211;6), Zn||Mn batteries in acidic environments can achieve voltages up to ~2&#8197;V. However, high proton concentrations raise concerns about Zn anode stability. Current strategies for inhibiting hydrogen evolution corrosion (HEC) on the anode in Zn&#8208;based batteries mainly focus on the near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. To supplement this gap, we developed a conversion&#8208;type interphase strategy using phosphate, sulfate precipitation, and phytic acid modification layers for Zn anodes to demonstrate the potential of Zn anode to operate in acidic electrolytes. This approach enables stable Zn stripping/plating at pH=2.2 for over 3,600&#8197;h and 400&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Benefiting from stable Zn electrodes, the electrolytic Zn||Mn batteries can operate at 1.90&#8197;V. To show more harsh scenarios, the seawater&#8208;based 0.25&#8197;Ah&#8208;scale Zn||Mn pouch cells can be assembled with a practical energy density of 57.4&#8197;Wh&#8201; kg&#8208;1 cell. Significantly, we analyze and emphasize that seawater holds promise as an alternative to deionized water for electrolyte solvents due to its energy and economic effectiveness. This strategy has motivated to expand the working pH range of metal anodes and provides the rational design for grid&#8208;scale energy storage technologies.

         <title>Microbe Engineering to Provide Drimane&#8208;Type Building Blocks for Chiral Pool Synthesis of Meroterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through rational engineering of PhoN and the incorporation of a Nudix hydrolase, an optimized PhoN&#8208;IPK system was developed, enabling the efficient production of drimane&#8208;type building blocks of drimenol (398&#8197;mg/L) and albicanol (3.5&#8197;g/L). Albicanol, serving as a versatile chiral pool precursor, facilitated the direct and concise synthesis of a variety of drimane&#8208;type merosesquiterpenoids.







Abstract
Drimane&#8208;type merosesquiterpenoids (DMT) are a class of natural products with diverse structures and broad biological activity. Classical DMT synthesis relies on atom&#8208;inefficient plant&#8208;derived chiral pool building blocks, while alternative drimane&#8208;type building blocks such as drimenol and albicanol offer more direct routes but face production challenges. In this study, we engineered a microbial platform for efficient production of these building blocks. By optimizing the PhoN&#8208;IPK system through rational engineering and incorporating a Nudix hydrolase, we achieved a drimenol production of 398&#8197;mg/L and high albicanol titers of 1805&#8197;mg/L in shake flasks and 3.5&#8197;g/L in a bioreactor. Structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulations of the engineered PhoN provided insights into its improved catalytic efficiency. We demonstrated the utility of this platform by synthesizing several DMT using albicanol as the starting material, reducing the number of synthetic steps and improving overall efficiency as compared to classical approaches.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Tailored EDL Induced Triple&#8208;Layer SEI on High&#8208;Capacity Anodes Enabling Fast&#8208;Charging and Durable Sodium&#8208;Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dense thin triple&#8208;layer solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (inner: Se, mediate: inorganic, outer: organic) is formed on Se&#8208;FeS2 anode via Sex2&#8722; anion&#8208;tailored electric double layer in NaCF3SO3/diglyme electrolyte, which ensures lower ion transport barrier and greatly suppresses the electrolyte substantial consumption. The Se&#8208;FeS2 enables high reversible capacity and ultra&#8208;long cycling life at fast&#8208;charging mode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
High&#8208;capacity electrodes face a great challenge of cycling stability due to particle fragmentation induced conductive network failure and accompanied by sustained electrolyte decomposition for repeatedly build solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, Se&#8208;solubility induced Sex2&#8722; as self&#8208;adjustment electrolyte additive to regulate electric double layer (EDL) for constructing novel triple&#8208;layer SEI (inner layer: Se; mediate layer: inorganic; outer layer: organic) on high&#8208;capacity FeS2 anode as an example for achieving stable and fast sodium storage. In detail, Sex2&#8722; in situ generated at 1.30&#8197;V (vs. Na+/Na) and was preferentially adsorbed onto EDL of anode, then converted to Se0 as inner layer of SEI. In addition, the Sex2&#8722; causes anion&#8208;enhanced Na+ solvation structure could produce more inorganic (Se0, NaF) and less organic SEI components. The unique triple&#8208;layer SEI with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer dense structure alleviate the excessive electrolyte consumption with less gas evolution. As a result, the anode delivered long&#8208;lifespan at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (383.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, 6000&#8197;cycles, 93.1&#8201;%, 5&#8197;min/cycle). The Se&#8208;induced triple&#8208;layer SEI could be also be formed on high&#8208;capacity SnS2 anode.

     alt="Anion-Tailored EDL Induced Triple-Layer SEI on High-Capacity Anodes Enabling Fast-Charging and Durable Sodium-Storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dense thin triple-layer solid-electrolyte interphase (inner: Se, mediate: inorganic, outer: organic) is formed on Se-FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; anode via Se&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion-tailored electric double layer in NaCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/diglyme electrolyte, which ensures lower ion transport barrier and greatly suppresses the electrolyte substantial consumption. The Se-FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enables high reversible capacity and ultra-long cycling life at fast-charging mode for sodium-ion batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-capacity electrodes face a great challenge of cycling stability due to particle fragmentation induced conductive network failure and accompanied by sustained electrolyte decomposition for repeatedly build solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, Se-solubility induced Se&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as self-adjustment electrolyte additive to regulate electric double layer (EDL) for constructing novel triple-layer SEI (inner layer: Se; mediate layer: inorganic; outer layer: organic) on high-capacity FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; anode as an example for achieving stable and fast sodium storage. In detail, Se&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in situ generated at 1.30&#8197;V (vs. Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na) and was preferentially adsorbed onto EDL of anode, then converted to Se&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; as inner layer of SEI. In addition, the Se&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; causes anion-enhanced Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation structure could produce more inorganic (Se&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, NaF) and less organic SEI components. The unique triple-layer SEI with layer-by-layer dense structure alleviate the excessive electrolyte consumption with less gas evolution. As a result, the anode delivered long-lifespan at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (383.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 6000&#8197;cycles, 93.1&#8201;%, 5&#8197;min/cycle). The Se-induced triple-layer SEI could be also be formed on high-capacity SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; anode. This work provides a novel SEI model by anion-tailored EDL towards stable sodium-storage of high-capacity anode for fast-charging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Access to Polyhydroxyalkanoates with Diverse Syndiotacticity via Polymerization by Spiro&#8208;Salen Complexes and Insights into the Stereocontrol Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spiro&#8208;salen catalytic system allows to establish a versatile platform of stereoregular PHA polymers with tunable thermal and mechanical properties which are comparable to commodity plastics. A combined experimental and computational study suggests a polymeric exchange mechanism could boost the polymerization activity and control the syndioselectivity.







Abstract
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have attracted broad interest as promising sustainable materials to address plastic pollution and resource scarcity. However, the chemical synthesis of stereoregular PHAs via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) has long been an elusive endeavor. In this contribution, we exploited a robust spiro&#8208;salen yttrium complex (Y3) as the catalyst to successfully prepare syndiotactic PHAs with diverse pendent groups. Simply altering the ratio of enantiomeric catalysts allowed to access of PHAs with diverse syndiotacticity (Pr=0.5&#8211;0.99, from sticky oil to tough materials), delivering tunable thermal properties (glass transition temperature, Tg from &#8722;52 to 70&#8201;&#176;C and melting transition temperature, Tm from 38 to 223&#8201;&#176;C). A combined experimental and computational study suggested a polymeric exchange mechanism could boost the polymerization activity and control the syndioselectivity.

         <title>Sulfurized Composite Interphase Enables a Highly Reversible Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new role of &#8208;SO3 and ZnS in the in situ formed sulfide composite SEI (SCSEI) can not only reduce the dehydration energy of [Zn(H2O)6]2+, but also enhance the stability of the ZnS/Zn interface and homogenize the ZnS/Zn interface electric field, thereby significantly improving the dynamic kinetics and uniform deposition of Zn2+.







Abstract
The stability and reversibility of Zn anode can be greatly improved by in situ construction of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Zn surface via a low&#8208;cost design strategy of ZnSO4 electrolyte. However, the role of hydrogen bond acceptor &#8208;SO3 accompanying ZnS formation during SEI reconstruction is overlooked. In this work, we have explored and revealed the new role of &#8208;SO3 and ZnS in the in situ formed sulfide composite SEI (SCSEI) on Zn anode electrochemistry in ZnSO4 aqueous electrolytes. Structure characterization and DFT demonstrate that the introduction of &#8208;SO3 can not only reduce the dehydration energy of [Zn(H2O)6]2+, but also enhance the stability of the ZnS/Zn interface and homogenize the ZnS/Zn interface electric field, thereby significantly improving the dynamic kinetics and uniform deposition of Zn2+. Owing to the synergistic effect of ZnS and &#8208;SO3, a high cycling stability of 1500&#8197;h with a cumulative&#8208;plated capacity of 7.5&#8197;Ah&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 has been achieved within the symmetrical cell. Furthermore, the full cell with NH4V4O10 cathode exhibits outstanding cyclic stability, exceeding 2000 cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintaining a Coulombic efficiency of 100&#8201;%. These new insights into anionic synergistic strategy could significantly enhance the practical application of zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Reductive C(sp2)&#8722;Si Cross&#8208;Couplings by Catalytic Sodium&#8208;Bromine Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a chemical transformation that exploits the sodium&#8208;bromine exchange reaction catalytically is presented. Using stable tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted silyldiazenes (tBu&#8722;N=N&#8722;SiR3) as silylating reagents, various (hetero)aryl bromides have been converted to the corresponding organosilicon compounds using inexpensive sodium alkoxides as catalytic promoters. Mechanistic studies point to the involvement of tert&#8208;butylsodium (tBuNa) that mediates the key Na/Br exchange event.







Abstract
The metal&#8208;halogen exchange reaction constitutes one of the most important preparative routes towards polar organometallic reagents such as aryllithium or Grignard reagents. However, despite extensive developments over the past eight decades, this fundamental organometallic elementary step has only been exploited stoichiometrically. Against this background, we demonstrate that the sodium&#8208;bromine exchange reaction can be implemented in a catalytic setting as a mean to activate C(sp2)&#8722;Br bonds in a transition metal&#8208;free manner en route to the regioselective and general preparation of (hetero)aryl silanes. Simply treating structurally diverse (hetero)aryl bromides with N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;silyldiazenes (tBu&#8722;N=N&#8722;Si) as silylating reagents and inexpensive sodium alkoxides as catalytic promoters yields a range of aromatic organosilicon compounds under ambient conditions. Mechanistic studies provide solid evidence for the involvement of tert&#8208;butyl sodium as the C(sp2)&#8722;Br metalating agent.

         <title>Reconstructing the Coordination Environment of Fe/Co Dual&#8208;atom Sites towards Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination environment of the Fe/Co dual&#8208;atom site can be tuned by preferentially removing the pyrrolic nitrogen over the pyridinic nitrogen, resulting in a shorter Fe&#8722;N to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction, and promoting an in&#8208;plane oxygen reconstruction to lower the energy barrier in the oxygen evolution reaction. The catalyst with the modified Fe/Co dual&#8208;atom sites exhibits superior oxygen electrocatalysis in a Zn&#8208;air battery.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal sites embedded in carbon can drive the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), and the further improvement is limited by the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding energies in the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM).

     alt="Reconstructing the Coordination Environment of Fe/Co Dual-atom Sites towards Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coordination environment of the Fe/Co dual-atom site can be tuned by preferentially removing the pyrrolic nitrogen over the pyridinic nitrogen, resulting in a shorter Fe&#8722;N to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction, and promoting an in-plane oxygen reconstruction to lower the energy barrier in the oxygen evolution reaction. The catalyst with the modified Fe/Co dual-atom sites exhibits superior oxygen electrocatalysis in a Zn-air battery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual-atom catalysts with nitrogen-coordinated metal sites embedded in carbon can drive the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), and the further improvement is limited by the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding energies in the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is promising to overcome this challenge, but has yet been verified since the lacking of bridge oxygen (O) in the rigid coordination environment of the metal centers. Here, we demonstrate that suitably tailored dual-atom catalysts of FeCo&#8722;N&#8722;C can undergo out-plane and in-plane reconstruction to form the both axial O and bridge O at the metal centers, and thus activate the LOM pathway. The tailored FeCo&#8722;N&#8722;C with shortened Fe&#8722;N bonds also favors the ORR process, therefore is a promising dual-atom oxygen catalyst. The assembled rechargeable ZABs demonstrate a peak power density of 332&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and exhibit no notable decline after ~720&#8197;h of continuous cycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric S&#8208;Arylation of Sulfenamides to Access Axially Chiral Sulfilimines Enabled by Anionic Stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Cobalt(III) Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
An adaptive Cu/anionic stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Co(III) complex combined catalysis is established for the enantioselective S&#8208;arylation of sulfenamides, precisely accessing various multi&#8208;chiral sulfilimines with excellent efficiencies and selectivity (67 examples, 12 possible isomers, up to 98&#8201;% ee). The S&#8208;arylation/pyramidal inversion sequence enables efficient stereodivegent synthesis of all four stereoisomers of multi&#8208;chiral sulfilimines.







Abstract
An efficient enantioselective coupling reaction between sulfenamides and cyclic diaryliodonium salts is established via adaptive Cu/anionic stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;Co(III) complex combined catalysis, precisely synthesizing a broad range of axially chiral sulfilimines with excellent enantioselectivities, diastereoselectivities, regioselectivities, and chemoselectivities (67 examples under same conditions, up to 98&#8201;% ee). The following thermodynamically controlled pyramidal inversion enables efficient stereodivegent synthesis of all four stereoisomers. Mechanistic studies suggest that anionic stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cobalt(III) complexes serve as counteranions of diaryliodonium and anionic ligand of Cu(I) catalyst simultaneously, which could be regarded as an explanation for outstanding selectivities.

         <title>Improving the Cellular Internalization of Zr(IV) Nanocages by Tuning Hydrophilicity and Lipophilicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decorating the ligand of a zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cage with a Ru(II) complex was found to not only improve the water solubility but also endow bright red fluorescence with a large Stokes shift (180&#8197;nm). Additionally, butyl modifications on the cyclopentadienyl anion rings of the Zr&#8722;O clusters fine&#8208;tuned the hydrophilicity and lipophilicity of the nanocages, thereby achieving outstanding live&#8208;cell imaging capabilities.







Abstract
Nanoscale molecular materials have emerged as a new class of compounds at the nanometer scale with well&#8208;defined chemical structures, remarkable uniformity and high reproducibility. Among these materials, zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional stability and applications in catalysis, recognition and separation and so on. However, their poor water solubility impedes their biomedical applications. In this study, decorating the ligand with Ru(II) complexes can not only improve the water solubility but also endow bright red fluorescence with large Stokes shift (180&#8197;nm). Notably, butyl&#8208;modification of the cyclopentadiene rings can significantly enhance the cell uptake (100&#8197;folds) of nanocages via actin&#8208; and dynamin&#8208;mediated endocytosis. The unique advantages and easy modifiability of these nanocages make them highly promising candidates for diverse biological applications.

         <title>Boosting the Performance of Iridium Single Atom Catalyst in a Porous Organic Polymer for Glycerol Conversion to Lactic Acid</title>

Single Atom Catalysts (SACs) are a promising frontier in heterogeneous catalysis, combining the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems with high active metal site dispersion. A novel, stable Iridium (Ir) SAC catalyst synthesized by directly incorporating an active Ir complex within a porous organic polymer matrix exhibits exceptional efficiency and selectivity in converting glycerol to lactic acid.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) inherit the merit of both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems with atomically dispersed mononuclear metal centers on the solid supports. Herein, we developed an Ir&#8208;SAC catalyst via the polymerization of an active homogeneous 2&#8208;picolinylhydrazone ligand&#8208;based iridium (Ir) metal complex. Such catalysts provide great stabilization against migration and agglomeration due to the strong covalent C&#8722;C bond linkage of active complexes and the polymer matrix. This Ir&#8208;SAC catalyst shows excellent selectivity towards glycerol to lactic acid conversion with a remarkable recyclability to offer an unprecedentedly high TON of over 104 million under optimized conditions.

         <title>Dynamic Phosphorescence Behavior of Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amide Complexes from the Perspective of Excited State Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide complexes has been synthesized. The doped PMMA films demonstrate a light&#8208;induced dynamic phosphorescence phenomenon. Our research reveals that these complexes exhibit a long phosphorescence lifetime, a high intersystem crossing (ISC) rate, and significant phosphorescence intensity. These three characteristics enable the phosphorescence of the CMA complex&#8208;doped films to be activated by light, allowing for a change in the emission color of the films.







Abstract
Carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) complexes have diverse applications in luminescence, imaging and sensing. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of CMA complexes, which were subsequently doped into a PMMA host. These materials demonstrate light&#8208;induced dynamic phosphorescence, attributed to their long intrinsic triplet state lifetime (&#964;P,int, in the &#956;s&#8208;ms scale), high intersystem crossing (ISC) rate constant (kISC, up to 107&#8197;s&#8722;1), and bright phosphorescence. The extended &#964;P,int, and elevated kISC facilitate efficient sensitization of singlet oxygen (1O2) under light irradiation, which is rapidly consumed by the host material, creating a localized anaerobic environment conducive to bright phosphorescence emission. The Sn&#8208;T1 process exhibits a large spin&#8208;orbital coupling matrix element (SOCME) value, while the SOCME value between T1 and S0 is comparatively smaller, resulting in a large kISC and long &#964;P,int, Computational results indicate that the hole&#8208;electron configuration in the lowest triplet state exhibits low contributions from gold. Based on the dynamic phosphorescence properties, an encryption material capable of achieving a &#8220;burn after reading&#8221; effect was developed. This work illustrates that those phosphorescent emitters with minimal heavy atom contribution can produce dynamic phosphorescent phenomena, providing a novel strategy for designing stimuli&#8208;responsive phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Photoregulated Supramolecular Polymerization through Halogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we exploit halogen bonding (XB) interactions as a reversible network element to control the communication between stimuli&#8208;responses and self&#8208;assembly. This approach broadens the still limited scope of XB in solution assemblies and paves the way for multifunctional adaptive supramolecular systems.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers are able to change their structure, morphology and function in response to external stimuli. However, controlling the independence of stimuli&#8208;responses in these systems is challenging. Herein, we exploit halogen bonding (XB) as a reversible network element to regulate the photoresponsive and adaptive behavior of supramolecular polymers. To this end, we have designed a two&#8208;component system comprising an amphiphilic XB acceptor with the ability to self&#8208;assemble in aqueous media (OPE&#8208;Py) and a molecule with a dual photoresponsive and XB donor function [(E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I]. OPE&#8208;Py self&#8208;assembles in aqueous media into supramolecular polymers, which transform into nanoparticle assemblies upon co&#8208;assembly with (E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I. Interestingly, a third type of assembly (2D sheets) is obtained if OPE&#8208;Py is treated with (E)&#8208;Azo&#8208;I and exposed to photoirradiation. At ambient conditions, both nanoparticles and 2D sheets remain invariant over time. However, heating dissociates the XB interactions present in both assemblies, resulting in their transformation to the original fiber&#8208;like morphology of OPE&#8208;Py. Thus, breaking the communication between self&#8208;assembly and the stimuli&#8208;responses upon heating restores the original state of the system, drawing parallels to feedback loops in programming language. This work broadens the still limited scope of XB in solution assemblies and paves the way for multifunctional adaptive supramolecular systems.

         <title>Program&#8208;Modulated Kinetics of Perovskite&#8208;Film Growth by Molecular &#8220;Thruster&#8221; for High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

A molecular &#8220;thruster&#8221;, a hypervalent iodine (III) compound, was used to programmatically modulate the kinetics of perovskite film growth. This molecular &#8220;thruster&#8221; features three carbonyl groups and C&#8722;&#8722;I+ bond, which endows its strongly coordination and dissociation abilities, thus programmatically regulating perovskite film growth by retarding the reaction between FAI and PbI2, promoting solvent volatilization, and passivating the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects. Consequently, the resultant FAPbI3 film exhibits high&#8208;quality with enhanced phase purity, compact morphology, and significantly reduced defects. As a result, the pero&#8208;SCs simultaneously achieved outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) and excellent operational stability.







Abstract
The rapid reaction between lead iodide (PbI2) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) complicates the fabrication of high&#8208;quality formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) films. Conventional methods, such as using nonvolatile small molecular additives to slow the reaction, often result in buried interfacial voids and molecule diffusion, compromising the devices&#8217; operational stability. In this study, we introduced a molecular &#8220;thruster&#8221;&#8212;a hypervalent iodine (III) compound with three carbonyl groups and a C&#8722;&#8722;I+ bond&#8212;that possesses coordination and dissociation abilities, enabling programed modulation of perovskite&#8208;film growth kinetics. Initially, the three carbonyl groups coordinate with PbI2 to slow the reaction between FAI and PbI2, preventing &#948;&#8208;phase formation. As temperature rises, the C&#8722;&#8722;I+ bond dissociates, promoting perovskite growth and the dissociated product iodobenzene will promote solvent volatilization, thus avoiding buried interfacial voids. Another product, a carbene compound with eight lone pair electrons sufficiently passivate the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects and anchors at grain boundaries without diffusion. Consequently, the resultant FAPbI3 film displays high&#8208;quality with enhanced phase purity, compact morphology, and reduced defects. Evidently, 0.062&#8208; and 1.004&#8208;cm2 pero&#8208;SCs achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 26.06&#8201;% (25.79&#8201;% certified) and 24.65&#8201;%, respectively. This approach also controls perovskite&#8208;film growth on plastic substrates, resulting in flexible pero&#8208;SCs with an impressive PCE of 25.12&#8201;%.

         <title>Hydrogen/Electron Amphiphilic Bi&#8208;Functional Water Molecular Inactivator&#8208;Assisted Interface Stabilization in Highly Reversible Zn Metal Batteries</title>

Based on the suppression principle, PD with both electron and proton affinity can simultaneously suppress H2O activity and enhance interface stability. Specifically, the proton affinity could break H2O&#8208;rich hydrogen bond network to terminate proton transport in bulk electrolyte, and electron affinity guaranteed the competitive chemistry with H2O molecules to enable stable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface for aqueous zinc metal battery.







Abstract
Continuous hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;network in aqueous electrolytes can lead to uncontrollable hydrogen transfer, and combining the interfacial parasitic electron consumption cause the side reaction in aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs). Herein, hydrogen/electron amphiphilic bi&#8208;functional 1,5&#8208;Pentanediol (PD) molecule was introduced to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. Stronger proton affinity of &#8208;OH in PD can break bulk&#8208;H2O hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;network to inhibit the activity of water, and electron affinity can enhance electron acceptation capability, which ensures that PD is preferentially bound to electrode material over H2O. Besides, the participation of PD in the Zn2+ solvation structure reduces water content at the solid&#8211;liquid interface and promotes uniform deposition process by optimizing Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation energy. Accordingly, dense and vertical zinc texture based on intrinsic steric hindrance effect of PD and formed SEI protective layer to induce stable Zinc anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, an organic&#8211;inorganic shielding water layer was formed at the cathode side to suppress vanadium dissolution in vanadium Oxide. Consequently, Zn//Zn symmetric cell could cycle for more than 5600&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2@1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (more than 250&#8197;hours at 50&#8201;&#176;C). Besides, the VO2 and I2 cathode all achieved stable cycling performance and former pouch cell could reach average capacity of 0.13 Ah.

         <title>Engineered Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)&#8208;Responsive Artificial H+/Cl&#8722; Ion Channels for Targeted Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive artificial H+/Cl&#8722; ion channels are developed. ROS trigger the rapid release of the channel forming units, which self&#8208;assemble into stable H&#8208;bonded transmembrane cascades, facilitating efficient H+/Cl&#8722; co&#8208;transport. ROS&#8208;C&#8208;Cl exhibits significant cytotoxicity against human breast cancer cells and demonstrates exceptional selectivity over normal cells.







Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ion channels regulate the ion flow across the membranes in response to alterations in the cellular redox state, playing a crucial role in cellular adaptation to oxidative stress. Despite their significance, replicating ROS&#8208;responsive functionality in artificial ion channels remains elusive. In this study, we introduce a novel class of artificial H+/Cl&#8722; ion channels activatable by elevated ROS levels in cancer cells. ROS&#8208;induced decaging of the phenylboronate group triggers the rapid release of the channel&#8208;forming units, leading to self&#8208;assembly of the H&#8208;bonded cascades facilitating the synergistic transport of H+ and Cl&#8722; ions, with H+/Cl&#8722; ion transport selectivity of 7.7. Upon activation, ROS&#8208;C&#8208;Cl exhibits significant apoptotic activity against human breast cancer cells, achieving an IC50 of 2.8&#8197;&#956;M, comparable to that of paclitaxel. Exploiting the intrinsic oxidative microenvironment of cancer cells, along with the enhanced oxidative stress arising from H+/Cl&#8722; co&#8208;transport, ROS&#8208;C&#8208;Cl demonstrates exceptional selectivity in targeting cancer cells with a selectivity index of 10.2 over normal breast cells, outperforming that of paclitaxel by 19.4 folds.

ROS trigger the rapid release of the channel forming units, which self-assemble into stable H-bonded transmembrane cascades, facilitating efficient H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; co-transport. &lt;b&gt;ROS-C-Cl&lt;/b&gt; exhibits significant cytotoxicity against human breast cancer cells and demonstrates exceptional selectivity over normal cells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive ion channels regulate the ion flow across the membranes in response to alterations in the cellular redox state, playing a crucial role in cellular adaptation to oxidative stress. Despite their significance, replicating ROS-responsive functionality in artificial ion channels remains elusive. In this study, we introduce a novel class of artificial H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion channels activatable by elevated ROS levels in cancer cells. ROS-induced decaging of the phenylboronate group triggers the rapid release of the channel-forming units, leading to self-assembly of the H-bonded cascades facilitating the synergistic transport of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions, with H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion transport selectivity of 7.7. Upon activation, &lt;b&gt;ROS-C-Cl&lt;/b&gt; exhibits significant apoptotic activity against human breast cancer cells, achieving an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 2.8&#8197;&#956;M, comparable to that of paclitaxel. Exploiting the intrinsic oxidative microenvironment of cancer cells, along with the enhanced oxidative stress arising from H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; co-transport, &lt;b&gt;ROS-C-Cl&lt;/b&gt; demonstrates exceptional selectivity in targeting cancer cells with a selectivity index of 10.2 over normal breast cells, outperforming that of paclitaxel by 19.4 folds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nano&#8208;Springe Enriched Hierarchical Porous MOP/COF Hybrid Aerogel: Efficient Recovery of Gold from Electronic Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processable zirconium metal based Metal&#8208;organic Polyhedra threaded chemically stable Covalent Organic Framework has been fabricated at ambient condition in the form of a crystalline hybrid hierarchically aerogel for selective recovery of gold from e&#8208;waste.







Abstract
Extraction of gold from secondary resources such as electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) has become crucial in recent times to compensate for the gradual scarcity of the noble metal in natural mines. However, designing and synthesizing a suitable material for highly efficient gold recovery is still a great challenge. Herein, we have strategically designed rapid fabrication of an ionic crystalline hybrid aerogel by covalent threading of an amino&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic polyhedra with an imine&#8208;linked chemically stable covalent organic framework at ambient condition. The hierarchically porous ultra&#8208;light aerogel featuring imine&#8208;rich backbone, high surface area, and cationic sites have shown fast removal, high uptake capacity (2349&#8197;mg/g), and excellent selectivity towards gold sequestration. Besides, the aerogel can extract ultra&#8208;trace gold&#8208;ions from different terrestrial water bodies, aiming towards safe drinking water. This study demonstrates the great potential of the composite materials based on a novel approach to designing a hybrid porous material for efficient gold recovery from complex water matrices.

         <title>Enhancing the Cumulene Character of One&#8208;Dimensional Acetylene&#8208;Based Systems by Stimuli&#8208;Induced Planarization of Their Two Pro&#8208;diradicaloid Cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene Units</title>

         <dc:description>
Connecting two pro&#8208;diradicaloid species, namely cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene, through an acetylene bridge has been shown to increase the cumulene character in one&#8208;dimensional acetylene&#8208;based conjugates. Spectroscopic analysis and calculations indicate significant &#960;&#8208;electronic delocalization during the low temperature&#8208;promoted planarization of the conjugates, which in turn enhances the cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;bridge.







Abstract
Acetylene/polyynes &#8722;(C&#8801;C&#8722;)n and cumulenes =(C=)n are connectors widely used for the realization of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) &#960;&#8208;conjugates. Although both &#960;&#8208;moieties are constituted by sp carbon atoms, their different bond connectivity confers distinct physicochemical properties to the resulting systems. In this context, while many acetylene/polyyne&#8208; and cumulene&#8208;based derivatives have been prepared and studied, no reports have tackled the possibility to reversibly alter the acetylene/polyyne&#8208;cumulene electronic character of these derivatives using mild conditions. Herein, we present a novel approach to enhance the cumulene character of 1D acetylene&#8208;based conjugates consisting in the preparation of derivatives featuring an acetylene moiety connecting two pro&#8208;diradicaloid species, namely cyclopenta[h,i]aceanthrylene (CPA), at their pro&#8208;radical positions. A thoughtful spectroscopic study of the prepared dimers, complemented by theoretical calculations, suggest a high &#960;&#8208;electronic delocalization of the pro&#8208;diradicaloid CPAs through the central acetylene spacer upon the dimers&#8217; planarization which, in turn, increases the cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;bridge, a feature enhanced for one of the two dimers at low temperature and in methylcyclohexane due to an aggregation&#8208;induced planarization process. We reckon that the proposed approach offers an interesting avenue towards the realization of 1D systems which cumulenic character of the acetylenic &#960;&#8208;connector could be altered in response to external stimuli.

         <title>Promoting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Stabilization of Excited Triplet States and Enhancement of Internal Electric Field at Dye/PCN Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work affords an efficient approach to promote PHE by both strengthening the driving force at dye/PCN interface and stabilizing excited triplet states of organic dyes by rational modulation of molecular structures and aggregated behaviors. The IEF strength increased by the adjustable substitution positions of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A moieties from p&#8208; to o&#8208;substitution, and the lifetimes of excited triplet states were prolonged by the alkyl chain engineering.







Abstract
The heterojunction photocatalysts composed of organic dyes and polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) have great potential for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE). However, serious charge recombination exists at the dye/PCN interface for the large gaps in time scales and the poor driving force of charge transfer process. Herein, both the excited triplet states of organic dyes with long lifetimes and strong internal electric fields (IEF) as charge transfer driving forces are achieved by the construction of high dipole moments with aromatic&#8208;core engineering, and modulation of dye aggregates by alkyl modification. Accordingly, PHE efficiency can achieve up to 833.49&#8197;&#956;mol/h, over 36&#8208;fold that of PCN/Pt (23.34&#8197;&#956;mol/h) under the same conditions. The relationship between molecular structures and PHE performance has been systematically investigated by the photophysical properties of organic dyes and the strength of IEF at dye/PCN interface. It afforded an efficient strategy to balance the charge transfer process in PHE systems, which can guide the molecular design of organic dyes with optimized aggregated behaviors and stable excited triplet states.

         <title>Reactive Intermediate Confinement in Beta Zeolites for the Efficient Aerobic Epoxidation of &#945;&#8208;Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the Mukaiyama epoxidation reaction, the channels of Beta zeolite can restrict the formation of undesired intermediates and only accomodate the epoxidation intermediate, thereby enhancing the selectivity of the epoxidation reaction and coupling effiency of aldehyde.







Abstract
The efficient conversion of long&#8208;chain linear &#945;&#8208;olefins (LAOs) into industrially useful epoxides is of pivotal importance. Mukaiyama epoxidation based on the use of molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant and aldehyde as the cosubstrate offers a promising route for LAOs epoxidation. However, challenges associated with epoxide forming selectivity and aldehyde coupling efficiency have long impeded the adoption of Mukaiyama epoxidation in large&#8208;scale applications. Herein, we show that confinement of key intermediates involved in the parallel epoxidation pathways within a Beta zeolite unlocks a selectivity of greater than 95&#8201;% towards the epoxides at the expense of minimal consumption of only 1.5&#8197;equivalents of the aldehyde, achieving an efficiency better than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Moreover, the incorporation of Sn sites into the Beta zeolite framework further facilitates the adsorption activation process of the aldehyde cosubstrate, thereby increasing the concentration of acylperoxy radicals and accelerating the kinetic process of the epoxidation step. Consequently, this work not only provides an efficient and green epoxidation route over zeolite catalysts with easily available O2 as the oxidant, but also systematically reveals the fundamental understanding of the zeolite confinement effects on steering the reaction pathway, which benefits the further development of valorization of LAOs.

         <title>Restraining Planar Gliding in Single&#8208;Crystalline LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 Cathodes by Combining Bulk and Surface Modification Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bulk and surface modification strategy is devised for developing single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 cathode particles with robust chemo&#8208;mechanical properties. Specifically, stabilizing MgO6 octahedra and BO4 tetrahedra are introduced into the bulk lattice, while a Mg3(BO3)2 protective layer is concurrently formed on the surface.







Abstract
The delamination cracking from planar gliding along the (003) facets and anisotropic lattice strain perpendicular to the (003) facets inevitable lead to degradation of Ni&#8208;rich single&#8208;crystal cathode materials, adversely affecting their cyclability. Herein, we rationally design a single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (SC90) cathode with robust chemo&#8208;mechanical properties, in which coherently grown MgO6 octahedra and BO4 tetrahedra are incorporated into the lattice, and a stabilizing Mg3(BO3)2 layer is concurrently formed on the particle surface. Multiscale in/ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that introducing the MgO6 and BO4 units leads to a &#8220;pinning effect&#8221; within the layered structure. This in turn strongly mitigates mechanical degradation by reducing planar gliding and delamination cracking over extended cycling. Moreover, the Mg3(BO3)2 coating maintains fast lithium diffusion by suppressing parasitic reactions at the cathode|electrolyte interface. The tailored SC90 cathode exhibits a capacity retention of ~88&#8201;% after 300 cycles at 5&#8197;C rate, significantly outperforming the pristine counterpart (~60&#8201;%). Additionally, a pouch&#8208;type full cell with a graphite anode sustains a specific discharge capacity of 177&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles, with 90&#8201;% capacity retention. This work highlights the &#8220;pining effect&#8221; in preventing unfavorable slab sliding and structural deterioration, offering new insights for designing advanced ultrahigh Ni single&#8208;crystal cathodes.

Selenium&#8208;containing Nile Blue (SeNB) derivatives enable near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;activated proximity labeling of biomolecules via a singlet&#8208;oxygen (1O2) mediated pathway in the presence of propargylamine. SeNB core efficiently generates 1O2 in lipid&#8208;rich environments while the tailored tail structures allow for selective targeting of different organelle membranes. This strategic combination achieves wash&#8208;free proximity labeling, bypassing genetic manipulation and compatible with multiple cell lines.







Abstract
Elucidating the subcellular localization of RNAs and proteins is fundamental to understanding their biological functions. Genetically encoded proteins/enzymes provide an attractive approach to target many proteins of interest, but are limited to specific cell lines. Although small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based methods have been explored, a comprehensive system for profiling multiple locations in living cells, comparable to fusion&#8208;protein techniques, is yet to be established. In this study, we introduce a novel proximity labeling strategy employing a suite of small molecules derived from benzo&#8208;phenoselenazine (e.g., selenium&#8208;containing Nile Blue [SeNB]), which achieves proximity labeling through singlet oxygen generation upon near&#8208;infrared light activation in the presence of propargylamine. These SeNB compounds allow for selective labeling of RNAs and proteins within living cells, exhibiting a distinct preference for organelle membranes, which are systematically investigated via in vitro, computational, and in cellulo examinations. Our findings highlight the capabilities of SeNB derivatives as wash&#8208;free and genetics&#8208;free approaches to illuminate the subcellular localization of biological molecules with deep penetration and high spatial resolution. Moreover, SeNB derivatives are capable of elucidating inter&#8208;organelle interactions at the molecular level, as evidenced by proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, thus holding significant potential for advancing our understanding of cellular processes related to disease progression and therapeutic development.

         <title>Depth&#8208;of&#8208;Discharge Dependent Capacity Decay Induced by the Accumulation of Oxidized Lattice Oxygen in Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid capacity decay mechanism of LRLO during LDOD cycling is elucidated. The accumulation of activated On&#8722; and persistent vacancy&#8208;rich state intensified TM in&#8208;plane migration, leading to the vacancies transition from separated to aggregated states, facilitating detrimental out&#8208;of&#8208;plane TM migration. Furthermore, increased anionic redox reactions resulted in cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode shuttle of On&#8722; and by&#8208;products, leading to lithium loss.







Abstract
More and more basic practical application scenarios have been gradually ignored/disregarded, in fundamental research on rechargeable batteries, e.g. assessing cycle life under various depths&#8208;of&#8208;discharge (DODs). Herein, although benefit from the additional energy density introduced by anionic redox, we critically revealed that lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LRLO) cathodes present anomalously poor capacity retention at low&#8208;DOD cycling, which is essentially different from typical layered cathodes (e.g. NCM), and pose a formidable impediment to the practical application of LRLO. We systemically demonstrated that DOD&#8208;dependent capacity decay is induced by the anionic redox and accumulation of oxidized lattice oxygen (On&#8722;). Upon low&#8208;DOD cycling, the accumulation of On&#8722; and the persistent presence of vacancies in the transition metal (TM) layer intensified the in&#8208;plane migration of TM, exacerbating the expansion of vacancy clusters, which further facilitated detrimental out&#8208;of&#8208;plane TM migration. As a result, the aggravated structural degradation of LRLO at low&#8208;DOD impeded reversible Li+ intercalation, resulting in rapid capacity decay. Furthermore, prolonged accumulation of On&#8722; persistently corroded the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, especially negative for pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cells with the shuttle effect. Once the &#8220;double&#8208;edged sword&#8221; effect of anionic redox being elucidated under practical condition, corresponding modification strategies/routes would become distinct for accelerating the practical application of LRLO.

         <title>Enhanced Quantum Efficiency via Co&#8208;Substitution in Red&#8208;Emitting Phosphor Sr2[MgAl5N7]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ for Advanced Spectroscopic Applications Including Laser Displays with Ultra&#8208;High Luminescence Saturation Threshold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work successfully introduced [Li&#8722;Si]5+ co&#8208;substitution into the Sr2[MgAl5N7]&#8201;:&#8201;0.01Eu2+ lattice. The co&#8208;substitution was verified to enhance the lattice rigidity so as to notably raise the external quantum efficiency. Under blue laser excitation, the phosphor has an ultra&#8208;high luminescence saturation threshold of 52.22&#8197;W/mm2. Under high pressure, the phosphor has an optimal pressure sensitivity of 5.07&#8197;nm/GPa.







Abstract
In order to obtain novel and more efficient red light&#8208;emitting materials, a series of Sr2[Mg1&#8722;xLixAl5&#8722;xSixN7]&#8201;:&#8201;0.01Eu2+ (SMAN&#8208;xLS, 0&#8804;x&#8804;0.5) red phosphors were devised and successfully synthesized via the high temperature solid state reaction and the effects of the co&#8208;substitution of [Mg&#8722;Al]5+ by [Li&#8722;Si]5+ on structural and luminescence properties is investigated in detail. A series of powder XRD data and Rietveld refinement indicate that [Li&#8722;Si]5+ co&#8208;substitution can successfully enter the Sr2[MgAl5N7]&#8201;:&#8201;0.01Eu2+ (SMAN) lattice. With the entry of [Li&#8722;Si]5+ into the lattice, the substitution of Al3+ by Si4+ leads to the weakening of the nephelauxetic effect of the 5d level of Eu2+, which shifts the emission peak from 657&#8197;nm to 647&#8197;nm and reduces the excitation in the green region, i.e., lowers the absorption of green light. When the amount of [Li&#8722;Si]5+ co&#8208;substitution is x=0.1, the luminescence intensity and thermal stability of the sample are enhanced, in which the external quantum efficiency (EQE), reflecting the luminescence intensity, is elevated by 49.6&#8201;%. The increase in lattice rigidity gives rise to higher luminescence intensity, and the introduced trap levels for the compensation of luminescence enhances the thermal stability. Under blue laser excitation, the SMAN&#8208;0.1LS can achieve an ultra&#8208;high luminescence saturation threshold of 52.22&#8197;W/mm2, which is remarkably superior to other existing red phosphors, a breakthrough performance that has enormous potential for application in high&#8208;power laser display light sources. Cathodoluminescence (CL) characterization and measurements attest to the favorable CL properties of SMAN&#8208;0.1LS. By measuring the pressure&#8208;dependent luminescence of SMAN&#8208;0.1LS, the emission peak can be shifted from 650&#8197;nm to 702&#8197;nm with the increase of pressure, and the sensitivity d&#955;/dP is 5.07&#8197;nm/GPa, which is indicative of the potential application of this system as an optical pressure sensor.

     alt="Enhanced Quantum Efficiency via Co-Substitution in Red-Emitting Phosphor Sr2[MgAl5N7]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ for Advanced Spectroscopic Applications Including Laser Displays with Ultra-High Luminescence Saturation Threshold"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work successfully introduced [Li&#8722;Si]&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; co-substitution into the Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[MgAl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;:&#8201;0.01Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; lattice. The co-substitution was verified to enhance the lattice rigidity so as to notably raise the external quantum efficiency. Under blue laser excitation, the phosphor has an ultra-high luminescence saturation threshold of 52.22&#8197;W/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Under high pressure, the phosphor has an optimal pressure sensitivity of 5.07&#8197;nm/GPa.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to obtain novel and more efficient red light-emitting materials, a series of Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Mg&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;5&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;:&#8201;0.01Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (SMAN-xLS, 0&#8804;x&#8804;0.5) red phosphors were devised and successfully synthesized via the high temperature solid state reaction and the effects of the co-substitution of [Mg&#8722;Al]&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; by [Li&#8722;Si]&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; on structural and luminescence properties is investigated in detail. A series of powder XRD data and Rietveld refinement indicate that [Li&#8722;Si]&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; co-substitution can successfully enter the Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[MgAl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;:&#8201;0.01Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (SMAN) lattice. With the entry of [Li&#8722;Si]&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; into the lattice, the substitution of Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; by Si&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; leads to the weakening of the nephelauxetic effect of the 5d level of Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which shifts the emission peak from 657&#8197;nm to 647&#8197;nm and reduces the excitation in the green region, i.e., lowers the absorption of green light. When the amount of [Li&#8722;Si]&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; co-substitution is &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=0.1, the luminescence intensity and thermal stability of the sample are enhanced, in which the external quantum efficiency (EQE), reflecting the luminescence intensity, is elevated by 49.6&#8201;%. The increase in lattice rigidity gives rise to higher luminescence intensity, and the introduced trap levels for the compensation of luminescence enhances the thermal stability. Under blue laser excitation, the SMAN-0.1LS can achieve an ultra-high luminescence saturation threshold of 52.22&#8197;W/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is remarkably superior to other existing red phosphors, a breakthrough performance that has enormous potential for application in high-power laser display light sources. Cathodoluminescence (CL) characterization and measurements attest to the favorable CL properties of SMAN-0.1LS. By measuring the pressure-dependent luminescence of SMAN-0.1LS, the emission peak can be shifted from 650&#8197;nm to 702&#8197;nm with the increase of pressure, and the sensitivity d&#955;/dP is 5.07&#8197;nm/GPa, which is indicative of the potential application of this system as an optical pressure sensor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering of HO&#8722;Zn&#8722;N2 Active Sites in Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks for Enhanced (Photo)Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective ligand removal strategy was developed to engineer active catalytic sites of unsaturated HO&#8722;Zn&#8722;N2 in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, which significantly accelerate the hydrogen evolution reaction by reducing the overpotential water adsorption from 0.31&#8197;V to 0.07&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Currently, lack of ways to engineer specific and well&#8208;defined active sites in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) limits our fundamental knowledge with respect to the mechanistic details for (photo)electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we introduce the open metal sites into ZIFs through the selective ligand removal (SeLiRe) strategy, comprehensively characterize the altered structural and electronic features, and evaluate their role in HER. In situ electrochemical analysis and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal the formation of high&#8208;valence HO&#8722;Zn&#8722;N2 sites through the binding of Zn&#8722;N2 with electrolyte hydroxide. The optimal OMS&#8208;ZIF exhibits a low overpotential of 0.41&#8197;V to achieve an ampere&#8208;level 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 120&#8208;hour stability. Theoretical simulations indicate that these active sites accelerate the water molecules activation kinetics, consequently enhancing the efficiency of the Volmer step. This work demonstrates a versatile strategy to introduce highly active catalytic sites in ZIFs, providing new insights into the electrocatalytic mechanism in alkaline media.

         <title>H Induced Metal&#8208;Insulation Transition Boosts the Stability of High Temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The frequent start&#8208;up and shut&#8208;down (SU/SD) caused fuel starvation operation condition seriously deteriorates the performance and lifetime of the fuel cell (HT&#8208;PEMFCs). We proposed the temperature&#8208;matched hydrogen&#8208;induced metal&#8208;insulator phase transition for controlling activity and fuel starvation tolerance in HT&#8208;PEMFCs.







Abstract
High temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) have garnered significant attention due to their expanded range of hydrogen sources and simplified management systems. However, the frequent start&#8208;up and shut&#8208;down (SU/SD) caused fuel starvation operation condition seriously deteriorates the performance and lifetime of the fuel cell. In this manuscript, VO2 was incorporated in the anode to restrain fuel starvation of the electrode. Under the operation condition, the insulative VO2 would reversibly transform into metallic HxVO2 by intercalating hydrogen, and HxVO2 can automatically release hydrogen, which could act as the hydrogen buffer and suppress reverse&#8208;current degradation. After the hydrogen release, the generated insulating VO2 would prevent the side reactions during fuel starvation. Compared to the traditional Pt anode, the electrode with VO2 showed much higher output power and greatly improved durability after fuel starvation. This work demonstrates the in situ reversible hydrogen storage/release&#8208;controlled metal&#8208;insulator phase transition strategy to enhance the durability of fuel cells.

         <title>Intracellular Co&#8208;Delivery of Carbon Monoxide and Nitric Oxide Induces Mitochondrial Apoptosis for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational coupling of aerobic photooxidative and anaerobic photocatalytic reactions within a micelle platform enables spatiotemporally controlled, simultaneous release of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) under clinically relevant wavelengths. This intracellular co&#8208;delivery of CO and NO synergistically induces mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer cell apoptosis, offering significant potential for tumor therapy.







Abstract
Understanding the interplay between gasotransmitters is essential for unlocking their therapeutic potential. However, achieving spatiotemporally controlled co&#8208;delivery to target cells remains a significant challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy for the intracellular co&#8208;delivery of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) gasotransmitters under clinically relevant wavelengths. This approach rationally couples aerobic photooxidative and anaerobic photocatalytic reactions within a polymeric micelle platform, using palladium(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP) as both photosensitizer and photocatalyst. Notably, the photooxidation&#8208;mediated release of CO generates a local hypoxic microenvironment, which facilitates the photoredox catalyzed release of NO. This self&#8208;adaptive micelle platform enables efficient uptake by tumor cells and intracellular co&#8208;delivery of CO and NO under 630&#8197;nm light irradiation, demonstrating potent anti&#8208;tumor activity in a 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model via the synergistic induction of mitochondrial apoptosis.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Arylation of Arenes with Varied Linker Lengths: Bridging Catalytic Selectivity with Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and versatile rhodium&#8208;catalytic system has been developed to achieve selective arylation of arenes at the meta position with high regiocontrol, even on substrates that exhibit significant flexibility between the arene and the directing group. The total synthesis of SHP2 inhibitor CNBCA validates the synthetic utility of this methodology, particularly in contexts where flexible access to the meta position of an aromatic ring is required.







Abstract
The directing group (DG)&#8208;assisted approach has so far been the major route to achieve selective C&#8722;H activation at both proximal and distal positions. While rhodium catalysts are highly effective in DG&#8208;assisted ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation, meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation with rhodium has not yet been reported. In this study, we present the first example of Rh&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H arylation of arenes. We found that the 2&#8208;cyanophenyl&#8208;based directing group, in conjunction with arylboronic acids, selectively promotes meta&#8208;arylation with complete mono&#8208;selectivity. Despite significant advancements in meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation for substrates with shorter linkers, such as hydrocinnamic acids, benzyl alcohols/amines, etc., meta&#8208;C&#8722;H activation of substrates with longer alkyl chains remains challenging with limited literature examples. We demonstrated that arenes with varying chain lengths, including conformationally flexible and less rigid ones such as 4&#8208;phenylbutanoic acid, 5&#8208;phenylvaleric acid, 6&#8208;phenylcaproic acid, 3&#8208;phenylpropanol, and 4&#8208;phenylbutanol underwent meta&#8208;arylation with high levels of regiocontrol. From a synthetic perspective, this approach could be valuable as it allows to produce biaryl derivatives of flexible arenes with native functional groups at the meta&#8208;position. The synthetic utility of this strategy is demonstrated through the total synthesis of CNBCA, a bioactive compound possessing promising potency against the SHP2 enzyme activity in vitro.

     alt="Rhodium-Catalyzed Meta-C&#8722;H Arylation of Arenes with Varied Linker Lengths: Bridging Catalytic Selectivity with Structural Diversity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient and versatile rhodium-catalytic system has been developed to achieve selective arylation of arenes at the &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt; position with high regiocontrol, even on substrates that exhibit significant flexibility between the arene and the directing group. The total synthesis of SHP2 inhibitor CNBCA validates the synthetic utility of this methodology, particularly in contexts where flexible access to the &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt; position of an aromatic ring is required.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directing group (DG)-assisted approach has so far been the major route to achieve selective C&#8722;H activation at both proximal and distal positions. While rhodium catalysts are highly effective in DG-assisted &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H arylation, &lt;i&gt;meta-&lt;/i&gt;C&#8722;H arylation with rhodium has not yet been reported. In this study, we present the first example of Rh-catalyzed &lt;i&gt;meta-&lt;/i&gt;C&#8722;H arylation of arenes. We found that the 2-cyanophenyl-based directing group, in conjunction with arylboronic acids, selectively promotes &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-arylation with complete mono-selectivity. Despite significant advancements in &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H activation for substrates with shorter linkers, such as hydrocinnamic acids, benzyl alcohols/amines, &lt;i&gt;etc&lt;/i&gt;., &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-C&#8722;H activation of substrates with longer alkyl chains remains challenging with limited literature examples. We demonstrated that arenes with varying chain lengths, including conformationally flexible and less rigid ones such as 4-phenylbutanoic acid, 5-phenylvaleric acid, 6-phenylcaproic acid, 3-phenylpropanol, and 4-phenylbutanol underwent &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-arylation with high levels of regiocontrol. From a synthetic perspective, this approach could be valuable as it allows to produce biaryl derivatives of flexible arenes with native functional groups at the &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-position. The synthetic utility of this strategy is demonstrated through the total synthesis of CNBCA, a bioactive compound possessing promising potency against the SHP2 enzyme activity in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>IrPdCuFeNiCoMo Based Core&#8208;Shell Icosahedron Nanocrystals and Nanocages for Efficient and Robust Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8208;shell structured icosahedron nanocrystals featured with PdCu core and IrPdCuFeNiCoMo high entropy alloy shell were deliberately designed and synthesized and sequential chemical etching of PdCu core results in IrPdCuFeNiCoMo high entropy alloy nanocages, which show robust performance towards acidic oxygen evolution reaction, delivering an overpotential of 235&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintain stable over 900&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer.







Abstract
Facets engineering of high entropy alloy (HEA) nanocrystals might be achieved via shape&#8208;controlled synthesis, which is promising but remains challenging in designing Ir&#8208;based catalysts towards efficient and robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic medium. Herein, icosahedra nanocrystals featured with PdCu core and IrPdCuFeNiCoMo shell were prepared by wet&#8208;chemical reduction in one&#8208;pot, ascribing to the initial formation PdCu core and subsequent deposition and diffusion of IrPdCuFeNiCoMo HEA shell. Sequential selective chemical etching of PdCu core results in IrPdCuFeNiCoMo HEA nanocages, delivering an overpotential of 235&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 51.0&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and 1624&#8197;A&#8201;gIr&#8722;1 at 1.50&#8197;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode in a conventional three electrode cell. In a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, it delivers a low cell voltage of 1.65 and 1.77&#8197;V at a current density of 1.0 and 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and maintains stable over 900&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations attribute the enhanced intrinsic activity to the broad distribution of the binding energy for OER intermediates on IrPdCuFeNiCoMo HEA, which breaks the linear scaling relationship and accelerates the OER process.

         <title>Organic Crosslinked Tin Oxide Mitigating Buried Interface Defects for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>

The gelation&#8208;promoting effect of BPS causes SnO2 to gel faster, resulting in a better intermediate state during the gelation and annealing crystallization processes, achieving a slightly larger and more uniform electron transport layer and an orderly perovskite layer.







Abstract
Tin dioxide (SnO2) stands as a promising material for the electron transport layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) attributed to its superlative optoelectronic properties. The attainment of superior power conversion efficiency hinges critically on the preparation of high&#8208;quality SnO2 thin films. However, conventional nanoparticle SnO2 colloids often suffer from inherent issues such as numerous oxygen vacancy defects and film non&#8208;uniformity. In this study, we report a strategy to homogenize SnO2 with reduced defects for high&#8208;performance PSCs. The commercial SnO2 colloid is modulated with bisphenol S (BPS) crosslinking to achieve a better annealing intermediate state. The phenolic hydroxyl groups on BPS bond with the hydroxyl groups on the SnO2 surface, passivating defects as well as promoting superb regularity of the films by forming a network of the SnO2 nanoparticles. Additionally, the sulfone groups on BPS coordinate with Pb2+, regulating the crystallization of PbI2 and FAPbI3, which leads to better interface contact at the buried interface. The FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells based on BPS&#8208;crosslinked SnO2 layers achieved a champion efficiency of 24.87&#8201;% and retained 95&#8201;% of their initial PCE after 1000&#8197;hours of continuous light soaking under N2 atmosphere.

         <title>A De Novo Auto&#8208;Activated Solar&#8208;Driven Biohybrid System for Hydrogen Production in Methanotrophic Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative biohybrid systems are created for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen (H2) production through the integration of engineered methanotrophic bacteria with thienoviologen (S&#8208;MV2+), exhibiting improved production activity, selectivity, and stability. Notably, the sacrificial agent is self&#8208;regenerated from methane, facilitating sustainable system activation and sustaining the electron flow cycle necessary for both H2 biosynthesis and methane oxidation. This provides a new approach to developing biohybrid system and upcycling greenhouse gases.







Abstract
Climate change driving by greenhouse gas emissions from petroleum&#8208;based energy has garnered significant attention. Renewable energy production via a sustainable system that integrates the cell factory and visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysts offers a novel approach for upcycling methane and addressing global energy challenges. Here, an auto&#8208;activated biohybrid system driven by solar energy is developed for converting methane into hydrogen fuel, which incorporated thienoviologen (S&#8208;MV2+) and genetically engineered methanotrophic bacteria. In this system, S&#8208;MV2+ functioned as photosensitizer and electron mediator, capturing solar energy and supplying electrons for an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed bioprocess. The genetically modified Methylomicrobium buryatense 5GB1 mutant, lacking methanol dehydrogenase but overexpressing hydrogenase, is able to convert methane into methanol that maintains the electron flow cycle by quenching photogenerated holes for both hydrogen biosynthesis and methane oxidation. Finally, the highest H2 production of 272.96&#8197;&#956;M from this biohybrid system was achieved with methanol as a sacrificial agent generated by the H2&#8208;producing mutant, resulting in a 140&#8208;fold enhancement. This innovative method showcases the potential of coupling photocatalysis with methanotrophic biocatalysis for sustainable energy production. Additionally, the system introduces a new strategy for self&#8208;regeneration of sacrificial agents, offering a promising avenue for hydrogen production using greenhouse gases in an eco&#8208;friendly manner.

         <title>Polyglycidamides: from Backbone&#8208;Promoted Amidation to Degradable Polyether with Wide&#8208;Range LCST</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epoxy&#8208;selective ring&#8208;opening polymerization of ethyl glycidate is achieved organocatalytically. The pendant ester groups of resulting ester&#8208;functionalized polyether can be easily co&#8208;amidated by two different amines at 0&#8201;&#176;C with ethylene glycol as a catalyst, generating amide&#8208;functionalized polyethers with tunable LCST and degradability.







Abstract
Amide groups occur extensively in natural and synthetic polymers cultivating their vital roles in biological and industrial worlds. We report here an efficient and controlled pathway to amide&#8208;functionalized polyethers through ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of commercially available ethyl glycidate followed by amidation of the pendant ester groups. Transesterification is inhibited during the ROP by use of a two&#8208;component organocatalyst. Surprisingly, amidation can be completed even at 0&#8201;&#176;C uncatalyzed, which is attributed to the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the oxygenated backbone as well as the inter&#8208;/intra&#8208;chain hydrogen bonding. Also interestingly, ethylene glycol and water are found to further accelerate the amidation while suppressing backbone degradation. The obtained polyglycidamides (PGAms) exhibit aqueous thermoresponsive properties, similar to their carbon&#8208;chain counterparts (polyacrylamides). Cloud point can be linearly modulated by co&#8208;amidation using two amines of varied ratios. Unlike polyacrylamides and regular polyethers, PGAm is degradable through retro&#8208;oxa&#8208;Michael addition under basic conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Epoxy-selective ring-opening polymerization of ethyl glycidate is achieved organocatalytically. The pendant ester groups of resulting ester-functionalized polyether can be easily co-amidated by two different amines at 0&#8201;&#176;C with ethylene glycol as a catalyst, generating amide-functionalized polyethers with tunable LCST and degradability.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amide groups occur extensively in natural and synthetic polymers cultivating their vital roles in biological and industrial worlds. We report here an efficient and controlled pathway to amide-functionalized polyethers through ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of commercially available ethyl glycidate followed by amidation of the pendant ester groups. Transesterification is inhibited during the ROP by use of a two-component organocatalyst. Surprisingly, amidation can be completed even at 0&#8201;&#176;C uncatalyzed, which is attributed to the electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygenated backbone as well as the inter-/intra-chain hydrogen bonding. Also interestingly, ethylene glycol and water are found to further accelerate the amidation while suppressing backbone degradation. The obtained polyglycidamides (PGAms) exhibit aqueous thermoresponsive properties, similar to their carbon-chain counterparts (polyacrylamides). Cloud point can be linearly modulated by co-amidation using two amines of varied ratios.

         <title>Mechanochromic Organic Micro&#8208;Laser</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic laser material has been shown to be capable of simultaneously exhibiting amplified spontaneous emission and mechanofluorochromic properties under a wide range of shear and normal force conditions. Applying a localized mechanical pressure as low as 0.1&#8197;MPa inhibits the micro&#8208;laser behavior at the given spot, while a hydrostatic pressure of 1 to 2&#8197;GPa leads to a narrow emission and a pressure&#8208;dependent shift in the emission wavelength.







Abstract
This work presents the first demonstration of a mechanochromic organic micro&#8208;laser, which exhibits remarkable wide range pressure sensing characteristics. The gain material, pinacolato boronate ester functionalized anthanthrene (AnBPin), is designed by incorporating mechanofluorochromic (MFC) properties into organic laser dye. The AnBPin exhibits a reversible transition between green and orange fluorescence upon grinding annealing and recrystallization cycle, and its micro&#8208;crystal exhibits typical organic micro&#8208;laser behaviors. Applying localized mechanical pressure as low as 0.1&#8197;MPa inhibits micro&#8208;laser behavior at the given spot. In contrast, under 1 to 2&#8197;GPa hydrostatic pressure, the organic laser maintains narrow emission while showing a pressure&#8208;dependent shift in emission wavelength. By combining theory and experimentation, we attribute the unusual pressure&#8208;correlated emission spectroscopy to the unique interleaved locked crystal structure. Understanding the mechanochromic laser behavior in AnBPin micro&#8208;crystals under an unprecedented pressure range significantly expands the family of organic micro&#8208;lasers and provides a new route for wide&#8208;range photonic pressure detection.

         <title>Engineering the Self&#8208;Assembly Pathways of POSS&#8208;Peptide Amphiphiles to Form Diverse Cross&#8208;&#946; Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A POSS&#8208;peptide amphiphile was constructed by conjugating cross&#8208;&#946; peptide with hydrophilic polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS). A single molecule unveils two distinctive transition pathways depending on water content. The POSS directs the unusual transition from the twisted to flat nanoribbons (pathway 2), which distinguishes it from the prevalently observed pathway 1 in &#946;&#8208;sheet forming peptide systems.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;&#946; structures are crucial in driving protein folding and aggregation. However, due to their strong aggregating tendency, the precise control of the self&#8208;assembly of &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;forming peptides remains a challenge. We propose a molecular geometry strategy to study and control the self&#8208;assembly of cross&#8208;&#946; structures. We conjugate the peptide with shape&#8208;persistent polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS), which acts as a hydrophilic head and senses the solvent environment. The POSS&#8208;peptide amphiphiles display two distinct self&#8208;assembly pathways: twisted nanoribbons transforming into either nanotubes at low water content or flat nanoribbons at high water content. The peptide packing in flat nanoribbons is predominantly modulated by POSS, diverting the system away from crystal formation, which is the absolute lowest energy state of pure peptide self&#8208;assemblies. For the first time, we have demonstrated that POSS can serve as a useful tool to adjust the interactions between cross&#8208;&#946; strands, achieving fine&#8208;tuning of the pathway complexity (i.e., the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of peptide self&#8208;assembly). With this versatile molecular platform incorporating multiple functionalities of POSS and programable peptide sequences, this study provides a platform to exploit cross&#8208;&#946;&#8208;based nanomaterials with functional and pathological significance.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Squeeze Triggers Guest Desorption from Sponge&#8208;Like Macrocycle Crystals</title>

         <dc:description>
Desorption in conventional porous sorbents often employ energy&#8208;intensive external forces including inert gas blowing, heating, vacuum treatment to trigger guest release.

Abstract
Desorption in conventional porous sorbents often employ external forces including inert gas blowing, heating, vacuum treatment to trigger guest release. We here report an unprecedented molecular&#8208;squeeze triggered guest release behavior from sponge&#8208;like macrocycle crystals. The crystals function as typical sponge to include guest molecules within their microscopic voids that are adaptively formed, thus acting as adsorbents for toluene/pyridine separations. Intriguingly, vaporized ethyl acetate (EA) molecules trigger the guest release from the crystals without entering the pores or voids of the crystals to replace the guests. Instead, they work as external forces applied directly onto the crystals themselves, &#8216;&#8216;squeezing&#8221; the materials to close the voids through supramolecular interactions between EA and macrocycles on the crystal surface and release the guest molecules. Various experimental techniques as well as molecular dynamics simulations reveal the mechanism of the molecular&#8208;squeeze induced guest release procedure. The EA&#8208;regenerated crystals can be recycled multiple times without the loss of separation performance. Compared with conventional guest release procedure, this method is manipulated in a mild condition, showing the potential in saving cost and energy.

         <title>Identification of Key Post&#8208;modification Enzymes Involved in the Biosynthesis of Lanostane&#8208;type Triterpenoids in the Medicinal Mushroom Antrodia camphorata.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through different gene mining strategies, three key enzymes (AcCYP4, AcSDR6, AcSMT1) involved in the downstream biosynthesis of major lanostane&#8208;type triterpenoids were discovered and identified from Antrodia camphorata. The catalytic mechanisms of AcSDR6 were elucidated by crystal structure analysis. These post&#8208;modification enzymes could be used to synthesize at least 11 major Antrodia lanostanoids.







Abstract
Lanostane&#8208;type triterpenoids are important bioactive secondary metabolites of mushrooms, though their biosynthetic study has been challenging due to scattered genes. Herein, the strategies of combining metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses, functional motif blast, and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) annotation were used to discover three key post&#8208;modification enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lanostanoids in the medicinal mushroom Antrodia camphorata. The cytochrome P450 enzyme AcCYP4 could generate a &#916;7,9(11) diene structure and introduce a 15&#945;&#8208;hydroxy group to the triterpene skeleton. The short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase AcSDR6 could regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208; selectively catalyze the dehydrogenation of 3&#946;&#8208;OH to produce 3&#8208;keto triterpenoids, and the catalytic mechanisms were interpreted by crystal structure analysis. AcSMT1 could introduce the methyl group at C&#8208;24 to produce a unique 31&#8208;carbon triterpene skeleton. This work elucidated the major biosynthetic pathway of Antrodia lanostanoids in vitro, and the discovered enzymes could be used to synthesize a series of bioactive triterpenoids.

         <title>Enhancing Mechanical Durability and Long&#8208;Term Stability in Organic Solar Cells via Flexible Linker&#8208;Sequential Block Copolymerized Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel multi&#8208;component copolymerized donors were successfully synthesized, and excellent efficiencies in both rigid binary (18.09&#8201;%) and ternary (19.05&#8201;%) as well as flexible binary (16.63&#8201;%) OSCs for flexible linker&#8208;sequential block MCD PM6&#8208;C10.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTD were achieved, along with excellent long term photovoltaic stability (T80=9,078&#8197;h) and photo&#8208;stability (T80=568&#8197;h) in invert OSCs as well as outstanding crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) value of 49.88&#8201;% and 31.29&#8201;% in both pristine and blend films, respectively.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;component copolymerized donors (MCDs) hold great promise for improving both the efficiency and mechanical robustness of flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) owing to their facile molecular tunability and advantageous one&#8208;pot copolymerization. However, despite the excellent crystallinity imparted by their highly conjugated polymer backbone, MCDs often struggle to retain photovoltaic performance under large external deformations, limiting their applicability in wearable devices. Herein, we developed a novel series of flexible linker&#8208;sequential block MCDs (Fs&#8208;MCDs), specifically PM6&#8208;Cl0.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTB, PM6&#8208;Cl0.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTH, and PM6&#8208;Cl0.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTD, by precisely incorporating flexible functional groups into the conjugated polymer skeleton. This design strategy introduced highly effective tensile active sites, resulting in remarkable mechanical durability, with PM6&#8208;Cl0.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTD achieving crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) values of 49.88&#8201;% in pristine films and 31.29&#8201;% in blends. The nearly 50&#8201;% COS in pristine films represents one of the highest values reported for Fs&#8208;MCD&#8208;based OSCs, marking a significant milestone in advancing f&#8208;OSC. Additionally, PM6&#8208;Cl0.8&#8208;b&#8208;D18&#8208;Cl0.2&#8208;BTD demonstrated excellent photovoltaic performance, with efficiencies of 18.09&#8201;% in rigid binary and 19.05&#8201;% in ternary, as well as 16.63&#8201;% in flexible OSCs. It also showed impressive device stability in invert OSC (T80=9,078&#8197;h). This unique molecular design strategy provides a promising avenue for synergistically improving the photovoltaic performance, mechanical properties, and device stability of f&#8208;OSCs.

         <title>Phenomics&#8208;Based Discovery of Novel Orthosteric Choline Kinase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an integrated phenomic approach we identified choline kinase alpha (CHKA) as an unexpected off&#8208;target of the methyltransferase inhibitor UNC0638 and its negative control UNC0737, shedding light on their mechanism of action. This discovery offers a drug&#8208;like starting for CHKA inhibitor development and investigating its role in immune metabolism.







Abstract
Choline kinase alpha (CHKA) is a central mediator of cell metabolism linked to cancer and immune regulation. Cellular and clinical evaluation of CHKA has been hampered by challenges in the development of drug&#8208;like choline kinase inhibitors. Here, we identify CHKA as an unexpected off&#8208;target of histone methyltransferase inhibitors using an integrated phenomic approach. We confirm CHKA as a direct protein target of the aminoquinazolines UNC0638 and UNC0737 using a combination of chemoproteomic, biochemical, cellular, and metabolic profiling assays, possibly explaining the previously reported discrepancies observed for different G9a/GLP inhibitor scaffolds in cellular assays. Using primary human cell model systems, we discover that CHKA modulation impairs IgG secretion and B&#8208;cell maturation consistent with the notion that choline metabolism plays an important role in immune signalling. Co&#8208;crystal structures of UNC0638 and UNC0737 with CHKA unravel an unexpected binding mode and suggest the inhibitors as attractive starting points for the development of selective chemical tools to further explore the biological role of CHKA in cancer and immune metabolism.

         <title>Spatially Isomeric Fulleropyrrolidines Enable Controlled Stacking of Perovskite Colloids for High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We utilize spatially isomeric fullerenes to finely control the crystallization of tin&#8208;based perovskites, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite films. Additionally, we use a well&#8208;defined fullerene bis&#8208;adduct, C60BB, to optimize the energy level alignment between the perovskite and the electron transport layer. As a result, the champion device achieves an efficiency of 16.05&#8201;% (certified: 15.86&#8201;%), surpassing the 16&#8201;% efficiency threshold.







Abstract
The advancement of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) has been severely hindered by the poor controllability of perovskite crystal growth and the energy level mismatch between the perovskite and fullerene&#8208;based electron transport layer (ETL). Here, we synthesized three cis&#8208;configured pyridyl&#8208;substituted fulleropyrrolidines (PPF), specifically 2&#8208;pyridyl (PPF2), 3&#8208;pyridyl (PPF3), and 4&#8208;pyridyl (PPF4), and utilized them as precursor additives to regulate the crystallization kinetics during film formation. The spatial distance between the two pyridine groups in PPF2, PPF3, and PPF4 increases sequentially, enabling PPF4 to interact with more perovskite colloidal particles. These interactions effectively enlarge the precursor colloid size and decelerate the crystallization rate of the perovskite, resulting in high&#8208;quality PPF4&#8208;based perovskite films with reduced defect density and lower exciton binding energy. Additionally, we incorporated a well&#8208;defined fullerene bis&#8208;adduct, C60BB, as an interlayer between the perovskite and PCBM layers to optimize energy level alignment. Through the synergistic effects of PPF4 and C60BB, our champion device achieved an efficiency of 16.05&#8201;% (certified: 15.86&#8201;%), surpassing the 16&#8201;% efficiency bottleneck and setting a new benchmark for TPSCs. Moreover, the devices exhibited outstanding stability, retaining 99&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 600&#8197;hours of maximum power point tracking under 1 sun condition.

A novel matrix&#8208;controlling strategy is presented in CDs&#8208;in&#8208;zeolite system to regulate the microenvironment of CDs by doping limited Mn2+ in zeolite. Mn&#8208;coordinated CDs (C&#8208;CDs) induce green phosphorescence, and non&#8208;coordinated CDs (NC&#8208;CDs) exhibit temperature&#8208;related blue or red phosphorescence due to energy transfer. Finally, multi&#8208;mode time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color evolution with temperature variation in a single system is achieved.







Abstract
Matrix immobilization has been proven to be a favored method for enhancing the phosphorescence of carbon dots (CDs), however, it remains a significant challenge to realize time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence colors (TDPC) by embedding CDs with single emission center. In this study, we present a novel matrix&#8208;controlling strategy to regulate the microenvironment of CDs by doping limited Mn2+ in zeolite. The surrounding environment influences the surface state of the CDs, leading to the formation of different excitons. At low temperatures, Mn&#8208;coordinated CDs (C&#8208;CDs) show fast&#8208;decaying green phosphorescence, while non&#8208;coordinated CDs (NC&#8208;CDs) exhibit inherent slow&#8208;decaying blue phosphorescence. Notably, the energy transfer occurs between NC&#8208;CDs and Mn2+ to produce an ultrafast&#8208;decaying red phosphorescence, with the intensity of the red component increasing as the temperature rises. The interplay of these luminescent centers with distinct decay rates activates fascinating multi&#8208;mode TDPC behavior as the temperature changes, resulting in dynamic afterglow evolutions from red to green at 298&#8197;K, orange to green at 273&#8197;K, and green to cyan to blue at 77&#8197;K. Leveraging the diverse luminescence of CDs@MnAPO&#8208;5, a multi&#8208;dimensional dynamic afterglow color pattern was developed for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Insight into Robust Anion Coordination Behavior of Organic Cathode with Dual Elongated &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual elongation strategy of &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs with active sites is proposed, containing both the extended carbazole and electropolymerized polymer, which enhances electronic conductivity by the electronic delocalization of electron&#8208;withdrawing conjugated groups, boosts theoretical capacity by increasing redox&#8208;active site density, and endows robust electrochemical stability attributed to nanonetwork organic structures.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials offer multi&#8208;electron reactivity, flexible structures, and redox reversibility, but encounter poor conductivity and durability in electrolytes. To overcome above barriers, we propose a dual elongation strategy of &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs with active sites, involving the extended carbazole and electropolymerized polymer, which enhances electronic conductivity by the electronic delocalization of electron&#8208;withdrawing conjugated groups, boosts theoretical capacity by increasing redox&#8208;active site density, and endows robust electrochemical stability attributed to the nanonetwork feature of polymer structures. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, 5,11&#8208;dihydridoindolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole (DHIC) is selected as the model cathode material for a dual&#8208;ion battery, with elongated carbazole groups functioning both as redox&#8208;active centers and polymerization anchors. Electrochemical comparisons and theoretical simulations validate the excellent specific capacity, accelerated reaction kinetics, and enhanced anion storage stability imparted by the dual elongated &#960;&#8208;conjugated system containing both carbazole motif and electropolymerized DHIC (pDHIC). Simultaneously, the coordination interaction between pDHIC and anions is innovatively evidenced through operando electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. As anticipated, pDHIC cathode delivers an unprecedentedly high specific capacity of 197&#8197;mAh/g at 50&#8197;mA/g, far outperforming graphite cathodes, and maintains excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 86.1&#8201;% over 500&#8197;cycles. This synergetic strategy sheds light on the performance revolution of organic electrode materials.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting H2O2 Photosynthesis via the Synergy of Multiple Charge Transfer Channels and Polarized Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the first example of piezo&#8208;photocatalytic synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) using covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Under the synergy of the intermolecular multiple&#8208;channel charge transfer and the piezoelectric polarization field, charge separation was greatly improved and ethenyl group&#8208;modified bicarbazole&#8208;based COFs (COF&#8208;DH&#8208;Eth) achieved a record&#8208;breaking H2O2 synthesis rate (9212&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1).







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) serve as one of the most promising candidates for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis, while attaining high&#8208;performance COFs remains a formidable challenge due to the insufficient separation of photogenerated charges. Here, through the rational design of bicarbazole&#8208;based COFs (Cz&#8208;COFs), we showcase the first achievement in piezo&#8208;photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2 using COFs. Noteworthily, the ethenyl group&#8208;modified Cz&#8208;COFs (COF&#8208;DH&#8208;Eth) demonstrates a record&#8208;high yield of H2O2 (9212&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) from air and pure water through piezo&#8208;photocatalysis, which is ca. 2.5&#8197;times higher than that of pristine Cz&#8208;COFs without ethenyl groups (COF&#8208;DH&#8208;H) under identical condition and COF&#8208;DH&#8208;Eth without ultrasonic treatment. The H2O2 production rate originates from the synergistic effect between an ultrasonication&#8208;induced polarized electric field and the spatially separated multiple charge transfer channels, which significantly promote the utilization of photogenerated electrons by directional transfer from bicarbazole groups to the ethenyl group&#8208;modified benzene rings. Several Cz&#8208;COFs and bifluorenylidene&#8208;based COFs (COF&#8208;BFTB&#8208;H) with similar twisted monomers exhibit obvious piezoelectric performance for promoting H2O2 generation, signifying that organic ligands with a twistable structure play a crucial role in creating broken symmetry structures, thereby establishing piezoelectric properties in COFs.

         <title>Chemocatalytic Conversion of Dinitrogen to Ammonia Mediated by a Tungsten Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first tungsten complex capable of chemocatalyzing the conversion of N2 into NH3 is presented. The tungsten center is coordinated by a pentadentate tetrapodal (pentaPod/P5) phosphine ligand. By integrating a phospholano (Pln) group into the ligand structure we succeeded in obtaining the catalyst [W(N2)P5Pln]. Further investigations on the influence of the new P5Pln ligand on the catalytic ability of this tungsten complex were done.







Abstract
Whereas molybdenum dinitrogen complexes have played a major role as catalytic model systems of nitrogenase, corresponding tungsten complexes were in most cases found to be catalytically inactive. Herein, we present a modified pentadentate tetrapodal (pentaPod) phosphine ligand in which two dimethylphosphine groups of the pentaPodMe (P5Me) ligand have been replaced with phospholanes (Pln). The derived molybdenum complex [Mo(N2)P5Pln] generates 22 and the analogous tungsten complex [W(N2)P5Pln] 7&#8197;equivalents of NH3 from N2 in the presence of 180&#8197;equivalents of SmI2(THF)2/H2O, rendering the latter the first tungsten complex chemocatalytically converting N2 to NH3. In contrast, the tungsten complex [W(N2)P5Me] generates ammonia from N2 only in a slightly overstoichiometric fashion. The reasons for these reactivity differences are investigated with the help of spectroscopic and electrochemical methods.

         <title>Chiral Metal Self&#8208;Assemblies of Zirconium&#8208;Tetrahedra and Their Second Harmonic Generation Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adjusting the solvent conditions, three different supramolecular structures (Zr&#8208;&#945;, Zr&#8208;&#946; and Zr&#8208;&#947;) have been achieved by using metallo&#8208;tetrahedra as building blocks. Zr&#8208;&#945; is racemic and centrosymmetric, while Zr&#8208;&#946; and Zr&#8208;&#947; exhibit excellent second harmonic generation activities in second&#8208;order nonlinear optics based on their non&#8208;centrosymmetric characteristics.







Abstract
The chirality of metal&#8208;organic cages holds enormous potential for novel applications in diverse fields, while it is relatively rare to employ such asymmetric units for the construction of noncentrosymmetric materials. Herein, by self&#8208;assembling the 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;nitrilotribenzoic acid (H3NBA) with bis(cyclopentadienyl)&#8208;zirconium dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2, Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5) in different solvent conditions, we have obtained three hierarchical packing modes of metallo&#8208;tetrahedra with distinct spatial symmetry groups (designated as Zr&#8208;&#945;, Zr&#8208;&#946;, and Zr&#8208;&#947;). Among them, Zr&#8208;&#945; employs a simple cubic arrangement and is a common centrosymmetric superstructure, which consists of a pair of equimolar metallo&#8208;tetrahedra enantiomers in its unit cell. While Zr&#8208;&#946; results in conglomerates with spontaneous resolution without using any resolving agents, giving rise to two enantiopure entities separately (Zr&#8208;&#946;&#8208;P, Zr&#8208;&#946;&#8208;M). More importantly, Zr&#8208;&#947; breaks the inversion center of symmetry and crystallizes into a racemic yet non&#8208;centrosymmetric superstructure with face&#8208;centered cubic packing mode. Based on the non&#8208;centrosymmetric nature, the hierarchical superstructure Zr&#8208;&#947; displayed good second harmonic generation activities. This work presents a successful instance wherein the reaction solvent induces the modulation of intermolecular packing mode to afford non&#8208;centrosymmetric solid materials, which can greatly promote the development of noncentrosymmetric solid (NCS) materials.

         <title>A Pyrrole&#8208;Fused Nanographene and its Edge&#8208;Perchlorinated Derivative Featuring a Corannulene Core and Five N&#8208;doped Heptagons</title>

         <dc:description>
A sunflower&#8208;like molecular structure of deca&#8208;nitrogen doped WNG (azaWNG) was synthesized via Scholl reaction. The azaWNG demonstrates a low oxidation potential and narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap due to ten interior nitrogen dopants, its electron&#8208;deficient core and extended &#960; system. The stability and solubility of azaWNG were improved through an edge&#8208;chlorination strategy, and the atom&#8208;precise structure has been confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
A pyrrole&#8208;fused analogue of warped nanographene, designated as deca&#8208;nitrogen doped &#8242;WNG&#8242; (azaWNG), was synthesized through the annular fusion of decapyrroylcorannulene. The resulting azaWNG exhibited extremely limited solubility in common organic solvents and was characterized solely by mass spectrometry. Theoretical calculations revealed that azaWNG has a sunflower&#8208;like molecular structure with electron&#8208;deficient corannulene as the core and electron&#8208;rich pyrrole as the petals, demonstrating a significantly narrower energy gap compared to all&#8208;carbon WNG. To improve its solubility and facilitate precise structural characterization, iodine monochloride was utilized for edge&#8208;perchlorination of azaWNG, enabling successful separation and purification of chlorinated azaWNG in solution phase. X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis unequivocally confirmed that edge&#8208;perchlorinated azaWNG contains 5 heptagons and 11 pentagons embedded within the warped &#960; skeleton. Cyclic voltammetry measurements indicated that the first oxidation potential of azaWNG is &#8722;0.59&#8197;V, representing the lowest value reported for any previously studied aza&#8208;nanographene. Consequently, azaWNG can be readily oxidized by AgPF6 or even atmospheric oxygen to yield stable oxidation states, as corroborated by UV/Visible absorption spectroscopy; this behavior is attributed to the fusion of ten pyrroles around corannulene. This work marks the first instance of nitrogen doping in WNG (C80H30), underscoring the significant modification to electronic structure induced by such doping.

         <title>A Fentanyl Hapten&#8208;Displaying Lipid Nanoparticle Vaccine that Non&#8208;Covalently Encapsulates a TLR7/8 Agonist and T&#8208;Helper Epitope Induces Protective Anti&#8208;Fentanyl Immunity</title>

A non&#8208;covalent assembly of a fentanyl hapten and immune&#8208;stimulating components in lipid nanoparticles induces fentanyl&#8208;specific antibodies that can sequester fentanyl from the serum and prevent it from activating opioid receptors on cells.







Abstract
Opioid use disorder &#8208; particularly involving fentanyl &#8208; has precipitated a public health crisis characterized by a significant increase in addiction and overdose&#8208;related deaths. Fentanyl&#8208;specific immunotherapy, which aims at inducing fentanyl&#8208;specific antibodies capable of binding fentanyl molecules in the bloodstream, preventing their entry in the central nervous system, is therefore gaining momentum. Conventional opioid designs rely on the covalent conjugation of fentanyl analogues to immunogenic carrier proteins that hold the inherent capacity of mounting immunodominant responses. Here, we present an alternative fentanyl vaccine design that utilizes a non&#8208;covalent assembly of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver fentanyl haptens in conjunction with a CD4+ T&#8208;helper peptide epitope and an imidazoquinoline TLR7/8 agonist. Our results demonstrate that a single intramuscular administration of the LNP&#8208;based nanovaccine elicits fentanyl&#8208;specific antibodies, significantly mitigating the effects of opioid overdose in preclinical mouse models. Furthermore, we analyzed the immunobiological behavior of the vaccine in vivo in mouse models, providing evidence that covalent attachment of a fentanyl hapten to a carrier proteins or peptide epitope is not necessary for inducing an effective immune response. However, co&#8208;delivery &#8208; specifically, the physical assembly of all immune cues into an LNP &#8208; remains essential for inducing hapten&#8208;specific immunity.

         <title>Idealizing Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Film Competitive by Surface Lattice Etching&#8208;Reconstruction for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a novel in situ lattice etching&#8208;reconstruction strategy enabled by hot organic esters with low polarity to idealize air&#8208;processed perovskite films for competitive solar cells regardless of humidity. Arising from the dynamic dissolution of nanoimpurities and selective recrystallization of Br&#8208;rich phase on the defective perovskite surface, we deliver a champion PCE of 15.37&#8201;% for all&#8208;air&#8208;processed carbon&#8208;based CsPbI2Br cell with excellent stability.







Abstract
Air&#8208;processed perovskite solar cells are desirable for the large&#8208;scale manufacturing application in the future, yet the presence of moisture and oxygen goes against perovskite crystallization and deteriorates phase stabilization, leading to the formation of substantial defective nano&#8208;impurities, especially on the vulnerable surface. Here, we propose a strategy to simultaneously remove superficial defect layer and solidify the surface by soaking air&#8208;fabricated perovskite film into low&#8208;polar organic esters at elevated temperature to trigger an in situ dynamic surface lattice disassemble and reconstruction process. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental results indicate that the inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite is first dissolved and then the Br&#8208;rich phase is recrystallized at solid&#8211;liquid interface owing to the balance between weak solubility and high&#8208;temperature induced annealing process, thus hardening the soft surface and releasing the lattice tensile stress, which benefits the minimization of interfacial recombination and improvement of the structural stability. As a result, we prepare a carbon&#8208;based CsPbI2Br device in complete air without precise control on humidity, achieving a champion efficiency of 15.37&#8201;% with excellent resistance to harsh attackers. This method offers a promising avenue for overcoming the limit of processing conditions on advancing perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Suppression of Structural Heterogeneity in High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallics for Electrocatalytic Upgrading of Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range ordered L10&#8208;(PtIr)(FeMoBi) HEI with one&#8208;dimensionally aligned Pt/Ir and Fe/Mo/Bi columns were synthesized to improve the activity (5.2&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1) and selectivity (95&#8201;%) of GA via electrocatalytic waste polymer&#8208;derived ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR), representing the most active electrocatalyst for selective GA production.







Abstract
The key to fully realizing the potential of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) lies in balancing their inherent local chemical disordering with the long&#8208;range ordering required for electrochemical applications. Herein, we synthesized a distinctive L10&#8208;(PtIr)(FeMoBi) high&#8208;entropy intermetallics (HEIs) exhibiting nanoscale long&#8208;range order and atomic scale short&#8208;range disorder via a lattice compensation strategy to mitigate the entropy reduction tendency. The (PtIr)(FeMoBi) catalyst exhibited remarkable activity and selectivity of glycollic acid (GA) production via electrocatalytic waste polymer&#8208;derived ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR). With a mass activity of 5.2&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for GA of 95&#8201;%, it outperformed most previously reported electrocatalysts for selective GA production. The lattice&#8208;compensation effect promotes the homogeneity of Pt and Fe actives sites, facilitating co&#8208;adsorption of EG and OH and reducing the energy barriers for dehydrogenation and OH&#8208;combination processes. This approach effectively avoids the formation of low&#8208;active sites commonly encountered in HEA solid solutions, offering a promising avenue for exploring the complex interplay between catalytic activity and HEI structures.

         <title>High Configuration Entropy Promises Electrochemical Stability of Chloride Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy, Long&#8208;Life All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>

We present a high&#8208;entropy strategy for high&#8208;voltage stable solid&#8208;state electrolytes. With a typical high&#8208;entropy chloride solid&#8208;state electrolyte Li2.9In0.75Zr0.1Sc0.05Er0.05Y0.05Cl6, we show that the high&#8208;entropy strategy not only enhances the ionic conductivity but also realizes unprecedented high&#8208;voltage stability for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with a long cycling life.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity, stability, and interface compatibility are indispensable for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;life all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), yet there are scarce SSEs with sufficient ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, with a high&#8208;entropy SSE (HE&#8208;SSE, Li2.9In0.75Zr0.1Sc0.05Er0.05Y0.05Cl6), we show the high configuration entropy has a thermodynamically positive relationship with the high&#8208;voltage stability. As a result, the ASSBs with HE&#8208;SSE and high&#8208;voltage cathode materials exhibit superior high&#8208;voltage and long&#8208;cycle stability, achieving 250&#8197;cycles with 81.4&#8201;% capacity retention when charged to 4.8&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li), and even 5000&#8197;cycles if charged to 4.6&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li). Experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations confirm that the HE&#8208;SSE greatly suppresses the high&#8208;voltage degradation of SSE at the interface, promoting the high&#8208;voltage stability coordinately through high entropy and interface stability. The high entropy design offers a general strategy to simultaneously improve the high&#8208;voltage stability and ionic conductivity of SSEs, creating an avenue to building high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;life ASSBs.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Transportation Across Liquid Membranes Mediated by Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This first report of using chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) as enantioselective carriers in bulk liquid membranes (BLMs) shows that CCOFs enhance the efficiency and enantioselectivity of amino acid separation. Exfoliating CCOFs into nanosheets creates flexible layers with accessible sites, enabling the separation of chiral drug enantiomers unattainable with the pristine CCOFs.







Abstract
Chiral liquid membrane separation is crucial in pharmaceuticals and chemical synthesis for its simplicity and stability, yet designing membrane carriers that enable efficient enantioseparation remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that chiral porous materials can act as mobile carriers of bulk liquid membranes (BLMs) to enhance enantioselective transport and separation. We design and prepare three 2D chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs) by imine condensations of a chiral dialdehyde with triamines containing ethyl, fluorine and/or isopropyl groups. These isostructural CCOFs feature ABC stacking, excellent water, acid and base tolerance, and chiral amine groups in 1D porous channels, promoting efficient enantioselective transportation of amino acid enantiomers. Among them, the CCOF with both &#8208;F and &#8208;iPr groups showing superior transport performance. Exfoliating the CCOF into chiral nanosheets creates flexible layers with accessible active sites, enabling nanosheet&#8208;mediated liquid membranes to separate chiral drug enantiomers, a feat unattainable with the pristine CCOF. This work establishes CCOFs as a promising platform for chiral BLM separations and will guide the design of high&#8208;performance BLMs using porous materials for enantioselective separation.

         <title>Starfish&#8208;Inspired Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;ion Conductive Membrane with Balanced Rigidity and Flexibility for Ultrastable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional &#8220;starfish&#8208;type&#8221; solid&#8208;state electrolyte film (PAN/MOFs/ILs) with balanced rigidity and flexibility was developed, demonstrating excellent ionic conductivity (~4.37&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature), a wide electrochemical window (~5.34&#8197;V), uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, and a high transference number (~0.69). Consequently, the LiFePO4/CPEs/Li cell achieved ultrastable cycling performance, retaining 90.1&#8201;% capacity after 2100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C.







Abstract
The performance of solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (SSLMB) is often constrained by the low ionic conductivity, narrow electrochemical window, and insufficient mechanical strength of polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes. Inspired by the soft&#8208;outside, rigid&#8208;inside structure of starfish, we designed multifunctional &#8220;starfish&#8208;type&#8221; composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) using electrospinning technology. These CPEs feature a three&#8208;dimensional rigid skeleton network composed of polyacrylonitrile/metal&#8211;organic frameworks/ionic liquids (PAN/MOFs/ILs), creating continuous and efficient Li+ transport channels: MOFs impart rigidity, PEO acts as a cushioning outer layer to enhance interfacial compatibility, and ILs reduce interfacial resistance. The resulting CPEs exhibited excellent ionic conductivity (4.37&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), a wide electrochemical window (5.34&#8197;V), uniform lithium&#8208;ion flux, and a high transference number (0.69). Leveraging these synergistic advantages, the Li/CPEs/Li symmetric cell demonstrated outstanding dendrite suppression for over 1300&#8197;hours, and the LiFePO4/CPEs/Li cell retained 90.1&#8201;% capacity after 2100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C, which is the best performance reported for SSLMB with MOF/PEO. The formation of multi&#8208;component solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase and its role in stabilizing lithium metal cycling were systematically elucidated through theoretical simulations and spectroscopic analysis. This nature&#8208;inspired design provides a promising strategy for the development of stable solid&#8208;state electrolytes with extended lifespans.

Leveraging these synergistic advantages, the Li/CPEs/Li symmetric cell demonstrated outstanding dendrite suppression for over 1300&#8197;hours, and the LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/CPEs/Li cell retained 90.1&#8201;% capacity after 2100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C, which is the best performance reported for SSLMB with MOF/PEO. The formation of multi-component solid-electrolyte interphase and its role in stabilizing lithium metal cycling were systematically elucidated through theoretical simulations and spectroscopic analysis. This nature-inspired design provides a promising strategy for the development of stable solid-state electrolytes with extended lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Recyclable polyethylene&#8208;like multiblock polymers offer tunable mechanical properties spanning LLDPE and LDPE while maintaining high melting temperatures. Synthesized using dehydrogenative polymerization, the glass transition temperature of these materials can be modulated through side&#8208;chain branching. They demonstrate chemical recyclability, selective depolymerization in mixed streams, and adjustable adhesive strength, promoting circularity and sustainable solutions for the plastic waste crisis, as reported by Garret M. Miyake et al in their Research Article (e202415707).

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Organonitrogen Compounds via Hydroxylamine&#8208;Mediated Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroxylamine&#8208;mediated cascade reaction combines the electrochemical synthesis of hydroxylamine and the chemical synthesis of organonitrogen compounds, offering a facile, green, and efficient pathway. The system alleviates the environmental crisis caused by the unbalanced natural nitrogen cycle and reduces the waste of resources in the transport and purification process.







Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is a key intermediate in the formation of numerous high value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds. The traditional synthesis of NH2OH requires the use of precious metals under high temperature conditions, which leads to high cost, high energy consumption, and environmental pollution. The NH2OH&#8208;mediated cascade reaction integrates the electrochemical synthesis of NH2OH and the chemical synthesis of organonitrogen compounds, offering a facile, green, and efficient alternative. This review presents the recent advances on electrosynthesis of high value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds by NH2OH&#8208;mediated cascade reactions. We present key concepts and the transformation process of different N&#8208;species to NH2OH, discuss suitable substrates and electrocatalysts, and elucidate the reaction mechanisms involved in generating compounds such as amino acids, cyclohexanone oxime, urea, amine, etc.. Finally, we address current challenges and future directions in this emerging field to encourage further research effort and the development of NH2OH&#8208;mediated cascade reaction.

         <title>Innate Immune Activation with Multifunctional Nanoparticles for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the roles of innate immune modulators (IIMs) in cancer therapy and their ability to enhance the antitumor effects of immune checkpoint blockade and summarizes recent progress in the development of IIM nanotherapeutics to target cGAS&#8208;STING, TLR, and RLR pathways. Multifunctional nanoparticles combining IIMs and chemotherapy, radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, or tumor vaccines are discussed next, followed by brief summaries of the lessons learned, current challenges, and future perspectives in optimizing IIM nanotherapeutics for cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has revolutionized the treatment of many cancers by leveraging the immune system to combat malignancies. However, its efficacy is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and other regulatory mechanisms of the immune system. Innate immune modulators (IIMs) provide potent immune activation to complement adaptive immune responses and help overcome resistance to ICB. This minireview provides an overview of IIMs and their roles in antitumor immune responses and summarizes recent advances in developing nanotechnology to enhance the delivery of IIMs to tumors for potentiating cancer immunotherapy and mitigating systemic toxicity. We discuss innovative nanoparticle platforms for the delivery of IIMs targeting the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes pathway, the toll&#8208;like receptor pathway, and the retinoic acid&#8208;inducible gene I&#8208;like receptor pathway. We review the preliminary clinical readouts of representative IIM nanoptherapeutics and highlight the development of multifunctional nanoparticles for combination treatments of IIMs with conventional treatment mdoalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, photodynmic therapy, and tumor antigens. Finally, we summarize the lessons learned from the existing systems, the challenges in the field, and future perspectives for this exciting field of nanotherapeutics for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Tetrazine Amplification System for Visual Detection of Trace Analytes via Click&#8208;Release Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrazine amplification system is introduced, utilizing a &#8220;click&#8208;release&#8208;oxidation&#8208;cycle&#8221; (CROC) cascade amplification process. This study presents the construction of the CROC system and its application in visually detecting low concentrations of &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and Pd&#8201;2&#8201;+. The system achieves a 10&#8201;5&#8208;fold amplification of the tetrazine signal, enabling detection at concentrations as low as 2&#8197;nM.







Abstract
Achieving visual detection of analytes at ultra&#8208;low concentrations in complex mixtures remains a persistent challenge. While sophisticated techniques offer single&#8208;molecule sensitivity, practical hurdles remain, necessitating tailored signal amplification systems for direct visual detection. In this study, we develop a strategy for the visualized detection of tetrazine through a &#8220;click&#8208;release&#8208;oxidation&#8208;cycle&#8221; (CROC) cascade amplification process. We systematically describe the construction and synthesis of this system, the kinetic process of click release, the kinetics of oxidation to tetrazine and its cascade amplification effect in trace amounts of tetrazine. This system is capable of amplifying the signal of tetrazine at a concentration as low as 2&#8197;nM by 105&#8208;fold, thereby providing a clearly visible purple signal. Finally, as proof of concept, we successfully apply this method to visually detect trace &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (&#946;&#8208;gal) and Pd2+.

         <title>Adsorbate Resonance Induces Water&#8208;Metal Bonds in Electrochemical Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water in electrochemical environments forms hydrogen bonds with surface adsorbed intermediates, stabilizing them. However, the stabilization is not explained solely by hydrogen bonding, indicating additional effects. Using density functional theory (DFT) on coadsorbed OH and water on complex solid solutions (CSSs), we link the residual stabilization to resonance between near&#8208;surface water and *OH, which induces covalency for water to the surface.







Abstract
This study delves into the intricate interactions between surface&#8208;near species, OH and H2O, on electrodes in electrochemical interfaces. These species are an inevitable part of many electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction. In our modeling, we utilize high statistics on a dataset of complex solid solutions with high atomic variability to show the emergence of H2O&#8208;metal covalent bonds under specific conditions. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations of adsorption energies on many thousands of different surface compositions, we provide a quantifiable physical understanding of this induced water covalency, which is rooted in simple quantum mechanics. Directional hydrogen bonding between surface&#8208;near H2O and OH, enables surface bonding electrons to delocalize, mediated&#160;by near&#8208;symmetrical adsorbate resonance structures. The different adsorbate resonance structures differ by surface coordination explaining the induced H2O&#8208;metal bonding.

&lt;p&gt;Water in electrochemical environments forms hydrogen bonds with surface adsorbed intermediates, stabilizing them. However, the stabilization is not explained solely by hydrogen bonding, indicating additional effects. Using density functional theory (DFT) on coadsorbed OH and water on complex solid solutions (CSSs), we link the residual stabilization to resonance between near-surface water and *OH, which induces covalency for water to the surface.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study delves into the intricate interactions between surface-near species, OH and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, on electrodes in electrochemical interfaces. These species are an inevitable part of many electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction. In our modeling, we utilize high statistics on a dataset of complex solid solutions with high atomic variability to show the emergence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-metal covalent bonds under specific conditions. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations of adsorption energies on many thousands of different surface compositions, we provide a quantifiable physical understanding of this induced water covalency, which is rooted in simple quantum mechanics. Directional hydrogen bonding between surface-near H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and OH, enables surface bonding electrons to delocalize, mediated&#160;by near-symmetrical adsorbate resonance structures. The different adsorbate resonance structures differ by surface coordination explaining the induced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-metal bonding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Porous Halogen&#8208;Bonded Frameworks Assembled through Hetero&#8208;polytopic Ion Pair Templation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 7, February 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetratopic halogen&#8208;bond donor with a discrete cation binding site was designed and synthesised. When crystallised with NaCl, a 3D framework is formed where the charge&#8208;balancing cation is sequestered in the 20&#8208;crown&#8208;6 moiety. The framework is porous to solvent and iodine vapour, and undergoes single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal reactions.







Abstract
Halogen&#8208;bonding (XB) interactions have been extensively studied in the preparation of crystalline frameworks, yet porous 3D framework materials built on XBs remain elusive. The donor&#8208;acceptor interactions are strengthened by use of anionic XB acceptors; however, the requisite charge&#8208;balancing cations typically disrupt the framework and occupy potential void space. In this work, we prepare a tetratopic XB donor bearing a crown ether moiety for sodium cation sequestration. We show that when this ionpair receptor is crystallised with NaCl it gives a 3D framework that is porous to solvent and vapour, and undergoes single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal reactions.

&lt;p&gt;A tetratopic halogen-bond donor with a discrete cation binding site was designed and synthesised. When crystallised with NaCl, a 3D framework is formed where the charge-balancing cation is sequestered in the 20-crown-6 moiety. The framework is porous to solvent and iodine vapour, and undergoes single-crystal to single-crystal reactions.
