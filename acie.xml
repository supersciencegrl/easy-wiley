         <title>Manipulating Electron&#8208;Transfer Events in [Fe4Co4] Cubes via a Mixed&#8208;Ligand Approach: The Impact of Elastic Frustration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The engineering of intermolecular interaction is challenging but critical for magnetically switchable molecules. Here, we prepared two cyanide&#8208;bridged {Fe4Co4} cube complexes via the alkynyl&#8208; and alcohol&#8208;functionalized trispyrazoyl capping ligands. The alkynyl&#8208;functionalized 1 exhibited a reversible thermal&#8208;induced incomplete metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron transfer (MMET) behavior at around 220 K, while the mixed alkynyl/alcohol&#8208;functionalized cube of 2 showed a complete and abrupt MMET behavior at 232 K, and remarkably, both showed a long&#8208;lived photo&#8208;induced metastable state near 200 K. The crystallographic study demonstrated that the incomplete transition of 1 was likely due to the possible elastic frustration originating from the competition between the anion&#8208;propagated elastic interactions and inter&#8208;cluster alkynyl&#8208;alkynyl &amp; CH/alkynyl interactions, whereas the latter are eliminated in 2 as a result of the partial substitution by the alcohol&#8208;functionalized ligands. Additionally, the introduction of chemically distinguishable cobalt centers within the cube unit of 2 did not lead to a two&#8208;step but a one&#8208;step transition, possibly because of the strong ferroelastic intramolecular interaction through the cyanide bridges.</dc:description>

         <title>About Perfluoropolyhedranes, Their Electron&#8208;Accepting Ability and Questionable Supramolecular Hosting Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyhedral molecules appeal for their eye&#8208;catching architecture and distinctive chemistry. Perfluorination of such, often greatly strained compounds, is a momentous challenge. It drastically changes electron distribution, structure and properties. Notably, small high&#8208;symmetry perfluoropolyhedranes feature a centrally located, star&#8208;shaped low&#8208;energy unoccupied molecular orbital that can host an extra electron within the polyhedral frame, thus producing a radical anion, without loss of symmetry. This predicted electron&#8208;hosting capacity was definitely established for perfluorocubane, the first perfluorinated Platonic polyhedrane to be isolated pure. Hosting atoms, molecules or ions in such &#8220;cage&#8221; structures is, however, all but forthright, when not illusionary, offering no easy access to supramolecular constructs. While adamantane and cubane have fostered numerous applications in materials science, medicine and biology, specific uses for their perfluorinated counterparts remain to be established. Some aspects of highly fluorinated carbon allotropes, such as fullerenes or graphite, are briefly mentioned for context.</dc:description>

         <title>New Radical Route and Insight for Highly Efficient Benzimidazoles Synthesis Integrated with Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzimidazoles are a versatile class of scaffolds with important biological activities, whereas their synthesis in a lower&#8208;cost and more efficient manner remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually new radical route for the high&#8208;performance photoredox coupling of alcohols and diamines to synthesize benzimidazoles along with stoichiometric hydrogen (H2) over Pd&#8208;decorated ultrathin ZnO nanosheets (Pd/ZnO NSs). Mechanistic study reveals the unique advantage of ZnO NSs over other supports and particularly that the features of Pd nanoparticles in facilitating the cleavage of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of alcohols and adsorbing subsequently&#8208;generated C&#8722;centered radicals hold the key to turning on the reaction. This work highlights a new insight into radical&#8208;induced efficient benzimidazoles synthesis pairing with H2 evolution by rationally designing semiconductor&#8208;based photoredox systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Customizable Supraparticles Constructed from Catechol&#8208;Terminated Molecular Building Blocks with Controllable Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal supraparticles integrated with multicomponent primary particles, come with emerging or synergetic functionalities. However, achieving functional customization of supraparticles remains a great challenge due to the limited option of building blocks with tailorability and functional extensibility. Herein, we developed a universal approach to construct customizable supraparticles with desired properties from molecular building blocks obtained by the covalent conjugation of catechol groups with a series of orthogonal functional groups. These catechol&#8208;terminated molecular building blocks can assemble into primary particles driven by various intermolecular interactions (i.e., metal&#8208;organic coordination, host&#8208;guest, and hydrophobic interaction), and then further assemble into supraparticles governed by catechol&#8208;mediated interfacial interactions. Our strategy enables supraparticles with diverse functionalities, such as dual&#8208;pH responsiveness, light&#8208;controllable permeability, and non&#8208;invasive fluorescence labeling of living cells. The ease with which these supraparticles can be fabricated, and the ability to tailor their chemical and physical properties through the choice of metals and orthogonal functional groups used, should enable a variety of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Sandwich&#8208;Kernelled AgCu Nanoclusters with Golden Ratio Geometry and Promising Photothermal Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal nanoclusters have recently attracted extensive interest from the scientific community. However, unlike carbon&#8208;based materials and metal nanocrystals, they rarely exhibit a sheet kernel structure, probably owing to the instability caused by the high exposure of metal atoms (particularly in the relatively less noble Ag or Cu nanoclusters) in such a structure. Herein, we synthesized a novel AgCu nanocluster with a sandwich&#8208;like kernel (diameter = ~0.9 nm and length = ~0.25 nm) by introducing the furfuryl mercaptan ligand (FUR) and the alloying strategy. Interestingly, the kernel consists of a centered silver atom and two planar Ag10 pentacle units with completely mirrored symmetry after a rotation of 36 degrees. The two Ag10 pentacles and some extended structures show an unreported golden ratio geometry, and the two inner five&#8208;membered rings and the centered Ag atom form an unanticipated full&#8208;metal ferrocene&#8208;like structure. The featured kernel structure causes the dominant radial direction transition of excitation electrons, as determined via time&#8208;dependent density functional theory calculations, which affords the protruding absorption at 612 nm and contributes to the promising photothermal conversion efficiency of 67.6% of the as&#8208;obtained nanocluster, having important implications for structure&#8208;property correlation and the development of nanocluser&#8208;based photothermal materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Tough Thermoplastic Elastomers by Leveraging Rigid&#8211;Flexible Supramolecular Segment Interplays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular interactions facilitate the development of tough multifunctional thermoplastic elastomers. However, the fundamental principles that govern supramolecular toughening are barely understood, and the rational design to achieve the desired high toughness remains daunting. Herein, we report a simple and robust method for toughening thermoplastic elastomers by rationally tailoring hard&#8211;soft phase separation structures containing rigid and flexible supramolecular segments. The introduced functional segments with distinct structural rigidities provide mismatched supramolecular interactions to efficiently tune the energy dissipation and bear an external load. The optimal supramolecular elastomer containing aromatic amide and acylsemicarbazide moieties demonstrates a record toughness (1.2 GJ m&#8722;3), extraordinary crack tolerance (fracture energy 282.5 kJ m&#8722;2), an ultrahigh true stress at break (2.3 GPa), good elasticity, healing ability, recyclability, and impact resistance. The toughening mechanism is validated by testing various elastomers, confirming the potential for designing and developing super&#8208;tough supramolecular materials with promising applications in aerospace and electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Evidence of a Uranium&#8208;Paddlewheel Node in a Catecholate&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interactions between uranium and non&#8208;innocent organic species are an essential component of fundamental uranium redox chemistry. However, they have seldom been explored in the context of multidimensional, porous materials. Uranium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer a new angle to study these interactions, as these self&#8208;assembled species stabilize uranium species through immobilization by organic linkers within a crystalline framework, while potentially providing a method for adjusting metal oxidation state through coordination of non&#8208;innocent linkers. We report the synthesis of the MOF NU&#8208;1700, assembled from U4+&#8208;paddlewheel nodes and catecholate&#8208;based linkers. We propose this highly unusual structure, which contains two U4+ in a paddlewheel built from four linkers &#8211; a first among uranium materials &#8211; as a result of extensive characterization via powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), sorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), in addition to density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Flytraps Held Together by Pt&#8210;Pt Intermetallic Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8210;metal bonds have rarely been explored as active elements in supramolecular assemblies despite their unique potential to introduce responsive behavior. In this report, a dynamic molecular container composed of two cyclometalated Pt units is constructed using Pt&#8210;Pt bonds. This molecule &#8212; the flytrap &#8212; has a flexible jaw composed of two [18]crown&#8208;6 ethers that can adapt their shape to bind large inorganic cations with sub&#8208;micromolar affinity. Along with the spectroscopic and crystallographic characterization of the flytrap, we report its photochemical assembly, which allows the capture of ions and their transport from solution to the solid state. In addition, we have been able to recycle the flytrap to regenerate its starting material due to the reversible nature of the Pt&#8210;Pt bond. We believe that other molecular containers and materials for harvesting valuable substrates from solution could be assembled using the advances presented here.</dc:description>

         <title>General Autofluorescence Method to Characterize Polymerization Progress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An autofluorescence technique to characterize polymerization progress in real time/in line was developed, which functioned in the absence of typical fluorogenic groups on the monomer or polymer. The monomer dicyclopentadiene and polymer polydicyclopentadiene&#160;are hydrocarbons that lack traditional functional groups for fluorescence spectroscopy. Here, the autofluorescence of formulations containing this monomer and polymer during ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) was harnessed for reaction monitoring. The methods fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and here&#8208;developed fluorescence lifetime recovery after photobleaching (FLRAP) characterized polymerization progress in these native systems&#8212;without requiring exogenous fluorophore. (Auto)fluorescence lifetime recovery changes during polymerization correlated linearly to degree of cure, providing a quantitative link with reaction progress. These changing signals also provided relative rates of background polymerization, enabling comparison of 10 different catalyst&#8211;inhibitor&#8208;stabilized formulations. Multiple&#8208;well analysis demonstrated suitability for future high&#8208;throughput evaluation of formulations for thermosets. The central concept of the combined autofluorescence and FLRAP/FRAP method may be extendable to monitoring other polymerization reactions previously overlooked for lack of an obvious fluorescence handle.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis of the Dynamics of the Human Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor Reveals Insights into the Energy Landscape of the Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G protein&#8208;coupled receptors initiate signal transduction in response to ligand binding. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), the focus of this study, binds the 28 residue peptide ghrelin. While structures of GHSR in different states of activation are available, dynamics within each state have not been investigated in depth. We analyze long molecular dynamics simulation trajectories using &#8220;detec&#173;tors&#8221; to compare dynamics of the apo and ghrelin&#8208;bound states yield&#173;ing timescale&#8208;specific amplitudes of motion. We identify differ&#173;ences in dynamics between apo and ghrelin&#8208;bound GHSR in the extracellular loop 2 and transmembrane helices 5&#8208;7. NMR of the GHSR histidine residues reveals chemical shift differences in these regions. We eva&#173;luate timescale specific correlation of motions between residues of ghre&#173;lin and GHSR, where binding yields a high degree of correlation for the first 8 ghrelin residues, but less correlation for the helical end. Finally, we investigate the traverse of GHSR over a rugged energy land&#173;scape via principal component analysis.Insert abstract text here.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiol&#8208;Aldehyde Polycondensation for Bio&#8208;based Adaptable and Degradable Phenolic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing sustainable materials with tunable mechanical properties, intrinsic degradability, and recyclability from renewable biomass through a mild process has become vital in polymer science. Traditional phenolic resins are generally considered to be not degradable or recyclable. Here we report the design and synthesis of linear and network structured phenolic polymers using facile polycondensation between natural aldehyde&#8208;bearing phenolic compounds and polymercaptans. Linear phenolic products are amorphous with Tg between &#8208;9 oC and&#160;12 oC. Cross&#8208;linked networks from vanillin and its di&#8208;functional derivative exhibited excellent mechanical strength between 6&#8208;64 MPa. The connecting dithioacetals are associatively adaptable strong bonds and susceptible to degradation in oxidative conditions to regenerate vanillin. These results highlight the potential of biobased sustainable phenolic polymers with recyclability and selective degradation, as a complement to the traditional phenol&#8208;formaldehyde resins.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to its excellent bioactivity profile that is increasingly utilized in pharmaceutical and synthetic chemistry, spirooxindole is an important core scaffold. We herein describe an efficient method for the construction of highly functionalized new spirooxindolocarbamates via a gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reaction of terminal alkynes or ynamides with isatin&#8208;derived ketimines. This protocol has a good functional group compatibility, readily available starting materials, mild reaction conditions, low catalyst loadings and no additives. It enables the transformation of various functionalized alkyne groups into cyclic carbamates. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis was achieved and DFT calculations verify the feasibility of the mechanistic proposal. Some of the target products exhibit good to excellent antiproliferative activity on human tumor cell lines. In addition, one of the most active compounds displayed a remarkable selectivity towards tumor cells over normal ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Amplified Chirality Transfer to Aromatic Molecules through Non&#8208;specific Inclusion by Amorphous, Hyperbranched Poly(fluorenevinylene) Derivatives</title>

Chirality transfer efficiency was much higher with higher&#8208;molar&#8208;mass polymers than lower&#8208;molar&#8208;mass ones and with hyperbranched polymers than the analogous linear ones. The hyperbranched polymers include the small molecules in their complex structure without any specific interactions at flexible stoichiometry. The included molecules may have ordered intermolecular arrangement that may be somewhat similar to those of liquid crystals. Naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene included in the polymer exhibited efficient circularly polarized luminescence where chirality was remarkably amplified in excited states, and anthracene exhibited especially high anisotropies in emission of the order of 10&#8208;2.</dc:description>

Naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene included in the polymer exhibited efficient circularly polarized luminescence where chirality was remarkably amplified in excited states, and anthracene exhibited especially high anisotropies in emission of the order of 10-2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactive Magnesium Nitride Additive: A Drop&#8208;in Solution for Lithium/Garnet Wetting in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Powder&#8208;form Mg3N2 offers a drop&#8208;in solution to improve lithium metal anode/garnet oxide electrolyte wetting and to suppress dynamic de&#8208;wetting in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. The concept of reactive dispersion&#8208;plus&#8208;wetting can be applied to the design and processing of other solid&#8208;state materials and devices.







Abstract
Garnet oxides such as Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) are promising solid electrolyte materials for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries because of high ionic conductivity, low electronic leakage, and wide electrochemical stability window. While LLZTO has been frequently discussed to be stable against lithium metal anode, it is challenging to achieve and maintain good solid&#8208;on&#8208;solid wetting at the metal/ceramic interface in both processing and extended electrochemical cycling. Here we address the challenge by a powder&#8208;form magnesium nitride additive, which reacts with the lithium metal anode to produce well&#8208;dispersed lithium nitride. The in situ formed lithium nitride promotes reactive wetting at the Li/LLZTO interface, which lowers interfacial resistance, increases critical current density (CCD), and improves cycling stability of the electrochemical cells. The additive recipe has been diversified to titanium nitride, zirconium nitride, tantalum nitride, and niobium nitride, thus supporting the general concept of reactive dispersion&#8208;plus&#8208;wetting. Such a design can be extended to other solid&#8208;state devices for better functioning and extended cycle life.

         <title>Cluster Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Containing Copper Iodine Cube with 100&#8201;% Exciton Utilization Using Host&#8208;Cluster Synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cluster light&#8208;emitting diode (CLED) with a record external quantum efficiency of 29.4&#8201;% was demonstrated. Its emissive layer consisted of redox&#8208;active Cu4I4 cluster and thermally activated delayed fluorescence host, which complementarily provided internal and external reverse intersystem crossing channels for 100&#8201;% triplet conversion, 100&#8208;fold increased singlet radiation rate constant and tenfold decreased triplet non&#8208;radiation rate constant.







Abstract
Clusters combine the advantages of organic molecules and inorganic nanomaterials, which are promising alternatives for optoelectronic applications. Nonetheless, recently emerged cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes require further excited state optimization of cluster emitters, especially to reduce population of the cluster&#8208;centered triplet quenching state (3CC). Here we report that redox&#8208;active ligands enhance reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) of Cu4I4 cluster for triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet conversion, and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) host can provide an external RISC channel. It indicates that the complementarity between TADF host and cluster in RISC transitions gives rise to 100&#8201;% triplet conversion efficiency and complete singlet exciton convergence, rendering 100&#8208;fold increased singlet radiation rate constant and tenfold decreased triplet non&#8208;radiation rate constant. We achieve a photoluminescence quantum yield of 99&#8201;% and a record external quantum efficiency of 29.4&#8201;%.

         <title>Hyperpolarized 13C&#8197;NMR Spectroscopy of Urine Samples at Natural Abundance by Quantitative Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperpolarized 13C&#8197;NMR spectroscopy by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization provides a rich and resolved 13C metabolic profile on urine samples at natural abundance while retaining precious quantitative information using a standard addition workflow.







Abstract
Hyperpolarized nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) offers an ensemble of methods that remarkably address the sensitivity issues of conventional NMR. Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (d&#8208;DNP) provides a unique and general way to detect 13C&#8197;NMR signals with a sensitivity enhanced by several orders of magnitude. The expanding application scope of d&#8208;DNP now encompasses the analysis of complex mixtures at natural 13C abundance. However, the application of d&#8208;DNP in this area has been limited to metabolite extracts. Here, we report the first d&#8208;DNP&#8208;enhanced 13C&#8197;NMR analysis of a biofluid &#8208;urine&#8208; at natural abundance, offering unprecedented resolution and sensitivity for this challenging type of sample. We also show that accurate quantitative information on multiple targeted metabolites can be retrieved through a standard addition procedure.

         <title>Piezochromism in Dynamic Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission or aggregation&#8208;caused quenching chromophores are prepared. For first time they are used to study piezochromism under mechanical stimuli by the diamond anvil cell technique.







Abstract
Piezochromic materials with pressure&#8208;dependent photoluminescence tuning properties are important in many fields, such as mechanical sensors, security papers, and storage devices. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as an emerging class of crystalline porous materials (CPMs) with structural dynamics and tunable photophysical properties, are suitable for designing piezochromic materials, but there are few related studies. Herein, we report two dynamic three&#8208;dimensional COFs based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) or aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) chromophores, termed JUC&#8208;635 and JUC&#8208;636 (JUC=Jilin University China), and for the first time, study their piezochromic behavior by diamond anvil cell technique. Due to the various luminescent groups, JUC&#8208;635 has completely different solvatochromism and molecular aggregation behavior in the solvents. More importantly, JUC&#8208;635 with AIE effect exhibits a sustained fluorescence upon pressure increase (&#8776;3&#8197;GPa), and reversible sensitivity with high&#8208;contrast emission differences (&#916;&#955;em=187&#8197;nm) up to 12&#8197;GPa, superior to other CPMs reported so far. Therefore, this study will open a new gate to expand the potential applications of COFs as exceptional piezochromic materials in pressure sensing, barcoding, and signal switching.

         <title>Solar Hydrocarbons: Single&#8208;Step, Atmospheric&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of C2&#8722;C4 Alkanes and Alkenes from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At atmospheric pressure, solar&#8208;energy&#8208;assisted one&#8208;step CO2 hydrogenation to C2&#8722;C4 hydrocarbons is realized with considerable activity. The photothermal effect of light plays an essential role in the distinct selectivity to hydrocarbons. Promising results obtained from a laboratory demonstration bode well for the development of a solar hydrocarbon pilot refinery.







Abstract
Cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) spinel has been found to produce C2&#8722;C4 hydrocarbons in a single&#8208;step, ambient&#8208;pressure, photocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 with a rate of 1.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, selectivity of 29.8&#8201;% and conversion yield of 12.9&#8201;%. On stream the CoFe2O4 reconstructs to a CoFe&#8722;CoFe2O4 alloy&#8208;spinel nanocomposite which facilitates the light&#8208;assisted transformation of CO2 to CO and hydrogenation of the CO to C2&#8722;C4 hydrocarbons. Promising results obtained from a laboratory demonstrator bode well for the development of a solar hydrocarbon pilot refinery.

&lt;p&gt;Cobalt ferrite (CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) spinel has been found to produce C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons in a single-step, ambient-pressure, photocatalytic hydrogenation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a rate of 1.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, selectivity of 29.8&#8201;% and conversion yield of 12.9&#8201;%. On stream the CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; reconstructs to a CoFe&#8722;CoFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; alloy-spinel nanocomposite which facilitates the light-assisted transformation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO and hydrogenation of the CO to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; hydrocarbons. Promising results obtained from a laboratory demonstrator bode well for the development of a solar hydrocarbon pilot refinery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Linear Adsorption Enables NO Selective Electroreduction to Hydroxylamine on Single Co Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and Co nanoparticles (Co NPs) were reported for the selective electroreduction of NO to NH2OH and NH3 by regulating the adsorption configuration of NO. The linear adsorption of NO on Co SACs could maintain the N&#8722;O bond in the hydrogenation process to generate NH2OH, while the bridge adsorption of NO on Co NPs would weaken the N&#8722;O bond, leading to the breaking of the N&#8722;O bond to produce ammonia.







Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH), a vital industrial feedstock, is presently synthesized under harsh conditions with serious environmental and energy concerns. Electrocatalytic nitric oxide (NO) reduction is attractive for the production of hydroxylamine under ambient conditions. However, hydroxylamine selectivity is limited by the competitive reaction of ammonia production. Herein, we regulate the adsorption configuration of NO by adjusting the atomic structure of catalysts to control the product selectivity. Co single&#8208;atom catalysts show state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH2OH selectivity from NO electroreduction under neutral conditions (FE
: 81.3&#8201;%), while Co nanoparticles are inclined to generate ammonia (FE
: 92.3&#8201;%). A series of in situ characterizations and theoretical simulations unveil that linear adsorption of NO on isolated Co sites enables hydroxylamine formation and bridge adsorption of NO on adjacent Co sites induces the production of ammonia.

         <title>Regiodivergent C&#8722;H Acylation of Arenes by Switching from Ionic&#8208; to Radical&#8208;Type Chemistry Using NHC Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent benzoylation of 2&#8208;methoxynaphthalene with benzoyl fluoride is presented using either Friedel&#8211;Crafts&#8208;type chemistry to give selectively the 1&#8208;isomer or cooperative NHC/photoredox catalysis to afford the 4&#8208;isomer exclusively. Along with arenes, regiodivergent aroylation also works for heteroarenes.







Abstract
The Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation reaction, which belongs to the class of electrophilic aromatic substitutions is a highly valuable and versatile reaction in synthesis. Regioselectivity is predictable and determined by electronic as well as steric factors of the (hetero)arene substrate. Herein, a radical approach for the acylation of arenes and heteroarenes is presented. C&#8722;H acylation is achieved through mild cooperative photoredox/NHC radical catalysis with the cross&#8208;coupling of an arene radical cation with an NHC&#8208;bound ketyl radical as a key step. As compared to the classical Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation, a regiodivergent outcome is observed upon switching from the ionic to the radical mode. In these divergent reactions, aroyl fluorides act as the acylation reagents in both the ionic as well as the radical process.

         <title>Diastereoselective Biomimetic Synthesis of Dimeric Tetrahydrocarbazoles via a Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization&#8208;[3+2] Cyclodimerization Cascade</title>

         <dc:description>
Discovery and development of a CuII&#8208;catalyzed, diastereoselective, biomimetic cycloisomerization&#8208;[3+2] cyclodimerization of 1&#8208;(indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;3&#8208;ols to access structurally unprecedented dimeric&#8208;tetrahydrocarbazoles is reported. Control experiments, isolation of monomer intermediates and their conversion into cyclodimerized products delineated the dimerization as being either homochiral or heterochiral [3+2] annulation of in situ generated monomers.







Abstract
The cyclodimerization (homochiral&#8208; and heterochiral&#8722;) of monomeric units for the construction of stereodefined polycyclic systems is a powerful strategy in both biosynthesis and biomimetic synthesis. Herein we have discovered and developed a CuII&#8208; catalyzed, biomimetic, diastereoselective tandem cycloisomerization&#8208;[3+2] cyclodimerization of 1&#8208;(indol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pent&#8208;4&#8208;yn&#8208;3&#8208;ol. This novel strategy operates under very mild conditions, providing access to structurally unprecedented dimeric tetrahydrocarbazoles fused to a tetrahydrofuran unit in excellent yields of the products. Several fruitful control experiments, isolation of the monomeric&#8208;cycloisomerized products and their subsequent conversion into the corresponding cyclodimeric products supported their intermediacy and the possible mechanism as a cycloisomerization&#8208;diastereoselective [3+2] cyclodimerization cascade. The cyclodimerization involves a substituent controlled, highly diastereoselective homochiral [3+2] annulation or heterochiral [3+2] annulation of in situ generated 3&#8208;hydroxytetrahydrocarbazoles. The key and important features of this strategy are: a) construction of three new C&#8722;C bonds &amp; one new C&#8722;O bond; b) creation of two new stereocenters, and c) construction of three new rings, in a single operation; d) low catalyst loading (1&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;%); e) 100&#8201;% atom economy; and f) rapid construction of structurally unprecedented natural product like polycyclic frameworks. A chiral pool version using an enantio&#8208; and diastereopure substrate was also demonstrated.

         <title>Controlling the Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Overlayer Structure in Pt/TiO2 Catalysts Prevents Particle Evaporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study expands the concept of the condition&#8208;dependence of overlayers induced by strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) in Pt/TiO2 catalysts. TiOX overlayer are studied with in situ TEM, and it is found that the overlayers are stable at high temperatures in oxygen and therefore can protect the platinum nanoparticles from evaporation.







Abstract
Platinum nanoparticles (NPs) supported by titania exhibit a strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI)[1] that can induce overlayer formation and encapsulation of the NP's with a thin layer of support material. This encapsulation modifies the catalyst's properties, such as increasing its chemoselectivity[2] and stabilizing it against sintering.[3] Encapsulation is typically induced during high&#8208;temperature reductive activation and can be reversed through oxidative treatments.[1] However, recent findings indicate that the overlayer can be stable in oxygen.[4,&#8201;5] Using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we investigated how the overlayer changes with varying conditions. We found that exposure to oxygen below 400&#8201;&#176;C caused disorder and removal of the overlayer upon subsequent hydrogen treatment. In contrast, elevating the temperature to 900&#8201;&#176;C while maintaining the oxygen atmosphere preserved the overlayer, preventing platinum evaporation when exposed to oxygen. Our findings demonstrate how different treatments can influence the stability of nanoparticles with or without titania overlayers. expanding the concept of SMSI and enabling noble metal catalysts to operate in harsh environments without evaporation associated losses during burn&#8208;off cycling.

         <title>Photosynthetic Fixation of CO2 in Alkenes by Heterogeneous Photoredox Catalysis with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photoredox system is reported for hydrocarboxylation of alkenes. Boron carbonitride with abundant terminal B/N defects was employed as a photo transducer, permitting construction of sterically encumbered Lewis acid&#8208;base sites that are able to synergistically activate CO2 molecules under visible light. Anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity was achieved with good functional group tolerance using CO2 as the carboxyl source.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven fixation of CO2 in organics has emerged as an appealing alternative for the synthesis of value&#8208;added fine chemicals. Challenges remain in the transformation of CO2 as well as product selectivity due to its thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. Here we develop a boron carbonitride (BCN) with the abundant terminal B/N defects around the mesoporous walls, which essentially enhances surface active sites as well as charge transfer kinetics, boosting the overall rate of CO2 adsorption and activation. In this protocol, anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrocarboxylation of alkenes with CO2 to an extended carbon chain is achieved with good functional group tolerance and specific regioselectivity under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The mechanistic studies demonstrate the formation of CO2 radical anion intermediate on defective boron carbonitride, leading to the anti&#8208;Markovnikov carboxylation. Gram&#8208;scale reaction, late&#8208;stage carboxylation of natural products and synthesis of anti&#8208;diabetic GPR40 agonists reveal the utility of this method. This study sheds new insight on the design and application of metal&#8208;free semiconductors for the conversion of CO2 in an atom&#8208;economic and sustainable manner.

&lt;p&gt;A metal-free heterogeneous photoredox system is reported for hydrocarboxylation of alkenes. Boron carbonitride with abundant terminal B/N defects was employed as a photo transducer, permitting construction of sterically encumbered Lewis acid-base sites that are able to synergistically activate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules under visible light. Anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity was achieved with good functional group tolerance using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the carboxyl source.

         <title>Fused Triangulene Dimers: Facile Synthesis by Intramolecular Radical&#8208;Radical Coupling and Application for Near&#8208;Infrared Lasers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fused triangulene dimers were synthesized by an intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling approach. The obtained material, dispersed in polystyrene films, showed amplified spontaneous emission in the near&#8208;infrared region. Solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers were also successfully fabricated.







Abstract
Large graphene&#8208;like molecules with four zigzag edges are ideal gain medium materials for organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) lasers. However, synthesizing them becomes increasingly challenging as the molecular size increases. In this study, we introduce a new intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling approach and successfully synthesize two fused triangulene dimers (1&#8201;a/1&#8201;b) efficiently. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of 1&#8201;a indicates that there is no intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking in the solid state. When the more soluble derivative 1&#8201;b is dispersed in polystyrene thin films, amplified spontaneous emission in the NIR region is observed. Using 1&#8201;b as the active gain material, we fabricate solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers that exhibit a narrow emission linewidth at around 790&#8197;nm. The laser devices also exhibit low thresholds with high photostability. Our study provides a new synthetic strategy for extended nanographenes, which have diverse applications in electronics and photonics.

         <title>Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries Based on an Ultrathin and Respirable Interphase Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries with high areal capacities, high energy and power densities, as well as long cycle number have been achieved using an ultrathin and respirable interphase layer. It enables highly reversible Li plating/stripping process and unlocks the new approaches of designing and screening novel interphase layers towards practical anode&#8208;free batteries.







Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium (Li) metal batteries are desirable candidates in pursuit of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, their poor cycling performances originated from the unsatisfactory reversibility of Li plating/stripping remains a grand challenge. Here we show a facile and scalable approach to produce high&#8208;performing anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries using a bioinspired and ultrathin (250&#8197;nm) interphase layer comprised of triethylamine germanate. The derived tertiary amine and LixGe alloy showed enhanced adsorption energy that significantly promoted Li&#8208;ion adsorption, nucleation and deposition, contributing to a reversible expansion/shrinkage process upon Li plating/stripping. Impressive Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiencies (CEs) of &#8776;99.3&#8201;% were achieved for 250&#8197;cycles in Li/Cu cells. In addition, the anode&#8208;free LiFePO4 full batteries demonstrated maximal energy and power densities of 527&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 1554&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, respectively, and remarkable cycling stability (over 250&#8197;cycles with an average CE of 99.4&#8201;%) at a practical areal capacity of &#8776;3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the highest among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art anode&#8208;free LiFePO4 batteries. Our ultrathin and respirable interphase layer presents a promising way to fully unlock large&#8208;scale production of anode&#8208;free batteries.

         <title>Functionalization of Olefinic C&#8722;H Bonds by an Aryl&#8208;to&#8208;Vinyl 1,4&#8208;Nickel Migration/Reductive Coupling Sequence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented aryl&#8208;to&#8208;vinyl 1,4&#8208;nickel/hydride shift process with further subsequent selective reductive cross&#8208;coupling with a wide variety of electrophiles has been developed. This 1,4&#8208;nickel migration/reductive coupling sequence provides a facile access to diverse alkenyl C&#8722;H&#8208;functionalized products under mild conditions and with overall good selectivity.







Abstract
An attractive approach to selective functionalization of remote C&#8722;H bonds is a metal/hydride shift/cross&#8208;coupling reaction sequence. Complimentary to the heavily exploited 1,2&#8208;nickel/hydride shift along an sp3 chain, a chain&#8208;walking process, the 1,4&#8208;nickel/hydride shift along an sp2 chain is more complex. Here we report an unprecedented aryl&#8208;to&#8208;vinyl 1,4&#8208;nickel/hydride shift reaction, in which the migratory alkenylnickel species generated in situ is selectively trapped by one of various coupling partners, such as isocyanates, alkyl bromides, aryl chlorides or alkynyl bromides, allowing regio&#8208; and stereoselective access to trisubstituted alkenes. In contrast to the well&#8208;reported ipso&#8208;aryl coupling reactions, this strategy provides remote alkenyl C&#8722;H functionalized products with good yield and with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and E/Z&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Diastereomer Resolution of M4L6 Coordination Cages by Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Resolution Ion&#8208;Mobility Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomeric coordination cages are separated and individually investigated using ultra&#8208;high&#8208;resolution ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry. Alongside iron(II), supramolecular species containing cobalt(II) and nickel(II) were also investigated, successfully demonstrating a new approach for the investigation of paramagnetic complexes.







Abstract
Coordination cages can be used for enantio&#8208; and regioselective catalysis and for the selective sensing and separation of isomeric guest molecules. Here, stereoisomers of a family of coordination cages are resolved using ultra&#8208;high&#8208;resolution cyclic ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry (cIM&#8208;MS). The observed ratio of diastereomers is dependent on both the metal ion and counter ion. Moreover, the point groups can be assigned through complementary NMR experiments. This method enables the identification and interrogation of the individual isomers in complex mixtures of cages which cannot be performed in solution. Furthermore, these techniques allow the stability of individual isomers within the mixture to be probed, with the T&#8208;symmetric isomers in this case shown to be more robust than the C3 and S4 analogues.

         <title>Understanding Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction on PdNiRuIrRh High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy by Machine Learning Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating machine learning&#8208;based Monte Carlo simulation with ab initio calculation, the complex atomic structure of a high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA&#8208;PdNiRuIrRh) was comprehensively uncovered. The origin of the superior electrocatalytic performance for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction was fundamentally understood.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts have been widely studied in electrocatalysis. However, identifying atomic structure of HEA with complex atomic arrangement is challenging, which seriously hinders the fundamental understanding of catalytic mechanism. Here, we report a HEA&#8208;PdNiRuIrRh catalyst with remarkable mass activity of 3.25&#8197;mA&#8201;&#956;g&#8722;1 for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), which is 8&#8208;fold enhancement compared to that of commercial Pt/C. Through machine learning potential&#8208;based Monte Carlo simulation, we reveal that the dominant Pd&#8722;Pd&#8722;Ni/Pd&#8722;Pd&#8722;Pd bonding environments and Ni/Ru oxophilic sites on HEA surface are beneficial to the optimized adsorption/desorption of *H and enhanced *OH adsorption, contributing to the excellent HOR activity and stability. This work provides significant insights into atomic structure and catalytic mechanism for HEA and offers novel prospects for developing advanced HOR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Nano&#8208;enabled Quenching of Bacterial Communications for the Prevention of Biofilm Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new antimicrobial strategy is reported to catalytically cut off cell&#8722;cell communications in biofilm construction. Through tuning the coordination environment around zinc atoms, an efficient lactonase&#8208;like Zn&#8722;Nx&#8722;C nanomaterial was synthesized to mimic the active domain of lactonase, which significantly prevented biofilm formation in antibiotic&#8208;resistant strains.







Abstract
Biofilm formation is a major threat to industry, the environment and human health. While killing of embedded microbes in biofilms may inevitably lead to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), catalytic quenching of bacterial communications by lactonase is a promising antifouling approach. Given the shortcomings of protein enzymes, it is attractive to engineer synthetic materials to mimic the activity of lactonase. Herein, an efficient lactonase&#8208;like Zn&#8722;Nx&#8722;C nanomaterial was synthesized by tuning the coordination environment around zinc atoms to mimic the active domain of lactonase for catalytical interception of bacterial communications in biofilm formation. The Zn&#8722;Nx&#8722;C material could selectively catalyze 77.5&#8201;% hydrolysis of N&#8208;acylated&#8208;L&#8208;homoserine lactone (AHL), a critical bacterial quorum sensing (QS) signal in biofilm construction. Consequently, AHL degradation downregulated the expression of QS&#8208;related genes in antibiotic resistant bacteria and significantly prevented biofilm formation. As a proof of concept, Zn&#8722;Nx&#8722;C&#8208;coated iron plates prevented 80.3&#8201;% biofouling after a month exposure in river. Overall, our study provides a nano&#8208;enabled contactless antifouling insight to avoid AMR evolution by engineering nanomaterials for mimicking the key bacterial enzymes (e.g., lactonase) functioning in biofilm construction.

         <title>Catalytic Linkage Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with various catalytic linkages (imine, amide, azine, and oxazole bonds) have been demonstrated to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction. The carbon atoms in oxazole linkages facilitated the form of OOH* and promoted protonation of O* to form the OH*, thus showed higher activity than other COFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been employed to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To achieve high activity and selectivity, various building blocks containing heteroatoms and groups linked by imine bonds were used to create catalytic COFs. However, the roles of linkages of COFs in ORR have not been investigated. In this work, the catalytic linkage engineering has been employed to modulate the catalytic behaviors. To create single catalytic sites while avoiding other possible catalytic sites, we synthesized COFs from benzene units linked by various bonds, such as imine, amide, azine, and oxazole bonds. Among these COFs, the oxazole&#8208;linkage in COFs enables to catalyze the ORR with the highest activity, which achieved a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.75&#8197;V and a limited current density of 5.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the oxazole&#8208;linked COF achieved a conversion frequency (TOF) value of 0.0133&#8197;S&#8722;1, which were 1.9, 1.3, and 7.4&#8208;times that of azine&#8208;, amide&#8208; and imine&#8208;COFs, respectively. The theoretical calculation showed that the carbon atoms in oxazole linkages facilitated the formation of OOH* and promoted protonation of O* to form the OH*, thus advancing the catalytic activity. This work guides us on which linkages in COFs are suitable for ORR.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly Mechanism and Chiral Transfer in CuO Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For inorganic material self&#8208;assembly, chiral communication generally aims at transferring and amplifying chirality from the molecules to the superstructure. The demanding fabrication and complex structure seriously hinders understanding the mechanism of chiral transfer and superstructure formation. In this work, we use a simple and mild synthesis method to demonstrate the evolution of the morphology and chirality of hierarchical superstructures.







Abstract
Chiral inorganic superstructures have received considerable interest due to the chiral communication between inorganic compounds and chiral organic additives. However, the demanding fabrication and complex multilevel structure seriously hinder the understanding of chiral transfer and self&#8208;assembly mechanisms. Herein, we use chiral CuO superstructures as a model system to study the formation process of hierarchical chiral structures. Based on a simple and mild synthesis route, the time&#8208;resolved morphology and the in situ chirality evolution could be easily followed. The morphology evolution of the chiral superstructure involves hierarchical assembly, including primary nanoparticles, intermediate bundles, and superstructure at different growth stages. Successive redshifts and enhancements of the CD signal support chiral transfer from the surface penicillamine to the inorganic superstructure. Full&#8208;field electro&#8208;dynamical simulations reproduced the structural chirality and allowed us to predict its modulation. This work opens the door to a large family of chiral inorganic materials where chiral molecule&#8208;guided self&#8208;assembly can be specifically designed to follow a bottom&#8208;up chiral transfer pathway.

         <title>Uncovering Dynamic Edge&#8208;Sites in Atomic Co&#8722;N&#8722;C Electrocatalyst for Selective Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Correlated in situ X&#8208;ray absorption and infrared spectroscopy study provides insight into the dynamic of the edge&#8208;sites in atomic Co&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction. Observation of adapted dynamic oxo adsorption and valence state shuttling between Co(2&#8722;&#948;)+ and Co2+ manifests the structural flexibility of unique edge&#8208;hosted atomic Co sites, in contrast to the rigid in&#8208;plane embedded Co1&#8722;Nx counterpart.







Abstract
Understanding the nature of single&#8208;atom catalytic sites and identifying their spectroscopic fingerprints are essential prerequisites for the rational design of target catalysts. Here, we apply correlated in situ X&#8208;ray absorption and infrared spectroscopy to probe the edge&#8208;site&#8208;specific chemistry of Co&#8722;N&#8722;C electrocatalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) operation. The unique edge&#8208;hosted architecture affords single&#8208;atom Co site remarkable structural flexibility with adapted dynamic oxo adsorption and valence state shuttling between Co(2&#8722;&#948;)+ and Co2+, in contrast to the rigid in&#8208;plane embedded Co1&#8722;Nx counterpart. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the synergistic interplay of in situ reconstructed Co1&#8722;N2&#8208;oxo with peripheral oxygen groups gives a rise to the near&#8208;optimal adsorption of *OOH intermediate and substantially increases the activation barrier for its dissociation, accounting for a robust acidic ORR activity and 2e&#8722; selectivity for H2O2 production.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Integration of a Hydrophobic and Fast&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;Conductive Inorganic Interphase to Stabilize Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ integration of a hydrophobic and fast&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;conductive inorganic interphase layer composed of zinc hexacyanoferrate (ZnHCF) on Zn by a room&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemistry method effectively addresses the irreversible issues facing Zn anodes involving dendrite growth and water erosion, while the hydrophilic and loose ZnHCF particles&#8208;based interphase counterpart cannot efficiently prevent water erosion on Zn during long&#8208;term cycling.







Abstract
The irreversible issues of Zn anode stemming from dendrite growth and water&#8208;induced erosion have severely hindered the commercialization of rechargeable aqueous Zn batteries. Herein, a hydrophobic and fast&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;conductive zinc hexacyanoferrate (HB&#8208;ZnHCF) interphase layer is in situ integrated on Zn by a rapid room&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemistry method to address these dilemmas. Different from currently proposed hydrophilic inorganic cases, the hydrophobic and compact HB&#8208;ZnHCF interphase effectively prevents the access of water molecules to Zn surface, thus avoiding H2 evolution and Zn corrosion. Moreover, the HB&#8208;ZnHCF with large internal ion channels, strong zincophilicity, and high Zn2+ transference number (0.86) permits fast Zn2+ transport and enables smooth Zn deposition. Remarkably, the resultant HB&#8208;ZnHCF@Zn electrode delivers unprecedented reversibility with 99.88&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency over 3000&#8197;cycles, realizes long&#8208;term cycling over 5800&#8197;h (&gt;8&#8197;months, 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and 1000&#8197;h (10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and assures the stable operation of full Zn battery with both coin&#8208; and pouch&#8208;type configurations.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Azahelicenes through Organocatalyzed Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalyzed multicomponent asymmetric synthesis of azahelicenes by using a central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality conversion strategy is reported. The one&#8208;pot sequential Chiral Phosphoric Acid&#8208;catalyzed Povarov reaction/oxidative aromatization gave access to various substituted pyrido[4] and [5]&#8208;helicenes with high enantioselectivity, and these could be easily derivatized while also displaying promising photophysical and chiroptical properties.







Abstract
We have developed an efficient modular asymmetric synthesis of azahelicenes through an organocatalyzed asymmetric multicomponent reaction from readily available polycyclic aromatic amines, aldehydes, and (di)enamides, by employing a central&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality conversion strategy. A series of aza[5]&#8208; and aza[4]helicenes bearing various substituents were readily afforded through this one&#8208;pot sequential enantioselective Povarov reaction/oxidative aromatization process, with good yields and high enantioselectivities. The fruitful and diverse derivatizations of the chiral azahelicene products demonstrated the potential of this method, and a preliminary application of the azahelicene derivative as a chiral organocatalyst was showcased. The photophysical and chiroptical properties of these azahelicenes, particularly the acid/base&#8208;triggered switching of these properties, were also well studied, which may find potential applications in the development of novel organic optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Initiator&#8208;Activation Strategy&#8208;Enabled Organocatalyzed Reversible&#8208;Deactivation Radical Polymerization Driven by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalyzed controlled radical polymerization has been established using a bis(phenothiazine)arene catalyst, enabling efficient initiation from sulfonyl chlorides with pyridine activators via photo&#8208;induced electron transfer. This work furnishes a versatile method to tailor poly(meth)acrylates without transition&#8208;metal concerns. It facilitates grafting polymerization toward brush topologies, &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; temporal control, and chain extensions.







Abstract
Organocatalyzed reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerizations (RDRPs) are attractive for many applications. Here, we developed photoredox&#8208;mediated RDRP by activating (hetero)aryl sulfonyl chloride (ArSO2Cl) initiators with pyridines and designing a novel bis(phenothiazine)arene catalyst. The in situ formed sulfonyl pyridinium intermediates effectively promote controlled chain&#8208;growth from ArSO2Cl, enabling access to various well&#8208;defined polymers with high initiation efficiencies and controlled dispersities under mild conditions. This versatile method allows &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; temporal control, chain&#8208;extension, facile synthesis of different polymer brushes via organocatalyzed grafting reactions from linear chains. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence decay studies and calculations support the reaction mechanism. This work provides a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free RDRP to tailor polymers with readily available aromatic initiators, and will promote the design of polymerization leveraged from photoredox catalysis.

         <title>Green, General and Low&#8208;cost Synthesis of Porous Organic Polymers in Sub&#8208;kilogram Scale for Catalysis and CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic polymers (POPs) with high surface areas were synthesized using inexpensive diamine and dialdehyde monomers under green synthesis conditions. Sub&#8208;kilogram yields of POP were obtained from a scaled&#8208;up synthesis in ethanol at room temperature. The cost of POPs can be reduced to &#8776;10&#8197;USD/kg, making it significantly more cost&#8208;effective compared to other porous materials.







Abstract
Porous organic polymers (POPs) with high porosity and tunable functionalities have been widely studied for use in gas separation, catalysis, energy conversion and energy storage. However, the high cost of organic monomers, and the use of toxic solvents and high temperatures during synthesis pose obstacles for large&#8208;scale production. Herein, we report the synthesis of imine and aminal&#8208;linked POPs using inexpensive diamine and dialdehyde monomers in green solvents. Theoretical calculations and control experiments show that using meta&#8208;diamines is crucial for forming aminal linkages and branching porous networks from [2+2] polycondensation reactions. The method demonstrates good generality in that 6 POPs were successfully synthesized from different monomers. Additionally, we scaled up the synthesis in ethanol at room temperature, resulting in the production of POPs in sub&#8208;kilogram quantities at a relatively low cost. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies demonstrate that the POPs can be used as high&#8208;performance sorbents for CO2 separation and as porous substrates for efficient heterogeneous catalysis. This method provides an environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective approach for large&#8208;scale synthesis of various POPs.

         <title>Maldistribution of Chemical Bond Strength Inducing Exceptional Anisotropy of Thermal Conductivity in Non&#8208;Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose that maldistribution of chemical bond strength can lead to large anisotropy of &#954; in non&#8208;layered materials. Taking PbSnS3, a typical non&#8208;layered orthorhombic compound, as an example, our result reveals that the maldistribution of Pb&#8722;S bonds leads to an anisotropy ratio up to 7.1 at 200&#8197;K and 5.5 at 300&#8197;K, respectively, which is one of the highest ever reported in non&#8208;layered materials and even surpasses many classical layered materials.







Abstract
Currently, the efforts to find materials with high &#954; anisotropy ratios mainly focus on layered materials, however, the limited quantity and lower workability comparing to non&#8208;layered ones boost the exploration of non&#8208;layered materials with high &#954; anisotropy ratios. Here, taking PbSnS3, a typical non&#8208;layered orthorhombic compound, as an example, we propose that maldistribution of chemical bond strength can lead to large anisotropy of &#954; in non&#8208;layered materials. Our result reveals that the maldistribution of Pb&#8722;S bonds lead to obvious collective vibrations of dioctahedron chain units, resulting in an anisotropy ratio up to 7.1 at 200&#8197;K and 5.5 at 300&#8197;K, respectively, which is one of the highest ever reported in non&#8208;layered materials and even surpasses many classical layered materials such as Bi2Te3 and SnSe. Our findings can not only broaden the horizon for exploring high anisotropic &#954; materials but also provide new opportunities for the application of thermal management.

Here, taking PbSnS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a typical non-layered orthorhombic compound, as an example, we propose that maldistribution of chemical bond strength can lead to large anisotropy of &#954; in non-layered materials. Our result reveals that the maldistribution of Pb&#8722;S bonds lead to obvious collective vibrations of dioctahedron chain units, resulting in an anisotropy ratio up to 7.1 at 200&#8197;K and 5.5 at 300&#8197;K, respectively, which is one of the highest ever reported in non-layered materials and even surpasses many classical layered materials such as Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and SnSe. Our findings can not only broaden the horizon for exploring high anisotropic &#954; materials but also provide new opportunities for the application of thermal management.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Methane Carboxylation Using Electrochemically Activated Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct synthesis of CH3COOH from CH4 and CO2 is made possible. The process first activates CO2 by electrochemistry, producing CO and O2. It is followed by oxidative CH4 carbonylation catalyzed by Rh single atom catalysts. The net result is CH4 carboxylation with 100&#8201;% atom economy.







Abstract
Direct synthesis of CH3COOH from CH4 and CO2 is an appealing approach for the utilization of two potent greenhouse gases that are notoriously difficult to activate. In this Communication, we report an integrated route to enable this reaction. Recognizing the thermodynamic stability of CO2, our strategy sought to first activate CO2 to produce CO (through electrochemical CO2 reduction) and O2 (through water oxidation), followed by oxidative CH4 carbonylation catalyzed by Rh single atom catalysts supported on zeolite. The net result was CH4 carboxylation with 100&#8201;% atom economy. CH3COOH was obtained at a high selectivity (&gt;80&#8201;%) and good yield (ca. 3.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1cat in 3&#8197;h). Isotope labelling experiments confirmed that CH3COOH is produced through the coupling of CH4 and CO2. This work represents the first successful integration of CO/O2 production with oxidative carbonylation reaction. The result is expected to inspire more carboxylation reactions utilizing preactivated CO2 that take advantage of both products from the reduction and oxidation processes, thus achieving high atom efficiency in the synthesis.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Bipolar Polyimide Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Cathodes for Durable Aluminium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging rechargeable aluminium batteries (RABs) offer a sustainable option for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies with low cost and exemplary safety. However, the development of RABs is restricted by the limited availability of high&#8208;performance cathode materials. Herein, we report two polyimide two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) cathodes with redox&#8208;bipolar capability in RAB. The optimal 2D&#8208;COF electrode achieves a high specific capacity of 132 mAh g&#8722;1. Notably, the electrode presents long&#8208;term cycling stability (with negligible ~0.0007% capacity decay per cycle), outperforming early reported organic RAB cathodes. 2D&#8208;COFs integrate n&#8208;type imide and p&#8208;type triazine active centres into the periodic porous polymer skeleton. With multiple characterizations, we elucidate the unique Faradic reaction of the 2D&#8208;COF electrode, which involves AlCl2+ and AlCl4&#8722; dual&#8208;ions as charge carriers. This work paves the avenue toward novel organic cathodes in RABs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Influence of Regiochemistry on the Performance of Organic Mixed Ionic and Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiophenes functionalised in the 3&#8208;position are ubiquitous building blocks for the design and synthesis of organic semiconductors. Their non&#8208;centrosymmetric nature has long been used as a powerful synthetic design tool exemplified by the vastly different properties of regiorandom and regioregular poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) owing to the repulsive head&#8208;to&#8208;head interactions between neighbouring side chains in the regiorandom polymer. The renewed interest in highly electron&#8208;rich 3&#8208;alkoxythiophene based polymers for bioelectronic applications opens up new considerations around the regiochemistry of these systems as both the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail and head&#8208;to&#8208;head couplings adopt near&#8208;planar conformations due to attractive intramolecular S&#8208;O interactions. To understand how this increased flexibility in the molecular design can be used advantageously, we explore in detail the geometrical and electronic effects that influence the optical, electrochemical, structural, and electrical properties of a series of six polythiophene derivatives with varying regiochemistry and comonomer composition. We show how the interplay between conformational disorder, backbone coplanarity and polaron distribution affects the mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conduction.&#160;Ultimately, we use these findings to identify a new conformationally restricted&#160;polythiophene derivative for p&#8208;type accumulation&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistor applications with performance on par with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mixed conductors evidenced by a &#956;C* product of 267 F V&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1 s&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stereoselective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions Catalyzed by Diboronate Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly enantioselective catalytic system for exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions was developed based on the newly discovered bispyrrolidine diboronates (BPDBs). When activated various Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acids, BPDBs could catalyze highly stereoselective asymmetric exo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of monocarbonyl&#8208;based dienophiles. When 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl&#8208;based dienophiles are used, the catalyst can sterically distinguish between the two binding sites, which leads to highly regioselective asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. BPDBs can be prepared as crystalline solids on a large scale and are stable under ambient conditions. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of the structure for acid&#8208;activated BPDB indicated that activation involves breakage of a labile N&#8594;B bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Ex situ Generation of Thiazyl Trifluoride (NSF3) as a Gaseous SuFEx Hub</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange (SuFEx) chemistry, an all&#8208;encompassing term for substitution events that replace fluoride at an electrophilic sulfur(VI), enables the rapid and flexible assembly of linkages around a SVI core. Although a myriad of nucleophiles and applications work very well with the SuFEx concept, the electrophile design has remained largely SO2&#8208;based. Here, we introduce S&#8801;N&#8208;based fluorosulfur(VI) reagents to the realm of SuFEx chemistry. Thiazyl trifluoride (NSF3) gas is shown to serve as an excellent parent compound and SuFEx hub to efficiently synthesize mono&#8208; and disubstituted fluorothiazynes in an ex situ generation workflow. Gaseous NSF3 was evolved from commercial&#160; reagents in a nearly quantitative fashion at ambient conditions. Moreover, the monosubstituted thiazynes could be extended further as SuFEx handles and be engaged in the synthesis of unsymmetrically disubstituted thiazynes. These results provide valuable insights into the versatility of these understudied sulfur functionalities, paving the way for future applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Improper Ferroelectricity in Columnar (NaY)MnMnTi4O12</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show that cation ordering on A site columns, oppositely displaced via coupling to B site octahedral tilts, results in a polar phase of the columnar perovskite (NaY)MnMnTi4O12. This scheme is similar to hybrid improper ferroelectricity found in layered perovskites, and can be considered a realisation of hybrid improper ferroelectricity in columnar perovskites. The cation ordering is controlled by annealing temperature and when present it also polarises the local dipoles associated with pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller active Mn2+ ions to establish an additional ferroelectric order out of an otherwise disordered dipolar glass. Below TN~12 K, Mn2+ spins order, making the columnar perovskites rare systems in which ordered electric and magnetic dipoles may reside on the same transition metal sublattice.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Sculponin U through A Photoinduced Radical Cascade Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have accomplished the total synthesis of sculponin U, a polycyclic C&#8208;20&#8208;oxygenated kaurane diterpenoid featuring a bridge of 7,20&#8208;lactone&#8208;hemiketal functionality, through a radical cascade cyclization triggered by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) of silyl enolate to form the cyclohexanone&#8208;fused bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton. Other keypoints in our synthetic strategy encompass a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to construct the middle six&#8208;membered ring of sculponin U, and an intramolecular radical cyclization induced by iron&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer to close the western cyclohexane ring. Successful preparation of the enantiopure silyl enolate as the PET precursor enables the asymmetric total synthesis of sculponin U, opening a new avenue for divergent syntheses of structurally related C&#8208;20&#8208;oxygenated kaurane congeners and pharmaceutical derivatives thereof.</dc:description>

         <title>Translating planar heterocycles into three&#8208;dimensional analogs via photoinduced hydrocarboxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid preparation of complex three&#8208;dimensional (3D) heterocyclic scaffolds is a key challenge in modern medicinal chemistry. Despite the increased probability of clinical success for small molecule therapeutic candidates with increased 3D complexity, new drug targets remain dominated by flat molecules due to the abundance of coupling reactions available for their construction. In principle, heteroarene hydrofunctionalization reactions offer an opportunity to transform readily accessible planar molecules into more three&#8208;dimensionally complex analogs through the introduction of a single molecular vector. Unfortunately, dearomative hydrofunctionalization reactions remain limited. Herein, we report a new strategy to enable the dearomative hydrocarboxylation of indoles and related heterocycles. This reaction represents a rare example of a heteroarene hydrofunctionalization that meets the numerous requirements for broad implementation in drug discovery. The transformation is highly chemoselective, broad in scope, operationally simple, and readily amenable to high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE). Accordingly, this process will allow existing libraries of heteroaromatic compounds to be translated into diverse 3D analogs and enable exploration of new classes of medicinally relevant molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Nanocomposites Camouflaged with Hybrid Cell Membranes for Accurate Therapy of Early&#8208;Stage Glioma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glioma features high fatality rate and short survival time of patients due to its fast growth speed and high invasiveness, hence timely treatment of early&#8208;stage glioma is extremely important. However, the blood brain barrier (BBB) severely prevents therapeutic agents from entering the brain; meanwhile, the non&#8208;targeted distribution of agents always causes side effects to vulnerable cerebral tissues. Therefore, delivery systems that possess both BBB penetrability and precise glioma targeting ability are keenly desired. We herein proposed a hybrid cell membrane (HM) camouflage strategy to construct therapeutic nanocomposites, in which HM consisting of brain metastatic breast cancer cell membrane and glioma cell membrane was prepared with a simple membrane fusion pathway. By coating HM onto drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles, the as&#8208;obtained biomimetic therapeutic agent (termed HMGINPs) inherited satisfying BBB penetrability and homologous glioma targeting ability simultaneously from the two source cells. HMGINPs exhibited good biocompatibility and superior therapeutic efficacy towards early&#8208;stage glioma.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Helicenes Defected by Heteroatoms and Heptagons with Narrow Emissions and Superior Photoluminescence Quantum Yields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of heteroatoms and/or heptagons as the defects into helicenes expands the variety of chiroptical materials with novel properties. However, it is still challenging to construct novel boron&#8208;doped heptagon&#8208;containing helicenes with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values. We report an efficient and scalable synthesis of a quadruple helicene 4Cz&#8208;NBN with two nitrogen&#8208;boron&#8208;nitrogen (NBN) units and a double helicene 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 bearing two NBN&#8208;doped heptagons, the latter could be formed via a two&#8208;fold Scholl reaction of the former. The helicenes 4Cz&#8208;NBN and 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 exhibit excellent PLQYs up to 99% and 65% with narrow FWHM of 24 nm and 22 nm, respectively. The emission wavelengths are tunable via stepwise titration experiments of 4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1 toward fluoride, enabling distinguished circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from green, orange (4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1&#8208;F1) to yellow (trans/cis&#8208;4Cz&#8208;NBN&#8208;P1&#8208;F2) with near&#8208;unity PLQYs and broader circular dichroism (CD) ranges. The five structures of the aforementioned four helicenes were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This work provides a novel design strategy for construction of non&#8208;benzenoid multiple helicenes exhibiting narrow emissions with superior PLQYs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stabilizing liquids based on supramolecular assembly (non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions) has attracted significant interest, due to the increasing demand for soft, liquid&#8208;based devices where the shape of the liquid is far removed from the equilibrium spherical shape. The components comprising these interfacial assemblies must have sufficient binding energies to the interface to prevent their ejection from the interface when the assemblies are compressed. Here, we highlight recent advances in structuring liquids based on non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions. We describe some of the progress made that reveals structure&#8208;property relationships. In addition to treating advances, we discuss some of the limitations and provide a perspective on future directions to inspire further studies on structured liquids based on supramolecular assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemically&#8208;Driven CO2 Release Using a Metastable&#8208;State Photoacid for Energy Efficient Direct Air Capture</title>

         <dc:description>One of the grand challenges underlying current direct air capture (DAC) technologies relates to the intensive energy cost for sorbent regeneration and CO2 release, making the massive scale (GtCO2/year) deployment required to have a positive impact on climate change economically unfeasible. This challenge underscores the critical need to develop new DAC processes with substantially reduced regeneration energies. Here, we report a photochemically&#8208;driven approach for CO2 release by exploiting the unique properties of an indazole metastable&#8208;state photoacid (mPAH). Our measurements on simulated and amino acid&#8208;based DAC systems revealed the potential of mPAH to be used for CO2 release cycles by regulating pH changes and associated isomers driven by light. Upon irradiating with moderate intensity light, a ~55% and ~68% to ~78% conversion of total inorganic carbon to CO2 was found for the simulated and amino acid&#8208;based DAC systems, respectively. Our results confirm the feasibility of on&#8208;demand CO2 release under ambient conditions using light instead of heat, thereby providing an energy efficient pathway for the regeneration of DAC sorbents.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Genetic Encoding of Unnatural Amino Acid in Protein Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional protein engineering methods for modifying protein nanopore are typically limited to 20 natural amino acids, which restricts the diversity of nanopore in structure and function. To enrich the chemical environment inside the nanopore, we employed the genetic code expansion (GCE) technique to site&#8208;specifically incorporate unnatural amino acid (UAA) into the sensing region of aerolysin nanopore. This approach leveraged the efficient pyrrolysine&#8208;based aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase&#8208;tRNA pair for a high yield of pore&#8208;forming protein. Both molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and single&#8208;molecule sensing experiments demonstrated that the conformation of UAA residues provided a favorable geometric orientation for the interactions of target molecules and the pore. This reasonably designed chemical environment enabled the direct discrimination of multiple peptides containing hydrophobic amino acids. Our work provides a new framework to endow unique sensing properties to nanopore that are difficult to achieve using classical protein engineering approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation of Polyesters to Diols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of carbon resources stored in plastic polymers through chemical recycling and upcycling is a promising approach for mitigating plastic waste. However, most current methods for upcycling suffer from limited selectivity towards a specific valuable product, particularly when attempting full conversion of the plastic. We present a highly selective reaction route for transforming polylactic acid (PLA) into 1,2&#8208;propanediol utilizing a Zn&#8208;modified Cu catalyst. This reaction exhibits excellent reactivity (0.65 g/(gcat&#183;h)) and selectivity (99.5%) towards 1,2&#8208;propanediol, and most importantly, can be performed in a solvent&#8208;free mode. Significantly, the overall solvent&#8208;free reaction is an atom&#8208;economical reaction with all the atoms in reactants (PLA and H2) fixed into the final product (1,2&#8208;propanediol), eliminating the need for a separation process. This method provides an innovative and economically viable solution for upgrading polyesters to produce high&#8208;purity products under mild conditions with optimal atom utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>The Elusive Structure of Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride Determined by Electron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Levocetirizine dihydrochloride is a widely known antihistaminic active pharmaceutical ingredient that is effectively used for the relief of allergic symptoms in patients of various age groups. Despite its usage in such medications for more than two decades, its crystal structure has yet to be determined unambiguously. Electron diffraction is used here to determine its crystal structure.







Abstract
Levocetirizine is an orally administrated, second&#8208;generation antihistaminic active pharmaceutical ingredient that has been used to treat symptoms of allergy and long&#8208;term hives for over 25&#8197;years. Despite the wide use of this compound, its crystal structure has remained unknown. Here we report the application of 3D electron diffraction (3D ED)/Micro&#8208;crystal electron diffraction (MicroED) to determine the crystal structure of Levocetirizine dihydrochloride directly from crystalline powders that were extracted from commercially available tablets containing the compound. We also showcase the utility of dynamical refinement to unambiguously assign absolute configuration. The results highlight the immense potential of 3D ED/MicroED for structure elucidation of components of microcrystalline mixtures that obviates the need to grow large&#8208;size single crystals and the use of complementary analytical techniques, which could be important for identification as well as for primary structural characterization.

         <title>Trialkoxysilane Exchange: Scope, Mechanism, Cryptates and pH&#8208;Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exchange reaction of trialkoxysilanes with alcohols typically requires very harsh conditions and has therefore not been used for the self&#8208;assembly of host&#8208;guest systems. In this work, unexpected solvent and salt effects are described, rationalized and exploited for the synthesis of degradable supramolecular hosts.







Abstract
The dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) of the Si&#8722;O bond holds unique opportunities, but has rarely been employed to assemble discrete molecular architectures. This may be due to the harsh conditions required to initiate exchange reactions at silicon in aprotic solvents. Herein, we provide a comprehensive experimental and computational account on the reaction of trialkoxysilanes with alcohols and identify mild conditions for rapid exchange in aprotic solvents. Substituent, solvent and salt effects are uncovered, understood and exploited for the construction of sila&#8208;orthoester cryptates. A sharp, divergent pH&#8208;response of the obtained cages renders this substance class attractive for future applications well beyond host&#8208;guest chemistry, for instance, in drug delivery.

         <title>Quantitative NanoSIMS Imaging of Individual Vesicles to Investigate the Relation between Fraction of Chemical Release and Vesicle Size</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We used correlative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) imaging to quantify the contents of subvesicular compartments, and to measure the partial release fraction of 13C&#8208;dopamine in cellular nanovesicles as a function of size. Three modes of exocytosis comprise full release, kiss&#8208;and&#8208;run, and partial release. The latter has been subject to scientific debate, despite a growing amount of supporting literature. We tailored culturing procedures to alter vesicle size and definitively show no size correlation with the fraction of partial release. In NanoSIMS images, vesicle content was indicated by the presence of isotopic dopamine, while vesicles which underwent partial release were identified by the presence of an 127I&#8208;labelled drug, to which they were exposed during exocytosis allowing entry into the open vesicle prior to its closing again. Demonstration of similar partial release fractions indicates that this mode of exocytosis is predominant across a wide range of vesicle sizes.</dc:description>

         <title>CuNi Nanoalloys with Tunable Composition and Oxygen Defects for the Enhancement of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of Cu to bimetallic CuNi nanoalloys of tunable composition and size promotes the catalytic activity in the electrochemical Oxygen Evolution reaction and the formation of Ni3+ under reaction conditions. The experimental evidence together with theoretical calculations showed that the relative amount between oxygen vacancies and lattice oxygen (OV/OL) is an excellent descriptor of the catalytic performance in alkaline conditions.







Abstract
Colloidal synthesis is an excellent tool for the study of cooperative effects in nanoalloys. In this work, bimetallic CuNi nanoparticles of defined size and composition are fully characterized and tested for the oxygen evolution reaction. Copper addition to nickel leads to modifications in the structural and electronic properties, showing a higher concentration of surface oxygen defects and formation of active Ni3+ sites under reaction conditions. The ratio OV/OL between oxygen vacancies and lattice oxygen shows a clear correlation with the overpotential, being an excellent descriptor of the electrocatalytic activity. This is attributed to modifications in the crystalline structure, leading to lattice strain and grain size effects. Bimetallic Cu50Ni50NP showed the lowest overpotential (318&#8197;mV vs RHE), low Tafel slope (63.9&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), and excellent stability. This work unravels the relative concentration between oxygen defects and lattice oxygen (OV/OL) as an excellent descriptor of the catalytic activity of bimetallic precatalysts.

         <title>Stochastic Simulation of Controlled Radical Polymerization Forming Dendritic Hyperbranched Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stochastic simulation of the formation process of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) based on the reversible deactivation radical polymerization (RDRP) using a branch&#8208;inducing monomer, evolmer, has been carried out. The simulation program successfully reproduced the change of dispersities (&#272;s) during the polymerization process. Furthermore, the simulation suggested that the observed &#272;s (= 1.5~2) are due to the distribution of the number of branches instead of undesired side reactions, and that the branch structures are well controlled. In addition, the analysis of the polymer structure reveals that the majority of HBPs have structures close to the ideal one. The simulation also suggested the slight dependence of branch density on molecular weight, which was experimentally confirmed by synthesizing HBPs with an evolmer having phenyl group.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming Diffusion Limitation of Faradaic Processes: Property&#8208;Performance Relationships of 2D Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Cu3(HHTP)2 for Reversible Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional MOF, (Cu3(HHTP)2), is synthesized with two different morphologies. Flake&#8208; and rod&#8208;like shaped particles were evaluated to investigate the impact of the particle morphology of MOFs on electrochemical Li+ ion storage. By optimization of the particle morphology, diffusion limitation of the Faradaic process can be strongly reduced.







Abstract
Faradaic reactions including charge transfer are often accompanied with diffusion limitation inside the bulk. Conductive two&#8208;dimensional frameworks (2D MOFs) with a fast ion transport can combine both&#8212;charge transfer and fast diffusion inside their porous structure. To study remaining diffusion limitations caused by particle morphology, different synthesis routes of Cu&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu3(HHTP)2), a copper&#8208;based 2D MOF, are used to obtain flake&#8208; and rod&#8208;like MOF particles. Both morphologies are systematically characterized and evaluated for redox&#8208;active Li+ ion storage. The redox mechanism is investigated by means of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and in situ XRD. Both types are compared regarding kinetic properties for Li+ ion storage via cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. A significant influence of particle morphology for 2D MOFs on kinetic aspects of electrochemical Li+ ion storage can be observed. This study opens the path for optimization of redox active porous structures to overcome diffusion limitations of Faradaic processes.

         <title>Targeted Synthesis of an Highly Stable Aluminium Phosphonate Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Showing Reversible HCl Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protons make the difference. Highly acidic synthesis conditions were employed to synthesize porous MIII&#8208;phosphonates with different degrees of framework protonation. Rapid release of HCl in solution and re&#8208;adsorption from aqueous solution and from the gas phase is demonstrated and structural changes that accompany these processes are elucidated.







Abstract
A concept for obtaining isoreticular compounds with tri&#8208; instead of tetravalent metal cations using highly acidic reaction conditions was developed and successfully applied in a high throughput study using N,N&#8242;&#8208;piperazinebis(methylenephosphonic&#160;acid) (H4PMP), that resulted in the discovery of a new porous aluminium phosphonate denoted CAU&#8208;60&#8901;6&#8201;HCl. The high&#8208;throughput study was subsequently extended to other trivalent metal ions. Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;60&#8901;6&#8201;HCl demonstrates reversible desorption of HCl (18.3&#8197;wt&#8201;% loading) with three distinct compositions observed with zero, four or six HCl molecules per formula unit. Structural changes were followed in detail by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, EDX analysis as well as IR spectroscopy. Rapid desorption of HCl in water within minutes and subsequent adsorption from the gas phase and from aqueous solution are shown. Furthermore, it is possible to adsorb HBr into the guest free Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;60 framework, demonstrating the high stability of this compound.

         <title>Localized Ligands Assist Ultrafast Multivalent&#8208;Cation Intercalation Pseudocapacitance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By switching from conventional intercalation to localized ligand&#8208;assisted&#8208;intercalation pseudocapacitance, the organic cathode exhibits unprecedented fast kinetics with little structural change upon ion intercalation.







Abstract
Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent cation (Mvn+, n&gt;1) carriers are considered potentially low&#8208;cost alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the high charge&#8208;density Mvn+ carriers generally lead to sluggish kinetics and poor structural stability in cathode materials. Herein, we report an Mvn+ storage via intercalation pseudocapacitance mechanism in a 2D bivalve&#8208;like organic framework featured with localized ligands. By switching from conventional intercalation to localized ligand&#8208;assisted&#8208;intercalation pseudocapacitance, the organic cathode exhibits unprecedented fast kinetics with little structural change upon intercalation. It thus enables an excellent power density of 57&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 over 20000 cycles for Ca2+ storage and a power density of 14&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a long cycling life over 45000 cycles for Zn2+ storage. This work may provide a largely unexploited route toward constructing a local dynamic coordination microstructure for ultrafast Mvn+ storage.

It thus enables an excellent power density of 57&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; over 20000 cycles for Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; storage and a power density of 14&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a long cycling life over 45000 cycles for Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; storage. This work may provide a largely unexploited route toward constructing a local dynamic coordination microstructure for ultrafast Mv&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Peptide Nanostructures Regulate Catalytic Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;based supramolecular nanostructures can mimic the activity and 3&#8208;dimensional complexity of enzymes. We report three tetrapeptides with the same amino acids but in different orders that self&#8208;assemble into unique nanostructures, and we find that their supramolecular morphology influences enzymatic efficiency. Coarse&#8208;grained simulations reveal how histidine residues clustered in hydrophobic pockets influence their catalytic activity.







Abstract
We report three constitutionally isomeric tetrapeptides, each comprising one glutamic acid (E) residue, one histidine (H) residue, and two lysine (KS) residues functionalized with side&#8208;chain hydrophobic S&#8208;aroylthiooxime (SATO) groups. Depending on the order of amino acids, these amphiphilic peptides self&#8208;assembled in aqueous solution into different nanostructures:nanoribbons, a mixture of nanotoroids and nanoribbons, or nanocoils. Each nanostructure catalyzed hydrolysis of a model substrate, with the nanocoils exhibiting the greatest rate enhancement and the highest enzymatic efficiency. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulations, analyzed with unsupervised machine learning, revealed clusters of H residues in hydrophobic pockets along the outer edge of the nanocoils, providing insight for the observed catalytic rate enhancement. Finally, all three supramolecular nanostructures catalyzed hydrolysis of the l&#8208;substrate only when a pair of enantiomeric Boc&#8208;l/d&#8208;Phe&#8208;ONp substrates were tested. This study highlights how subtle molecular&#8208;level changes can influence supramolecular nanostructures, and ultimately affect catalytic efficiency.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The doping of group&#8197;8 and 9 metals having unpaired d electrons into a thiolate&#8208;protected Ag25 nanocluster was demonstrated. Open d&#8208;shell group&#8197;8 (Ru, Os) and 9 (Rh, Ir) could be incorporated into the Ag24(SR)18 superatomic framework by forming metal&#8208;hydride superatoms with a closed d&#8208;shell. The synthesized superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanoclusters exhibited dopant&#8208;dependent photoluminescence intensities and lifetimes.







Abstract
We report a new strategy in which a thiolate&#8208;protected Ag25 nanocluster can be doped with open d&#8208;shell group&#8197;8 (Ru, Os) and 9 (Ir) metals by forming metal hydride (RuH2, OsH2, IrH) superatoms with a closed d&#8208;shell. Structural analyses using various experimental and theoretical methods revealed that the Ag25 nanoclusters were co&#8208;doped with the open d&#8208;shell metal and hydride species to produce superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanoclusters, establishing a novel superatom doping phenomenon for open d&#8208;shell metals. The synthesized superatom&#8208;in&#8208;superatom nanoclusters exhibited dopant&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) properties. Comparative PL lifetime studies of the Ag25 nanoclusters doped with 8&#8211;10&#8197;group metals revealed that both radiative and nonradiative processes were significantly dependent on the dopant. The former is strongly correlated with the electron affinity of the metal dopant, whereas the latter is governed predominantly by the kernel structure changed upon the doping of the metal hydride(s).

         <dc:description>
A method for the C(sp2)&#8722;I selective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) of bromo(iodo)arenes with 3&#176;, 2&#176;, and 1&#176;alkyl bromides is reported. This mild XEC displays a broad scope with demonstrated functional group tolerance and finds use in the streamlined preparation of synthetically challenging bioactive compounds. Given the prevalence of its building blocks and the substrate generality, this discovery will likely inspire numerous applications.







Abstract
Despite several methodologies established for C(sp2)&#8722;I selective C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formations, achieving arene&#8208;flanked quaternary carbons by cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary alkyl precursors with bromo(iodo)arenes in a C(sp2)&#8722;I selective manner is rare. Here we report a general Ni&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;I selective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) reaction, in which, beyond 3&#176; alkyl bromides (for constructing arene&#8208;flanked quaternary carbons), 2&#176; and 1&#176; alkyl bromides are also demonstrated to be viable coupling partners. Moreover, this mild XEC displays excellent C(sp2)&#8722;I selectivity and functional group compatibility. The practicality of this XEC is demonstrated in simplifying the routes to several medicinally relevant and synthetically challenging compounds. Extensive experiments show that the terpyridine&#8208;ligated NiI halide can exclusively activate alkyl bromides, forming a NiI&#8722;alkyl complex through a Zn reduction. Attendant density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal two different pathways for the oxidative addition of the NiI&#8722;alkyl complex to the C(sp2)&#8722;I bond of bromo(iodo)arenes, explaining both the high C(sp2)&#8722;I selectivity and generality of our XEC.

         <title>A Dicyanomethyl Radical Conjugated with a Pyridylamino Group: Combining Radical&#8208;based Dynamic Covalent Chemistry and Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared a dicyanomethyl radical with a pyridyl group that combines dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) property based on a reversible radical coupling/cleavage reaction and coordination ability to metal ions for the first time. This work demonstrated that DCC based on dicyanomethyl radicals works orthogonally to metal&#8208;ligand coordination reactions.







Abstract
In this work, we aimed to develop a dicyanomethyl radical that undergoes both reversible C&#8722;C bond formation/dissociation and metal&#8208;ligand coordination reactions to combine dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) based on organic radicals with coordination chemistry. We have previously reported a dicyanomethyl radical conjugated with a triphenylamine (1&#8901;) that exhibits a monomer/dimer equilibrium between the &#963;&#8208;bonded dimer (12). We designed and synthesized a novel dicyanomethyl radical with a pyridyl group as a coordination point (2&#8901;) by replacing the phenyl group of 1&#8901; with a 3&#8208;pyridyl group. We showed that 2&#8901; is also in an equilibrium with the &#963;&#8208;bonded dimer (22) in solution and has suitable thermodynamic parameters for application in DCC. 22 coordinates to PdCl2 in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio to selectively form a metallamacrocycle (22)2(PdCl2)2, and its structure was clarified by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR, ESR, and electronic absorption measurements revealed that (22)2(PdCl2)2 also undergoes the reversible C&#8722;C bond formation/dissociation reaction. Ligand&#8208;exchange experiment showed that 22 was liberated from (22)2(PdCl2)2 by the addition of another ligand with a higher affinity for PdII. This work demonstrated that DCC based on dicyanomethyl radicals works orthogonally to metal&#8208;ligand coordination reactions.

         <title>Constructing Built&#8208;in Electric Field in Heterogeneous Nanowire Arrays for Efficient Overall Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By proposing and fabricating Ni2P&#8208;CoCH heterostructure with large &#916;&#934; as a model catalyst for overall alkaline water electrolysis, the introduction of a strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) is successfully realized to create the asymmetrical charge distributions on catalyst surfaces. The negative charge&#8208;enriched Ni2P and positive charge&#8208;enriched CoCH as active sites separately achieve high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities.







Abstract
Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions are key to water electrolysis. Herein, we report a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) strategy to fabricate heterogeneous nickel phosphide&#8208;cobalt nanowire arrays grown on carbon fiber paper (Ni2P&#8208;CoCH/CFP) with large work function difference (&#916;&#934;) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Impressively, Ni2P&#8208;CoCH/CFP exhibits a remarkable catalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions to obtain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, the assembled lab&#8208;scale electrolyzer driven by an AAA battery delivers excellent stability after 50&#8197;h electrocatalysis with a 100&#8201;% faradic efficiency. Computational calculations combining with experiments reveal the interface&#8208;induced electric field effect facilitates asymmetrical charge distributions, thereby regulating the adsorption/desorption of the intermediates during reactions. This work offers an avenue to rationally design high&#8208;performance heterogeneous electrocatalysts.

         <title>Fucose Binding Motifs on Mucin Core Glycopeptides Impact Bacterial Lectin Recognition
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enable studies of fucose&#8208;binding bacterial lectins, a library of fucosylated mucin glycopeptides carrying Lewis&#8208; and H&#8208;antigen structures on mucin core glycans was prepared using a chemoenzymatic approach. This library was applied to evaluate the Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin LecB and the Clostridium difficile toxin A binding preferences to explore the importance of the glycan core and peptide backbone presentation for lectin recognition.







Abstract
Mucin glycoproteins are essential components of the mucosal barrier, which protects the host from pathogens. Throughout evolution, bacteria have developed strategies to modulate and penetrate this barrier, and cause virulence by interacting with mucin O&#8208;glycans at the epithelial cell&#8208;surface. O&#8208;fucosylated glycan epitopes on mucins are key ligands of many bacterial lectins. Here, a chemoenzymatic synthesis strategy is described to prepare a library of fucosylated mucin core glycopeptides to enable studies of mucin&#8208;interacting and fucose&#8208;binding bacterial lectins. Glycan cores with biologically important Lewis and H&#8208;antigens were prepared decorating the peptide backbone at different sites and densities. The fucosylated mucin glycopeptides were applied in microarray binding studies to explore the importance of glycan core and peptide backbone presentation of these antigens in binding interactions with the P.&#8197;aeruginosa lectin LecB and the C.&#8197;difficile toxin&#8197;A.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Alcohols and Ketones via Cross&#8208;Coupling of Secondary Alcohols under Manganese Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of two secondary alcohols in a divergent synthesis of either &#947;&#8208;disubstituted alcohols or &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones is herein reported. A wide range of different alcohols could undergo the cross&#8208;coupling process smoothly and furnish the corresponding products by using the same catalyst, with overall moderate to good yields.







Abstract
A homogeneous manganese&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of two secondary alcohols for the divergent synthesis of &#947;&#8208;disubstituted alcohols and &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones is reported. Employing the well&#8208;defined Mn&#8208;MACHOPh as the catalyst, this novel protocol has a broad substrate scope with good functional group tolerance and affords a diverse library of valuable disubstituted alcohols and ketones in moderate to good yields. The strong influence of the reaction temperature on the selective formation of alcohol products was theorized in preliminary DFT studies. Studies have shown that the Gibbs free energy of the formation of alcohols is thermodynamically more favourable than corresponding ketones at a lower temperature.

         <title>Carbon Nitride Pillared Vanadate Via Chemical Pre&#8208;Intercalation Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;deficient NH4V4O10 (NVO) nanobelts with large interlayer spacing are fabricated as the cathode for stable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The pre&#8208;intercalated C3N4 acts as the &#8220;pillars&#8221; to enlarge the interplanar spacing for better structural stability and faster ion transfer. The abundant oxygen vacancies improve the conductivity of NVO. The obtained NVO cathode enables exceptional rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling in full cells.







Abstract
Vanadium based compounds are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their high specific capacity. However, the narrow interlayer spacing, low intrinsic conductivity and the vanadium dissolution still restrict their further application. Herein, we present an oxygen&#8208;deficient vanadate pillared by carbon nitride (C3N4) as the cathode for AZIBs through a facile self&#8208;engaged hydrothermal strategy. Of note, C3N4 nanosheets can act as both the nitrogen source and pre&#8208;intercalation species to transform the orthorhombic V2O5 into layered NH4V4O10 with expanded interlayer spacing. Owing to the pillared structure and abundant oxygen vacancies, both the Zn2+ ion (de)intercalation kinetics and the ionic conductivity in the NH4V4O10 cathode are promoted. As a result, the NH4V4O10 cathode delivers exceptional Zn&#8208;ion storage ability with a high specific capacity of about 370&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, a high&#8208;rate capability of 194.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a stable cycling performance of 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Dual Microenvironment Modulation of Pd Nanoparticles in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PdCu2 nanoparticles are incorporated into isoreticular COFs, namely, MF&#8722;X (X=&#8722;CH3, &#8722;H, &#8722;CF3 and &#8722;CN), for the semihydrogenation of alkynes, where PdCu2@MF&#8722;CH3 exhibits the best catalytic performance. The dual modulation of the Pd microenvironment turns out to be crucial: the Cu species (primary microenvironment) improves the selectivity, while the engineered pore walls around PdCu2 sites (secondary microenvironment) optimize the activity.







Abstract
The chemical microenvironment modulation of metal nanoparticles (NPs) holds promise for tackling the long&#8208;lasting challenge of the trade&#8208;off effect between activity and selectivity in catalysis. Herein, ultrafine PdCu2 NPs incorporated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse groups on their pore walls have been fabricated for the semihydrogenation of alkynes. The Cu species, as the primary microenvironment of Pd active sites, greatly improves the selectivity. The functional groups as the secondary microenvironment around PdCu2 NPs effectively regulate the activity, in which PdCu2 NPs encapsulated in the COF bearing &#8722;CH3 groups exhibit the highest activity with &gt;99&#8201;% conversion and 97&#8201;% selectivity. Both experimental and calculation results suggest that the functional group affects the electron&#8208;donating ability of the COFs, which successively impacts the charge transfer between COFs and Pd sites, giving rise to a modulated Pd electronic state and excellent catalytic performance.

         <title>Insertion of Chemical Handles into the Backbone of DNA during Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis by Oxidative Coupling of Amines to Phosphites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible and inexpensive method for linking chemical handles to the backbone of oligonucleotides during solid&#8208;phase synthesis was developed. Primary or secondary amines are linked to positions where a tert&#8208;butyl phosphoramidite is inserted by an oxidative coupling using iodine to obtain the desired phosphoramidate. With this method different functional groups such as azides, alkynes, amines were inserted as chemical handles.







Abstract
Conjugation of molecules or proteins to oligonucleotides can improve their functional and therapeutic capacity. However, such modifications are often limited to the 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; end of oligonucleotides. Herein, we report the development of an inexpensive and simple method that allows for the insertion of chemical handles into the backbone of oligonucleotides. This method is compatible with standardized automated solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis, and relies on formation of phosphoramidates. A unique phosphoramidite is incorporated into a growing oligonucleotide, and oxidized to the desired phosphoramidate using iodine and an amine of choice. Azides, alkynes, amines, and alkanes have been linked to oligonucleotides via internally positioned phosphoramidates with oxidative coupling yields above 80&#8201;%. We show the design of phosphoramidates from secondary amines that specifically hydrolyze to the phosphate only at decreased pH. Finally, we show the synthesis of an antibody&#8208;DNA conjugate, where the oligonucleotide can be selectively released in a pH&#8197;5.5 buffer.

         <title>Photodissociative Modules that Control Dual&#8208;Emission Properties in Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Organoborane Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual emissive triarylborane&#8208;based donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor fluorophores sensitive to environmental parameters, including temperature, solvent polarity, and viscosity of the medium, are reported by Shigehiro Yamaguchi and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202303725). The intramolecularly coordinated B&#8211;X=P bond undergoes dissociation in the excited state, giving rise to bright emissions from the two different states. Precise tuning of the substituents led to single&#8208;molecule white emission in solution.

         <title>Kinetic Control via Binding Sites within the Confined Space of Metal Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Frameworks for Enhanced Shape&#8208;Selectivity Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;selective catalysis is enabled by a steric, kinetic&#8208;control strategy based on the substrate being anchored on the internal wall of an adjustable pore space in porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs).







Abstract
One striking feature of enzyme is its controllable ability to trap substrates via synergistic or cooperative binding in the enzymatic pocket, which renders the shape&#8208;selectivity of product by the confined spatial environment. The success of shape&#8208;selective catalysis relies on the ability of enzyme to tune the thermodynamics and kinetics for chemical reactions. In emulation of enzyme's ability, we showcase herein a targeting strategy with the substrate being anchored on the internal pore wall of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), taking full advantage of the sterically kinetic control to achieve shape&#8208;selectivity for the reactions. For this purpose, a series of binding site&#8208;accessible metal metalloporphyrin&#8208;frameworks (MMPFs) have been investigated to shed light on the nature of enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysis. They exhibit a different density of binding sites that are well arranged into the nanospace with corresponding distances of opposite binding sites. Such a structural specificity results in a facile switch in selectivity from an exclusive formation of the thermodynamically stable product to the kinetic product. Thus, the proposed targeting strategy, based on the combination of porous materials and binding events, paves a new way to develop highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for shifting selectivity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogeneous yolk shells consisting of a plasmonic gold nanostar coated with a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) were prepared. This configuration shows improved colloidal stability, can sieve different molecules based on their size or charge, displays interesting synergy with gold for application in photocatalysis and presents a strong optical activity for use as SERS sensors.







Abstract
Hybrid composites between nanoparticles and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been described as optimal materials for a wide range of applications in optical sensing, drug delivery, pollutant removal or catalysis. These materials are usually core&#8208;shell single&#8208; or multi&#8208;nanoparticles, restricting the inorganic surface available for reaction. Here, we develop a method for the preparation of yolk&#8208;shells consisting in a plasmonic gold nanostar coated with MOF. This configuration shows more colloidal stability, can sieve different molecules based on their size or charge, seems to show some interesting synergy with gold for their application in photocatalysis and present strong optical activity to be used as SERS sensors.

         <title>A Universal Formation Mechanism of Hollow Multi&#8208;Shelled Structures Dominated by Concentration Waves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concentration wave dominated universal formation mechanism of hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMS) is revealed by numerical simulation, as reported by Wei Ge, Dan Wang and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202302621). The discovery of the physical essence behind the formation of HoMS not only flourishes the environment for HoMS synthesis, but also offers a predictive blueprint for creating dynamic HoMS by concentration waves, thereby establishing a valuable framework for future research in the realm of synthetic chemistry.

         <dc:description>Sulfondiimines are diaza&#8208;analogues of sulfones with a chiral sulfur center. Compared to sulfones and sulfoximines, their synthesis and transformations have so far been studied to a lesser extent. Here, we report the enantioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;benzothiazine 1&#8208;imines, i.e., cyclic sulfondiimine derivatives from sulfondiimines and sulfoxonium ylides via C&#8211;H alkylation/cyclization reactions. The combination of [Ru(p&#8208;cymene)Cl2]2 and a newly developed chiral spiro carboxylic acid is key to achieving high enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Activatable Semiconducting Polymer Pro&#8208;nanomodulators for Deep&#8208;Tissue Sono&#8208;immunotherapy of Orthotopic Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunotherapy has provided a promising modality for cancer treatment, while it often has the issues of limited response rates and potential off&#8208;targeted side effects in clinical practices. We herein report the construction of semiconducting polymer pro&#8208;nanomodulators (SPpMs) with ultrasound (US)&#8208;mediated activatable pharmacological actions for deep&#8208;tissue sono&#8208;immunotherapy of orthotopic pancreatic cancer. Such SPpMs consist of a sonodynamic semiconducting polymer backbone grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) chains linked with two immunomodulators (a programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 blocker and an indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase inhibitor) via a singlet oxygen (1O2) cleavable segment. In view of the excellent sonodynamic property of semiconducting polymer core, SPpMs enable effective generation of 1O2 under US treatment, even in a deep&#8208;tissue depth up to 12 cm. The generated 1O2 not only ablates tumors via sonodynamic effect and induces immunogenic cell death, but also destroys the 1O2 cleavable segments to allow in&#8208;situ release of immunomodulators in tumors. This synergetic action results in boosted antitumor immune response via reversing two tumor immunosuppressive pathways. As such, SPpMs can mediate deep&#8208;tissue sono&#8208;immunotherapy to complete eradicate orthotopic pancreatic cancer and effectively prevent tumor metastasis. Moreover, such a precision immune activation obviously reduces the possibility of immune&#8208;related adverse events.</dc:description>

         <title>Rashba Band Splitting and Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Induced by Halogen Bonds in Hybrid Layered Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions play an essential role in directing the self&#8208;assembly of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic crystals. In hybrid halide perovskites, hydrogen bonding has been the paramount non&#8208;covalent interaction. Here, we show another non&#8208;covalent interaction, namely, the halogen bond interaction, that directs a symmetry&#8208;breaking assembly in a new series of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites (ICH2CH2NH3)2(CH3NH3)n&#8208;1PbnI3n+1 (n is the layer thickness, n = 1&#8722;4). Structural analysis shows that the halogen bond strength varies with the layer thickness. For the odd number (n = 1, 3) layered perovskites, stronger halogen interaction leads to centrosymmetric structures, whereas for the n = 2 layered perovskites, weaker halogen bonds result in non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures. Transient reflection spectroscopy shows a suppressed radiative recombination rate (k2 ~ 0) and prolonged spin lifetime for n = 2 structure, suggesting an enhanced Rashba band splitting effect. The structural asymmetry is further confirmed with a reversible bulk photovoltaic effect. Our work provides a new design strategy to enable hybrid perovskites with emerging properties and functionalities associated with structural asymmetry.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Polyethyleneimines from the Manganese Catalyzed Coupling of Ethylene Glycol and Ethylenediamine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethyleneimines find many applications in products such as detergents, adhesives, cosmetics, and for processes such as tissue culture, gene therapy, and CO2 capture. The current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technology for the production of the branched polyethyleneimines involves aziridine feedstock which is a highly toxic, volatile and mutagenic chemical and raises significant concern to human health and environment. We report here a novel method for the synthesis of branched polyethyleneimines from ethylene glycol and ethylenediamine feedstock which are much safer, environmentally benign, commercially available and potentially renewable feedstock. The polymerisation reaction is catalysed by a complex of an earth&#8208;abundant metal, manganese and liberates H2O as the only by&#8208;product. Our mechanistic studies using a combination of DFT computation and experiment suggest that the reaction proceeds by the formation and subsequent hydrogenation of imine intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>T&#8208;shaped Ni0 Systems Featuring Cationic Tetrylenes: Direct Observation of L/Z&#8208;type Ligand Duality, and Alkene Hydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a facile synthetic method for accessing rare T&#8208;shaped Ni0 species, stabilised by low&#8208;coordinate cationic germylene and stannylene ligands which behave as Z&#8208;type ligands toward Ni0. An in&#8208;depth computational analysis indicates significant Nid&#8594;Ep donation (E = Ge, Sn), with essentially no E&#8594;Ni donation. Further, the tetrylene ligand&#8217;s Lewis acidity can be modulated in&#8208;situ through the addition of a donor ligand, which selectively binds at the Lewis acidic tetrylene site. This switches this binding centre from a Z&#8208;type to a classical L&#8208;type ligand, with a concomitant geometry switch at Ni0 from T&#8208;shaped to trigonal planar. Exploring the effects of this geometry switch in catalysis, isolated T&#8208;shaped complexes 3a&#8208;c and 4a&#8208;c are capable of the hydrogenation of alkenes under mild conditions, whilst the closely related trigonal planar and tetrahedral Ni0 complexes 5, D, and E, which feature an L&#8208;type chloro&#8208; or cationic&#8208;tetrylene ligands, are inactive under these conditions. Further, addition of small amounts of N&#8208;bases to the catalytic systems involving T&#8208;shaped complexes significantly reduces turnover rates, giving evidence for the in&#8208;situ modulation of ligand electronics for catalytic switching.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Sodium Thioborate Fast Ion Conductor: Na 3 B 5 S 9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new sodium fast&#8208;ion conductor, Na3B5S9, that exhibits a high Na ion total conductivity of 0.80 mS&#8729;cm&#8208;1 (sintered pellet; cold&#8208;pressed pellet = 0.21 mS&#8729;cm&#8208;1). The structure consists of corner&#8208;sharing B10S20 supertetrahedral clusters, which create a framework that supports 3D Na ion diffusion channels. The Na ions are well&#8208;distributed in the channels and form a disordered sublattice spanning five Na crystallographic sites. The combination of structural elucidation via single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and powder synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction at variable temperatures, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal high Na&#8208;ion mobility (predicted conductivity: 0.96 mS&#8729;cm&#8208;1) and the nature of the 3D diffusion pathways. Notably, the Na ion sublattice orders at low temperatures, resulting in isolated Na polyhedra and thus much lower ionic conductivity. This highlights the importance of a disordered Na ion sublattice &#8208; and existence of well&#8208;connected Na ion migration pathways formed via face&#8208;sharing polyhedra &#8208; in dictating Na ion diffusion.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Carbon Nanorings: Synthesis, Properties and Hierarchical Self&#8208;assembly of Chiral Ternary Complexes Featuring a Narcissistic Chiral Self&#8208;Recognition for Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported the synthesis and chiroptical properties of novel chiral carbon nanorings Sp&#8208;/Rp&#8208;[12]PCPP containing a planar chiral [2.2]PCP unit, and demonstrated that Sp&#8208;/Rp&#8208;[12]PCPP can not only host crown ether 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 to form ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring complexes with a binding constant 3.35&#215;103 M&#8211;1, but also accommodate the complexes of 18&#8208;Crown&#8208;6 and S/R&#8208;protonated amines to form homochiral S@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; and heterochiral S@Rp&#8208;/R@Sp&#8208; ternary complexes, displaying significantly larger binding constants up to 3.31&#215;105 M&#8211;1 dependent on chiral guests. Importantly, homochiral S@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; ternary complexes exhibit an enhanced CD signal, while heterochiral S@Rp&#8208;/R@Sp&#8208;ones remain a constant CD signal when compared with the chiral carbon nanorings, respectively, suggesting that homochiralS@Sp&#8208;/R@Rp&#8208; ternary complexes display a highly narcissistic chiral self&#8208;recognition for S/R&#8208;protonated chiral amines, respectively.

         <title>A Thiazole&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework for Lithium&#8208;Sulphur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulphur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are a promising alternative power source, as they can provide a higher energy density than current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Porous materials are often used as cathode materials as they can act as a host for sulphur in such batteries. Recently, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have also been used, however they typically suffer from stability issues resulting in limited and thus insufficient durability under practical conditions and applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a crystalline and porous imine&#8208;linked triazine&#8208;based dimethoxybenzene&#8208;functionalized COF (TTT&#8208;DMTD) incorporating a high density redox sites. The imine linkages were further post&#8208;synthetically transformed to yield a robust thiazole&#8208;linked COF (THZ&#8208;DMTD) by utilizing a sulphur&#8208;assisted chemical conversion method, while maintaining the crystallinity. As a synergistic effect of its high crystallinity, porosity and the presence of redox&#8208;active moieties, the thiazole&#8208;linked THZ&#8208;DMTD exhibited a high capacity and long&#8208;term stability (642 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1.0 C; 78.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles) when applied as a cathode material in a Li&#8208;S battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Ring&#8208;Opening Hydrophosphinylation of Methylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrophosphinylation of methylene cyclopropanes allowed for the synthesis of a wide range of chiral allylic phosphine oxides via highly selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage (up to 96&#8201;% yield and up to 94&#8201;% ee). DFT calculations were performed to support the experimental results and to investigate the mechanism of the reaction.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of methylenecyclopropanes (MCPs) has presented a considerable challenge due to the difficult manipulation of regioselectivity and complicated reaction patterns. Herein, we report a straightforward Pd&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydrophosphinylation reaction of MCPs via highly selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage. This method allows for rapid and efficient access to a wide range of chiral allylic phosphine oxides in good yields and high enantioselectivities. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Deoxidizing&#160;Electrolyte Additive Enables Highly Stable Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries, the Zn anode suffers from severe corrosion reactions and consequent dendrite growth troubles that cause fast performance decay. Herein, we uncover the corrosion mechanism and confirm that the dissolved oxygen (DO) other than the reputed proton is a principal origin of Zn corrosion and by&#8208;product precipitates, especially during the initial battery resting period.&#160;In a break from common physical deoxygenation methods, we propose a chemical self&#8208;deoxygenation strategy to tackle the DO&#8208;induced hazards. As a proof of concept, sodium anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate (AQS) is introduced to aqueous electrolytes as a self&#8208;deoxidizing additive. As a result, the Zn anode sustains a long&#8208;term cycling of 2500 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8210;2 and over 1100 h at 5 mA cm&#8210;2 together with a high Coulombic efficiency up to 99.6%. The full cells also show a high capacity retention of 92% after 500 cycles. Our findings provide a renewed understanding of Zn corrosion in aqueous electrolytes and also a practical solution towards industrializing aqueous Zn batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroxyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Efficient Photoelectrocatalytic NO Oxidation with Simultaneous Nitrate Storage Using A Flow Photoanode Reactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective conversion of dilute NO pollutant into low&#8208;toxic product and simultaneous storage of metabolic nitrogen for crop plants remains a great challenge from the perspective of waste management and sustainable chemistry. This study&#160;demonstrates that this bottleneck&#160;can be well tackled by refining the reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#160;on Ni&#8208;modified NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 (Zr) using nickel foam (Ni@NU/NF) as a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) substrate through a flow photoanode reactor via the gas&#8208;phase photoelectrocatalysis. By rationally refining the ROS to &#8226;OH, Ni@NU/NF can rapidly eliminate 82% of NO without releasing remarkable NO2 under a low bias voltage (0.3 V) and visible light irradiation. The abundant mesoporous pores on Ni@NU/NF are conducive to the diffusion and storage of the formed nitrate, which enables the progressive conversion NO into nitrate with selectivity over 99% for long&#8208;term use. Through calculation, 90% of NO could be recovered as the nitrate species, indicating that this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategy can capture, enrich and recycle the pollutant N source from the atmosphere. This study offers a new perspective of NO pollutant treatment and sustainable nitrogen exploitation, which may possess great potential to the development of highly efficient air purification systems for industrial and indoor NOx control.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Precise Defective Copper Nanocluster Catalysts for Highly Selective C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of defective [Cu28H10(C7H7S)18(TPP)3] (Cu28) nanoclusters (NCs) on a gram scale has been developed. The surface vacancy on one of the vertices of Cu28 was systematically investigated at the atomic level and Cu28 can act as an effective and selective catalyst for Sonogashira C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions under visible&#8208;light irradiation.







Abstract
Point defects in nanoparticles have long been hypothesized to play an important role in governing the particle's electronic structure and physicochemical properties. However, single point defects in material systems usually exist with other heterogeneities, obscuring the chemical role of the effects. Herein, we report the synthesis of novel atomically precise, copper hydride nanoclusters (NCs), [Cu28H10(C7H7S)18(TPP)3] (Cu28; TPP: triphenylphosphine; C7H7S: o&#8208;thiocresol) with a defined defect in the gram scale via a one&#8208;pot reduction method. The Cu28 acts as a highly selective catalyst for C&#8722;C cross&#8208;couplings. The work highlights the potential of defective NCs as model systems for investigating individual defects, correlating defects with physiochemical properties, and rationally designing new nanoparticle catalysts.

         <title>Quadruple H&#8208;Bonding and Polyrotaxanes Dual Cross&#8208;linking Supramolecular Elastomer for High Toughness and Self&#8208;healing Conductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly tough and self&#8208;healable elastomer is prepared through a strategy by combining quadruple H&#8208;bonding and polyrotaxanes dual crosslinks. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulation and low&#8208;field solid state 1H&#8197;NMR confirmed the combined effect. Highly stretchable conductors based on the elastomers provide great potential for the high stretchable and tough electronic devices.







Abstract
Tough and self&#8208;healable substrates can enable stretchable electronics long service life. However, for substrates, it still remains a challenge to achieve both high toughness and autonomous self&#8208;healing ability at room temperature. Herein, a strategy by using the combined effects between quadruple H&#8208;bonding and slidable cross&#8208;links is proposed to solve the above issues in the elastomer. The elastomer exhibits high toughness (77.3&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), fracture energy (&#8776;127.2&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2), and good healing efficiency (91&#8201;%) at room temperature. The superior performance is ascribed to the inter and intra crosslinking structures of quadruple H&#8208;bonding and polyrotaxanes in the dual crosslinking system. Strain&#8208;induced crystallization of PEG in polyrotaxanes also contributes to the high fracture energy of the elastomers. Furthermore, based on the dual cross&#8208;linked supramolecular elastomer, a highly stretchable and self&#8208;healable electrode containing liquid metal is also fabricated, retaining resistance stability (0.16&#8211;0.26&#8197;&#937;) even at the strain of 1600&#8201;%.

         <title>Sulfone&#8208;Modified Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabling Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Generation via One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By accelerating the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs, enhancing the protonation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and promoting the O2 adsorption in a &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; Yeager&#8208;type with enhanced adsorption energy, FS&#8208;COFs alter the photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process from two&#8208;step 2e&#8722; route to the one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; route, achieving efficient hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers a promising hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthetic strategy, especially the one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) ORR route holds great potential in achieving highly efficient and selectivity. However, efficient one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR is rarely harvested and the underlying mechanism for regulating the ORR pathways remains greatly obscure. Here, by loading sulfone units into covalent organic frameworks (FS&#8208;COFs), we present an efficient photocatalyst for H2O2 generation via one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR from pure water and air. Under visible light irradiation, FS&#8208;COFs exert a superb H2O2 yield of 3904.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, outperforming most reported metal&#8208;free catalysts under similar conditions. Experimental and theoretical investigation reveals that the sulfone units accelerate the separation of photoinduced electron&#8208;hole (e&#8722;&#8208;h+) pairs, enhance the protonation of COFs, and promote O2 adsorption in the Yeager&#8208;type, which jointly alters the reaction process from two&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR to the one&#8208;step one, thereby achieving efficient H2O2 generation with high selectivity.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biosupercapacitors (BSCs) that can harvest and store chemical energy show great promise for power delivery of biological applications. However, low power density still limits their applications, especially as miniaturized implants.&#160;Here, we report an implantable fiber BSC with maximal power density of 22.6 mW&#8231;cm&#8722;2, superior to the previous reports. The fiber BSC was fabricated by integrating anode and cathode fibers of biofuel cell with supercapacitor fibers through multi&#8208;strand twisting. This twisting structure endowed many channels inside and high electrochemical active area for efficient mass diffusion and charge transfer among different fibers, benefiting high power output. The obtained thin and flexible fiber BSC operated stably under deformations and performed high biocompatibility after implantation. Eventually, the fiber BSC was implanted subcutaneously in rats and successfully realized electrical stimulation of sciatic nerve, showing promise&#160;as a power source in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Photoreduction of Carborane Phosphonium Salts: Efficient Synthesis of Carborane&#8208;Oxindole&#8208;Pharmaceutical Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoreduction of carborane phosphonium salts, enabled by a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced charge&#8208;transfer complex, has been developed. This strategy allows access to various carborane&#8208;oxindole&#8208;pharmaceuticals via carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals in the absence of a transition metal (TM) and photocatalyst (PC).







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photoreaction of carboranes is an effective approach to prepare carborane&#8208;containing compounds. While several methods involving boron&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals have been established, those for carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals are underdeveloped, except for the UV&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photohomolysis. Herein, we describe a simple but effective approach to access carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals by photoreduction of carborane phosphonium salts under blue light irradiation without using transition metals and photocatalysts. The utility of the method was demonstrated by successfully preparing a range of carborane&#8208;oxindole&#8208;pharmaceutical hybrids by radical cascade reactions. Computational and experimental studies suggest that the carbon&#8208;centered carboranyl radicals are generated by single&#8208;electron transfer of the photoactive charge&#8208;transfer complexes between the salts and the additive potassium acetate.

     alt="Visible-Light-Induced Photoreduction of Carborane Phosphonium Salts: Efficient Synthesis of Carborane-Oxindole-Pharmaceutical Hybrids"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photoreduction of carborane phosphonium salts, enabled by a visible-light-induced charge-transfer complex, has been developed. This strategy allows access to various carborane-oxindole-pharmaceuticals via carbon-centered carboranyl radicals in the absence of a transition metal (TM) and photocatalyst (PC).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visible-light-induced photoreaction of carboranes is an effective approach to prepare carborane-containing compounds. While several methods involving boron-centered carboranyl radicals have been established, those for carbon-centered carboranyl radicals are underdeveloped, except for the UV-light-promoted photohomolysis. Herein, we describe a simple but effective approach to access carbon-centered carboranyl radicals by photoreduction of carborane phosphonium salts under blue light irradiation without using transition metals and photocatalysts. The utility of the method was demonstrated by successfully preparing a range of carborane-oxindole-pharmaceutical hybrids by radical cascade reactions. Computational and experimental studies suggest that the carbon-centered carboranyl radicals are generated by single-electron transfer of the photoactive charge-transfer complexes between the salts and the additive potassium acetate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Polarization Triggered Multiple Polar Units Toward Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Ethanol with High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetrical refinement structure with self&#8208;polarizing unit possesses benchmark electrocatalytic activity towards CO2 to ethanol reductiopn on Cu2O@MOF/CF electrodes. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the polarization of atomically localized electric fields derived from the asymmetric electron distribution can tune the moderate adsorption of *CO to assist the C&#8722;C coupling and reduce the formation energy of CH3CHO* for the generation of ethanol.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to highly valuable ethanol has been considered a intriguring strategy for carbon neutruality. However, the slow kinetics of coupling carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonds, especially the low selectivity ethanol than ethylene in neutral conditions, is a significant challenge. Herein, the asymmetrical refinement structure with enhanced charge polarization is built in the vertically oriented bimetallic organic frameworks (NiCu&#8208;MOF) nanorod array with encapsulated Cu2O (Cu2O@MOF/CF), which can induce an intensive internal electric field to increase the C&#8722;C coupling for producing ethanol in neutral electrolyte. Particularly, when directly employed Cu2O@MOF/CF as the self&#8208;supporting electrode, the ethanol faradaic efficiency (FEethanol) could reach maximum 44.3&#8201;% with an energy efficiency of 27&#8201;% at a low working&#8208;potential of &#8722;0.615&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) using CO2&#8208;saturated 0.5&#8197;M KHCO3 as the electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the polarization of atomically localized electric fields derived from the asymmetric electron distribution can tune the moderate adsorption of *CO to assist the C&#8722;C coupling and reduce the formation energy of H2CCHO*&#8208;to&#8208;*OCHCH3 for the generation of ethanol. Our research offers a reference for the design of highly active and selective electrocatalysts for reducing CO2 to multicarbon chemicals.

         <title>Dual Recycling of Depolymerization Catalyst and Biodegradable Polyester that Markedly Outperforms Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual recycling of the potent depolymerization catalyst PMA and biodegradable polyester PVL that largely outperforms commodity polyolefins has been achieved. The chemical recycling of PVL in bulk phase is performed under mild temperature of only 100&#8201;&#176;C, recovering the pure monomer in quantitative yield for closed&#8208;loop recycling and the depolymerization catalyst that can be reused repeatedly without loss of activity and efficiency.







Abstract
Chemically recyclable, circular polymers continue to attract increasing attention, but rendering both catalysts for depolymerization and high&#8208;performance polymers recyclable is a more sustainable yet challenging goal. Here we introduce a dual catalyst/polymer recycling system in that recyclable inorganic phosphomolybdic acid catalyzes selective depolymerization of high&#8208;ceiling&#8208;temperature biodegradable poly(&#948;&#8208;valerolactone) in bulk phase, which, upon reaching suitable molecular weight, exhibits outstanding mechanical performance with a high tensile strength of &#8776;66.6&#8197;MPa, fracture strain of &#8776;904&#8201;%, and toughness of &#8776;308&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3, and thus markedly outperforms commodity polyolefins, recovering its monomer in pure state and quantitative yield at only 100&#8201;&#176;C. In sharp contrast, the uncatalyzed depolymerization not only requires a high temperature of &gt;310&#8201;&#176;C but is also low yielding and non&#8208;selective. Importantly, the recovered monomer can be repolymerized as is to reproduce the same polymer, thereby closing the circular loop, and the recycled catalyst can be reused repeatedly for depolymerization runs without loss of its catalytic activity and efficiency.

         <title>Fabrication of Photoprocessable Materials via Photopolymerization Using an Acid&#8208;Induced Photocleavable Platinum&#8208;Acetylide Crosslinker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photopolymerization and photoprocessing are core technologies for the precise molding and tuning of polymer materials; however, they are incompatible with single materials because of their conflicting reactivity. Herein, the acid&#8208;induced photocleavage of a platinum&#8211;acetylide crosslinker allows the fabrication of materials via photopolymerization with 365&#8208;nm UV light as well as photoprocessing with 365&#8208;nm UV light under acidic conditions.







Abstract
Photopolymerization and photoprocessing are core technologies for molding and tuning polymer materials. However, they are incompatible with single materials owing to their contradictory photoreactivity. Herein, an acid&#8208;induced photocleavable crosslinker, a platinum&#8211;acetylide complex covered by permethylated cyclodextrins, enables the fabrication of photoprocessable materials via photopolymerization with N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)acrylamide. The polymer networks are molded by 365&#8197;nm irradiation as well as softened and degraded by a cooperative reaction with HCl as an acidic additive under 365&#8197;nm UV light, or 470&#8197;nm visible light in the presence of a photosensitizer. Moreover, the crosslinker is applied to a photoadhesive triggered by 365&#8197;nm irradiation. The adhesion is detachable on&#8208;demand through acid&#8208;induced photodegradation with the same wavelength and intensity of irradiation. Thus, acid&#8208;induced photocleavage allows the integration of light&#8208;induced molding and processing under various lights of various wavelengths, opening up new strategies for polymer technologies.

         <title>Pore Size Modulation in Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enabling High Performance Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;coordination directed structure swelling method was used to modulate the pore size of MIL&#8208;88B, which enables to reveal the pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent gas sensitivity and selectivity of MOF materials for the first time.







Abstract
Pore size plays a critical role in determining the performance of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in catalysis, sensing, and gas storage or separation. However, revealing the pore&#8208;size/property relationship remains extremely challenging because ideal structure models possessing different pore sizes but having the same components are lacking. In this work, a solvent&#8208;coordination directed structure swelling method was developed for modulating the ratio between the large and narrow pore phases of a flexible MOF, MIL&#8208;88B. Pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent gas sensitivity and selectivity were studied for the first time in the MIL&#8208;88B samples. The optimized MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;20&#8201;% sample showed one of the best sensing performances among all the reported MOF&#8208;based H2S&#8208;sensing materials. This work not only provides a method to synthesize ideal structure models for revealing the relationship between pore&#8208;size and properties, but also may inspire the development of high&#8208;performance gas sensing materials.

         <title>Rational Design of the &#946;&#8208;Bulge Gate in a Green Fluorescent Protein Accelerates the Kinetics of Sulfate Sensing
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The serendipitous discovery of an intrinsic fluorescent protein&#8208;based sensor for sulfate called SulfOFF&#8208;1 is reported. This function was unlocked by introducing mutations in a solvent&#8208;exposed region of the fluorescent protein mNeonGreen. An integrated approach encompassing in vitro spectroscopy and in silico modeling provides a comprehensive understanding of the sensor mechanism.







Abstract
Detection of anions in complex aqueous media is a fundamental challenge with practical utility that can be addressed by supramolecular chemistry. Biomolecular hosts such as proteins can be used and adapted as an alternative to synthetic hosts. Here, we report how the mutagenesis of the &#946;&#8208;bulge residues (D137 and W138) in mNeonGreen, a bright, monomeric fluorescent protein, unlocks and tunes the anion preference at physiological pH for sulfate, resulting in the turn&#8208;off sensor SulfOFF&#8208;1. This unprecedented sensing arises from an enhancement in the kinetics of binding, largely driven by position 138. In line with these data, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations capture how the coordinated entry and gating of sulfate into the &#946;&#8208;barrel is eliminated upon mutagenesis to facilitate binding and fluorescence quenching.

&lt;p&gt;The serendipitous discovery of an intrinsic fluorescent protein-based sensor for sulfate called SulfOFF-1 is reported. This function was unlocked by introducing mutations in a solvent-exposed region of the fluorescent protein mNeonGreen. An integrated approach encompassing &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; spectroscopy and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; modeling provides a comprehensive understanding of the sensor mechanism.

&#8220;The featured project reconfirms that high&#8208;impact science and successful transfer into an SME are not opposite ends of the spectrum, but rather bridges that can be built readily &#8230; To get this far, the team learned to work effectively at the interface between synthetic organic chemistry, characterization of microcrystalline surfaces, and spatially resolved chemical analysis of lipids in tissue sections.&#8220; Find out more about CeMOS Mannheim's Applied Mass Spectrometry Team.







Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Applied Mass Spectrometry Team at the Center for Mass Spectrometry and Optical Spectroscopy (CeMOS Mannheim) in Germany. They recently published an article together with Sirius Fine Chemicals SiChem GmbH and Bruker Daltonics. The work presents a novel concept for vacuum&#8208;stable&#8208;by&#8208;design MALDI matrices that enable long MALDI mass spectrometry measurements (e.g., for imaging) of at least 72&#8197;hours. Through the use of a photo&#8208;removable group, organic synthesis transformed the widely used, but unfortunately very volatile MALDI matrix 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyacetophenone (2,5&#8208;DHAP) into a vacuum&#8208;stable one. The protecting group can be uncaged by the MALDI laser in the ion source and then the matrix performs in the same way as the common matrix 2,5&#8208;DHAP. &#8220;A Caged In&#8208;Source Laser&#8208;Cleavable MALDI Matrix with High Vacuum Stability for Extended MALDI&#8208;MS Imaging&#8221;, Q.

         <title>Electron Acceptor Molecule Doping Induced &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interaction to Promote Charge Transport Kinetics for Efficient and Stable 2D/3D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, electron acceptor molecule 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene is utilized to trigger intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction along with the electronic doping of 2D/3D perovskite to facilitate carrier transportation. It effectively reduces defect density and optimizes energy level alignment. As a result, the 2D/3D perovskite solar cell achieves a champion PCE of up to 24.01&#8201;% coupled with greatly strengthened environmental stability.







Abstract
Although the incorporation of 2D perovskite into 3D perovskite can greatly enhance intrinsic stability, power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2D/3D perovskite is still inferior to its 3D counterpart due to poor carrier transport kinetics resulted from the quantum and dielectric confinement of 2D component. To overcome this issue, the electron acceptor molecule 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) was introduced to trigger intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction in 2D perovskite along with the electronic doping of 2D/3D perovskite to improve charge transfer efficiency. By virtue of high electron affinity, TCNB can undergo electron transfer reaction and subsequently establish &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction with 1&#8208;naphthalenemethylammonium (NMA) cations, greatly strengthening lattice rigidity and reducing exciton binding energy. Transmission electron microscopy results demonstrate that 2D phases are mainly distributed at grain boundaries, reducing defect density and weakening nonradiative recombination. Meanwhile, the p&#8208;type doping of perovskite by TCNB optimizes energy level alignment at perovskite/hole transport layer interface. Consequently, PCE of champion device is significantly boosted to 24.01&#8201;%. The unencapsulated device retains an initial efficiency close to 94&#8201;% after exposure to ambient environment for over 1000&#8197;h. This work paves a novel path for designing new mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells with high PCE and superior stability.

         <title>A Concerted Enzymatic and Bioorthogonal Approach for Extracellular and Intracellular Activation of Environment&#8208;Sensitive Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Based Imaging Probes and Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this article, we report a novel targeting strategy involving the combination of an enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly (EISA) moiety and a strained cycloalkyne to generate large accumulation of bioorthogonal sites in cancer cells. These bioorthogonal sites can serve as activation triggers in different regions for transition metal&#8208;based probes, which are new ruthenium(II) complexes carrying a tetrazine unit for controllable phosphorescence and singlet&#8208;oxygen generation. Importantly, the environment&#8208;sensitive emission of the complexes can be further enhanced in the hydrophobic regions offered by the large supramolecular assemblies, which is highly advantageous to biological imaging. Additionally, the (photo)cytotoxicity of the large supramolecular assemblies containing the complexes was investigated, and the results illustrate that cellular localization (extracellular and intracellular) imposes a profound impact on the efficiencies of photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocurrent Generation and Polarity Switching in Electrochemical Cells through Light&#8208;induced Excited State Proton Transfer of Photoacids and Photobases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light is a common source of energy in sustainable technologies for photocurrent generation. To date, in such light&#8208;harvesting applications, the excited electrons generate the photocurrent. Here, we introduce a new mechanism for photocurrent generation that is based on excited state proton transfer (ESPT) of photoacids and photobases that can donate or accept a proton, respectively, but only after excitation. We show that the formed ions following ESPT can either serve as electron donors or acceptors with the electrodes, or modify the kinetics of mass transport across the diffuse layer, both resulting in photocurrent generation. We further show that control of the current polarity is obtained by switching the irradiation between the photoacid and the photobase. Our study represents a new approach in photoelectrochemistry by introducing ESPT processes, which can be further utilized in light&#8208;responsive energy production or energy storage.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Light is a common source of energy in sustainable technologies for photocurrent generation. To date, in such light-harvesting applications, the excited electrons generate the photocurrent. Here, we introduce a new mechanism for photocurrent generation that is based on excited state proton transfer (ESPT) of photoacids and photobases that can donate or accept a proton, respectively, but only after excitation. We show that the formed ions following ESPT can either serve as electron donors or acceptors with the electrodes, or modify the kinetics of mass transport across the diffuse layer, both resulting in photocurrent generation. We further show that control of the current polarity is obtained by switching the irradiation between the photoacid and the photobase. Our study represents a new approach in photoelectrochemistry by introducing ESPT processes, which can be further utilized in light-responsive energy production or energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charting the Chemical Reaction Space around a Multicomponent Combination: Controlled Access to a Diverse Set of Biologically Relevant Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Charting the chemical reaction space around the combination of carbonyls, amines, and isocyanoacetates allows the description of new multicomponent processes leading to a variety of unsaturated imidazolone scaffolds. The resulting compounds display the chromophore of the green fluorescent protein and the core of the natural product coelenterazine. Despite the competitive nature of the pathways involved, general protocols provide selective access to the desired chemotypes. Moreover, we describe unprecedented reactivity at the C&#8208;2 position of the imidazolone core to directly afford C, S, and N&#8208;derivatives featuring natural products (e.g. leucettamines), potent kinase inhibitors, and fluorescent probes with suitable optical and biological profiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging Boron and Carbonyl based MR&#8208;TADF Emitter Designs to Achieve High Performance Deep Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) compounds are attractive as emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) as they simultaneously can harvest both singlet and triplet excitons to produce light and show very narrowband emission, which translates to excellent colour purity. Here, we report the first example of a MR&#8208;TADF emitter (DOBDiKTa) that fuses together fragments from the two major classes of MR&#8208;TADF compounds, those containing boron and those containing carbonyl groups as acceptor fragments in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon skeleton. Using this molecular design, this compound shows desirable narrowband deep blue emission and efficient TADF character. The OLED with DOBDiKTa as the emitter and mCP:PPT (1:1) as the co&#8208;host exhibits an EQEmax of 17.4%, an efficiency roll&#8208;off of 32% at 100 cd m&#8208;2, and CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.12). Compared to DOBNA and DiTKa, DOBDiKTa shows higher device efficiency with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off while maintaining a narrow pure blue electroluminescence, which demonstrates the promise of the proposed molecular design.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Main group systems capable of undergoing controlled redox events at extreme potentials are elusive yet highly desirable for a range of organic electronics applications including use as energy storage media. Herein we describe phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized terthiophenes that exhibit two reversible 1e&#8211; reduction at potentials below &#8211;2 V vs Fc/Fc+ (Fc = ferrocene) while retaining high degrees of stability. A phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized terthiophene radical anion was synthesized in which the redox&#8208;responsive nature of the platform was established using combined structural, spectroscopic, and computational characterization. Straightforward structural modification led to the identification of a derivative that exhibits exceptional stability during bulk 2e&#8211; galvanostatic charge&#8208;discharge cycling and enabled characterization of a 2e&#8211; redox series. A new multi&#8208;electron redox system class is hence disclosed that expands the electrochemical cell potential range achievable with main group electrolytes without compromising stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;silica Cu&#8208;CHA Zeolite Enriched with Al Pairs Transcribed from Silicoaluminophosphate Seed: Synthesis and Ammonia Selective Catalytic Reduction Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;exchanged low&#8208;silica CHA zeolites (Si/Al &#8804; 4) synthesized without organic templates are promising candidate catalysts for ammonia selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides (NH3&#8208;SCR), but their practical application is restricted due to the low hydrothermal stability. Here, inspired by the transcription from duplex DNA to RNA, we synthesized Al pairs enriched low&#8208;silica CHA zeolite (CHA&#8208;SPAEI, Si/Al = 3.7) by using silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) featured by strict alternation of &#8211;Al&#8211;O&#8211;P(Si)&#8211;O&#8211;Al&#8211;O&#8211; tetrahedra as seed. The proportion of Al pairs in CHA&#8208;SPAEI is 78%, which is much higher than that in the conventional low&#8208;silica CHA (CHA&#8208;LS, 52%). After hydrothermal ageing at 800 &#176;C for 6 h, Cu&#8208;exchanged CHA&#8208;SPAEI shows NO conversion above 90% within 225&#8208;500 &#176;C under a gas hourly space velocity of 200,000 h&#8208;1, which is much better than that of Cu&#8208;exchanged CHA&#8208;LS. The spatial close proximity of Al pairs in CHA&#8208;SPAEI is confirmed by the 27Al double&#8208;quantum single&#8208;quantum two&#8208;dimensional NMR analyses. The strict &#8208;P(Si)&#8208;O&#8208;Al&#8208;O&#8208;P(Si)&#8208;O&#8208; sequence in the fragments from the dissolution of SAPO seed promotes the Al pairs with the &#8208;Al&#8208;O&#8208;Si&#8208;O&#8208;Al&#8208;O&#8208; sequence via a transcription process. The utilization of aluminophosphate&#8208;based zeolites as seeds opens up a new avenue for the regulation of the Al distribution in zeolites.</dc:description>

         <title>An Integrated Dual&#8208;Functional Nanotool Capable of Studying Single&#8208;Cell Epigenetics and Programmable Gene Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;cell epigenetics is envisioned to decipher manifold epigenetic phenomena and to contribute to our accurate knowledge about basic epigenetic mechanisms. Engineered nanopipette technology has gained momentum in single&#8208;cell study, whereas solutions to epigenetic study remain unachieved. This study addresses the challenge by exploring N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A)&#8208;bearing deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme) confined within nanopipette for profiling representative m6A modifying enzyme of fat mass and obesity&#8208;associated protein (FTO). Electroosmotic intracellular extraction of FTO could remove the m6A and cause DNAzyme cleavage, leading to the altered ionic current signal. Because the cleavage can release a DNA sequence, we simultaneously program it as an antisense strand against FTO&#8208;mRNA, intracellular injection of which has been shown to induce early stage apoptosis. This nanotool thus features the dual functions of studying single&#8208;cell epigenetics and programmable gene regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanine Polymersomes Inbreathe Gas Signaling Molecule: SO2&#8208;Driven Bilayer Tubular Deformation for Transmembrane Traffic Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating nanoscale assemblies that can respond to gas signaling molecules has emerged as a field of growing interest owing to their unique biomedical applications in gas&#8208;guided delivery and gas therapeutics. Yet, among a variety of endogenous gaseous biosignals, exploiting sulfur dioxide (SO2) as a cue for controllable self&#8208;assembly remains elusive, despite its crucial two&#8208;sided roles both in physiology and pathology. Here we show a SO2&#8208;responsive polymersome system assembled from a novel class of cyanine&#8208;containing block copolymers. By intake of SO2 gas, the tautomerism of cyanine drives such vesicles to continuously deform, and change into long nanotubes through axial stretching and anisotropic extrusion of the membranes. Unexpectedly, during this order&#8208;to&#8208;order phase transition, their membranes manifest well SO2&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent permselectivity, which allows the cargos of different sizes loaded therein to be selectively transferred across the bilayers. This study would inspire us to better understand and mimic the function of gas signaling molecules in shifting biomembrane shape and managing transmembrane traffic.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct and Indirect Evolution of Photoluminescent Semiconductor&#160;CdS Magic&#8208;Size Clusters through Their Precursor Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal semiconductor II&#8722;VI metal chalcogenide (ME) magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs) exhibit either an optical absorption singlet or doublet. In the latter case, a sharp photoluminescence (PL) signal is observed. Whether the PL&#8208;inactive MSCs transform to the PL&#8208;active ones is unknown. We show that PL&#8208;inactive CdS MSC&#8208;322 transforms to PL&#8208;active CdS MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 in the presence of acetic acid (HOAc). MSC&#8208;322 displays a sharp absorption at ~322 nm, whereas MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 both have broad absorptions respectively around 328 and 373 nm. In a reaction of cadmium myristate and S powder in 1&#8208;octadecene, MSC&#8208;322 develops; with HOAc, MSC&#8208;328 and MSC&#8208;373 are present. We propose that the MSCs evolve from their relatively transparent precursor compounds (PCs). The PC&#8208;322 to PC&#8208;328 quasi&#8208;isomerization involves monomer substitution, while monomer addition occurs for the PC&#8208;328 to PC&#8208;373 transformation. Our findings suggest that S dominates the precursor self&#8208;assembly quantitatively, and ligand&#8208;bonded Cd mainly controls MSC optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Migratory Insertion in Gold Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploration of elementary reactions in organometallic catalysis is an important method with which to discover new reactions. In this article, we report a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed iodo&#8208;alkynylation of benzyne involving the merging of challenging migratory insertion and an oxidative addition process in gold catalytic cycle. A wide range of structurally diverse alkynyl iodides are good coupling partners in this iodo&#8208;alkynylation transformation. Both aliphatic and aromatic alkynyl iodides can react with benzynes smoothly to afford highly functionalized 1,2&#8208;disubstituted aromatics in moderate to good yields. Its good functional group compatibility and late&#8208;stage application of complex molecules demonstrate its synthetic robustness. Studies of the mechanism reveals the feasibility of oxidative addition and the DFT calculations demonstrate the possible migratory insertion of benzyne into Au(III)&#8208;carbon bonds in the Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalytic cycle, representing an important step towards an elementary reaction in gold chemistry research.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical coupling initiated by organophosphine addition to ynoates</title>

         <dc:description>Dual nucleophilic phosphine photoredox catalysis is yet to be developed due to facile oxidation of the phosphine organocatalyst to the phosphoranyl radical cation. Herein, we report a reaction design that avoids this event and exploits traditional nucleophilic phosphine organocatalysis with photoredox catalysis to allow the Giese coupling with ynoates. The approach has good generality, while its mechanism is supported by cyclic voltametric, Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching, and interception studies.</dc:description>

         <title>40 Years of Low&#8208;Temperature Electrolytes for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable lithium batteries are one of the most appropriate energy storage systems in our electrified society, as virtually all portable electronic devices and electric vehicles today rely on the chemical energy stored in them. However, sub&#8208;zero Celsius operation, especially below &#8722;20&#176;C, remains a huge challenge for lithium batteries and greatly limits their application in extreme environments. Slow Li+ diffusion and charge transfer kinetics have been identified as two main origins of the poor performance of RLBs under low&#8208;temperature conditions, both strongly associated with the liquid electrolyte that governs bulk and interfacial ion transport. In this review, we first analyze the low&#8208;temperature kinetic behavior and failure mechanism of lithium batteries from an electrolyte standpoint. We next trace the history of low&#8208;temperature electrolytes in the past 40 years (1983&#8211;2022), followed by a comprehensive summary of the research progress as well as introducing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization and computational methods for revealing their underlying mechanisms. Finally, we provide some perspectives on future research of low&#8208;temperature electrolytes with particular emphasis on mechanism analysis and practical application.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase Transition&#8208;Promoted Rapid Photomechanical Motions of Single Crystals of a Triene Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular crystals with the ability to transform light energy into macroscopic mechanical motions are a promising class of materials with potential applications in actuating and photonic devices. In regard to such materials, coordination polymers that exhibit dynamic photomechanical motion, associated with a phase transition, are unknown. Herein, we report an intriguing photoactive, one&#8208;dimensional Zn(II) coordination polymer, 1, derived from 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethenylbenzene and 3,5&#8208;difluorobenzoate. Single crystals of 1 under UV light irradiation exhibit rapid shrinking and bending, violent bursting&#8208;jumping, splitting and cracking behavior. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and 1H NMR spectroscopy reveal an unusual photoinduced phase transition involving a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction resulting in photomechanical responses. Interestingly, crystals of 1, which are triclinic with space group P&#160;1, are transformed into a higher symmetry, monoclinic cell with space group C2/c. This process represents a rare example of symmetry enhancement upon photoirradiation. The photomechanical activity is likely due to the sudden release of stress associated with strained molecular geometries and significant solid&#8208;state molecular movement arising from cleavage and formation of chemical bonds. A composite membrane fabricated from 1 and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) also displays interesting photomechanical behavior under UV light illumination, indicating the material's potential as a photoactuator.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Electrochemical Cobalt Catalysed Hydrogen Atom Transfer for the Hydrofunctionalisation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic hydrogen atom transfer from metal&#8208;hydrides to alkenes allows feedstock olefins to be used as alkyl radical precursors. The chemoselectivity of this process makes it an attractive synthetic tool and as such it has been regularly used in synthesis of complex molecules. However, onwards reactivity is limited by compatibility with the conditions which form the key metal&#8208;hydride species. Now, through the merger with photocatalysis or electrochemistry, milder methods are emerging which can unlock entirely new reactivity and offer perspectives on expanding these methods in unprecedented directions. This review outlines the most recent developments in electro&#8208; and photochemical cobalt catalysed methods and offers suggestions on the future outlook.</dc:description>

         <title>Extending the &#960;&#8208;Conjugated System in Spiro&#8208;Type Hole Transport Material Enhances the Efficiency and Stability of Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hole transport materials (HTMs) are a key component of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The small molecular 2,2&#8217;,7,7&#8217;&#8208;tetrakis(N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;amine&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;spirobifluorene (spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, termed &#8220;Spiro&#8221;) is the most successful HTM used in PSCs, but its versatility is imperfect. To improve its performance, we developed a novel spiro&#8208;type HTM (termed &#8220;DP&#8221;) by substituting four anisole units on Spiro with 4&#8208;methoxybiphenyl moieties. By extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of Spiro in this way, the HOMO level of the HTM matches well with the perovskite valence band, enhancing hole mobility and increasing the glass transition temperature. DP&#8208;based PSC achieves high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.24% for small&#8208;area (0.06 cm2) devices and 21.86% for modules (designated area of 27.56 cm2), along with the certified efficiency of 21.78% on a designated area of 27.86 cm2. The encapsulated DP&#8208;based devices maintain 95.1% of the initial performance under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 conditions after 2,560 hours and 87% at the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 conditions over 600 hours.</dc:description>

DP-based PSC achieves high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.24% for small-area (0.06 cm2) devices and 21.86% for modules (designated area of 27.56 cm2), along with the certified efficiency of 21.78% on a designated area of 27.86 cm2. The encapsulated DP-based devices maintain 95.1% of the initial performance under ISOS-L-1 conditions after 2,560 hours and 87% at the ISOS-L-3 conditions over 600 hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequential Multistep Excited&#8208;State Structural Transformations in N,N&#8242;&#8208;Diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that a single polycyclic &#960;&#8208;scaffold can undergo sequential multistep excited&#8208;state structural evolution along the bent, planar, and twisted conformers, which coexist to produce intrinsic multiple fluorescence emissions in room&#8208;temperature solution. By installing a methyl or trifluoromethyl group on the ortho&#8208;site of N,N&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DPAC), the enhanced steric effects change the fluorescence emission of DPAC from a dominant red band to well&#8208;resolved triple bands. The ultra&#8208;broadband triple emissions of ortho&#8208;substituted DPACs range from ~350 to ~850 nm, which is unprecedented for small fluorophores with molecular weight of &lt; 500. Ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical calculations clearly reveal that the above dramatic changes originate from the influence of steric hindrance on the shape of excited state potential energy surface (S1 PES). Compared to the steep S1 PES of parental DPAC, introduction of ortho&#8208;substituent is shown to make the path of structural evolution in S1 wider and flatter, so the ortho&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibit slower structural transformations from bent to planar and then to twisted forms, yielding intrinsic triple emission. The results provide the proof of concept that the bent, planar, and twisted emissive states can coexist in the same S1 PES, which greatly expand the fundamental understanding of the excited&#8208;state structural relaxation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral diarylmethylamines (DAMA) are important structural motifs widely present in pharmaceuticals, natural products, and chiral ligands. Herein, we reported a highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral DAMAs via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8208;H alkoxylation strategy. The reaction features easy operation, the use of earth&#8208;abundant and cost&#8208;efficient cobalt(II) catalyst, and readily available ligand. A range of chiral DAMAs were efficiently synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90% yield and up to 99% ee) through desymmetrization and parallel kinetic resolution. Moreover, this protocol was also compatible with the synthesis of chiral benzylamines via kinetic resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Connecting Ruthenium Photocatalysis to 1,2&#8208;Dioxetane&#8208;Mediated Chemiluminescence: a Versatile Combination for Optical Detection and Read&#8208;Out</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical storage and photon quantification systems based on sensitive photoreactions have numerous applications. Herein, we report a highly efficient photocatalytic reaction, in which ruthenium photoredox catalysis is combined with a 1,2&#8208;dioxetane, from which chemiluminescence can be triggered. In this system, blue light irradiation as optical input enables a defined inverse correlation with base&#8208;triggered, blue light emission as optical output. Comparison of readout by 1H NMR and chemiluminescence, relative to previous optical input, underlines the reliability and usefulness of the ruthenium&#8208;dioxetane system for optical storage, sensing and ruthenium detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Caging of Carboxyl Groups for On&#8208;Demand Protein Activation with Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The caging of amino acid side chains can provide exquisite control of protein function. The first chemical caging of carboxyl groups (Asp and Glu) in enzymic active sites is reported. Caging of a heme propionate in a protein was also feasible by this approach based on esterification with a tuned diazo compound. Decaging is enabled by small&#8208;molecule reagents that elicit a Staudinger reaction or 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition.







Abstract
Tools for on&#8208;demand protein activation enable impactful gain&#8208;of&#8208;function studies in biological settings. Thus far, however, proteins have been chemically caged at primarily Lys, Tyr, and Sec, typically through the genetic encoding of unnatural amino acids. Herein, we report that the preferential reactivity of diazo compounds with protonated acids can be used to expand this toolbox to solvent&#8208;accessible carboxyl groups with an elevated pKa value. As a model protein, we employed lysozyme (Lyz), which has an active&#8208;site Glu35 residue with a pKa value of 6.2. A diazo compound with a bioorthogonal self&#8208;immolative handle esterified Glu35 selectively, inactivating Lyz. The hydrolytic activity of the caged Lyz on bacterial cell walls was restored with two small&#8208;molecule triggers. The decaging was more efficient by small molecules than by esterases. This simple chemical strategy was also applied to a hemeprotein and an aspartyl protease, setting the stage for broad applicability.

         <title>A Caged In&#8208;Source Laser&#8208;Cleavable MALDI Matrix with High Vacuum Stability for Extended MALDI&#8208;MS Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel vacuum&#8208;stable&#8208;by&#8208;design MALDI matrix enables long MALDI MS imaging measurements of at least 72&#8197;hours. Using a photo&#8208;removable 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl (DMNB) group, organic synthesis transformed the widely used, but unfortunately very volatile MALDI matrix 2,5&#8208;dihydroxy acetophenone (2,5&#8208;DHAP) into a vacuum&#8208;stable matrix, which can be uncaged by the MALDI laser in the ion source and then perform as the common matrix 2,5&#8208;DHAP.







Abstract
Insufficient vacuum stability of matrix chemicals is a major limitation in matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of large tissue sample cohorts. Here, we designed and synthesized the photo&#8208;cleavable caged molecule 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydroxyacetophenone (DMNB&#8208;2,5&#8208;DHAP) and employed it for lipid MALDI&#8208;MSI of mouse brain tissue sections. DMNB&#8208;2,5&#8208;DHAP is vacuum&#8208;stable in a high vacuum MALDI ion source for at least 72&#8197;h. Investigation of the uncaging process suggested that the built&#8208;in laser (355&#8197;nm) in the MALDI ion source promoted the in situ generation of 2,5&#8208;DHAP. A caging group is used for the first time in designing a MALDI matrix that is vacuum&#8208;stable, uncaged upon laser irradiation during the measurement process, and that boosts lipid ion intensity with MALDI&#8208;2 laser&#8208;induced postionization.

         <dc:description>
Nanoporous block copolymer membranes functionalized with a polyoxometalate water oxidation catalyst (POM&#8208;WOC) and a light&#8208;absorbing ruthenium complex were probed and characterized using operando scanning electrochemical microscopy, ex situ spatially resolved micro&#8208;X&#8208;ray fluorescence spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Molecular scale information was obtained about the spatial distribution and catalytic performance of the membrane.







Abstract
Heterogeneous light&#8208;driven catalysis is a cornerstone of sustainable energy conversion. Most catalytic studies focus on bulk analyses of the hydrogen and oxygen evolved, which impede the correlation of matrix heterogeneities, molecular features, and bulk reactivity. Here, we report studies of a heterogenized catalyst/photosensitizer system using a polyoxometalate water oxidation catalyst and a model, molecular photosensitizer that were co&#8208;immobilized within a nanoporous block copolymer membrane. Via operando scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), light&#8208;induced oxygen evolution was determined using sodium peroxodisulfate (Na2S2O8) as sacrificial electron acceptor. Ex situ element analyses provided spatially resolved information on the local concentration and distribution of the molecular components. Infrared attenuated total reflection (IR&#8208;ATR) studies of the modified membranes showed no degradation of the water oxidation catalyst under the reported light&#8208;driven conditions.

         <title>Dimensional Reduction of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Cryopreservation of Red Blood Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimensional reduction strategy in which 3D metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are gradually reduced to 2D ultra&#8208;thin, flexible metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs), has been proposed to facilitate their cryopreservation applications. The 2D MOLs displayed superior ice crystal growth inhibition for the enhanced interfacial interaction through structural deformation/stretching and increased inner ordered structures utilization efficiency.







Abstract
To increase the red blood cell (RBC) cryopreservation efficiency by metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), a dimensional reduction approach has been proposed. Namely, 3D MOF nanoparticles are progressively reduced to 2D ultra&#8208;thin metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs). We found that 2D MOLs are beneficial for enhanced interactions of the interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bonded water network and increased utilization of inner ordered structures, due to the higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio. Specifically, a series of hafnium (Hf)&#8208;based 2D MOLs with different thicknesses (monolayer to stacked multilayers) and densities of hydrogen bonding sites have been synthesized. Both ice recrystallization inhibition activity (IRI) and RBCs cryopreservation assay confirm the pronounced better IRI activity and excellent cell recovery efficiency (up to &#8776;63&#8201;% at a very low concentration of 0.7&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1) of thin&#8208;layered Hf&#8208;MOLs compared to their 3D counterparts, thereby verifying the dimensional reduction strategy to improved cryoprotectant behaviors.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Atom Support Boosts Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Urea Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a novel interface chemistry manipulation strategy to trigger the occurrence of urea oxidation reaction (UOR) before the self&#8208;oxidation reaction of Ni species (NSOR) by constructing a novel 2D/2D heterostructure composed of NiO anchored Ru&#8722;Co dual&#8208;atom support (Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO). Operando spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical studies verify the thermodynamically favorable process of UOR on the Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;based catalysts have been regarded as one of the most promising electrocatalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), however, their activity is largely limited by the inevitable self&#8208;oxidation reaction of Ni species (NSOR) during the UOR. Here, we proposed an interface chemistry modulation strategy to trigger the occurrence of UOR before the NSOR via constructing a 2D/2D heterostructure that consists of ultrathin NiO anchored Ru&#8722;Co dual&#8208;atom support (Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO). Operando spectroscopic characterizations confirm this unique triggering mechanism on the surface of Ru&#8208;Co DAS/NiO. Consequently, the fabricated catalyst exhibits outstanding UOR activity with a low potential of 1.288&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable long&#8208;term durability for more than 330&#8197;h operation. DFT calculations and spectroscopic characterizations demonstrate that the favorable electronic structure induced by this unique heterointerface endows the catalyst energetically more favorable for the UOR than the NSOR.

         <title>A Dissipative Reaction Network Drives Transient Solid&#8211;Liquid and Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Cycling of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent nanoparticles have been dispersed in water under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions by coupling to a dissipative reaction network that consumes a fuel at a controlled rate. The transient dispersed state enables autonomous solid&#8211;liquid or liquid&#8211;liquid back&#8211;and&#8211;forth phase cycling of gold nanoparticles on a timescale that is easily adjusted by changing the pH value.







Abstract
Transient states maintained by energy dissipation are an essential feature of dynamic systems where structures and functions are regulated by fluxes of energy and matter through chemical reaction networks. Perfected in biology, chemically fueled dissipative networks incorporating nanoscale components allow the unique properties of nanomaterials to be bestowed with spatiotemporal adaptability and chemical responsiveness. We report the transient dispersion of gold nanoparticles in water, powered by dissipation of a chemical fuel. A dispersed state that is generated under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions permits fully reversible solid&#8211;liquid or liquid&#8211;liquid phase transfer. The molecular basis of the out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium process is reversible covalent modification of nanoparticle&#8208;bound ligands by a simple inorganic activator. Activator consumption by a coupled dissipative reaction network leads to autonomous cycling between phases. The out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium lifetime is tunable by adjusting the pH value, and reversible phase cycling is reproducible over several cycles.

         <title>A Remotely Controlled Nanosystem for Spatiotemporally Specific Gene Regulation and Combinational Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR light&#8208;controlled, mitochondrial&#8208;targeted nanosystem can be used for spatiotemporally selective gene regulation and tumor treatment. The system relies on photodynamic effect&#8208;induced translocation of a DNA repair enzyme, which enables spatially&#8208;controlled gene regulation and thus enhanced antitumor effects.







Abstract
The dearth of technologies that allow gene modulation and therapy with high spatiotemporal precision remains a bottleneck in biomedical research and applications. Here we present a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;controlled nanosystem that allows spatiotemporally controlled regulation of gene expression and thus combinational tumor therapy. The nanosystem is built by engineering of an enzyme&#8208;activatable antisense oligonucleotide and further combination with an upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;based photodynamic system and a mitochondria localization signal. The system relies on photodynamic effect&#8208;induced translocation of a DNA repair enzyme from nucleus into mitochondria, which enables spatially selective gene regulation via enzymatic reactions. We demonstrate that the NIR light&#8208;induced mitochondrial photodamage and gene regulation enable enhanced antitumor effect. Our approach may enable the specific gene regulation and tumor treatment with high precision both spatially and temporally.

         <title>Influence of Composition of Nickel&#8208;Iron Nanoparticles for Abiotic CO2 Conversion to Early Prebiotic Organics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under high temperature and pressure, synthetic Ni&#8722;Fe nanoparticles catalyze H2&#8208;dependent CO2 fixation to form the main intermediates of the acetyl&#8208;CoA pathway (e.g., formate, acetate, and pyruvate). The reported chemistry is reminiscent of hydrothermal vents, which yield large amounts of H2 in the presence of transition metals and are implicated in forming the first biochemical pathways through CO2 fixation.







Abstract
Abiotic synthesis of formate and short hydrocarbons takes place in serpentinizing vents where some members of vent microbial communities live on abiotic formate as their main carbon source. To better understand the catalytic properties of Ni&#8722;Fe minerals that naturally exist in hydrothermal vents, we have investigated the ability of synthetic Ni&#8722;Fe based nanoparticular solids to catalyze the H2&#8208;dependent reduction of CO2, the first step required for the beginning of pre&#8208;biotic chemistry. Mono and bimetallic Ni&#8722;Fe nanoparticles with varied Ni&#8208;to&#8208;Fe ratios transform CO2 and H2 into intermediates and products of the acetyl&#8208;coenzyme A pathway&#8212;formate, acetate, and pyruvate&#8212;in mM range under mild hydrothermal conditions. Furthermore, Ni&#8722;Fe catalysts converted CO2 to similar products without molecular H2 by using water as a hydrogen source. Both CO2 chemisorption analysis and post&#8208;reaction characterization of materials indicate that Ni and Fe metals play complementary roles for CO2 fixation.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Stereoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides by Cobalt Catalysis</title>

A ligand&#8208;controlled cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of glycals was developed to access 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides. This method exhibits broad substrate scope and excellent diastereoselectivity under very mild conditions. In addition, unprecedented stereodivergent synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;ribofuranosides was achieved using different chiral bisoxazoline ligands.







Abstract
2&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides represent an important class of carbohydrates that are present in many bioactive molecules. However, owing to the lack of substituents at the C2 position, the stereoselective synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides is highly challenging. Herein, we report a ligand&#8208;controlled stereoselective C&#8208;alkyl glycosylation reaction to access 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;C&#8208;alkyl glycosides from readily available glycals and alkyl halides. This method exhibits broad substrate scope and excellent diastereoselectivity under very mild conditions. In addition, unprecedented stereodivergent synthesis of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;C&#8208;ribofuranosides is achieved using different chiral bisoxazoline ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest that hydrometallation of the glycal with the bisoxazoline&#8208;ligated Co&#8722;H species may be the turnover&#8208;limiting and stereodetermining step of this transformation.

         <title>Supercharged CO2 Photothermal Catalytic Methanation: High Conversion, Rate, and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nickel&#8208;boron nitride photothermal catalyst for enabling the Solar Sabatier process is reported that reduces the energy intensity of the thermo&#8208;catalytic version, yet maintains an amazing Sabatier conversion of 87.68&#8201;%, a reaction rate of 2.03&#8197;mol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, and near 100&#8201;% selectivity under ambient pressure conditions. Together these attributes are considered a prerequisite for scaling the process to a technologically relevant level.







Abstract
To overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic impediments of the Sabatier CO2 methanation reaction, the process must be operated under very high temperature and pressure conditions, to obtain an industrially viable conversion, rate, and selectivity. Herein, we report that these technologically relevant performance metrics have been achieved under much milder conditions using solar rather than thermal energy, where the methanation reaction is enabled by a novel nickel&#8208;boron nitride catalyst. In this regard, an in situ generated HOB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;B surface frustrated Lewis's pair is considered responsible for the high Sabatier conversion 87.68&#8201;%, reaction rate 2.03&#8197;mol&#8201;gNi&#8722;1h&#8722;1, and near 100&#8201;% selectivity, realized under ambient pressure conditions. This discovery bodes well for an opto&#8208;chemical engineering strategy aimed at the development and implementation of a sustainable &#8216;Solar Sabatier&#8217; methanation process.

         <title>Design of Drug Efficacy Guided by Free Energy Simulations of the &#946;2&#8208;Adrenoceptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic targets and numerous approved drugs act by either stimulating or blocking receptor activation. However, the design of ligands that modulate GPCR signaling is challenging. We demonstrate that molecular simulations of GPCRs can be used to predict ligand efficacy and identify potent &#946;2&#8208;adrenoceptor agonists.







Abstract
G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) play important roles in physiological processes and are modulated by drugs that either activate or block signaling. Rational design of the pharmacological efficacy profiles of GPCR ligands could enable the development of more efficient drugs, but is challenging even if high&#8208;resolution receptor structures are available. We performed molecular dynamics simulations of the &#946;2 adrenergic receptor in active and inactive conformations to assess if binding free energy calculations can predict differences in ligand efficacy for closely related compounds. Previously identified ligands were successfully classified into groups with comparable efficacy profiles based on the calculated shift in ligand affinity upon activation. A series of ligands were then predicted and synthesized, leading to the discovery of partial agonists with nanomolar potencies and novel scaffolds. Our results demonstrate that free energy simulations enable design of ligand efficacy and the same approach can be applied to other GPCR drug targets.

         <title>Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Chiral Au13 Clusters Stabilized by Enantiopure Monodentate NHC Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of new enantiopure chiral NHC&#8208;stabilized superatomic gold clusters exhibited an oxygen&#8208;insensitive circularly polarized fluorescence with a record&#8208;setting quantum yield of 61&#8201;% in the solution state.







Abstract
Chiral Au nanoclusters have promising application prospects in chiral sensing, asymmetric catalysis, and chiroptics. However, enantiopure superatomic homogold clusters with crystallographic structures emitting bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remain challenging. In this study, we designed chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), and for the first time enantioselectively synthesized a pair of monovalent cationic superatomic Au13 clusters. This new enantiomeric pair of clusters has a quasi&#8208;C2 symmetric core and exhibited CPL with an unprecedent solution&#8208;state quantum yield (QY) of 61&#8201;% among those of the atomically precise Au nanoclusters. DFT calculations provided insights into the circular dichroism behavior, and revealed the origin of CPL from superatomic Au clusters. This work opens a new avenue for developing novel homochiral nanoclusters using chiral NHC ligands and provides fundamental understanding of the origin of the chiroptics of metal clusters.

However, enantiopure superatomic homogold clusters with crystallographic structures emitting bright circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remain challenging. In this study, we designed chiral N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), and for the first time enantioselectively synthesized a pair of monovalent cationic superatomic Au&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; clusters. This new enantiomeric pair of clusters has a quasi-&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetric core and exhibited CPL with an unprecedent solution-state quantum yield (QY) of 61&#8201;% among those of the atomically precise Au nanoclusters. DFT calculations provided insights into the circular dichroism behavior, and revealed the origin of CPL from superatomic Au clusters. This work opens a new avenue for developing novel homochiral nanoclusters using chiral NHC ligands and provides fundamental understanding of the origin of the chiroptics of metal clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalisation of Graphene Sensor Surfaces for the Specific Detection of Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>

Functionalisation of selective biosensors: The noncovalent functionalisation of graphene with perylene bisimide via the FLaT approach allows for specific coupling with antibodies. The application of the respective antigen results in a concentration dependent change of electrical characteristics, proving selective binding of the small molecule without cross&#8208;sensitivity towards other small molecules.







Abstract
We report on a controllable and specific functionalisation route for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (GFETs) for the recognition of small physiologically active molecules. Key element is the noncovalent functionalisation of the graphene surface with perylene bisimide (PBI) molecules directly on the growth substrate. This Functional Layer Transfer enables the homogeneous self&#8208;assembly of PBI molecules on graphene, onto which antibodies are subsequently immobilised. The sensor surface was characterised by atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and electrical measurements, showing superior performance over conventional functionalisation after transfer. Specific sensing of small molecules was realised by monitoring the electrical property changes of functionalised GFET devices upon the application of methamphetamine and cortisol. The concentration dependent electrical response of our sensors was determined down to a concentration of 300&#8197;ng&#8201;ml&#8722;1 for methamphetamine.

         <title>Decoupling Redox Hopping and Catalysis in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks &#8208;based Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic challenges associated with the multielectron activation in MOF&#8208;based CO2 electrocatalysts can be addressed by decoupling the catalysis from the charge transport. Better performance and desired selectivity can be achieved when the activation potential of the catalysts is matched with the conduction band of the charge&#8208;transporting framework.







Abstract
Traditional MOF e&#8208;CRR, constructed from catalytic linkers, manifest a kinetic bottleneck during their multi&#8208;electron activation. Decoupling catalysis and charge transport can address such issues. Here, we build two MOF/e&#8208;CRR systems, CoPc@NU&#8208;1000 and TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000, by installing cobalt metalated phthalocyanine and tetraphenylporphyrin electrocatalysts within the redox active NU&#8208;1000 MOF. For CoPc@NU&#8208;1000, the e&#8208;CRR responsive CoI/0 potential is close to that of NU&#8208;1000 reduction compared to the TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000. Efficient charge delivery, defined by a higher diffusion (Dhop=4.1&#215;10&#8722;12&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1) and low charge&#8208;transport resistance (
=59.5&#8197;&#937;) in CoPC@NU&#8208;1000 led FECO=80&#8201;%. In contrast, TPP(Co)@NU&#8208;1000 fared a poor FECO=24&#8201;% (Dhop=1.4&#215;10&#8722;12&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 
=91.4&#8197;&#937;). For such a decoupling strategy, careful choice of the host framework is critical in pairing up with the underlying electrochemical properties of the catalysts to facilitate the charge delivery for its activation.

         <title>Do The Twist: Efficient Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Visible Light Polymerization Facilitated by Spin&#8208;Orbit Charge Transfer Inter&#8208;system Crossing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic catalyst enables rapid and efficient production of polymers using low energy visible light by leveraging a unique charge transfer mechanism. This mechanism relies on communication between connected, yet electronically decoupled units, which is facilitated by twisting one unit out of plane. This discovery is anticipated to enable the rapid and energy efficient production of plastics through emergent 3D printing technology.







Abstract
The use of visible light to drive polymerizations with spatiotemporal control offers a mild alternative to contemporary UV&#8208;light&#8208;based production of soft materials. In this spectral region, photoredox catalysis represents the most efficient polymerization method, yet it relies on the use of heavy&#8208;atoms, such as precious metals or toxic halogens. Herein, spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing from boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyads bearing twisted aromatic groups is shown to enable efficient visible light polymerizations in the absence of heavy&#8208;atoms. A &#8776;5&#8211;15&#215; increase in polymerization rate and improved photostability was achieved for twisted BODIPYs relative to controls. Furthermore, monomer polarity had a distinct effect on polymerization rate, which was attributed to charge transfer stabilization based on ultrafast transient absorption and phosphorescence spectroscopies. Finally, rapid and high&#8208;resolution 3D printing with a green LED was demonstrated using the present photosystem.

         <title>Photocatalytic C&#8722;C Cleavage of Methylenecyclobutanes for &#947;,&#948;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes by Strain Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of methylenecyclobutanols was accomplished by C&#8722;C cleavage to release ring strain, selectively affording &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The photocatalyzed reaction proceeds in good yields, and was used for the concise synthesis of the natural product alatanone A.







Abstract
Radical additions onto olefins have surfaced as an increasingly powerful strategy for the synthesis of difunctionalized scaffolds. However, despite of major advances, known approaches continue to be largely limited to two manifolds, namely 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of alkenes and remote difunctionalization via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Herein, we describe a mechanistically distinct approach by photoinduced carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) activation/ring&#8208;opening to access &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from methylenecyclobutanols and sulfonyl chlorides by strain release. Remarkably, the sulfonyl motif on the products was easily removed by another photocatalytic process, which enabled the concise assembly of the natural product alatanone A. The synthetic utility of our approach was reflected by versatile functional group tolerance, ample substrate scope, and scalability. The photocatalysis represents a conceptually distinct alternative to existing approaches for remote 1,4&#8208;diversifications, with a double bond remaining in the thus obtained products.

         <title>A Janus Separator based on Cation Exchange Resin and Fe Nanoparticles&#8208;decorated Single&#8208;wall Carbon Nanotubes with Triply Synergistic Effects for High&#8208;areal Capacity Zn&#8722;I2 Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A Janus separator based on cation exchange resin and Fe nanoparticles&#8208;decorated single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes with triple synergistic effects is exploited to suppress Zn dendrites growth, mitigate polyiodide shuttle effect and facilitate redox kinetics of iodine species. This is reflected in the outstanding cycling stability of symmetrical cells and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn&#8722;I2 battery with a lifespan over 2500&#8197;h and a high&#8208;areal capacity of 3.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Zn&#8722;I2 batteries stand out in the family of aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) due to their low&#8208;cost and immanent safety. However, Zn dendrite growth, polyiodide shuttle effect and sluggish I2 redox kinetics result in dramatically capacity decay of Zn&#8722;I2 batteries. Herein, a Janus separator composed of functional layers on anode/cathode sides is designed to resolve these issues simultaneously. The cathode layer of Fe nanoparticles&#8208;decorated single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes can effectively anchor polyiodide and catalyze the redox kinetics of iodine species, while the anode layer of cation exchange resin rich in &#8722;SO3&#8722; groups is beneficial to attract Zn2+ ions and repel detrimental SO42&#8722;/polyiodide, improving the stability of cathode/anode interfaces synergistically. Consequently, the Janus separator endows outstanding cycling stability of symmetrical cells and high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn&#8722;I2 batteries with a lifespan over 2500&#8197;h and a high&#8208;areal capacity of 3.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization of a Labeled, Cancer&#8208;Targeting DNA Aptamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the unprecedented hyperpolarization of the cancer&#8208;targeting aptamer AS1411 via parahydrogen. For that, we screened for suitable parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) labels, performed solid phase synthesis to incorporate the label into AS1411 and adapted the polarity of DNA via PEGylation to enable efficient, selective hydrogenation in organic solvents without affecting canonical nucleotides.







Abstract
Enhancing NMR signals of biomacromolecules by hyperpolarization offers exciting opportunities for diagnostic applications. However, their hyperpolarization via parahydrogen remains challenging as specific catalytic interactions are required, which are difficult to tune due to the large size of the biomolecule and its insolubility in organic solvents. Herein, we show the unprecedented hyperpolarization of the cancer&#8208;targeting DNA aptamer AS1411. By screening different molecular motifs for an unsaturated label in nucleosides and in DNA oligomers, we were able to identify structural prerequisites for the hyperpolarization of AS1411. Finally, adjusting the polarity of AS1411 by complexing the DNA backbone with amino polyethylene glycol chains allowed the hydrogenation of the label with parahydrogen while the DNA structure remains stable to maintain its biological function. Our results are expected to advance hyperpolarized molecular imaging technology for disease detection in the future.

         <title>Non&#8208;planar Nest&#8208;like [Fe2S2] Cluster Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;planar nest&#8208;like [Fe2S2] cluster sites in N&#8208;doped carbon plane with similar active center atomic composition to ferredoxin achieve efficient O2 adsorption and activation while avoiding too robust adsorption of OH* intermediate, thus realizing excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance beyond planar [FeN4] and [Fe2N6]. This work provides insights into co&#8208;regulation of atomic composition and spatial configuration for efficient ORR catalysis.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts, as promising alternative to platinum&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), are still highly expected to achieve better performance by modulating the composition and spatial structure of active site. Herein, we constructed the non&#8208;planar nest&#8208;like [Fe2S2] cluster sites in N&#8208;doped carbon plane. Adjacent double Fe atoms effectively weaken the O&#8722;O bond by forming a peroxide bridge&#8208;like adsorption configuration, and the introduction of S atoms breaks the planar coordination of Fe resulting in greater structural deformation tension, lower spin state, and downward shifted Fe d&#8208;band center, which together facilitate the release of OH* intermediate. Hence, the non&#8208;planar [Fe2S2] cluster catalyst, with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#8197;V, displays superior ORR activity than that of planar [FeN4] or [Fe2N6]. This work provides insights into the co&#8208;regulation of atomic composition and spatial configuration for efficient oxygen reduction catalysis.

         <title>Aromatic Amides: A Smart Backbone toward Isolated Ultralong Bright Blue&#8208;Phosphorescence in Confined Polymeric Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulation of the triplet excited state by utilizing an aromatic amide skeleton has led to ultralong blue phosphorescence in confined films. Strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling within the aromatic amide as well as hydrogen bonding interactions with polyvinyl alcohol accelerate intersystem crossing and suppress the non&#8208;radiative relaxations, thereby overcoming the dilemma of achieving organic phosphorescence with both high energy and long lifetime.







Abstract
We describe an aromatic amide skeleton for manipulation of triplet excited states toward bright long&#8208;lived blue phosphorescence. Spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the aromatic amides can promote strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling between (&#960;,&#960;*) and the bridged (n,&#960;*) states, and enable multiple channels to populate the emissive 3(&#960;,&#960;*), as well as facilitate robust hydrogen bonding with polyvinyl alcohol to suppress non&#8208;radiative relaxations. Isolated inherent deep&#8208;blue (0.155, 0.056) to sky&#8208;blue (0.175, 0.232) phosphorescence with high quantum yields (up to 34.7&#8201;%) in confined films are achieved. The blue afterglow of the films can last for several seconds and are showcased in information display, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and white light afterglow. Owing to the high population of 3(&#960;,&#960;*) states, the smart aromatic amide skeleton provides an important molecular design prototype to manipulate triplet excited states for ultralong phosphorescence with various colors.

Spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the aromatic amides can promote strong spin-orbit coupling between (&#960;,&#960;*) and the bridged (n,&#960;*) states, and enable multiple channels to populate the emissive &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(&#960;,&#960;*), as well as facilitate robust hydrogen bonding with polyvinyl alcohol to suppress non-radiative relaxations. Isolated inherent deep-blue (0.155, 0.056) to sky-blue (0.175, 0.232) phosphorescence with high quantum yields (up to 34.7&#8201;%) in confined films are achieved. The blue afterglow of the films can last for several seconds and are showcased in information display, anti-counterfeiting, and white light afterglow. Owing to the high population of &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(&#960;,&#960;*) states, the smart aromatic amide skeleton provides an important molecular design prototype to manipulate triplet excited states for ultralong phosphorescence with various colors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Diversification of Complex Bioactive Molecules by Accelerated Synthesis in Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules was achieved using an automated platform based on desorption&#8208;electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry. Accelerated reactions in microdroplets enable the ultrafast synthesis of diversified drug molecules. Over 250&#8197;analogues of bioactive compounds were generated and characterized using nanogram amounts of material in less than 1&#8197;second per reaction.







Abstract
Late&#8208;stage diversification of drug molecules is an important strategy in drug discovery that can be facilitated by reaction screening using high&#8208;throughput experimentation. Here we present a rapid method for functionalizing bioactive molecules based on accelerated reactions in microdroplets. Reaction mixtures are nebulized at throughputs better than 1&#8197;reaction/second and the accelerated reactions occurring in the microdroplets are followed by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI&#8208;MS). Because the accelerated reactions occur on the millisecond timescale, they allow an overall screening throughput of 1&#8197;Hz working at the low nanogram scale. Using this approach, an opioid agonist (PZM21) and an antagonist (naloxone) were diversified using three reactions important in medicinal chemistry: sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click reactions, imine formation reactions, and ene&#8208;type click reactions. Some 269&#8197;functionalized analogs of naloxone and PZM21 were generated and characterized by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) after screening over 500&#8197;reactions.

         <title>Reduction of Platinum(IV) Prodrug Hemoglobin Nanoparticles with Deeply Penetrating Ultrasound Radiation for Tumor&#8208;Targeted Therapeutically Enhanced Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective activation of PtIV prodrugs upon irradiation is receiving much interest. The majority of PtIV complexes are excited with ultraviolet or blue light, limiting the use of such compounds to superficial application. To overcome this limitation, herein, the first example of PtIV prodrug nanoparticles that could be reduced with deeply penetrating ultrasound radiation is reported, enabling the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors.







Abstract
The development of PtIV prodrugs that are reduced into the therapeutically active PtII species within the tumor microenvironment has received much research interest. In order to provide spatial and temporal control over the treatment, there is a high demand for the development of compounds that could be selectively activated upon irradiation. Despite recent progress, the majority of PtIV complexes are excited with ultraviolet or blue light, limiting the use of such compounds to superficial application. To overcome this limitation, herein, the first example of PtIV prodrug nanoparticles that could be reduced with deeply penetrating ultrasound radiation is reported, enabling the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors. The nanoparticles were found to selectively accumulate inside a mouse colon carcinoma tumor upon intravenous injection and were able to eradicate the tumor upon exposure to ultrasound radiation.

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of Monometallic C^C* Platinum(II) Formamidinate Complexes using Sterically Demanding Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following a concise quantum chemical screening, sterically demanding amidinate ligands were employed in the synthesis of monometallic C^C* cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes. This new class of photoluminescent platinum(II) complexes features a hypsochromic shift of the emission wavelength of up to 137&#8197;nm in comparison to their bimetallic counterparts explained by the loss of metallophilic interactions.







Abstract
A novel class of cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes&#8212;previously considered to be inaccessible&#8212;was synthesized by an improved synthetic route utilizing ligands predicted by density functional theory calculations. Based on a concise quantum chemical screening three model ligands with varying steric demand were chosen and a series of six photoluminescent C^C* cyclometalated platinum(II) formamidinate complexes was obtained. The least sterically demanding ligand led to a bimetallic complex in two isomeric forms, which could be separated and confirmed by the corresponding solid&#8208;state structures. Sterically more hindered amidinate ligands gave the monometallic complexes supporting the theoretical predictions. The monometallic complexes show a significant hypsochromic shift of the emission wavelength, explained by the loss of the metal&#8208;metal interactions. Depending on the cyclometalating ligand quantum yields up to 87&#8201;% with short decay times were found for this new class of phosphorescent green&#8208;blue to pure blue platinum(II) emitters.

         <title>Entropic Contributions to Sodium Solvation and Solvent Stabilization upon Electrochemical Sodium Deposition from Diglyme and Propylene Carbonate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entropic contributions to the free enthalpy may significantly influence the equilibrium potential of an electrode in a battery system. By microcalorimetric measurements of Na deposition from a diglyme solution, we show that solvation entropy destabilizes the Na+ in solution by about 0.7&#8197;eV, thus strongly increasing the stability of the electrolyte solution upon Na deposition and affecting the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase.







Abstract
The formation of an appropriate solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the anode of a sodium battery is crucially dependent on the electrochemical stability of solvent and electrolyte at the redox potential of Na/Na+ in the respective system. In order to determine entropic contributions to the relative stability of the electrolyte solution, we measure the reaction entropy of Na metal deposition for diglyme (DG) and propylene carbonate (PC) based electrolyte solutions by electrochemical microcalorimetry at single electrodes. We found a large positive reaction entropy for Na+ deposition in DG of &#916;R
234&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 (c.f.: &#916;R
83&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1), which signals substantial entropic destabilization of Na+ in DG by about 0.73&#8197;eV, thus increasing the stability of solvent and electrolyte relative to Na+ reduction. We attribute this strong entropic destabilization to a highly negative solvation entropy of Na+, due to the low dielectric constant and high freezing entropy of DG.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Optophysiology Platform for Recording Intracellular and Extracellular Signals across the Brain of Free&#8208;Moving Animals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;density intra/extracellular optophysiology platform was created for simultaneously quantifying intracellular L&#8208;cysteine (Cys) and extracellular dopamine (DA), and recording electrophysiological signals in the brain of free&#8208;moving mice. Using our powerful tool, we found that Cys regulated DA by facilitating the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase. Molecular networks involving Cys and DA were significantly affected in the depressed mice and recovered by the treatment with N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;cysteine.







Abstract
Developing a novel tool capable of real&#8208;time monitoring and simultaneously quantifying of both intra/extracellular chemical signals across the large&#8208;scale brain is the key bottleneck for understanding the interactions between the molecules inside and outside neurons. Here we built up a high&#8208;density intra/extracellular optophysiology platform, together with developing two probes for specific recognition of L&#8208;cysteine (Cys) and dopamine (DA), for simultaneously quantifying of both intracellular Cys and extracellular DA with high selectivity and accuracy across the brain of freely moving animals, as well as recording electrical signals. Using this powerful tool, it was found that intracellular Cys regulated extracellular DA through inducing the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the depressed mice brain. We also established the functional networks of Cys and DA across 32 brain regions in freely moving animals. More importantly, it was discovered that depression reduced the correlations between adjacent brain regions, which was recovered by the treatment of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine.

         <title>Synergy of Cu/C3N4 Interface and Cu Nanoparticles Dual Catalytic Regions in Electrolysis of CO to Acetic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalyst composed of Cu nanoparticles and g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets (Cu&#8722;CN) is reported, which could efficiently covert CO into acetate with a Faradaic efficiency of 62.8&#8201;% in a flow cell and acetic acid continuously in a porous solid electrolyte reactor. In situ experiments and density functional theory studies reveal the synergy between dual catalytic regions: Cu/C3N4 interface enhances the generation and coverage of *CHO from CO, and Cu NPs facilitate the acetic acid (acetate) generation from migrated *CHO.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction reaction of carbon monoxide (CORR) offers a promising way to manufacture acetic acid directly from gaseous CO and water at mild condition. Herein, we discovered that the graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) supported Cu nanoparticles (Cu&#8722;CN) with the appropriate size showed a high acetate faradaic efficiency of 62.8&#8201;% with a partial current density of 188&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in CORR. In situ experimental and density functional theory calculation studies revealed that the Cu/C3N4 interface and metallic Cu surface synergistically promoted CORR into acetic acid. The generation of pivotal intermediate &#8722;*CHO is advantage around the Cu/C3N4 interface and migrated *CHO facilitates acetic acid generation on metallic Cu surface with promoted *CHO coverage. Moreover, continuous production of acetic acid aqueous solution was achieved in a porous solid electrolyte reactor, indicating the great potential of Cu&#8722;CN catalyst in the industrial application.

         <title>Harnessing the Structure and Dynamics of the Squalene&#8208;Hopene Cyclase for (&#8722;)&#8208;Ambroxide Production
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergy in engineering the active site and entrance tunnel of squalene&#8208;hopene cyclase is demonstrated in the archetypal promiscuous cyclization of (E,E)&#8208;homofarnesol towards high&#8208;value (&#8722;)&#8208;ambroxide. Moreover, the long&#8208;term stability of the enzyme in vivo was exploited in a feeding strategy to demonstrate high cyclization performance.







Abstract
Terpene cyclases offer enormous synthetic potential, given their unique ability to forge complex hydrocarbon scaffolds from achiral precursors within a single cationic rearrangement cascade. Harnessing their synthetic power, however, has proved to be challenging owing to their generally low catalytic performance. In this study, we unveiled the catalytic potential of the squalene&#8208;hopene cyclase (SHC) by harnessing its structure and dynamics. First, we synergistically tailored the active site and entrance tunnel of the enzyme to generate a 397&#8208;fold improved (&#8722;)&#8208;ambroxide synthase. Our computational investigations explain how the introduced mutations work in concert to improve substrate acquisition, flow, and chaperoning. Kinetics, however, showed terpene&#8208;induced inactivation of the membrane&#8208;bound SHC to be the major turnover limitation in vivo. Merging this insight with the improved and stereoselective catalysis of the enzyme, we applied a feeding strategy to exceed 105 total turnovers. We believe that our results may bridge the gap for broader application of SHCs in synthetic chemistry.

Exfoliated laminar iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based polymer (PFePc) nanosheets covalently and longitudinally linked to graphene (3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc) are designed as noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free candidates for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

Abstract
Iron phthalocyanine&#8208;based polymers (PFePc) are attractive noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free candidates for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the low site&#8208;exposure degree and poor electrical conductivity of bulk PFePc restricted their practical applications. Herein, laminar PFePc nanosheets covalently and longitudinally linked to graphene (3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc) was prepared. Such structural engineering qualifies 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc with high site utilization and rapid mass transfer. Thence, 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc demonstrates efficient ORR performance with a high specific activity of 69.31&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a high mass activity of 81.88&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and a high turnover frequency of 0.93&#8197;e&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;site&#8722;1 at 0.90&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in O2&#8208;saturated 0.1&#8197;M KOH, outperforming the lamellar PFePc wrapped graphene counterpart. Systematic electrochemical analyses integrating variable&#8208;frequency square wave voltammetry and in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy further underline the rapid kinetics of 3D&#8208;G&#8208;PFePc towards ORR.

Bright multicolor electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with high device performance are prepared by adoping triphenylamine&#8208;derived solid&#8208;state emissive carbon dots (CDs) as single emissive layer.







Abstract
Two kinds of triphenylamine&#8208;derived solid&#8208;state emissive carbon dots (CDs) with orange and yellow color are facilely synthesized through solvothermal treatment, taking advantage of the nonplanar structure and good carrier mobility of triphenylamine unit. Theoretical calculations show that the triphenylamine structure could greatly inhibit the direct &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of aromatic skeletons and enhance the fluorescence properties of CDs in aggregation state. By adopting the CDs as single emissive layer, high&#8208;performance orange&#8208;color and green&#8208;color electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are successfully fabricated, with maximum brightness of 9450/4236&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, high current efficiency of 1.57/2.34&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and low turn&#8208;on voltage of 3.1/3.6&#8197;eV are respectively achieved. Significantly, white&#8208;color LED device is further prepared. This work provides a universal platform for the construction of novel solid&#8208;state emissive CDs with significant applications in photoelectric device.

By adopting the CDs as single emissive layer, high-performance orange-color and green-color electroluminescent light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are successfully fabricated, with maximum brightness of 9450/4236&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, high current efficiency of 1.57/2.34&#8197;cd&#8201;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and low turn-on voltage of 3.1/3.6&#8197;eV are respectively achieved. Significantly, white-color LED device is further prepared. This work provides a universal platform for the construction of novel solid-state emissive CDs with significant applications in photoelectric device.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reducing Overpotential of Solid&#8208;State Sulfide Conversion in Potassium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve a superior potassium&#8208;sulfur battery performance, we elucidate the solid&#8208;state K2S3&#8722;K2S conversion pathway via meta&#8208;stable intermediates on a range of transition metal single&#8208;atom catalytic sulfur hosts. It is demonstrated that the host with Cu single atom exhibits a relatively weak Cu&#8208;S bonding, resulting in low overpotential of K2S3&#8722;K2S conversion. The resultant catalytic sulfur host demonstrates high discharge capacities of 1595 and 1226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 335 and 1675&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Improving kinetics of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion in sulfur cathodes can enhance sulfur utilization of metal&#8208;sulfur batteries. However, fundamental understanding of the solid&#8208;state conversion remains to be achieved. Here, taking potassium&#8208;sulfur batteries as a model system, we for the first time report the reducing overpotential of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion via the meta&#8208;stable S32&#8722; intermediates on transition metal single&#8208;atom sulfur hosts. The catalytic sulfur host containing Cu single atoms demonstrates high capacities of 1595 and 1226&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at current densities of 335 and 1675&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, with stable Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;100&#8201;%. Combined spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical computations reveal that the relatively weak Cu&#8208;S bonding results in low overpotential of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion and high sulfur utilization. The elucidation of solid&#8208;state sulfide conversion mechanism can direct the exploration of highly efficient metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Photoelectromagnetic Responsive Adaptive Porous Frameworks through Dynamic Covalent Chemistry of Tetraarylethylene&#8208;backboned Aryldicyanomethyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrocyclic trimer&#8208;based dynamic framework with a complex 3D channel network has been constructed through reversible dynamic covalent linking of tetraarylethylene&#8208;backboned aryl dicyanomethyl radical building blocks. Due to the conformational dynamics and radical&#8208;mediated reaction dynamics, the system shows macroscopic responsiveness in terms of light absorption, photoluminescence, and magnetic properties.







Abstract
Dynamic materials undergoing adaptive solid&#8208;state transitions are attractive for soft mechanics and information technology. Here, we report a novel porous framework system based on macrocyclic trimers assembled from open&#8208;shell tetraarylethylene building blocks with aryldicyanomethyl radicals as coupling linkers. Under mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimuli, the framework showed adaptability by activating conformational dynamics and radical&#8208;based transformations, thus displaying macroscopic responsiveness in terms of light absorption, luminescence, and magnetism. We studied the dynamic processes by variable&#8208;temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (VT&#8208;NMR), variable&#8208;temperature electron spin resonance (VT&#8208;ESR), and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurement and further established a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application for multi&#8208;modal information encryption. The strategy may open avenues for rational design of solid&#8208;state photoelectromagnetic dynamic materials by merging dynamic covalent coupling chemistry and functional aggregation principles.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;promoted Electrocatalytic Graphitization of Biochars for Energy Storage: Mechanistic Understanding using Multi&#8208;scale Approaches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a catalytic process of nickel&#8208;promoted electrochemical graphitization in molten calcium chloride. Multi&#8208;scale approach from atomic reactions to macroscale cells is useful in understanding the mechanism of evolution in the electrolytic cell, the kinetics of electrochemical reactions and the pathways of nickel&#8208;promoted graphitization and tubularization.







Abstract
Owing to high&#8208;efficiency and scalable advantages of electrolysis in molten salts, electrochemical conversion of carbonaceous resources into graphitic products is a sustainable route for achieving high value&#8208;added carbon. To understand the complicated kinetics of converting amorphous carbon (e.g. carbonized lignin&#8208;biochar) into highly graphitic carbon, herein this study reports the key processing parameters (addition of Ni, temperature and time) and multi&#8208;scale approach of nickel&#8208;boosted electrochemical graphitization&#8208;catalysis processes in molten calcium chloride. Upon both experiments and modellings, multi&#8208;scale analysis that ranges from nanoscale atomic reaction to macroscale cell reveal the multi&#8208;field evolution in the electrolysis cell, mechanism of electrochemical reaction kinetics as well as pathway of nickel&#8208;boosted graphitization and tubulization. The results of as&#8208;achieved controllable processing regions and multi&#8208;scale approaches provide a rational strategy of manipulating electrochemical graphitization processes and utilizing the converted biomass resources for high value&#8208;added use.

         <title>Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Electroluminescence from Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Perovskite Quantum Cutters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We doped yitterbium ions into perovskite nanocrystal hosts for extending their electroluminescence wavelength towards 1000&#8197;nm. The synergy of halide&#8208;stoichiometry control and surface passivation enables us to achieve an efficient near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diode with a peak external quantum efficiency of 7.7&#8201;%, representing the highest efficiency among organic LEDs and perovskite LEDs with peak wavelengths beyond 850&#8197;nm to date.







Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) deliver size&#8208; and composition&#8208;tunable luminescence of high efficiency and color purity in the visible range. However, attaining efficient electroluminescence (EL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region from PeNCs is challenging, limiting their potential applications. Here we demonstrate a highly efficient NIR light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) by doping ytterbium ions into a PeNCs host (Yb3+&#8201;:&#8201;PeNCs), extending the EL wavelengths toward 1000&#8197;nm, which is achieved through a direct sensitization of Yb3+ ions by the PeNC host. Efficient quantum&#8208;cutting processes enable high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 126&#8201;% from the Yb3+&#8201;:&#8201;PeNCs. Through halide&#8208;composition engineering and surface passivation to improve both PLQY and charge&#8208;transport balance, we demonstrate an efficient NIR LED with a peak external quantum efficiency of 7.7&#8201;% at a central wavelength of 990&#8197;nm, representing the most efficient perovskite&#8208;based LEDs with emission wavelengths beyond 850&#8197;nm.

         <title>Close&#8208;Shell Reductive Elimination versus Open&#8208;Shell Radical Coupling for Site&#8208;Selective Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activations by Computation and Experiments</title>

The origins of site&#8208;selectivity for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation and arylation have been illuminated by means of density functional theory calculations. The competition between close&#8208;shell reductive elimination and open&#8208;shell radical attack is responsible for the ortho&#8208; versus meta&#8208;selectivity, for which a multi&#8208;linear regression model, predicting the site&#8208;selection, was devised and tested experimentally.







Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed &#963;&#8208;bond activation&#8208;assisted meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization has emerged as a useful tool to forge distal C&#8722;C bonds. However, given the limited number of mechanistic studies, a clear understanding of the origin of the site&#8208;selectivity and the complete reaction pattern is not available. Here, we present systematic computational studies on ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization with primary, secondary, tertiary alkyl bromides and aryl bromides. The C&#8722;H scission and the C&#8722;C formation were carefully examined. Monocyclometalated ruthenium(II) complexes were identified as the active species, which then underwent inner&#8208;sphere single electron transfer (ISET) to activate the organic bromides. The site&#8208;selectivity results from the competition between the close&#8208;shell reductive elimination and the open&#8208;shell radical coupling. Based on this mechanistic understanding, a multilinear regression model was built to predict the site&#8208;selectivity, which was further validated by experiments.

         <title>Ene Reductase Enabled Intramolecular &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H Functionalization of Substituted Cyclohexanones for Efficient Synthesis of Bridged Bicyclic Nitrogen Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization reaction that is enabled by ene reductases is reported. When the reaction is coupled with photocatalysis, various 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan&#8208;3&#8208;ones can be synthesized in a straightforward manner from readily available cyclohexenones and N&#8208;phenylglycines. This chemoenzymatic reaction can be carried out on a gram scale, and the product can be further selectively derivatized.







Abstract
Herein we report that ene reductases (EREDs) can facilitate an unprecedented intramolecular &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization reaction for the synthesis of bridged bicyclic nitrogen heterocycles containing the 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold. To streamline the synthesis of these privileged motifs, we developed a gram&#8208;scale one&#8208;pot chemoenzymatic cascade by combining iridium photocatalysis with EREDs, using readily available N&#8208;phenylglycines and cyclohexenones that can be obtained from biomass. Further derivatization using enzymatic or chemical methods can convert 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan&#8208;3&#8208;one into 6&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan&#8208;3&#945;&#8208;ols, which can be potentially utilized for the synthesis of azaprophen and its analogues for drug discovery. Mechanistic studies revealed the reaction requires oxygen, presumably to produce oxidized flavin, which can selectively dehydrogenate the 3&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone derivatives to form the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone, which subsequently undergoes spontaneous intramolecular aza&#8208;Michael addition under basic conditions.

Pillar[5]arene derivatives with perylene diimide tethers have been shown to form aggregates in nonpolar organic solvents that undergo a central&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer on complexation with a cationic amino acid ethyl ester. The chiral transfer only occurs when the chiral inducer exceeds a threshold concentration, with significant gabs values of up to 3.67&#215;10&#8722;2 observed.







Abstract
Perylene diimide tethered pillar[5]arene derivatives form aggregates in non&#8208;polar organic solvents, and the complexation of cationic amino acid ethyl ester (cAA&#8208;OEt) with the aggregates induce a central&#8208;to&#8208;planar&#8208;to&#8208;helical chirality transfer, leading to intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals having dissymmetric factors (gabs) of up to 3.67&#215;10&#8722;2. The hierarchical chiral induction exhibited an intriguing threshold dose effect, namely, the chiral induction does not occur in the low concentration range of cAA&#8208;OEt but is triggered when cAA&#8208;OEt exceeds a threshold concentration. The inhibited interconversion between the Rp and Sp conformers of pillar[5]arene, which is further restricted in the aggregation, plays a crucial role in the threshold effect. When adding enantiopure cAA&#8208;OEt first to the threshold concentration and then adding an equal amount of the antipodal cAA&#8208;OEt to give cAA&#8208;OEt in racemic form, CD spectra having the same sign as the CD induced by first adding pure cAA&#8208;OEt were induced, thus showing an unprecedented &#8220;first come, first served&#8221; effect.

         <title>Iron&#8208;siRNA Nanohybrids for Enhanced Chemodynamic Therapy via Ferritin Heavy Chain Downregulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;reinforcing chemodynamic therapy (CDT) agent based on siRNA&#8208;embedded iron nanoparticles (Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs) is reported. The degradation of Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs to Fe2+ and siRNA occurs in acidic endo/lysosomes and is promoted by oxygen depletion&#8208;caused intracellular pH decrease. In addition to initiating CDT, Fe2+&#8208;catalyzed &#8901;OH generation facilitates endo/lysosomal escape of ferritin heavy chain (FHC) siRNA, enabling FHC downregulation&#8208;enhanced CDT.







Abstract
Ferrous iron (Fe2+) has more potent hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH)&#8208;generating ability than other Fenton&#8208;type metal ions, making Fe&#8208;based nanomaterials attractive for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). However, because Fe2+ can be converted by ferritin heavy chain (FHC) to nontoxic ferric form and then sequestered in ferritin, therapeutic outcomes of Fe&#8208;mediated CDT agents are still far from satisfactory. Here we report the synthesis of siRNA&#8208;embedded Fe0 nanoparticles (Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs) for self&#8208;reinforcing CDT via FHC downregulation. Upon internalization by cancer cells, pH&#8208;responsive Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs are degraded to release Fe2+ and FHC siRNA in acidic endo/lysosomes with the aid of oxygen (O2). The accompanied O2 depletion causes an intracellular pH decrease, which further promotes the degradation of Fe0&#8208;siRNA NPs. In addition to initiating chemodynamic process, Fe2+&#8208;catalyzed &#8901;OH generation facilitates endo/lysosomal escape of siRNA by disrupting the membranes, enabling FHC downregulation&#8208;enhanced CDT.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Triggered Chemodynamic Therapy via a Peptide&#8208;H2S Donor Conjugate with Complexed Fe2+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>

By combining an enzyme&#8208;triggered hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor with the Fenton reaction promoter Fe2+, we developed a peptide&#8208;H2S donor conjugate&#8208;Fe2+ complex that increased levels of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species in C6 cancer cells, providing an H2S&#8208;amplified, enzyme&#8208;responsive system for precise cancer treatment.







Abstract
Inducing high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside tumor cells is a cancer therapy method termed chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Relying on delivery of Fenton reaction promoters such as Fe2+, CDT takes advantage of overproduced ROS in the tumor microenvironment. We developed a peptide&#8208;H2S donor conjugate, complexed with Fe2+, termed AAN&#8208;PTC&#8211;Fe2+. The AAN tripeptide was specifically cleaved by legumain, an enzyme overexpressed in glioma cells, to release carbonyl sulfide (COS). Hydrolysis of COS by carbonic anhydrase formed H2S, an inhibitor of catalase, an enzyme that detoxifies H2O2. Fe2+ and H2S together increased intracellular ROS levels and decreased viability in C6 glioma cells compared with controls lacking either Fe2+, the AAN sequence, or the ability to generate H2S. AAN&#8208;PTC&#8211;Fe2+ performed better than temezolimide while exhibiting no cytotoxicity toward H9C2 cardiomyocytes. This study provides an H2S&#8208;amplified, enzyme&#8208;responsive platform for synergistic cancer treatment.

A manganese&#8208;coordinated polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based biocatalyst (Mn&#8722;PcBC) with axial Mn&#8722;N5 sites and 2D d&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated networks was synthesized. Owing to the unique chemical and electronic structures, Mn&#8722;PcBC displays efficient, multifaceted, and robust ROS&#8208;scavenging activity and offers promise as an artificial antioxidase for stem&#8208;cell therapeutics and the treatment of other ROS&#8208;related diseases.







Abstract
Constructing highly effective biocatalysts with controllable coordination geometry for eliminating reactive oxygen species (ROS) to address the current bottlenecks in stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based therapeutics remains challenging. Herein, inspired by the coordination structure of manganese&#8208;based antioxidase, we report a manganese&#8208;coordinated polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based biocatalyst (Mn&#8722;PcBC) with axial Mn&#8722;N5 sites and 2D d&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated networks that serves as an artificial antioxidase to rescue stem cell fate. Owing to the unique chemical and electronic structures, Mn&#8722;PcBC displays efficient, multifaceted, and robust ROS&#8208;scavenging activities, including elimination of H2O2 and O2&#8901;&#8722;. Consequently, Mn&#8722;PcBC efficiently rescues the bioactivity and functionality of stem cells in high&#8208;ROS&#8208;level microenvironments by protecting the transcription of osteogenesis&#8208;related genes. This study offers essential insight into the crucial functions of axially coordinated Mn&#8722;N5 sites in ROS scavenging and suggests new strategies to create efficient artificial antioxidases for stem&#8208;cell therapies.

         <title>Self&#8208;Driven Prenucleation&#8208;Induced Perovskite Crystallization Enables Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;driven prenucleation strategy is proposed with formamide as a double&#8208;face solvent to accelerate the nucleation of formamidine/cesium&#8208;based perovskites. The preferentially precipitated PbI2&#8208;DMSO crystals by formamide act as nucleation seeds to accelerate the nucleation process. The crystalline quality of the prepared perovskite film is significantly improved. The efficiency of hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells exceeds 19&#8201;%.







Abstract
Perovskite film with high crystal quality is fundamental to achieving high&#8208;performance solar cells. A fast nucleation process is crucial to improving the crystallization quality. Here, we propose a self&#8208;driven prenucleation strategy to achieve fast nucleation. This is realized through rational solvent design. The key characteristics of different solvents are systematically evaluated. Among them, formamide, with ultra&#8208;high dielectric constant, low Gutman donor number, and a high boiling point, is selected as the co&#8208;solvent. These unique characteristics render formamide a double&#8208;face solvent that is a good solvent for formamidinium iodide (FAI) and CsI while a poor solvent for PbI2. As a result, formamide induces the self&#8208;driven prenucleation of PbI2&#8208;DMSO seeding crystals and accelerates the nucleation, improving the crystalline quality of perovskite film. The efficiency of the hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells is boosted beyond 19&#8201;% for the first time.

Charged COF nanosheets are used as nuclei&#8208;deposition substrate (NDS) to generate MOF@COF nanosheet seeds, which enables the fabrication of ultrathin, defect&#8208;free MOF membranes by secondary growth.







Abstract
We report a covalent organic framework (COF) induced seeding strategy to fabricate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes. Contrary to graphene oxide nuclei&#8208;depositing substrate, COF substrate has uniform pore size, high microporosity and abundant functional groups. We designed a series of charged COF nanosheets to induce the formation of ZIF&#8208;8@COF nanosheet seeds with high aspect ratio over 150, which were readily processed into a compact and uniform seed layer. The resulting ZIF&#8208;8 membranes with thickness down to 100&#8197;nm exhibit an ultrahigh C3H6/C3H8 separation performance and superior long&#8208;term stability. Our strategy is also validated by fabricating ultrathin ZIF&#8208;67 and UiO&#8208;66 membranes.

         <title>Highly Stable Triangular Single&#8208;Layer 2D Assemblies: Synthesis and Their Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Elastic and Anisotropic Curling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stable single&#8208;layer 2D assemblies of AuI&#8208;thiolate, with both long&#8208;range molecular order and a uniform triangular morphology, have been synthesized, and their elastic and anisotropic curling upon external stimuli has been achieved on single&#8208;assembly level.







Abstract
Synthesis of highly stable two&#8208;dimensional single&#8208;layer assemblies (SLAs) is a key challenge in supramolecular science, especially those with long&#8208;range molecular order and well&#8208;defined morphology. Here, thin (thickness &lt;2&#8197;nm) triangular AuI&#8208;thiolate SLAs with high thermo&#8208;, solvato&#8208; and mechano&#8208; stability have been synthesized via a double&#8208;ligand co&#8208;assembly strategy. Furthermore, the SLAs show assembly&#8208;level elastic and anisotropic deformation responses to external stimuli as a result of the long&#8208;range anisotropic molecular packing, which provides SLAs with new application potentials in bio&#8208;mimic nanomechanics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthesis of highly stable two-dimensional single-layer assemblies (SLAs) is a key challenge in supramolecular science, especially those with long-range molecular order and well-defined morphology. Here, thin (thickness &amp;lt;2&#8197;nm) triangular Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-thiolate SLAs with high thermo-, solvato- and mechano- stability have been synthesized via a double-ligand co-assembly strategy. Furthermore, the SLAs show assembly-level elastic and anisotropic deformation responses to external stimuli as a result of the long-range anisotropic molecular packing, which provides SLAs with new application potentials in bio-mimic nanomechanics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Biomimetic Dimerization of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives catalyzed by an iron octacarboxy phthalocyanine complex was established in aqueous media with oxygen as a bulk oxidant. This protocol allows the dimerization of a wide range of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides with remarkable functional&#8208;group tolerance to construct natural and unnatural pyrroloindole dimers and dimerized peptides with a unique scaffold linking two turn structures.







Abstract
Biomimetic oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives in aqueous media with oxygen as a bulk oxidant catalyzed by an iron octacarboxy phthalocyanine complex was established. The discovery of the extremely active iron catalyst enables aerobic enzyme&#8208;mimetic oxidation to be performed in a flask. This method was applicable to the oxidative dimerization of a wide range of tryptophan derivatives, including various dipeptides and oligopeptides, with remarkable functional&#8208;group tolerance without the protection of the amino acid residues. Furthermore, oxidative dimerization of tryptophan derivatives bearing dioxopiperazine units enabled the convergent total synthesis of five natural pyrroloindole compounds and unnatural congeners. The established chemical method provides facile access to a broad range of dimerized peptides with a unique scaffold to link two turn structures, which will serve as a powerful tool to create new small&#8208; and medium&#8208;sized&#8208;molecules as drug candidates.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Vinylcyclopropane&#8208;Cyclopentene (VCP&#8208;CP) Rearrangement</title>

         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Alkenyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropylacetaldehydes undergo enantioselective vinylcyclopropane&#8208;cyclopentene (VCP&#8208;CP) rearrangement using a Jorgensen&#8208;Hayashi&#8208;type catalyst. The reaction proceeds through enamine/iminium activation and comprises the in situ generation of a donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane intermediate that undergoes ring&#8208;opening/cyclization. Computational studies together with the experimental data support a type&#8208;II DYKAT process operating.







Abstract
We have demonstrated that the catalytic and enantioselective vinylcyclopropane&#8208;cyclopentene rearrangement can be carried out on (vinylcyclopropyl)acetaldehydes through activation via enamine intermediates. The reaction makes use of racemic starting materials that, upon ring opening facilitated by the catalytic generation of a donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane, deliver an acyclic iminium ion/dienolate intermediate in which all stereochemical information has been deleted. The final cyclization step forms the rearrangement product, showing that chirality transfer from the catalyst to the final compound is highly effective and leads to the stereocontrolled formation of a variety of structurally different cyclopentenes.

         <title>Molecular Dipole Engineering of Carbonyl Additives for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach was proposed to design and synthesize efficient carbonyl additives to improve perovskite device performance. After systematic research, we find that molecular dipole plays an important role in determining the passivation effect of the additive molecule. After optimization, the companion efficiency of the perovskite device is 23.20&#8201;% (0.09&#8197;cm2), 20.18&#8201;% (14&#8197;cm2) and it can maintain long&#8208;term stability under harsh conditions.







Abstract
Carbonyl functional materials as additives are extensively applied to reduce the defects density of the perovskite film. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding for the effect of carbonyl additives to improve device performance. In this work, we systematically study the effect of carbonyl additive molecules on the passivation of defects in perovskite films. After a comprehensive investigation, the results confirm the importance of molecular dipole in amplifying the passivation effect of additive molecules. The additive with strong molecular dipole possesses the advantages of enhancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). After optimization, the companion efficiency of PSCs is 23.20&#8201;%, and it can maintain long&#8208;term stability under harsh conditions. Additionally, a large&#8208;area solar cell module&#8208;modified DLBA was 20.18&#8201;% (14&#8197;cm2). This work provides an important reference for the selection and designing of efficient carbonyl additives.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Stereoselective Synthesis and Biological Activity of 2&#8208;Exomethylene Pseudo&#8208;glycoconjugates: Discovery of Mincle&#8208;Selective Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphine&#8208;ligand&#8208;controlled Tsuji&#8211;Trost&#8208;type glycosylation enabled the stereoselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;pseudo&#8208;glycoconjugates with an exomethylene group at the C2 position. These compounds are Mincle&#8208;selective ligands that do not bind to CD1d, suggesting that the 2&#8208;OH group of natural glycoconjugates is critical for CD1d binding.







Abstract
Glycoconjugate analogues in which the sp3&#8208;hybridized C2 position of the carbohydrate structure (normally bearing a hydroxy group) is converted into a compact sp2&#8208;hybridized exomethylene group are expected to have unique biological activities. We established ligand&#8208;controlled Tsuji&#8211;Trost&#8208;type glycosylation methodology to directly prepare a variety of these 2&#8208;exomethylene pseudo&#8208;glycoconjugates, including glucosylceramide analogues, in an &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;selective manner. Glucocerebrosidase GBA1 cleaves these synthetic pseudo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucosylceramides similarly to native glucosylceramides. The pseudo&#8208;glucosylceramides exhibit selective ligand activity towards macrophage&#8208;inducible C&#8208;type lectin (Mincle), but unlike native glucosylceramides, are inactive towards CD1d.

         <title>Starch&#8208;Based Superabsorbent Hydrogel with High Electrolyte Retention Capability and Synergistic Interface Engineering for Long&#8208;Lifespan Flexible Zinc&#8722;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrostatic interaction between the acrylate groups along the starch&#8208;based superabsorbent hydrogel polymer electrolyte (SSHPE) polymeric chains and zinc contributes to the dendrite&#8208;free interfacial layer formation. However, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based polymer&#8208;host exhibits limited interaction with the zinc anode, suggesting a random zinc deposition.







Abstract
The advent of wearable electronics has strongly stimulated advanced research into the exploration of flexible zinc&#8722;air batteries (ZABs) with high theoretical energy density, high inherent safety, and low cost. However, the half&#8208;open battery structure and the high concentration of alkaline aqueous environment pose great challenges on the electrolyte retention capability and the zinc anode stability. Herein, a starch&#8208;based superabsorbent hydrogel polymer electrolyte (SSHPE) with high ionic conductivity, electrolyte absorption and retention capabilities, strong alkaline resistance and high zinc anode stability has been designed and applied in ZABs. Experimental and calculational analyses probe into the root of the superiority of SSHPEs, confirming the significance of the carboxyl functional groups along their polymer chains.

&lt;p&gt;The electrostatic interaction between the acrylate groups along the starch-based superabsorbent hydrogel polymer electrolyte (SSHPE) polymeric chains and zinc contributes to the dendrite-free interfacial layer formation. However, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-based polymer-host exhibits limited interaction with the zinc anode, suggesting a random zinc deposition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advent of wearable electronics has strongly stimulated advanced research into the exploration of flexible zinc&#8722;air batteries (ZABs) with high theoretical energy density, high inherent safety, and low cost. However, the half-open battery structure and the high concentration of alkaline aqueous environment pose great challenges on the electrolyte retention capability and the zinc anode stability. Herein, a starch-based superabsorbent hydrogel polymer electrolyte (SSHPE) with high ionic conductivity, electrolyte absorption and retention capabilities, strong alkaline resistance and high zinc anode stability has been designed and applied in ZABs. Experimental and calculational analyses probe into the root of the superiority of SSHPEs, confirming the significance of the carboxyl functional groups along their polymer chains. These features endow the as-fabricated ZAB a long cycle life of 300&#8197;h, much longer than that with commonly used poly(vinyl alcohol)-based electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron Redistribution Enables Redox&#8208;Resistible Li6PS5Cl towards High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an electron redistribution strategy with Mg and F co&#8208;doping to inhibit the interfacial redox reactions between Li6PS5Cl and Li. Mg triggers the electron agglomeration around S atom, inhibiting the electron acceptation from Li metal, and F further generates the self&#8208;limiting interface between the electrolyte and Li metal. This design enhances interfacial stability, enabling the high performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery.







Abstract
Sulfide electrolytes with high ionic conductivity hold great promise for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the parasitic redox reactions between sulfide electrolyte and Li metal result in interfacial instability and rapid decline of the battery performance. Herein, a redox&#8208;resistible Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) electrolyte is created by regulating the electron distribution in LPSC with Mg and F incorporation. The introduction of Mg triggers the electron agglomeration around S atom, inhibiting the electron acceptance from Li, and F generates the self&#8208;limiting interface, which hinders the redox reactions between LPSC and Li metal. This redox&#8208;resistible Li6PS5Cl&#8208;MgF2 electrolyte therefore presents a high critical current density (2.3 times that of pristine electrolyte). The LiCoO2/Li6PS5Cl&#8208;MgF2/Li cell shows an outstanding cycling stability (93.3&#8201;%@100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C). This study highlights the electronic structure modulation to address redox issues on sulfide&#8208;based lithium batteries.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Revival of Degraded &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 to Stable Highly Luminescent Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
After ageing under ambient conditions, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of as&#8208;synthesized CsPbI3 nanocrystals drastically declined to &#8776;11&#8201;% due to the formation of surface defect states. These &#8220;optically sick&#8221; CsPbI3 nanocrystals are then revived to their cubic phase through the addition of 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DSH), and regain a PLQY of approximately 90&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 is regarded as an attractive optical luminophore, it is readily degraded to the optically inactive &#948;&#8208;phase under ambient conditions. Here, we present a simple approach to revive degraded (&#8220;optically sick&#8221;) &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 through &#8220;medication&#8221; with thiol&#8208;containing ligands. The effect of different types of thiols is systematically studied through optical spectroscopy. The structural reconstruction of degraded &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals to cubic crystals in the presence of thiol&#8208;containing ligands is visualized through high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and supported by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. We found that 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DSH) effectively revives degraded CsPbI3 and results in high immunity towards moisture and oxygen, hitherto unreported. DSH facilitates the passivation of surface defects and etching of degraded Cs4PbI6 phase, thus reverting them back to the cubic CsPbI3 phase, leading to enhanced PL and environmental stability.

         <title>Overcoming the Trade&#8208;Off between C2H2 Sorption and Separation Performance by Regulating Metal&#8208;Alkyne Chemical Interaction in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;alkyne chemical interaction of PdII and PtII in two isostructural NbO metal&#8211;organic frameworks was regulated to obtain different binding affinities for C2H2. As a result, C2H2 could be selectively adsorbed and C2H2/CO2 could be separated at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Designing porous materials for C2H2 purification and safe storage is essential research for industrial utilization. We emphatically regulate the metal&#8208;alkyne interaction of PdII and PtII on C2H2 sorption and C2H2/CO2 separation in two isostructural NbO metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), Pd/Cu&#8208;PDA and Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA. The experimental investigations and systematic theoretical calculations reveal that PdII in Pd/Cu&#8208;PDA undergoes spontaneous chemical reaction with C2H2, leading to irreversible structural collapse and loss of C2H2/CO2 sorption and separation. Contrarily, PtII in Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA shows strong di&#8208;&#963; bond interaction with C2H2 to form specific &#960;&#8208;complexation, contributing to high C2H2 capture (28.7&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.01&#8197;bar and 153&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;bar). The reusable Pt/Cu&#8208;PDA efficiently separates C2H2 from C2H2/CO2 mixtures with satisfying selectivity and C2H2 capacity (37&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1). This research provides valuable insight into designing high&#8208;performance MOFs for gas sorption and separation.

         <title>A Modular Tubular Flow System with Replaceable Photocatalyst Membranes for Scalable Coupling and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular tubular flow system with replaceable porous structured photocatalyst membranes provides a solution for scaling&#8208;up heterogeneous photocatalytic coupling and hydrogenation reactions with high efficiency under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Heterogeneous photocatalysis is effective for the selective synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals at lab&#8208;scale, yet falls short of requirements for mass production (low cost and user friendliness). Here we report the design and fabrication of a modular tubular flow system embedded with replaceable photocatalyst membranes for scalable photocatalytic C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N homocoupling and hydrogenation reactions, which can be operated in either circular and continuous flow mode with high performance. The photocatalyst membranes almost fully occupy the volume of the reactor, thus enabling optimal absorption of the incident light. Additionally, the porous structured photocatalyst membranes facilitate the mass transfer of the reactants to efficiently use the active sites, resulting in 0th&#8208;order reaction kinetics and a high space&#8208;time yield compared to the batch reaction system at practical application levels and prolonged reaction times.

&lt;p&gt;A modular tubular flow system with replaceable porous structured photocatalyst membranes provides a solution for scaling-up heterogeneous photocatalytic coupling and hydrogenation reactions with high efficiency under ambient conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneous photocatalysis is effective for the selective synthesis of value-added chemicals at lab-scale, yet falls short of requirements for mass production (low cost and user friendliness). Here we report the design and fabrication of a modular tubular flow system embedded with replaceable photocatalyst membranes for scalable photocatalytic C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N homocoupling and hydrogenation reactions, which can be operated in either circular and continuous flow mode with high performance. The photocatalyst membranes almost fully occupy the volume of the reactor, thus enabling optimal absorption of the incident light. Additionally, the porous structured photocatalyst membranes facilitate the mass transfer of the reactants to efficiently use the active sites, resulting in 0&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-order reaction kinetics and a high space-time yield compared to the batch reaction system at practical application levels and prolonged reaction times.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Utilizing Nitroarenes and HCHO to Directly Construct Functional N&#8208;Heterocycles by Supported Cobalt/Amino Acid Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By relay catalysis of a supported bifunctional cobalt catalyst and L&#8208;proline, a reductive annulation reaction of nitroarenes and formaldehyde involving both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations is presented, which enables direct and diverse access to 1,3&#8208;diaryl imidazolines.







Abstract
Due to the generation of multiple intermediates during the nitroarene reduction, precise interception of single one to develop tandem reactions involving both C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formations still remains a significant challenge. Herein, the relay catalysis of a supported bifunctional cobalt catalyst with l&#8208;proline has been successfully applied to establish a bran&#8208;new reductive annulation reaction of nitroarenes and formaldehyde, which enables direct and diverse construction of both symmetrical and unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diaryl imidazolines. It proceeds with operational simplicity, good substrate and functionality compatibility, and excellent step and atom&#8208;efficiency. Mechanistic studies reveal that the Co&#8208;catalyst exhibits a synergistic effect on the formation of key N&#8208;hydroxy imine, and the l&#8208;proline subsequently facilitates the key C&#8722;C bond formation. The current work opens a door to develop useful transformations with nitroarenes by reduction&#8208;interrupted strategy.

         <title>Exposed Zinc Sites on Hybrid ZnIn2S4@CdS Nanocages for Efficient Regioselective Photocatalytic Epoxide Alcoholysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow CdS nanocages wrapped in ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets were synthesized to form the hierarchical photocatalyst ZnIn2S4@CdS. Surface&#8208;exposed Zn acid centers and the Z&#8208;Scheme pathway between ZnIn2S4 and CdS promote the polarization of epoxide molecules and interfacial charge transfer, leading to photoredox&#8208;catalyzed regioselective alcoholysis of epoxides.







Abstract
Photocatalytic epoxide alcoholysis through C&#8722;O bond cleavage and formation has emerged as an alternative to synthesizing anti&#8208;tumoral pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. However, the lack of crucial evidence to interpret the interaction between reactants and photocatalyst surface makes it challenging for photocatalytic epoxide alcoholysis with both high activity and regioselectivity. In this work, we report the hierarchical ZnIn2S4@CdS photocatalyst for epoxide alcoholysis with high regioselectivity nearly 100&#8201;%. Mechanistic studies unveil that the precise activation switch on exposed Zn acid sites for C&#8722;O bond polarization and cleavage has a critical significance for achieving efficient photocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the establishment of Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction facilitates the interface charge separation and transfer. Remarkably, the underlying regioselective photocatalytic reaction pathway has been distinctly revealed.

         <title>A BN&#8208;Doped U&#8208;Shaped Heteroacene as a Molecular Floating Gate for Ambipolar Charge Trapping Memory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise electrophilic aromatic borylation reaction was used to synthesize a wide band gap U&#8208;shaped BN&#8208;doped heteroacene. The donor effect of the nitrogen atoms and the high electron affinity of the boron atoms fine&#8208;tuned the electronic features, as well as the dual&#8208;functional layer enabled by supramolecular engineering, resulting in an organic field&#8208;effect transistor memory with large ambipolar memory windows and a high charge storage density.







Abstract
Two wide&#8208;band gap U&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with/without boron and nitrogen (BN&#8208;) doping (BN&#8208;1 and C&#8208;1) were synthesized to tune the electronic features to suit the performance requirements for organic field&#8208;effect transistor memory (OFET&#8208;NVM). The chemical structures were characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy and single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Owing to the electron&#8208;donor effect of N and the high electron affinity of B, the BN&#8208;1&#8208;based OFET&#8208;NVM displays large ambipolar memory windows and an enhanced charge storage density compared to C&#8208;1 and most reported small molecules. A novel supramolecular system formed from BN&#8208;1 and PMMA contributes to fabricating uniform films with homogeneous microstructures, which serve as a two&#8208;in&#8208;one tunnelling dielectric and charge&#8208;trapping layer to realize long&#8208;term charge retention and reliable endurance. Our results demonstrate that both BN doping and supramolecular engineering are crucial for the charge trapping of OFET&#8208;NVM.

         <title>Enhancing Energy Conversion Efficiency and Durability of Alkaline Nickel&#8208;Zinc Batteries with Air&#8208;Breathing Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To leverage the oxygen produced from the avoidable side reaction of oxygen evolution in Ni&#8208;Zn battery, an air&#8208;breathing cathode is constructed by coupling oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst with the Ni(OH)2 cathode. Benefiting from the stabilizing effects on the electrolyte and electrodes, this novel battery (Ni&#8208;ZnAB) exhibits an ultralong lifespan and ultrahigh energy efficiency (85&#8201;%), superior to Ni&#8208;Zn battery and Zn&#8208;air battery (ZAB).







Abstract
Despite their high output voltage and safety advantages, rechargeable alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries face significant challenges associated with the cathodic side reaction of oxygen evolution, which results in low energy efficiency (EE) and poor stability. Herein, we propose to leverage the side oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in nickel&#8208;zinc batteries by coupling electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in the cathode, thus constructing an air breathing cathode. Such a novel battery (Ni&#8208;ZnAB), designed in a pouch&#8208;type cell with a lean electrolyte, exhibits an outstanding EE of 85&#8201;% and a long cycle life of 100 cycles at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which are significantly superior to those of traditional Ni&#8208;Zn batteries (54&#8201;%, 50 cycles). Compared to Ni&#8208;Zn, the enhanced EE of Ni&#8208;ZnAB is attributed to the contribution from ORR, while the improved cycling stability is because the stability of the anode, cathode and electrolyte are also enhanced in Ni&#8208;ZnAB. Furthermore, an ultrahigh stability of 500 cycles with an average EE of 84&#8201;% at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved using a mold cell with rich electrolyte, demonstrating the strong application potential of Ni&#8208;ZnAB.

         <title>Carbazolylene&#8208;Ethynylene Macrocycle based Conductive Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

Two shape&#8208;persistent macrocycle&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (MC&#8208;COFs) with aligned porous channels were synthesized. The MC&#8208;COFs&#8217; electrical conductivities were enhanced over 6 orders of magnitude upon I2 doping, with the framework structural integrity maintained. The electrical properties of MC&#8208;COFs can be switched between electron&#8208;conducting and insulating states through simple doping&#8208;regenerating cycles.







Abstract
Two covalent organic frameworks consisting of carbazolylene&#8208;ethynylene shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles with azine (MC&#8208;COF&#8208;1) or imine (MC&#8208;COF&#8208;2) linkages were synthesized via imine condensation. The obtained 2D frameworks are fully conjugated which imparts semiconducting properties. In addition, the frameworks showed high porosity with aligned accessible porous channels along the z axis, serving as an ideal platform for post&#8208;synthetic incorporation of I2 into the channels to enable electrical conductivity. The resulting MC&#8208;COF&#8208;1 showed an electrical conductivity up to 7.8&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature upon I2 doping with the activation energy as low as 0.09&#8197;eV. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the electrical properties of both MC&#8208;COFs are switchable between electron&#8208;conducting and insulating states by simply implementing doping&#8208;regenerating cycles. The knowledge gained in this study opens new possibilities for the future development of tunable conductive 2D organic materials.

         <title>Isobaric Stable Isotope N&#8208;Phosphorylation Labeling (iSIPL) for Ultrasensitive Proteome Quantification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>

A novel isobaric phosphorus reagent enables the accurate quantitative proteome analysis and peptide sequencing with high sensitivity. The reporter ion clusters with characteristic P&#8722;N bonds were efficiently generated with very high intensities for protein quantification.







Abstract
Stable isotope chemical labeling methods have been widely used for high&#8208;throughput mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based quantitative proteomics in biological and clinical applications. However, the existing methods are far from meeting the requirements for high sensitivity detection. In the present study, a novel isobaric stable isotope N&#8208;phosphorylation labeling (iSIPL) strategy was developed for quantitative proteome analysis. The tryptic peptides were selectively labeled with iSIPL tag to generate the novel reporter ions containing phosphoramidate P&#8722;N bond with high intensities under lower collision energies. iSIPL strategy are suitable for peptide sequencing and quantitative analysis with high sensitivity and accuracy even for samples of limited quantity. Furthermore, iSIPL coupled with affinity purification and mass spectrometry was applied to measure the dynamics of cyclin dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) interactomes during transactivation of the HIV&#8208;1 provirus. The interaction of CDK9 with PARP13 was found to significantly decrease during Tat&#8208;induced activation of HIV&#8208;1 gene transcription, suggesting the effectiveness of iSIPL strategy in dynamic analysis of protein&#8208;protein interaction in vivo. More than that, the proposed iSIPL strategy would facilitate large&#8208;scale accurate quantitative proteomics by increasing multiplexing capability.

         <title>Design of Multicomponent Peptide Fibrils with Ordered and Programmable Compositional Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent peptide nanofibrils are constructed with an unprecedented degree of control over peptide arrangement. A neighbor&#8208;controlled patterning method is described to convert 8 designed peptides into the fibrils with 412 different compositional patterns with tunable compositions and peptide positions. This strategy may enable application&#8208;specific tailoring of material and biological properties of peptide fibrils.







Abstract
Advanced applications of biomacromolecular assemblies require a stringent degree of control over molecular arrangement, which is a challenge to current synthetic methods. Here we used a neighbor&#8208;controlled patterning strategy to build multicomponent peptide fibrils with an unprecedented capacity to manipulate local composition and peptide positions. Eight peptides were designed to have regulable nearest neighbors upon co&#8208;assembly, which, by simulation, afforded 412 different patterns within fibrils, with varied compositions and/or peptide positions. The fibrils with six prescribed patterns were experimentally constructed with high accuracy. The controlled patterning also applies to functionalities appended to the peptides, as exemplified by arranging carbohydrate ligands at nanoscale precision for protein recognition. This study offers a route to molecular editing of inner structures of peptide assemblies, prefiguring the uniqueness and richness of patterning&#8208;based material design.

         <title>Selective Production of CO from Organic Pollutants by Coupling Piezocatalysis and Advanced Oxidation Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an unprecedented Co3S4/MoS2/peroxymonosulfate/ultrasound system to achieve a high rate of conversion from pollutants to CO through the coupling of piezocatalysis and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). This system is assisted by the formation of an electron transfer chain from Mo and S to Co, thus improving the thermodynamic process from carbonate to CO and enhancing the yield and selectivity. Our discovery represents a significant boost to achieving low emissions in wastewater treatment.







Abstract
To date, the chemical conversion of organic pollutants into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks rather than CO2 remains a major challenge. Herein, we successfully developed a coupled piezocatalytic and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) system for achieving the conversion of various organic pollutants to CO. The CO product stems from the specific process in which organics are first oxidized to carbonate through peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based AOPs, and then the as&#8208;obtained carbonate is converted into CO by piezoelectric reduction under ultrasonic (US) vibration by using a Co3S4/MoS2 catalyst. Experiments and DFT calculations show that the introduction of Co3S4 not only effectively promotes the transfer and utilization of piezoelectric electrons but also realizes highly selective conversion from carbonate to CO. The Co3S4/MoS2/PMS system has achieved selective generation of CO in actual complex wastewater treatment for the first time, indicating its potential practical applicability.

Herein, a catalyst&#8208;controlled regiodivergent and enantioselective formal hydroamination of N,N&#8208;disubstituted acrylamides has been developed. Sterically&#8208;disfavored and electronically&#8208;disfavored enantioselective hydroaminations of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes were obtained using different transition metals (Cu, Ni) and chiral ligands, delivering enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam and &#946;&#8208;aminoamide derivatives in good yields and selectivity.







Abstract
Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminoacid and &#945;&#8208;chiral&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoacid derivatives play an important role in biological science and pharmaceutical chemistry. Thus, the development of methods for their synthesis is highly valuable and yet remains challenging. Herein, an unprecedented catalyst&#8208;controlled regiodivergent and enantioselective formal hydroamination of N,N&#8208;disubstituted acrylamides with aminating agents has been developed, accessing enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam and &#945;&#8208;chiral&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoamide derivatives. Sterically&#8208;disfavored and electronically&#8208;disfavored enantioselective hydroamination of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes have been successfully tuned using different transition metals and chiral ligands. Notably, extremely hindered aliphatic &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam derivatives were synthesized by Cu&#8722;H catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;N bond forming with tertiary alkyl species. Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;chiral&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoamide derivatives have been accessed by Ni&#8722;H catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;selective formal hydroaminations of alkenes. This set of reactions tolerates a wide range of functional groups to deliver diverse &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminolactam and &#945;&#8208;chiral&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aminoamide derivatives in good yields with high levels of enantioselectivity.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, a catalyst-controlled regiodivergent and enantioselective formal hydroamination of &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;-disubstituted acrylamides has been developed. Sterically-disfavored and electronically-disfavored enantioselective hydroaminations of electron-deficient alkenes were obtained using different transition metals (Cu, Ni) and chiral ligands, delivering enantioenriched &#945;-tertiary-&#945;-aminolactam and &#946;-aminoamide derivatives in good yields and selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enantioenriched &#945;-tertiary-&#945;-aminoacid and &#945;-chiral-&#946;-aminoacid derivatives play an important role in biological science and pharmaceutical chemistry. Thus, the development of methods for their synthesis is highly valuable and yet remains challenging. Herein, an unprecedented catalyst-controlled regiodivergent and enantioselective formal hydroamination of &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;-disubstituted acrylamides with aminating agents has been developed, accessing enantioenriched &#945;-tertiary-&#945;-aminolactam and &#945;-chiral-&#946;-aminoamide derivatives. Sterically-disfavored and electronically-disfavored enantioselective hydroamination of electron-deficient alkenes have been successfully tuned using different transition metals and chiral ligands. Notably, extremely hindered aliphatic &#945;-tertiary-&#945;-aminolactam derivatives were synthesized by Cu&#8722;H catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;N bond forming with tertiary alkyl species. Enantioenriched &#945;-chiral-&#946;-aminoamide derivatives have been accessed by Ni&#8722;H catalyzed anti-Markovnikov-selective formal hydroaminations of alkenes. This set of reactions tolerates a wide range of functional groups to deliver diverse &#945;-tertiary-&#945;-aminolactam and &#945;-chiral-&#946;-aminoamide derivatives in good yields with high levels of enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Small Molecule Degraders of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B and T&#8208;Cell Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inhibitor for protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T&#8208;cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC&#8208;PTP) was discovered and transformed into a first&#8208;in&#8208;class, potent, and selective dual PROTAC degrader for both targets. The degrader promotes antigen presentation of tumor cells and activates CD8+ T&#8208;cells. Importantly, the degrader is effective in vivo and suppresses syngeneic tumor growth.







Abstract
Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and T&#8208;cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC&#8208;PTP) play non&#8208;redundant negative regulatory roles in T&#8208;cell activation, tumor antigen presentation, insulin and leptin signaling, and are potential targets for several therapeutic applications. Here, we report the development of a highly potent and selective small molecule degrader DU&#8208;14 for both PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP. DU&#8208;14 mediated PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP degradation requires both target protein(s) and VHL E3 ligase engagement and is also ubiquitination&#8208; and proteasome&#8208;dependent. DU&#8208;14 enhances IFN&#8208;&#947; induced JAK1/2&#8208;STAT1 pathway activation and promotes MHC&#8208;I expression in tumor cells. DU&#8208;14 also activates CD8+ T&#8208;cells and augments STAT1 and STAT5 phosphorylation. Importantly, DU&#8208;14 induces PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP degradation in vivo and suppresses MC38 syngeneic tumor growth. The results indicate that DU&#8208;14, as the first PTP1B and TC&#8208;PTP dual degrader, merits further development for treating cancer and other indications.

         <title>Armor&#8208;like Inorganic&#8208;rich Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Enabled by the Pentafluorophenylboronic Acid Additive for High&#8208;voltage Li||NCM622 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;voltage stability of NCM622 is realized by armor&#8208;like CEI via electrolyte engineering, where the armored lithium borate on the CEI surface represses the dissolution of CEI moieties and improves the Li+ conductivity of CEI while abundant LiF is distributed across whole CEI to enhance the mechanical stability.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) comprising Li metal anode and high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich cathode could potentially realize high capacity and power density. However, suitable electrolytes to tolerate the oxidation on the cathode at high cut&#8208;off voltage are urgently needed. Herein, we present an armor&#8208;like inorganic&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) strategy for exploring oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolytes for sustaining 4.8&#8197;V Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) batteries with pentafluorophenylboronic acid (PFPBA) as the additive. In such CEI, the armored lithium borate surrounded by CEI up&#8208;layer represses the dissolution of inner CEI moieties and also improves the Li+ conductivity of CEI while abundant LiF is distributed over whole CEI to enhance the mechanical stability and Li+ conductivity compared with polymer moieties. With such robust Li+ conductive CEI, the Li||NCM622 battery delivered excellent stability at 4.6&#8197;V cut&#8208;off voltage with 91.2&#8201;% capacity retention after 400&#8197;cycles. The excellent cycling performance was also obtained even at 4.8&#8197;V cut&#8208;off voltage.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of a Tridecasaccharide Motif of Bacteroides vulgatus Lipopolysaccharides against Inflammatory Bowel Diseases through an Orthogonal One&#8208;Pot Glycosylation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tridecasaccharide from Bacteroides vulgatus mpk lipopolysaccharides has been synthesized for the first time by a strategy involving orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation reactions based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which precluded issues such as aglycone transfer and the unpleasant odor of thioglycoside&#8208;based orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation.







Abstract
Lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides vulgatus represent interesting targets for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. However, efficient access to long, branched and complex lipopolysaccharides remains challenging. Herein, we report the modular synthesis of a tridecasaccharide from Bacteroides vulgates through an orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which avoids the issues of thioglycoside&#8208;based one&#8208;pot synthesis. Our approach also features: 1) 5,7&#8208;O&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsilylene&#8208;directed glycosylation for stereoselective construction of the &#945;&#8208;Kdo linkage; 2) hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery for the stereoselective formation of &#946;&#8208;mannosidic bonds; 3) remote anchimeric assistance for stereoselective assembly of the &#945;&#8208;fucosyl linkage; 4) several orthogonal one&#8208;pot synthetic steps and strategic use of orthogonal protecting groups to streamline oligosaccharide assembly; 5) convergent [1+6+6] one&#8208;pot synthesis of the target.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Metallosalphen&#8208;Based 2D Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for NO2 Sensing: Metal Coordination Induced Planarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nonplanar Salphen ligand (6OH&#8208;Salphen) with C2v&#8208;symmetry was developed to construct 2D Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF via in situ one pot synthesis, featuring metal coordination induced planarization of the Salphen cores. The existence of N2O2 pocket of 6OH&#8208;Salphen endows 2D Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF with higher metal density, shorter metal&#8208;metal distance and a narrower band gap, thus making it display a high response toward NO2 (766&#8201;% at 100&#8197;ppm).







Abstract
As an emerging class of promising porous materials, the development of two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) is hampered by the few categories and tedious synthesis of the specific ligands. Herein, we developed a nonplanar hexahydroxyl&#8208;functionalized Salphen ligand (6OH&#8208;Salphen) through a facile two&#8208;step synthesis, which was further applied to construct layered 2D c&#8208;MOFs through in situ one pot synthesis based on the synergistic metal binding effect of the N2O2 pocket of Salphen. Interestingly, the C2v&#8208;symmetry of ligand endows Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF with periodically heterogeneous pore structures. Benefitting from the higher metal density and shorter in&#8208;plane metal&#8208;metal distance, Cu&#8208;Salphen&#8208;MOF showcased excellent NO2 sensing performance with good sensitivity, selectivity and reversibility. The current work opens up a new avenue to construct 2D c&#8208;MOF directly from nonplanar ligands, which greatly simplifies the synthesis and provides new possibilities for preparing different topological 2D c&#8208;MOF based functional materials.

&lt;p&gt;As an emerging class of promising porous materials, the development of two-dimensional conductive metal organic frameworks (2D &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-MOFs) is hampered by the few categories and tedious synthesis of the specific ligands. Herein, we developed a nonplanar hexahydroxyl-functionalized Salphen ligand (6OH-Salphen) through a facile two-step synthesis, which was further applied to construct layered 2D &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-MOFs through &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; one pot synthesis based on the synergistic metal binding effect of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pocket of Salphen. Interestingly, the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetry of ligand endows Cu-Salphen-MOF with periodically heterogeneous pore structures. Benefitting from the higher metal density and shorter in-plane metal-metal distance, Cu-Salphen-MOF showcased excellent NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sensing performance with good sensitivity, selectivity and reversibility. The current work opens up a new avenue to construct 2D &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-MOF directly from nonplanar ligands, which greatly simplifies the synthesis and provides new possibilities for preparing different topological 2D &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-MOF based functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Some matrix chemicals used in MALDI mass spectrometry are not sufficiently vacuum&#8208;stable and therefore not suitable for extended MALDI imaging experiments. Caging the MALDI matrices by covalent attachment of a photocleavable group renders them vacuum&#8208;stable, as reported by Qiuqin Zhou et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202217047). The caged matrix is eventually uncaged in&#8197;situ by the UV laser in the MALDI ion source. Thereby, the original matrix is liberated, thus enabling MALDI imaging of large clinical or pharmacological sample cohorts. Artwork by Miriam Rittel, Stefano Rizzo, and Silas Ackermann.

         <title>Back Cover: Isolated Tin(IV) Active Sites for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 to CH4 in Neutral Aqueous Solution (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 22/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;copper metal based catalyst for the deep electroreduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons is reported by Pei&#8208;Qin Liao and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202301767). For the first time, a Sn&#8208;based catalyst was developed for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) to produce hydrocarbons. This Sn&#8208;based MOF shows an unexpected performance in the eCO2RR to produce CH4, as formate or CO are usually common products for traditional Sn&#8208;based catalysts.

Lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides vulgatus represent interesting targets for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. In their Research Article (e202301351), Guozhi Xiao and co&#8208;workers accomplished the first synthesis of a tridecasaccharide motif from Bacteroides vulgatus lipopolysaccharides by a strategy involving orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation reactions based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates, which avoided issues such as aglycone transfer and the unpleasant odor of thioglycoside&#8208;based orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation.

Ambergris is a highly valued natural product in the fragrance industry and is also known as "floating gold" because of its biosynthesis in the intestines of sperm whales. Owing to this scarce natural resource, the stereoselective synthesis of its most prominent olfactory component, (&#8722;)&#8208;ambroxide, via alternative routes is attractive. In their Research Article (e202301607), S&#237;lvia Osuna, Bernhard Hauer et&#8197;al. demonstrate the catalytic potential of an engineered squalene&#8208;hopene cyclase in the intricate cyclization of the precursor homofarnesol.

         <title>Engineering Graphdiyne for Solar Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because of their large specific surface area, adjustable band gap, and uniformly pore structure, graphdiyne (GDY) materials have become a rising star for photocatalytic energy conversion. This Minireview summarizes the unique physicochemical properties of GDY as well as the construction and progress of GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction and nitrogen reduction.







Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY) with a direct band gap, excellent carrier mobility and uniform pores, is regarded as a promising photocatalytic material for solar energy conversion, while the research on GDY in photocatalysis is a less developed field. Herein, the distinctive structure, adjustable band gap, and electronic properties of GDY for photocatalysis is firstly summarized. The construction and progress of GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar energy conversion, including H2 evolution reaction (HER), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and N2 reduction reaction (NRR) are then elaborated. At last, the challenges and perspectives in developing GDY&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar fuel production are discussed. It is anticipated that a timely Minireview will be helpful for rapid progress of GDY in solar energy conversion.

         <title>Lessons Learned from the Grouping of Chemicals to Assess Risks to Human Health</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grouping chemicals for risk assessment can consider the similarity of their intrinsic properties (e.g. structure), extrinsic properties, (e.g. persistence), and toxicological properties (e.g. genotoxicity). Based on the lessons learned on several substance classes, we derive principles of grouping, and differentiate between the prioritization of chemicals in groups of the same initial concern versus the definitive groups for justified read&#8208;across.







Abstract
In analogy to the periodic system that groups elements by their similarity in structure and chemical properties, the hazard of chemicals can be assessed in groups having similar structures and similar toxicological properties. Here we review case studies of chemical grouping strategies that supported the assessment of hazard, exposure, and risk to human health. By the EU&#8208;REACH and the US&#8208;TSCA New Chemicals Program, structural similarity is commonly used as the basis for grouping, but that criterion is not always adequate and sufficient. Based on the lessons learned, we derive ten principles for grouping, including: transparency of the purpose, criteria, and boundaries of the group; adequacy of methods used to justify the group; and inclusion or exclusion of substances in the group by toxicological properties. These principles apply to initial grouping to prioritize further actions as well as to definitive grouping to generate data for risk assessment. Both can expedite effective risk management.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Catalysts for Molecular Oxygen Activation in Heterogeneous Thermo&#8208;/Electro&#8208;catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Mini&#8208;review systematically summarized the recent research progress of dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) for molecular oxygen activation (MOA) in heterogeneous thermo&#8208; and electrocatalysis. Despite the rapid developments in this field, many great challenges still hinder the practical application of DASCs. We look forward to the challenges and application prospects of DASCs for MOA.







Abstract
Efficient molecular oxygen activation (MOA) is the key to environmentally friendly catalytic oxidation reactions. In the last decade, single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SASCs) with nearly 100&#8201;% atomic utilization and unique electronic structure have been widely investigated for MOA. However, the single active site makes the activation effect unsatisfactory and difficult to deal with complex catalytic reactions. Recently, dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) have provided a new idea for the effective activation of molecular oxygen (O2) due to more diverse active sites and synergetic interactions among adjacent atoms. In this review, we systematically summarized the recent research progress of DASCs for MOA in heterogeneous thermo&#8208; and electrocatalysis. Finally, we look forward to the challenges and application prospects in the construction of DASCs for MOA.

         <title>Gold Complexes in Anticancer Therapy: From New Design Principles to Particle&#8208;Based Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold compounds have attracted considerable interest as anticancer drugs. However, the clinical translation of this class of compounds is hampered by suboptimal pharmacological performance. To address this problem, strategies based on molecular design principles have been the primary focus. More recently, the use of nanoparticle&#8208;based delivery systems has emerged as a promising strategy to circumvent many limitations of these promising anticancer metallodrugs.







Abstract
The discovery of the medicinal properties of gold complexes has fuelled the design and synthesis of new anticancer metallodrugs, which have received special attention due to their unique modes of action. Current research in the development of gold compounds with therapeutic properties is predominantly focused on the molecular design of drug leads with superior pharmacological activities, e.g., by introducing targeting features. Moreover, intensive research aims at improving the physicochemical properties of gold compounds, such as chemical stability and solubility in the physiological environment. In this regard, the encapsulation of gold compounds in nanocarriers or their chemical grafting onto targeted delivery vectors could lead to new nanomedicines that eventually reach clinical applications. Herein, we provide an overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress of gold anticancer compounds, andmore importantly we thoroughly revise the development of nanoparticle&#8208;based delivery systems for gold chemotherapeutics.

         <title>A Flow Cytometry&#8208;Based Ultrahigh&#8208;Throughput Screening Method for Directed Evolution of Oxidases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh&#8208;throughput screening platform &#8220;FlOxi&#8221; was developed by integrating oxidation/Fenton reaction cascade, Fe3+ mediated eGFPHis decoration, and fluorescence&#8208;activated&#8208;cell&#8208;sorting into a general strategy. FlOxi was validated in two evolution campaigns targeting two oxidases, exemplifying the suitability of the platform for screening oxidase variants in an ultrahigh&#8208;throughput manner.







Abstract
Oxidases are of interest to chemical and pharmaceutical industries because they catalyze highly selective oxidations. However, oxidases found in nature often need to be re&#8208;engineered for synthetic applications. Herein, we developed a versatile and robust flow cytometry&#8208;based screening platform &#8220;FlOxi&#8221; for directed oxidase evolution. FlOxi utilizes hydrogen peroxide produced by oxidases expressed in E. coli to oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+ (Fenton reaction). Fe3+ mediates the immobilization of a His6&#8208;tagged eGFP (eGFPHis) on the E. coli cell surface, ensuring the identification of beneficial oxidase variants by flow cytometry. FlOxi was validated with two oxidases&#8212;a galactose oxidase (GalOx) and a D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (D&#8208;AAO)&#8212;yielding a GalOx variant (T521A) with a 4.4&#8208;fold lower Km value and a D&#8208;AAO variant (L86M/G14/A48/T205) with a 4.2&#8208;fold higher kcat than their wildtypes. Thus, FlOxi can be used for the evolution of hydrogen peroxide&#8208;producing oxidases and applied for non&#8208;fluorescent substrates.

         <title>Augmenting the Performance of Hydrogenase for Aerobic Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution via Solvent Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are shown to be superior solvents for solar hydrogen generation using natural hydrogenase enzymes. This &#8220;inDEStructible&#8221; system demonstrates that DES&#8208;based engineered solvents stabilise hydrogenase towards oxygen and enable efficient H2 generation in air.







Abstract
This work showcases the performance of [NiFeSe] hydrogenase from Desulfomicrobium baculatum for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen generation in a variety of organic&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents. Despite its well&#8208;known sensitivity towards air and organic solvents, the hydrogenase shows remarkable performance under an aerobic atmosphere in these solvents when paired with a TiO2 photocatalyst. Tuning the water content further increases hydrogen evolution activity to a TOF of 60&#177;3&#8197;s&#8722;1 and quantum yield to 2.3&#177;0.4&#8201;% under aerobic conditions, compared to a TOF of 4&#8197;s&#8722;1 in a purely aqueous solvent. Contrary to common belief, this work therefore demonstrates that placing natural hydrogenases into non&#8208;natural environments can enhance their intrinsic activity beyond their natural performance, paving the way for full water splitting using hydrogenases.

         <title>Visualizing Proteins in Human Cells at Near&#8208;Physiological Concentrations with Sensitive 19F NMR Chemical Tags</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using sensitive 19F NMR chemical tags, globular proteins (6&#8211;40.5&#8197;kD) were observed in human cells at concentrations as low as 1.0&#8197;&#956;M after electroporation delivery. The method further enabled the quantification of protein&#8208;protein interactions in human cells, demonstrating a practical approach for studying the conformations and dynamics of human&#8208;derived proteins in their native conditions.







Abstract
In&#8208;cell NMR spectroscopy is an effective tool for observing proteins at atomic resolution in their native cellular environment. However, its utility is limited by its low sensitivity and the extensive line broadening caused by nonspecific interactions in the cells, which is even more pronounced in human cells due to the difficulty of overexpressing or delivering high concentrations of isotopically labeled proteins. Here, we present a high&#8208;sensitivity tag (wPSP&#8208;6F) containing two trifluoromethyl groups that can efficiently label globular proteins with molecular weights in the 6&#8211;40&#8197;kDa range under mild conditions. This tag allowed us to detect globular proteins in human cells at concentrations as low as 1.0&#8197;&#956;M, which would not have been achievable with 15N or 3&#8208;fluorotyrosine labeling. Moreover, we detected conformational changes and interactions of proteins in the cellular environment. The new sensitive 19F NMR tag may significantly expand the scope of protein NMR in human cells.

         <title>Isolated Tin(IV) Active Sites for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of CO2 to CH4 in Neutral Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;based catalysts are known for their high yield of formate or CO in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, but here we report for the first time that a new Sn&#8208;based catalyst can achieve exceptional partial current density for the CH4 product.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts with non&#8208;copper metal sites for electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (eCO2RR) to hydrocarbons and oxygenates is highly desirable, but still a great challenge. Herein, a stable metal&#8211;organic framework (DMA)4[Sn2(THO)2] (Sn&#8208;THO, THO6&#8722; = triphenylene&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexakis(olate), DMA = dimethylammonium) with isolated and distorted octahedral SnO62&#8722; active sites is reported as an electrocatalyst for eCO2RR, showing an exceptional performance for eCO2RR to the CH4 product rather than the common products formate and CO for reported Sn&#8208;based catalysts. The partial current density of CH4 reaches a high value of 34.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing most reported copper&#8208;based and all non&#8208;Cu metal&#8208;based catalysts. Our experimental and theoretical results revealed that the isolated SnO62&#8722; active site favors the formation of key *OCOH species to produce CH4 and can greatly inhibit the formation of *OCHO and *COOH species to produce *HCOOH and *CO, respectively.

We report a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted nanoplatform ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL for photodynamic therapy by conjugating 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to a 2D Hf12&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic nanophotosensitizer (Hf&#8208;MOL). Upon endocytosis, ALA is released from Hf&#8208;MOL and accumulates in mitochondria for porphyrin IX (PpIX) synthesis, while Hf&#8208;MOL is retained in lysosomes. Light irradiation excites both PpIX and Hf&#8208;MOL to elicit potent cytotoxicity and antitumor responses.







Abstract
The efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) depends on the subcellular localization of photosensitizers. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted nanoparticle platform for enhanced PDT of cancer. By grafting 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to a Hf12&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (Hf&#8208;MOL) via carboxylate coordination, ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL enhanced ALA delivery and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) synthesis in mitochondria, and trapped the Hf&#8208;MOL comprising 5,15&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;benzoatoporphyrin (DBP) photosensitizers in lysosomes. Light irradiation at 630&#8197;nm simultaneously excited PpIX and DBP to generate singlet oxygen and rapidly damage both mitochondria and lysosomes, leading to synergistic enhancement of the PDT efficacy. The dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeted ALA/Hf&#8208;MOL outperformed Hf&#8208;MOL in preclinical PDT studies, with a 2.7&#8208;fold lower half maximal inhibitory concentration in cytotoxicity assays in vitro and a 3&#8208;fold higher cure rate in a colon cancer model in vivo.

         <title>London Dispersion Effects in a Distannene/Tristannane Equilibrium: Energies of their Interconversion and the Suppression of the Monomeric Stannylene Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>

Use of the dispersion energy donor (DED) ligand, C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3, affords an equilibrium mixture of the distannene {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}2, and cyclotristannane {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}3, which suppresses monomer dissociation. Multinuclear NMR and computational analyses indicated that DED interactions are the main arbiter of the dimer&#8208;trimer thermal interconversion.







Abstract
Reaction of {LiC6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3&#8901;Et2O}2 (Cyp=cyclopentyl) (1) of the new dispersion energy donor (DED) ligand, 2,4,6&#8208;triscyclopentylphenyl with SnCl2 afforded a mixture of the distannene {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}2 (2), and the cyclotristannane {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2}3 (3). 2 is favored in solution at higher temperature (345&#8197;K or above) whereas 3 is preferred near 298&#8197;K. Van't Hoff analysis revealed the 3 to 2 conversion has a &#916;H=33.36&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and &#916;S=0.102&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1, which gives a &#916;G300 K=+2.86&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, showing that the conversion of 3 to 2 is an endergonic process. Computational studies show that DED stabilization in 3 is &#8722;28.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 per {Sn(C6H2&#8722;2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3)2 unit, which exceeds the DED energy in 2 of &#8722;16.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 per unit. The data clearly show that dispersion interactions are the main arbiter of the 3 to 2 equilibrium. Both 2 and 3 possess large dispersion stabilization energies which suppress monomer dissociation (supported by EDA results).

         <title>Tough, Reprocessable, and Recyclable Dynamic Covalent Polymers with Ultrastable Long&#8208;Lived Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating dynamic covalent boronic ester linkages with internal B&#8722;N coordination into a commercial epoxy matrix has led to the fabrication of high&#8208;performance polymer&#8208;based materials with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. The polymers show excellent mechanical properties, environmental stability, shape memory, and recyclability, which could be useful for anticounterfeiting, data encryption, and information editing applications.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers, whose emission can persist for a long period after photoexcitation, are of great importance for practical applications. Herein, dynamic covalent boronic ester linkages with internal B&#8722;N coordination are incorporated into a commercial epoxy matrix. The reversible dissociation of B&#8722;N bonds upon loading provides an efficient energy dissipation pathway for the epoxy network, while the rigid epoxy matrix can inhibit the quenching of triplet excitons in boronic esters. The obtained polymers exhibit enhanced mechanical toughness (12.26&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), ultralong RTP (&#964;=540.4&#8197;ms), and shape memory behavior. Notably, there is no apparent decrease in the RTP property upon prolonged immersion in various solvents because the networks are robust. Moreover, the dynamic bonds endow the polymers with superior reprocessablity and recyclability. These novel properties have led to their potential application for information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Breakthrough Separation of 2&#8208;Butene Isomers with High Dynamic Selectivity and Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mixed&#8208;linker MET&#8208;Fe (MET&#8208;Fe&#8208;x) was designed for breakthrough separation of 2&#8208;butene geometric isomers, which are desired for upgrading the raffinates from petrochemical and refinery processes to higher value&#8208;added end products. We reported that the synergetic effect of shape&#8208;selective electrostatic repulsion at the pore window and electrostatic attraction inside the cavity can boost the dynamic separation performance.







Abstract
Developing porous sorbents represents a potential energy&#8208;efficient way for industrial gas separation. However, a bottleneck for reducing the energy penalty is the trade&#8208;off between dynamic adsorption capacity and selectivity. Herein, we showed this problem can be overcome by modulating the kinetic and thermodynamic separation behaviours in metal&#8211;organic frameworks for sieving 2&#8208;butene geometric isomers, which are desired for upgrading the raffinates to higher value&#8208;added end products. We found that the iron&#8208;triazolate framework can realize the selective shape screening of 2&#8208;butene isomers assisted by electrostatic interactions at the pore apertures. Further introducing uncoordinated N binding sites by ligand substitution lowered the gas diffusion barrier and greatly boosted the dynamic separation performance. In breakthrough tests under ambient conditions, trans&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 can be efficiently separated from cis&#8208;2&#8208;C4H8 with a record capacity of 2.10&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 with high dynamic selectivity of 2.39.

         <title>Chemical&#8208;Mechanical Robustness of Single&#8208;Crystalline Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enabled by Surface Atomic Arrangement Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical effect of intrinsic surface composition and structure on the properties of single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides as cathode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries is demonstrated via control of the elemental&#8208;structural surface atomic arrangement. The concomitant concentration gradient and layered&#8208;spinel intertwined structure were thus constructed, enabling the chemical&#8208;mechanical robustness of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes in the electrochemical process.







Abstract
Layered transition metal oxide cathodes have been one of the dominant cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries with efficient Li+ intercalation chemistry. However, limited by the weak layered interaction and unstable surface, mechanical and chemical failure plagues their electrochemical performance, especially for Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. Here, adopting a simultaneous elemental&#8208;structural atomic arrangement control based on the intrinsic Ni&#8722;Co&#8722;Mn system, the surface role is intensively investigated. Within the invariant oxygen sublattice of the crystal, a robust surface with the synergistic concentration gradient and layered&#8208;spinel intertwined structure is constructed on the model single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich cathode. With mechanical strain dissipation and chemical erosion suppression, the cathode exhibits an impressive capacity retention of 82&#8201;% even at the harsh 60&#8201;&#176;C after 150&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C. This work highlights the coupling effect of structure and composition on the chemical&#8208;mechanical properties, and the concept will spur more researches on the cathodes that share the same sublattice.

         <title>11C&#8208;Cyanation of Aryl Fluorides via Nickel and Lithium Chloride&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radiosynthetic method for [11C]aryl nitriles via nickel&#8208;mediated carbon&#8208;fluorine bond activation is reported. This method enables the efficient ipso&#8208;11C&#8208;cyanation of a broad range of aryl fluorides, including pharmaceutical drugs. Stoichiometric reactions and theoretical studies indicate that LiCl greatly promotes the oxidative addition of aryl fluorides to a nickel(0) complex, affording aryl(chloro)nickel(II) complexes at room temperature.







Abstract
Aryl fluorides are expected to be useful as radiolabeling precursors due to their chemical stability and ready availability. However, direct radiolabeling via carbon&#8208;fluorine (C&#8722;F) bond cleavage is a challenging issue due to its significant inertness. Herein, we report a two&#8208;phase radiosynthetic method for the ipso&#8208;11C&#8208;cyanation of aryl fluorides to obtain [11C]aryl nitriles via nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;F bond activation. We also established a practical protocol that avoids the use of a glovebox, except for the initial preparation of a nickel/phosphine mixture, rendering the method applicable for general PET centers. This method enabled the efficient synthesis of diverse [11C]aryl nitriles from the corresponding aryl fluorides, including pharmaceutical drugs. Stoichiometric reactions and theoretical studies indicated a significant promotion effect of lithium chloride on the oxidative addition, affording an aryl(chloro)nickel(II) complex, which serves as a precursor for rapid 11C&#8208;cyanation.

         <title>Photoinduced Fluorescence Switching in Molecular Aggregates by Topological [2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ fluorescence switching in molecular aggregates by the topological [2+2] photocycloaddition of thianaphthene&#8208;dioxide derivatives promises a way to regulate molecular stacking and alter photophysical processes. It was demonstrated that such a photocycloaddition can occur when derivatives are doped in selective polymer matrixes, which paves the way for the visualization of macrophase separation in polymer blends.







Abstract
The optical modulation of fluorescence characteristics in molecular aggregates, which mainly involves diverse molecular stacking and the consequent intermolecular interactions, remains a significant challenge for potential applications in optical anticounterfeiting, data storage, and imaging. Here we successfully realize in situ fluorescence switching in molecular aggregates of thianaphthene&#8208;dioxide derivatives by topological [2+2] photocycloaddition, which represents a promising way to regulate the molecular stacking and alter photophysical processes. Notably, 2&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl)benzo[b]thiophene&#8208;dioxide (BTO&#8208;TF) in both crystal and powder forms exhibits a unique switching from an initial nonfluorescent state to a highly fluorescent state (&#934;PL=0.46) upon UV irradiation, because of the destruction of the [2+2] cycloaddition process by volume expansion of the photodimer. Furthermore, we demonstrate such a [2+2] photocycloaddition can occur when 2&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxypheny)benzo[b]thiophene&#8208;dioxide (BTO&#8208;OH) is doped within selective polymer matrixes, and can be utilized for the visualization of macrophase separation in polymer blends.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Induced Electronic States Regulation Boosting Electroreduction of Dilute Nitrate to Ammonium</title>

B as a modifier was introduced to tune the oxidation state of Cu and further regulate the performance of electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction with dilute NO3&#8722; concentration (&#8804;100&#8197;ppm NO3&#8722;&#8722;N). The optimal Cu(B) exhibits a 100&#8201;% ammonia Faraday efficiency (FENH3) and a record&#8208;high yield of 309&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, superior over the pristine Cu (FENH3=23&#8201;%, 12&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1).







Abstract
Electrochemically converting NO3&#8722; into NH3 offers a promising route for water treatment. Nevertheless, electroreduction of dilute NO3&#8722; is still suffering from low activity and/or selectivity. Herein, B as a modifier was introduced to tune electronic states of Cu and further regulate the performance of electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR) with dilute NO3&#8722; concentration (&#8804;100&#8197;ppm NO3&#8722;&#8722;N). Notably, a linear relationship was established by plotting NH3 yield vs. the oxidation state of Cu, indicating that the increase of Cu+ content leads to an enhanced NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion activity. Under a low NO3&#8722;&#8722;N concentration of 100&#8197;ppm, the optimal Cu(B) catalyst displays a 100&#8201;% NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion at &#8722;0.55 to &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. RHE, and a record&#8208;high NH3 yield of 309&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, which is more than 25&#8197;times compared with the pristine Cu nanoparticles (12&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1). This research provides an effective method for conversion of dilute NO3&#8722; to NH3, which has certain guiding significance for the efficient and green conversion of wastewater in the future.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; concentration (&#8804;100&#8197;ppm NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;N). The optimal Cu(B) exhibits a 100&#8201;% ammonia Faraday efficiency (FE&lt;sub&gt;NH3&lt;/sub&gt;) and a record-high yield of 309&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, superior over the pristine Cu (FE&lt;sub&gt;NH3&lt;/sub&gt;=23&#8201;%, 12&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemically converting NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; into NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; offers a promising route for water treatment. Nevertheless, electroreduction of dilute NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is still suffering from low activity and/or selectivity. Herein, B as a modifier was introduced to tune electronic states of Cu and further regulate the performance of electrochemical NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction reaction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR) with dilute NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; concentration (&#8804;100&#8197;ppm NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;N). Notably, a linear relationship was established by plotting NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. the oxidation state of Cu, indicating that the increase of Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; content leads to an enhanced NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-to-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; conversion activity. Under a low NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;N concentration of 100&#8197;ppm, the optimal Cu(B) catalyst displays a 100&#8201;% NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-to-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; conversion at &#8722;0.55 to &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. RHE, and a record-high NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 309&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is more than 25&#8197;times compared with the pristine Cu nanoparticles (12&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This research provides an effective method for conversion of dilute NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which has certain guiding significance for the efficient and green conversion of wastewater in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Terminal Alkynes as One&#8208;Carbon Donors in [5+1] Heteroannulation: Synthesis of Pyridines via Ynimine Intermediates and Application in the Total Synthesis of Anibamine B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Di&#8208; through pentasubstituted pyridines were synthesized in one operation from readily accessible &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters and terminal alkynes with complete regiochemical control and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility. The first total synthesis of the indolizinium alkaloid anibamine B was accomplished featuring this novel pyridine synthesis as a key step.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] heteroannulation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated oximes and their derivatives with alkynes has been developed into a powerful strategy for the synthesis of pyridines. It nevertheless lacks regioselectivity when unsymmetrically substituted alkynes are used. We report herein the unprecedented synthesis of polysubstituted pyridines by a formal [5+1] heteroannulation of two readily accessible building blocks. A copper&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling between &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated oxime esters and terminal alkynes affords ynimines, which, without isolation, undergo an acid&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction involving ketenimine formation, 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization and aromatization to afford pyridines. Terminal alkynes served as a one&#8208;carbon donor to the pyridine core in this transformation. Di&#8208; through pentasubstituted pyridines are accessible with complete regioselectivity and excellent functional&#8208;group compatibility. The first total synthesis of anibamine B, an indolizinium alkaloid with potent antiplasmodial activity, was accomplished featuring this reaction as a key step.

         <title>Chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x=2&#8211;6) Units Realizing Giant Birefringence with Transparency in the Near&#8208;Infrared for Optoelectronic Materials</title>

The chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x=2&#8211;6) species are shown to be excellent birefringent &#8220;genes&#8221;. The metal polysulfide family is a rich birefringent crystal source, realizing birefringence as large as 0.58, and wide band gaps of approximately 2.0&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Birefringent crystals are requisite optical devices in laser and modern opto&#8208;electronic fields. Development of excellent birefringent materials is still challenging. Herein, the linear or chain&#8208;like [Sx] (x=2&#8211;6) species were theoretically proved to be the origin of the large birefringence, and could be regarded as birefringent genes. Besides, the metal polysulfide family was first proposed to be rich birefringent materials source, among which Cs2S6 realizes giant birefringence 0.58@1064&#8197;nm together with a wide band gap of 1.70&#8197;eV (based on the generalized gradient approximation). Moreover, the first dual&#8208;anion group polysulfide Na4Ba3(S2)4S3 was obtained, showing wide infrared transmission range (0.5&#8211;6.2&#8197;&#956;m), wide band gap (2.3&#8197;eV), and large birefringence (0.37 at 1064&#8197;nm). This work provides a new guiding thought for exploring large birefringence crystals in the future.

         <title>Electronic Transmission Channels Promoting Charge Separation of Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with Controllable Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 22, May 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An accelerated electronic transmission channel with electron&#8208;output &#8220;tentacles&#8221; was designed in conjugated polymers. This channel was found to promote charge separation and photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) represent a promising platform for photocatalytic CO2 fixation owing to their suitable band structures that meet the requirements of the reduction potential of CO2 to value&#8208;added fuels. However, the photocatalytic performance of CPs is rather restrained by the low charge transfer efficiency. Herein, we rationally designed three CPs with a more delocalized electronic transmission channel and planar molecular structure, which are regarded to evidently reduce the exciton binding energy (Eb) and accelerate the internal charge transfer process. Besides, the assembly of suitable electron&#8208;output &#8220;tentacles&#8221; and cocatalysts on the surface of CPs could effectively facilitate interfacial electron delivery. Accordingly, the optimal P&#8208;2CN exhibits an apparent quantum yield of 4.6&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm for photocatalytic CO2 to CO. Further adjusting the amounts of cyano groups and cocatalysts, the CO selectivity could be obtained in the range of 0&#8211;80.5&#8201;%.
