         <title>Polyethylene Upgrading to Liquid Fuels Boosted by Atomic Ce Promoters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrocracking catalysis is a key route to plastic waste upgrading, but the acid site&#8208;driven C&#8208;C cleavage step is relatively sluggish in conventional bifunctional catalysts, dramatically effecting the overall efficiency. We demonstrate here a facile and efficient way to boost the reactivity of acid sites by introducing Ce promoters into Pt/HY catalysts, thus achieving a better metal&#8208;acid balance. Remarkably, 100 % of LDPE can be converted with 80.9 % selectivity of liquid fuels over the obtained Pt/5Ce&#8208;HY catalysts at 300 &#176;C in 2 h. For comparison, Pt/HY only gives 38.8% of LDPE conversion with 21.3% selectivity of liquid fuels. Through multiple experimental studies on the structure&#8208;performance relationship, the Ce species occupied in the supercage are identified as the actual active sites, which possess remarkably&#8208;improved adsorption capability towards short&#8208;chain intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Dynamic Polymerization for Facile Aqueous&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Enzyme&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework Biocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as a hypotoxic and porous scaffold to encapsulate enzyme (enzyme@COF) has inspired numerous interests at the intersection of chemistry, materials, and biological science. In this study, we report a convenient scheme for one&#8208;step, aqueous&#8208;phase synthesis of highly crystalline enzyme@COF biocatalysts. This facile approach relies on an ionic liquid (2 &#181;L of imidazolium ionic liquid)&#8208;mediated dynamic polymerization mechanism, which can facilitate the in situ assembly of enzyme@COF under mild conditions. This green strategy is adaptive to synthesize different biocatalysts with highly crystalline COF &#8220;exoskeleton&#8221;, as well evidenced by the low&#8208;dose cryo&#8208;EM and other characterizations. Attributing to the rigorous sieving effect of crystalline COF pore, the hosted lipase shows non&#8208;native selectivity for aliphatic acid hydrolysis. In addition, the highly crystalline linkage affords COF &#8220;exoskeleton&#8221; with higher photocatalytic activity for in situ production of H2O2, enabling us to construct a self&#8208;cascading photo&#8208;enzyme coupled reactor for pollutants degradation, with a 2.63&#8208;fold degradation rate as the poorly crystalline photo&#8208;enzyme reactor. This work showcases the great potentials of employing green and trace amounts of ionic liquid for one&#8208;step synthesis of crystalline enzyme@COF biocatalysts, and emphasizes the feasibility of diversifying enzyme functions by integrating the reticular chemistry of a COF.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyst Supported by a Single&#8208;Atom Support Accelerates both Electrodes used in the Chlor&#8208;Alkali Industry via Modification of Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Consuming one of the largest amount of electricity, the chlor&#8208;alkali industry supplies basic chemicals for society, which mainly consists of two reactions, hydrogen evolution (HER) and chlorine evolution reaction (CER). Till now, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst applied in this field is still the dimensional stable anode (DSA), which consumes a large amount of noble metal of Ru and Ir. It is thus necessary to develop new types of catalysts. In this study, an organocatalyst anchored on the single&#8208;atom support (SAS) is put forward. It exhibits high catalytic efficiency towards both HER and CER with an overpotential of 21 mV and 20 mV at 10 mA&#42895;cm&#8208;2. With this catalyst on both electrodes, the energy consumption is cut down by 1.2 % compared with the commercial system under industrial conditions. Based on this novel catalyst and the high activity, the mechanism of modifying non&#8208;covalent interaction is demonstrated to be reliable for the catalyst&#8217;s design. This work not only provides efficient catalysts for the chlor&#8208;alkali industry but also points out that the SACs can also act as support, providing new twists for the development of SACs and organic molecules in the next step.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Arylation Enables Direct Synthesis of Atropisomeric Phosphines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atropisomeric phosphines hold considerable significance in asymmetric catalysis, yet their synthesis presents a formidable challenge owing to intricate multistep procedures. In this context, a groundbreaking methodology has been presented for their preparation. This innovative approach entails an atroposelective rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation employing aryl and heteroaryl halides, chelated by a P(III) center. The essence of this strategy lies in its ability to directly construct chiral phosphine ligands in a single step, thereby exhibiting exceptional efficiency in terms of atom and redox economy. Illustrative examples serve to demonstrate the immense potential of in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed ligands in asymmetric catalysis. Mechanistic experiments have further provided invaluable insights into this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Electrocatalytic Decarboxylative Arylation to Access Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a pressing need, particularly in the field of drug discovery, for general methods that will enable direct coupling of tertiary alkyl fragments to (hetero)aryl halides. Herein a uniquely powerful and simple set of conditions for achieving this transformation with unparalleled generality and chemoselectivity is disclosed. This new protocol is placed in context with other recently reported methods, applied to simplify the routes of known bioactive building blocks molecules, and scaled up in both batch and flow. The role of pyridine additive as well as the mechanism of this reaction are interrogated through Cyclic Voltammetry studies, titration experiments, control reactions with Ni(0) and Ni(II)&#8208;complexes, and ligand optimization data. Those studies indicate that the formation of a BINAPNi(0) is minimized and the formation of an active pyridine&#8208;stabilized Ni(I) species is sustained during the reaction. Our preliminary mechanistic studies ruled out the involvement of Ni(0) species in this electrochemical cross&#8208;coupling, which is mediated by Ni(I) species via a Ni(I)&#8208;Ni(II)&#8208;Ni(III)&#8208;Ni(I) catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report soluble tetrakis&#8208;biphenyl substituted pentacenes comprised of sp2 carbons and synthesized from pentacene&#8208;5,7,12,14&#8208;tetraone. Intramolecular Yamamoto coupling of two tetrakis(chlorobiphenylyl)pentacenes yields helical, doubly wrapped pentacenes, in which the quaterphenylene units solubilize the pentacenes and shield their central anthracene units to an unprecedented degree. The criss&#8208;cross&#8208;bridged pentacenes resist (photo)oxidation, Diels&#8208;Alder reactions and are much less reactive than TIPS&#8208;ethynylated pentacene. Extension of this concept might provide access to the larger acenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired trace hydroxyl&#8208;rich electrolyte additives for high&#8208;rate and stable Zn&#8208;ion batteries at low temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;rate and stable Zn&#8208;ion batteries working at low temperatures are highly desirable for practical applications, but are challenged by sluggish kinetics and severe corrosion. Herein, inspired by frost&#8208;resistant plants, we report trace hydroxyl&#8208;rich electrolyte additives that implement a dual remodeling effect for high&#8208;performance low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The additive with high Zn absorbability not only remodels Zn2+ primary solvent shell by alternating H2O molecules, but also forms a shielding layer thus remodeling the Zn surface, which effectively enhances fast Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation reaction kinetics and prohibits Zn anode corrosion. Taking trace &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose (&#945;DG) as a demonstration, the electrolyte obtains a low freezing point of &#8208;55.3 &#176;C, and the Zn//Zn cell can stably cycle for 2000 h at 5 mA cm&#8208;2 under &#8208;25 &#176;C, with a high cumulative capacity of 5000 mAh cm&#8208;2. A full battery that stably operates for 10000 cycles at &#8208;50 &#176;C is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Guest&#8208;Facilitated Heteroleptic Assemblyof Helical Anionocages Enables Reversible Chirality Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a novel strategy for reversible modulation of supramolecular chirality, based on guest&#8208;facilitated heteroleptic assembly of helical anionocages. Two triple&#8208;stranded helical anionocages, including a chiral cage 1 (A2L13) and a crown ether functionalized, achiral cage 2 (A2L23) were synthesized by anion coordination of bis&#8208;monourea&#8208;based ligands and PhPO32&#8208;.&#160;Both cages exhibited favorable binding with tetraethylammonium TEA+ and cobaltocenium Cob+ (endo&#8208;guest, bound in the cavity).&#160;Additionally, cage&#160;2 could reversibly release and recapture of the guests through binding the exo&#8208;guest potassium ions (K+) in the crown ethers and subsequent removal of the K+ by [2,2,2]&#8208;cryptand. The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of cage 1 was not significantly affected by guest encapsulation, or mixing with the &#8220;empty&#8221;cage 2. However, in the presence of both cage 2 and an endo&#8208;guest/exo&#8208;guest, the Cotton effects were reversed at 391 nm and significantly enhanced at 310 nm. This observation was attributed to the guest&#8208;facilitated formation of heteroleptic cages that enabled effective chirality transfer from the chiral to the achiral ligands. The CD changes induced by K+ could be fully reversed by removing it with [2,2,2]&#8208;cryptand. Sequential addition and removal of K+ allowed reversible modulation of the chirality for at least 10 cycles without significant attenuation.</dc:description>

         <title>Lateral Heterometal Junction Rectifier Fabricated by Sequential Transmetallation of Coordination Nanosheet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterostructures of two&#8208;dimensional materials realise novel and enhanced physical phenomena, making them attractive research targets. Compared to inorganic materials, coordination nanosheets have virtually infinite combinations, leading to tunability of physical properties and are promising candidates for heterostructure fabrication. Although stacking of coordination materials into vertical heterostructures is widely reported, reports of lateral coordination material heterostructures are few. Here we show the successful fabrication of a seamless lateral heterojunction showing diode behaviour, by sequential and spatially limited immersion of a new metalladithiolene coordination nanosheet, Zn3BHT, into aqueous Cu(II) and Fe(II) solutions. Upon immersion, the Zn centres in insulating Zn3BHT are replaced by Cu or Fe ions, resulting in conductivity. The transmetallation is spatially confined, occurring only within the immersed area. We anticipate that our results will be a starting point towards exploring transmetallation of various two&#8208;dimensional materials to produce lateral heterojunctions, by providing a new and facile synthetic route.</dc:description>

         <title>Hygroscopic Solutes Enable Non&#8208;van der Waals Electrolytes for Fire&#8208;Tolerant Dual&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermal safety issues of batteries have hindered their large&#8208;scale applications. Nonflammable electrolytes improved safety but solvent evaporation above 100 &#186;C limited thermal tolerance, lacking reliability. Herein, fire&#8208;tolerant metal&#8208;air batteries were realized by introducing solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes whose hygroscopic solutes could spontaneously reabsorb the evaporated water solvent. Using Zn/CaCl2&#8208;in&#8208;air/carbon batteries as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, they failed upon burning at 631.8 &#186;C but self&#8208;recovered then by reabsorbing water from the air at room temperature. Different from conventional aqueous electrolytes whose irreversible thermal transformation is determined by the boiling points of solvents, solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes make this transformation determined by the much higher decomposition temperature of solutes. It was found that stronger intramolecular bonds instead of intermolecular (van der Waals) interactions were strongly correlated to ultra&#8208;high tolerance temperatures of our solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes, inspiring a concept of non&#8208;van der Waals electrolytes. Our study would improve the understanding of the thermal properties of electrolytes, guide the design of solute&#8208;in&#8208;air electrolytes, and enhance battery safety.</dc:description>

         <title>Polydentate Ligand Reinforced Chelating to Stabilize Buried Interface toward High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The instability of the buried interface poses a serious challenge for commercializing perovskite photovoltaic technology. Herein, we report  a  polydentate ligand reinforced chelating strategy to strengthen the stability of buried interface by managing interfacial defects and stress. The bis(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) (methoxycarbonylmethyl)phosphonate (BTP) is employed to manipulate the buried interface. The C=O, P=O and two &#8208;CF3 functional groups in BTP synergistically passivate the defects from the surface of SnO2 and the bottom surface of the perovskite layer. Moreover, The BTP modification contributes to mitigated interfacial residual tensile stress, promoted perovskite crystallization, and reduced interfacial energy barrier. The multidentate ligand modulation strategy is appropriate for different perovskite compositions. Due to much reduced nonradiative recombination and heightened interface contact, the device with BTP yields a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.63%, which is one of the highest efficiencies ever reported for devices fabricated in the air environment. The unencapsulated BTP&#8208;modified devices degrade to 98.6%&#160;and 84.2% of their initial PCE values after over 3000 h of aging in the ambient environment and after 1728 h of thermal stress, respectively. This work provides insights into strengthening the stability of the buried interface by engineering multidentate chelating ligand molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Benzoxasiloles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of     silicon&#8208;stereogenic   benzoxasiloles  has been realized via intramolecular Si&#8208;O coupling of [2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)phenyl]silanes.

         <title>Photoinduced Decarboxylative Radical Phosphinylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is an unprecedented protocol for C(sp3)&#8211;phosphinylation. With 1 mol % 4CzIPN (1,2,3,5&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene) as the catalyst, the visible light&#8208;induced reaction of redox&#8208;active esters of aliphatic carboxylic acids with dimethyl arylphosphonites or diethyl alkylphosphonites at room temperature provides the corresponding decarboxylative phosphinylation products in satisfactory yields. The protocol exhibits broad substrate scope and wide functional group compatibility, enabling the late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules and rapid synthesis of bioactive phosphinic acids such as glutamine synthetase phosphinothricin and a kynureninase inhibitor. A radical&#8211;polar crossover mechanism involving the formation and subsequent oxidation of phosphoranyl radicals followed by nucleophilic demethylation (or deethylation) is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of S&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides Using Salen Aluminum Catalysts: A route to High&#8208;Isotactic Functionalized Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polythioesters are important sustainable polymers with broad applications. The ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of S&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides (SCA) can afford polythioesters with functional groups that are typically difficult to prepare by ROP of thiolactones. Typical methods involving organocatalysts, like dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and triethylamine (Et3N), have been plagued by uncontrolled polymerization, including epimerization for most SCAs resulting in the loss of isotacticity. Here, we report the use of salen aluminum catalysts for the selective ROP of various SCAs without epimerization, affording functionalized polythioester with high molecular weight up to 37.6 kDa and the highest Pm value up to 0.99. Notably, the ROP of TlaSCA (SCA prepared from thiolactic acid) generates the first example of a crystalline isotactic poly(thiolactic acid), which exhibited a distinct Tm value of 152.6 &#176;C. Effective ligand tailoring governs the binding affinity between the sulfide chain&#8208;end and the metal center, thereby maintaining the activity of organometallic catalysts and reducing the occurrence of epimerization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Multimodal Engineering of Catalytic Interfaces Confers Multi&#8208;Site Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Internal Preconcentration and Accelerating Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly efficient catalysts to address the shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) remains a formidable challenge. In this study, a series of multi&#8208;site catalytic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MSC&#8208;MOFs) were elaborated through multimodal molecular engineering to regulate both the reactant diffusion and catalysis processes. MSC&#8208;MOFs were crafted with nanocages featuring collaborative specific adsorption/catalytic interfaces formed by exposed mixed&#8208;valence metal sites and surrounding adsorption sites. This design facilitates internal preconcentration, a coadsorption mechanism, and continuous efficient catalytic conversion toward polysulfides concurrently. Leveraging these attributes, LSBs with an MSC&#8208;MOF&#8208;Ti catalytic interlayer demonstrated a 62% improvement in discharge capacity and cycling stability. This resulted in achieving a high areal capacity (11.57 mAh cm&#8722;2) at a high sulfur loading (9.32 mg cm&#8722;2) under lean electrolyte conditions, along with a pouch cell exhibiting an ultra&#8208;high gravimetric energy density of 350.8 Wh kg&#8722;1. Lastly, this work introduces a universal strategy for the development of a new class of efficient catalytic MOFs, promoting SRR and suppressing the shuttle effect at the molecular level. The findings shed light on the design of advanced porous catalytic materials for application in high&#8208;energy LSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion on Atomically Precise Silver Nanocluster/MXene Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3RR) to synthesize ammonia (NH3) provides a competitive manner for carbon neutrality and decentralized NH3 synthesis. Atomically precise nanoclusters, as an advantageous platform for investigating the NO3RR mechanisms and actual active sites, remain largely underexplored due to the poor stability. Herein, we report a (NH4)9[Ag9(mba)9] nanoclusters (Ag9 NCs) loaded on Ti3C2 MXene (Ag9/MXene) for highly efficient NO3RR performance towards ambient NH3 synthesis with improved stability in neutral medium. The composite structure of MXene and Ag9 NCs enables a tandem catalysis process for nitrate reduction, significantly increasing the selectivity and FE of NH3. Besides, compared with individual Ag9 NCs, Ag9/MXene has better stability with the current density performed no decay after 108 hours of reaction. This work provides a strategy for improving the catalytic activity and stability of atomically precise metal NCs, expanding the mechanism research and application of metal NCs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Inherent &#8220;soft&#8221; ionic lattice nature of halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs), triggered by the weak Pb&#8208;X (X=Cl, Br, I) bond, is recognized as the primary culprit for their serious instability. A promising way is to construct exceedingly strong ionic interaction inside the QDs and increase their crystal cohesive energy by substituting the interior X&#8208; with highly electronegative F&#8208;, however, which is challenging and hitherto remains unreported. Here, a &#8220;whole&#8208;body&#8221; fluorination strategy is proposed for strengthening the interior bonding architecture of QDs, wherein the F&#8208; are uniformly distributed throughout the whole nanocrystal encompassing both the interior lattice and surface, successfully stabilizing their &#8220;soft&#8221; crystal lattice and passivating surface defects. This approach effectively mitigates their intrinsic instability issues including light&#8208;induced phase segregation. As a result, light&#8208;emitting devices based on these QDs exhibit exceptional efficiency and remarkable stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophilic Cocrystals with Water Switched Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing water molecules to regulate the luminescence properties of solid materials is highly challenging. Herein, we develop a strategy to produce water&#8208;triggered luminescence&#8208;switching cocrystals by coassembling hydrophilic donors with electron&#8208;deficient acceptors, where 1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) was used as the electron acceptor and pyridyl benzimidazole derivatives were used as the electron donors enabling multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonds. Two cocrystals, namely 2PYTC and 4PYTC were obtained and showed heat&#8208;activated emission, and such emission could be quenched or weakened by adding water molecules. The cocrystal structure exhibited the donor molecule that can form multiple hydro bonds with water and acceptor molecules due to the many nitrogen atoms of them. The analyses of the photophysical data, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and other data confirmed the reversible fluorescence "on&#8208;off" effects were caused by eliminating and adding water molecules in the crystal lattice. The density functional theory calculations indicate that the vibration of the O&#8208;H bond of water molecules in the cocrystal can absorb the excitation energy and suppress fluorescence. Furthermore, the obtained cocrystals also showed temperature, humidity, and H+/NH4+ responsive emission behavior, which allows their applications as thermal and humidity sensors, and multiple information encryptions. This research paves the way for preparing intelligent hydrophilic organic cocrystal luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfonium Rearrangements enable a Direct Preparation of Sulfenyl Imidinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfenyl imidinium salts are a virtually unexplored class of intermediates in organic chemistry. Herein, we demonstrate how sulfonium rearrangements can be deployed to access these versatile synthetic intermediates, bearing three contiguous (and congested) stereogenic centers, with high levels of selectivity. The synthetic value of the scaffold was unraveled by selective transformations into a range of building blocks, including 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives and sulfonolactones.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Fate of Copper Ions in the Synthesis of Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper is a crucial catalyst in the synthesis of graphdiyne (GDY). However, as catalysts, the final fate of the copper ions has hardly been concerned, which are usually treated as impurities.&#160;Here, it is&#160;observed that after simple washing&#160;with water and ethanol, GDY still contains&#160;a certain amount of copper ions, and demonstrated that the copper ions are adsorbed&#160;at&#160;the atomic layers of GDY.&#160;Furthermore, we transformed in situ the copper ions&#160;into ultrathin&#160;Cu&#160;nanocrystals, and the obtained Cu/GDY hybrids&#160;can be generally converted into a&#160;series of metal/GDY hybrid materials, such as Ag/GDY, Au/GDY, Pt/GDY, Pd/GDY, and Rh/GDY. The&#160;Cu/GDY hybrids&#160;exhibit&#160;extraordinary surface enhanced Raman&#160;scattering effect and can be applied in pollutant efficient&#160;enrichment and detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Electronegativity Cationic High&#8208;Entropy Doping to Trigger Stable Anion Redox Activity for High&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;Free Layered Cathodes&#160;in Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#160;(NCM&#8208;811) exhibits the highest capacity in commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), and the high Ni content (80%) provides the only route for high energy density. However, the cationic structure instability arisen from the increase of Ni content (&gt;80%) limits the further increase of the capacity, and inevitable O2&#160;release&#160;related to anionic structure instability hinders the utilization of anion redox activity. Here, by comparing various combinations of high&#8208;entropy dopants substituted Co element, we propose a low&#8208;electronegativity cationic high&#8208;entropy doping strategy to fabricate the high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free layered cathode (LiNi0.8Mn0.12Al0.02Ti0.02Cr0.02Fe0.02O2) that exhibits much higher capacity and cycling stability. Configurational disorder originated from cationic&#160;high&#8208;entropy doping in transition metal (TM) layer, anchors the oxidized lattice oxygen&#160;((O2)n&#8208;)&#160;to preserve&#160;high (O2)n&#8208;&#160;content, triggering the anion redox activity. Electron transfer induced by applying TM dopants with lower electronegativity than that of Co element, increases the electron density of O in TM&#8208;O octahedron (TM&#8208;O6) configuration to reach higher (O2)n&#8208;&#160;content, resulting in the higher anion redox activity. With exploring the stabilization effect on both cations and anions of high&#8208;entropy doping and low&#8208;electronegativity cationic modified anion redox activity, we propose an innovative and variable pathway for rationally tuning the properties of commercial cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Synthesis and Functionalization of Bicycloalkanes, Cubanes and Related Bioisosteres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bicycloalkanes, cubanes and their structural analogues have emerged as bioisosteres of (hetero)arenes. To meet increasing demand, the chemical community has developed a plethora of novel synthetic methods. In this review, we assess the progress made in the field of light&#8208;driven construction and functionalization of such relevant molecules. We have focused on diverse structural targets, as well as on reaction processes giving access to: (i) [1.1.1]&#8208;bicyclopentanes (BCPs); (ii) [2.2.1]&#8208;bicyclohexanes (BCHs); (iii) [3.1.1]&#8208;bicycloheptanes (BCHeps); and (iv) cubanes; as well as other structurally related scaffolds. Finally, future perspectives dealing with the identification of novel reaction manifolds to access new functionalized bioisosteric units are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Suppressing Exciton&#8208;Vibration Coupling to Prolong Exciton Lifetime of Nonfullerene Acceptors Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The limited exciton lifetime (&#964;, generally &lt;1 ns) leads to short exciton diffusion length (LD) of organic semiconductors, which is the bottleneck issue impeding the further improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, efficient strategies to prolong intrinsic &#964; are rare and vague. Herein, we propose a facile method to efficiently reduce vibrational frequency of molecular skeleton and suppress exciton&#8208;vibration coupling to decrease non&#8208;radiative decay rate and thus prolong &#964; via deuterating nonfullerene acceptors. The &#964; remarkably increases from 0.90 ns (non&#8208;deuterated L8&#8208;BO) to 1.35 ns (deuterated L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D), which is the record for organic photovoltaic materials. Besides, the inhibited molecular vibration improves molecular planarity of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D for enhanced exciton diffusion coefficient. Consequently, the LD increases from 7.9 nm (L8&#8208;BO) to 10.7 nm (L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D). The prolonged LD of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D enables PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D&#8208;based bulk heterojunction OSCs to acquire higher PCEs of 18.5% with more efficient exciton dissociation and weaker charge carrier recombination than PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based counterparts. Moreover, benefiting from the prolonged LD, D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;D&#8208;based pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction OSCs achieve an impressive PCE of 19.3%, which is among the highest values. This work provides an efficient strategy to increase the &#964; and thus LD of organic semiconductors, boosting PCEs of OSCs.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the discovery of graphene, the development of new two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials has received considerable interest. Recently, as a newly emerging member of the 2D family, 2D metastable&#8208;phase oxides that combine the unique advantages of metal oxides, 2D structures, and metastable&#8208;phase materials have shown enormous potential in various catalytic reactions. In this review, the potential of various 2D materials to form a metastable&#8208;phase is predicted. The advantages of 2D metastable&#8208;phase oxides for advanced applications, reliable methods of synthesizing 2D metastable&#8208;phase oxides, and the application of these oxides in different catalytic reactions are presented. Finally, the challenges associated with 2D metastable&#8208;phase oxides and future perspectives are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenation of CO2 to Light Olefins over ZnZrOx/SSZ&#8208;13</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting CO2 to olefins is an ideal route to achieve carbon neutrality. However, selective hydrogenation to light olefins, especially single&#8208;component olefin, while reducing CH4 formation remains a great challenge. Herein, we developed ZnZrOx/SSZ&#8208;13 tandem catalyst for the highly selective hydrogenation of CO2 to light olefins. This catalyst shows C2=&#8208;C4= and propylene selectivity up to 89.4% and 52%, respectively, while CH4 is suppressed down to 2%, and there is no obvious deactivation. It is demonstrated that the isolated moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) of SSZ&#8208;13 promotes the rapid conversion of intermediate species derived from ZnZrOx, thereby enhancing the kinetic coupling of the reactions and inhibit the formation of alkanes and improve the light olefins selectivity. Besides, the weaker BAS of SSZ&#8208;13 promote the conversion of intermediates into aromatics with 4&#8208;6 methyl groups, which is conducive to the aromatics cycle. Accordingly, more propene can be obtained by elevating the Si/Al ratio of SSZ&#8208;13. This provides an efficient strategy for CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins with high selectivity.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Converting CO2 to olefins is an ideal route to achieve carbon neutrality. However, selective hydrogenation to light olefins, especially single-component olefin, while reducing CH4 formation remains a great challenge. Herein, we developed ZnZrOx/SSZ-13 tandem catalyst for the highly selective hydrogenation of CO2 to light olefins. This catalyst shows C2=-C4= and propylene selectivity up to 89.4% and 52%, respectively, while CH4 is suppressed down to 2%, and there is no obvious deactivation. It is demonstrated that the isolated moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) of SSZ-13 promotes the rapid conversion of intermediate species derived from ZnZrOx, thereby enhancing the kinetic coupling of the reactions and inhibit the formation of alkanes and improve the light olefins selectivity. Besides, the weaker BAS of SSZ-13 promote the conversion of intermediates into aromatics with 4-6 methyl groups, which is conducive to the aromatics cycle. Accordingly, more propene can be obtained by elevating the Si/Al ratio of SSZ-13.

         <title>Site&#8208;specific Deaminative Trifluoromethylation of Aliphatic Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into organic molecules is of paramount importance in modern synthetic chemistry and medicinal chemistry. While methods for constructing C(sp2)&#8208;CF3 bonds have been well established, the advancement of practical and comprehensive approaches for forming C(sp3)&#8208;CF3 bonds remains considerably restricted. In this work, we describe an efficient and site&#8208;specific deaminative trifluoromethylation reaction of aliphatic primary amines to afford the corresponding alkyl trifluoromethyl compounds. The reaction proceeds at room temperature with readily accessible N&#8208;anomeric amide (Levin&#8217;s reagent) and bench&#8208;stable bpyCu(CF3)3 (Grushin&#8217;s reagent) under blue light. The protocol features mild reaction conditions, good functional group tolerance, and moderate to good yields. Remarkably, the method can be applied to the direct, late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of natural products and bioactive molecules. Experimental mechanistic studies were conducted, and a radical mechanism is proposed, wherein the dual roles of Grushin&#8217;s reagent have been elucidated.</dc:description>

         <title>Torsional Motion Effect on the Quintet Multiexciton Formation through Intramolecular Singlet Fission in Ferrocene&#8208;Bridged Pentacene Dimers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of ferrocene (Fc)&#8208;bridged pentacene (Pc)&#8208;dimers [Fc&#8208;Ph(2,n)&#8208;(Pc)2: n shows the number of phenylene spacers] were synthesized to examine the tortional motion effect of Fc&#8208;terminated phenylene linkers on the strongly coupled quintet multiexciton (5TT) formation through intramolecular singlet fission (ISF). Fc&#8208;Ph(2,4)&#8208;(Pc)2 has the relatively small electronic coupling and large conformational flexibility according to spectroscopic and theoretical analyses. Fc&#8208;Ph(2,4)&#8208;(Pc)2 exhibits high&#8208;yield&#160;5TT together with quantitative singlet TT (1TT) generation through ISF. This demonstrates much more efficient ISF than those of the other less flexible Pc&#8208;dimers. The activation entropy in 1TT spin conversion of Fc&#8208;Ph(2,4)&#8208;(Pc)2 is larger than those of the other systems due to the larger conformational flexibility, associated with the torsional motion of the linkers. The torsional motion of linkers in&#160;1TT is attributable to weakened metal&#8208;ligand bonding in the Fc due to hybridization of hole level of Pc to Fc in 1TT unpaired orbitals.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovering Electrochemistry with an Electrochemistry&#8208;Informed Neural Network (ECINN)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Machine learning is increasingly integrated into chemistry research by guiding experimental procedures, correlating structure, and function, interpreting large experimental datasets, to distill scientific insights that might be challenging with traditional methods. Such applications, however, largely focus on gaining insights via big data and/or big computation, while neglecting the valuable chemical prior knowledge dwelling in chemists&#8217; minds. In this paper, we introduce an Electrochemistry&#8208;Informed Neural Network (ECINN) by explicitly embedding electrochemistry priors including the Butler&#8208;Volmer (BV), Nernst and diffusion equations on the backbone of neural networks for multi&#8208;task discovery of electrochemistry parameters. We applied the ECINN to voltammetry experiments of &#160;and redox couples to discover electrode kinetics and mass transport parameters. Notably, ECINN seamlessly integrated mass transport with BV to analyze the entire voltammogram to infer transfer coefficients directly, so offering a new approach to Tafel analysis by outdating various mass transport correction methods. In addition, ECINN can help discover the nature of electron transfer and is shown to refute incorrect physics if imposed.&#160; This work encourages chemists to embed their domain knowledge into machine learning models to start a new paradigm of chemistry&#8208;informed machine learning for better accountability, interpretability, and generalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing *CO2 Intermediates at the Acidic Interface using Molecularly Dispersed Cobalt Phthalocyanine as Catalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) operating in acidic media circumvents the problems of carbonate formation and CO2 crossover in neutral/alkaline electrolyzers. Alkali cations have been universally recognized as indispensable components for acidic CO2R, while they cause the inevitable issue of salt precipitation. It is therefore desirable to realize alkali&#8208;cation&#8208;free CO2R in pure acid. However, without alkali cations, stabilizing *CO2 intermediates by catalyst itself at the acidic interface poses as a challenge. Herein, we first demonstrate that a carbon nanotube&#8208;supported molecularly dispersed cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc@CNT) catalyst provides the Co single&#8208;atom active site with energetically localized d states to strengthen the adsorbate&#8208;surface interactions, which stabilizes *CO2 intermediates at the acidic interface (pH = 1). As a result, we realize CO2 conversion to CO in pure acid with a faradaic efficiency of 60% at pH = 2 in flow cell. Furthermore, CO2 is successfully converted in cation exchanged membrane&#8208;based electrode assembly with a faradaic efficiency of 73%. For CoPc@CNT, acidic conditions also promote the intrinsic activity of CO2R compared to alkaline conditions, since the potential&#8208;limiting step, *CO2 to *COOH, is pH&#8208;dependent. This work provides a new understanding for the stabilization of reaction intermediates and facilitates the designs of catalysts and devices for acidic CO2R.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomative spirocyclization reactions represent a promising means to convert arenes into three&#8208;dimensional architectures; however, controlling the regioselectivity of radical dearomatization with nonactivated arenes to afford the spirocyclizative 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization other than its kinetically preferred 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization is exceptionally challenging. Here we disclose a novel strategy for dearomative 1,2&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;amidoximation of (hetero)arenes enabled by direct visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced homolysis of N&#8211;NO bonds of nitrosamides, giving rise to various highly regioselective amidoximated spirocycles that previously have been inaccessible or required elaborate synthetic efforts.

         <title>Chaotropic Nanoelectrocatalysis: Chemically Disrupting Water Intermolecular Network at the Point&#8208;of&#8208;Catalysis to Boost Green Hydrogen Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient green hydrogen production through electrocatalytic water splitting serves as a powerful catalyst for realizing a carbon&#8208;free hydrogen economy. However, current electrocatalytic designs face challenges such as poor hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance (Tafel slope, 100 &#8208; 140 mV dec&#8722;1) because water molecules are thermodynamically trapped within their extensive hydrogen bonding network. Herein, we drive efficient HER by manipulating the local water microenvironment near the electrocatalyst. This is achieved by functionalizing the nanoelectrocatalyst&#8217;s surface with a monolayer of chaotropic molecules to chemically weaken water&#8208;water interactions directly at the point&#8208;of&#8208;catalysis. Notably, our chaotropic design demonstrates a superior Tafel slope (77 mV dec&#8208;1) and the lowest overpotential (0.3 V at 10 mA cm&#8208;2), surpassing its kosmotropic counterparts (which reinforces the water molecular network) and previously reported electrocatalytic designs by up to ~2&#8208;fold and ~3&#8208;fold, respectively. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations highlight the critical role of chaotropic surface chemistry in disrupting the water intermolecular network, thereby releasing free/weakly bound water molecules that strongly interact with the electrocatalyst to boost HER. Our study provides a unique molecular approach that can be readily integrated with emerging electrocatalytic materials to rapidly advance the electrosynthesis of green hydrogen, holding immense promise for sustainable chemical and energy applications.</dc:description>

This is achieved by functionalizing the nanoelectrocatalyst&#8217;s surface with a monolayer of chaotropic molecules to chemically weaken water-water interactions directly at the point-of-catalysis. Notably, our chaotropic design demonstrates a superior Tafel slope (77 mV dec-1) and the lowest overpotential (0.3 V at 10 mA cm-2), surpassing its kosmotropic counterparts (which reinforces the water molecular network) and previously reported electrocatalytic designs by up to ~2-fold and ~3-fold, respectively. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations highlight the critical role of chaotropic surface chemistry in disrupting the water intermolecular network, thereby releasing free/weakly bound water molecules that strongly interact with the electrocatalyst to boost HER. Our study provides a unique molecular approach that can be readily integrated with emerging electrocatalytic materials to rapidly advance the electrosynthesis of green hydrogen, holding immense promise for sustainable chemical and energy applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The 1,4&#8208;dithiin motif is known for its reversible redox properties to generate radical cations and diradical dications and thus is interesting for organic electronic applications. However, examples where this motif is embedded into chiral larger fused aromatic compounds is very rare. Here we describe the syntheses of several structurally related pyrene fused dithiins and their spectroscopic investigations with a focus on tuning circular dichroism in respect the g values depending on their connectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>All&#8208;Round Ionic Liquids for Shuttle&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs) is hindered by the rampant Zn dendrites growth, parasite corrosion, and polyiodide shuttling. In this work, ionic liquid EMIM[OAc] is employed as an all&#8208;round solution to mitigate challenges on both the Zn anode and the iodine cathode side. First, the EMIM+&#160;embedded lean&#8208;water inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and inert solvation sheath modulated by OAc&#8208;&#160;effectively repels H2O molecules away from the Zn anode surface. The preferential adsorption of EMIM+&#160;on Zn metal facilitates uniform Zn nucleation via a steric hindrance effect. Second, EMIM+&#160;can reduce the polyiodide shuttling by hindering the iodine dissolution and forming an EMIM+&#8211;I3&#8211;&#160;dominated phase. These effects holistically enhance the cycle life, which is manifested by both Zn||Zn symmetric cells and Zn&#8208;I2&#160;full cells. ZIBs with EAc deliver a capacity decay rate of merely 0.01 &#8240; per cycle after over 18,000 cycles at 4 A g&#8208;1, and lower self&#8208;discharge and better calendar life than the ZIBs without ionic liquid EAc additive.</dc:description>

         <title>Pivotal Role of Geometry Regulation on O&#8722;O Bond Formation Mechanism of Bimetallic Water Oxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we highlight the impact of catalyst geometry on the formation of O&#8722;O bonds in Cu2 and Fe2 catalysts. A series of Cu2 complexes with diverse linkers were designed as electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Interestingly, the catalytic performance of these Cu2 complexes is enhanced as their molecular skeleton become more rigid, which contrast with the behavior observed in our previous investigation with Fe2 analogs. Moreover, mechanistic studies reveal that the reactivity of the bridging O atom results in distinct pathways for O&#8722;O bond formation in Cu2 and Fe2 catalysts. In Cu2 systems, the coupling takes place between a terminal CuIII&#8722;OH and a bridging &#956;&#8722;O&#8226; radical. Whereas in Fe2 systems, it involves the coupling of two terminal Fe&#8722;oxo entities. Furthermore, an in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;activity analysis uncovers the spatial geometric prerequisites for the coupling of the terminal OH with the bridging &#956;&#8722;O&#8226; radical, ultimately leading to the O&#8722;O bond formation. Overall, this study emphasizes the critical role of precisely adjusting the spatial geometry of catalysts to align with the O&#8722;O bonding pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and Stable Tin&#8208;Lead Mixed Perovskite Solar Cells Using Post&#8208;Treatment Additive with Synergistic Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inhibiting the oxidation of Sn2+ during the crystallization process of Sn&#8208;Pb mixed perovskite is found to be as important as the oxidation resistance of precursor solution to achieve high efficiency, but less investigated. Considering the excellent reduction feature of hydroquinone and the hydrophobicity of tert&#8208;butyl group, an antioxidant 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhydroquinone (DBHQ) was introduced into Sn&#8208;Pb mixed perovskite films using an anti&#8208;solvent approach. Interestingly, we find that DBHQ can act as function alterable additive during its utilization. On the one hand, DBHQ can restrict the oxidation of Sn2+ during the crystallization process, facilitating the fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite film; on the other hand, the generated oxidation product 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DBBQ) can functionalize as defect passivator to inhibit the charge recombination. As a result, this synergetic effect renders the Sn&#8208;Pb mixed PSC a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 23.0%, which is significantly higher than the reference device (19.6%). Furthermore, the unencapsulated DBQH&#8208;modified PSCs exhibited excellent long&#8208;term stability and thermal stability, with the devices maintaining 84.2% and 78.9% of the initial PCEs after aging at 25&#176;C and 60&#176;C for 800 h and 120 h under N2 atmosphere, respectively. Therefore, the functional alterable strategy provides a novel cornerstone for high&#8208;performance Sn&#8208;Pb mixed PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymeric Metal Halides with Bright Luminescence and Versatile Processability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most of current metal halide materials, including all inorganic and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids, are crystalline materials with poor workability and plasticity that limit their application scope. Here, we develop a novel class of materials termed polymeric metal halides (PMHs) through introducing polycations into antimony&#8208;based metal halide materials as A&#8208;site cations. A series of PMHs with orange&#8208;yellow broadband emission and large Stokes shift originating from inorganic self&#8208;trapped excitons are successfully prepared, which meanwhile exhibit the excellent processability and formability of polymers. The versatility of these PMHs is manifested as the broad choices of polycations, the ready extension to manganese&#8208; and copper&#8208;based halides, and the tolerance to molar ratios between polycations and metal halides in the formation of PMHs. The merger of polymer chemistry and inorganic chemistry thus provides a novel generic platform for the development of metal halide functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermediates in Mechanochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical reactions offer methodological and environmental advantages for chemical synthesis, constantly attracting attention within the scientific community. Besides unmistakable sustainability advantages, the conditions under which mechanochemical reactions occur, namely solventless conditions, sometimes facilitate the isolation of otherwise labile or inaccessible products. Despite these advantages, limited knowledge exists regarding the mechanisms of these reactions and the types of intermediates involved. Nevertheless, in an expanding number of cases, ex&#8208;situ and in&#8208;situ monitoring techniques have allowed for the observation, characterization, and isolation of reaction intermediates in mechanochemical transformations. In this Minireview, we present a series of examples in which reactive intermediates have been detected in mechanochemical reactions spanning organic, organometallic, inorganic, and materials chemistry. Many of these intermediates were stabilized by non&#8208;covalent interactions, which played a pivotal role in guiding the chemical transformations. We believe that by uncovering and understanding such instances, the growing mechanochemistry community could find novel opportunities in catalysis and discover new mechanochemical reactions while achieving simplification in chemical reaction design.</dc:description>

         <title>Guest&#8208;shuttling in a Nanosized Metallobox</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An iridium&#8208;conjoined long and narrow metallorectangle was obtained by combining a quinoxalinophenanthrophenazine&#8208;connected Janus&#8208;di&#8208;imidazolylidene ligand and pyrazine. The size and shape of this assembly together with the fused polyaromatic nature of its panels, provides it with properties that are uncommon for other metallosupramolecular assemblies. For example, this nanosized &#8216;slit&#8208;like&#8217; metallobox is able show very large binding affinities with planar organic molecules in such a way, that the cavity is asymmetrically occupied by the guest molecule. This unsymmetrical conformation leads to the existence of a large amplitude motion of these guests, which slide between the two sides of the cavity of the host, thus constituting rare examples of molecular shuttles.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrocyclic Dual&#8208;Locked &#8220;Turn&#8208;On&#8221; Drug for Selective and Traceless Release in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drug safety and efficacy due to premature release into the bloodstream and poor biodistribution remains a problem despite seminal advances in this area. To circumvent these limitations, we report drug cyclization based on dynamic covalent linkages to devise a dual lock for the small molecule anticancer drug, camptothecin (CPT). Drug activity is &#8220;locked&#8221; within the cyclic structure by the redox responsive disulfide and pH&#8208;responsive boronic acid&#8208;salicylhydroxamate and turns on only in the presence of acidic pH, reactive oxygen species and glutathione through traceless release. Notably, the dual&#8208;responsive CPT is more active (100&#8208;fold) than the non&#8208;cleavable (permanently closed) analogue. We further include a bioorthogonal handle in the backbone for functionalization to generate cyclic&#8208;locked, cell&#8208;targeting peptide&#8208; and protein&#8208;CPTs, for targeted delivery of the drug and traceless release in triple negative metastatic breast cancer cells to inhibit cell growth at low nanomolar concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Localized Medium Concentration Electrolyte with Fast Kinetics for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte is widely acknowledged as a cutting&#8208;edge electrolyte for the lithium metal anode. However, the high fluorine content, either from high&#8208;concentration salts or from highly fluorinated diluents, results in significantly higher production costs and an increased environmental burden. Here, we have developed a novel electrolyte termed "Localized Medium&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte" (LMCE) to effectively address these issues. This LMCE is designed and produced by diluting a medium concentration (0.5 M &#8211; 1.5 M) electrolyte which is incompatible with lithium metal anode before diluting. It has ultralow concentration (0.1 M) and demonstrates remarkable compatibility with lithium metal anode. Surprisingly, our LMCE, despite having an ultralow concentration (0.1 M), exhibits excellent kinetics in Li/Cu, Li/Li, LiFePO4/Li, and NCM811/Li batteries. Additionally, LMCE effectively inhibits the corrosion of the Al current collector caused by LiTFSI salt under high voltage (&gt; 4 V) conditions. This groundbreaking LMCE design transforms the seemingly "incompatible" into the "compatible", opening up new avenues for exploring various electrolyte formulations, including all liquid electrolyte&#8208;based batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosted Mg&#8722;CO2 Batteries by Amine&#8208;Mediated CO2 Capture Chemistry and Mg2+&#8208;Conducting Solid&#8208;electrolyte Interphases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;aqueous Mg&#8722;CO2 battery with high reversibility and enhanced kinetics is utilized using an amine molecular mediator that tunes the CO2 reduction pathways as well as the Mg anode. It not only modifies the reactant state of CO2 and Mg2+ to promote CO2 cathodic reaction kinetics but also facilitates Mg2+&#8208;conducting interphase formation to enable the reversible cycling of Mg anode.







Abstract
Mg&#8722;CO2 battery has been considered as an ideal system for energy conversion and CO2 fixation. However, its practical application is significantly limited by the poor reversibility and sluggish kinetics of CO2 cathode and Mg anode. Here, a new amine mediated chemistry strategy is proposed to realize a highly reversible and high&#8208;rate Mg&#8722;CO2 battery in conventional electrolyte. Judiciously combined experimental characterization and theoretical computation unveiled that the introduced amine could simultaneously modify the reactant state of CO2 and Mg2+ to accelerate CO2 cathodic reactions on the thermodynamic&#8208;kinetic levels and facilitate the formation of Mg2+&#8208;conductive solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) to enable highly reversible Mg anode. As a result, the Mg&#8722;CO2 battery exhibits boosted stable cyclability (70&#8197;cycles, more than 400&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and high&#8208;rate capability (from 100 to 2000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with 1.5&#8197;V overpotential) even at &#8722;15&#8201;&#176;C. This work opens a newly promising avenue for advanced metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modified donor has been developed for the glycosylation of 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;2&#8208;octulosonic acid (Kdo). The high reactivity and wide substrate scope of the donor enabled the synthesis of a range of Kdo&#8208;containing glycosides with complete &#945;&#8208;stereoselectivity without the formation of 2,3&#8208;ene by&#8208;products. Several natural oligosaccharides were synthesized by a stepwise or one&#8208;pot process, including a highly branched Kdo pentasaccharide.







Abstract
3&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;oct&#8208;2&#8208;ulosonic acid (Kdo) is an eight&#8208;carbon monosaccharide found widely in bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and capsule polysaccharides (CPSs). We developed an indirect method for the stereoselective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Kdo glycosides with a C3&#8208;p&#8208;tolylthio&#8208;substituted Kdo phosphite donor. The presence of the p&#8208;tolylthio group enhanced the reactivity, suppressed the formation of elimination by&#8208;products (2,3&#8208;enes), and provided complete &#945;&#8208;stereocontrol. A variety of Kdo &#945;&#8208;glycosides were synthesized by our method in excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%). After glycosylation, the p&#8208;tolylthio group can be efficiently removed by free&#8208;radical reduction. Subsequently, the orthogonality of the phosphite donor and thioglycoside donor was demonstrated by the one&#8208;pot synthesis of a trisaccharide in Helicobacter pylori and Neisseria meningitidis LPS. Moreover, an efficient total synthesis route to the challenging 4,5&#8208;branched Kdo trisaccharide in LPSs from several A. baumannii strains was highlighted. To demonstrate the high reactivity of our approach further, the highly crowded 4,5,7,8&#8208;branched Kdo pentasaccharide was synthesized as a model molecule for the first time. Additionally, the reaction mechanism was investigated by DFT calculations.

A variety of Kdo &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-glycosides were synthesized by our method in excellent yields (up to 98&#8201;%). After glycosylation, the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-tolylthio group can be efficiently removed by free-radical reduction. Subsequently, the orthogonality of the phosphite donor and thioglycoside donor was demonstrated by the one-pot synthesis of a trisaccharide in &lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; LPS. Moreover, an efficient total synthesis route to the challenging 4,5-branched Kdo trisaccharide in LPSs from several &lt;i&gt;A. baumannii&lt;/i&gt; strains was highlighted. To demonstrate the high reactivity of our approach further, the highly crowded 4,5,7,8-branched Kdo pentasaccharide was synthesized as a model molecule for the first time. Additionally, the reaction mechanism was investigated by DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Combinatorial Ligand Assisted Simultaneous Control of Axial and Central Chirality in Highly Stereoselective C&#8722;H Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aim of converging multiple stereocenters in asymmetric catalysis brings exciting avenues for expanding the &#8216;chiral pool&#8217;. With this aim, a dual&#8208;cooperative ligand system was developed for controlling two distinct stereo&#8208;environment in an atropselective C&#8722;H allylation of biaryls. The system leverages a chiral amino acid as a transient&#8208;ligand source and chiral phosphoric acid for the early C&#8722;H activation step. The DFT studies present a rich mechanistic model, authenticating the extensive experimental findings.







Abstract
The significance of stereoselective C&#8722;H bond functionalization thrives on its direct application potential to pharmaceuticals or complex chiral molecule synthesis. Complication arises when there are multiple stereogenic elements such as a center and an axis of chirality to control. Over the years cooperative assistance of multiple chiral ligands has been applied to control only chiral centers. In this work, we harness the essence of cooperative ligand approach to control two different stereogenic elements in the same molecule by atroposelective allylation to synthesize axially chiral biaryls from its racemic precursor. The crucial roles played by chiral phosphoric acid and chiral amino acid ligand in concert helped us to obtain one major stereoisomer out of four distinct possibilities.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Targeting Biomimetic Semiconducting Polymer Nanocomposites for Amplified Theranostics of Bone Metastasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;targeting biomimetic semiconducting polymer nanocomposite is developed for amplified theranostics of bone metastasis. The nanocomposite enables efficient tumor homing after dual&#8208;targeting effect towards both cancer cells and osteoclasts, and thus achieves bone metastasis diagnosis and effective inhibition of tumor growth via mediating dual&#8208;model imaging at bone metastasis sites and a combined therapy against cancer cells and osteoclasts.







Abstract
Bone metastasis is a type of metastatic tumors that involves the spreads of malignant tumor cells into skeleton, and its diagnosis and treatment remain a big challenge due to the unique tumor microenvironment. We herein develop osteoclast and tumor cell dual&#8208;targeting biomimetic semiconducting polymer nanocomposites (SPFeNOC) for amplified theranostics of bone metastasis. SPFeNOC contain semiconducting polymer and iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles inside core and surface camouflaged hybrid membrane of cancer cells and osteoclasts. The hybrid membrane camouflage enables their targeting to both metastatic tumor cells and osteoclasts in bone metastasis through homologous targeting mechanism, thus achieving an enhanced nanoparticle accumulation in tumors. The semiconducting polymer mediates near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and sonodynamic therapy (SDT), and Fe3O4 nanoparticles are used for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Because both cancer cells and osteoclasts are killed synchronously via the combinational action of SDT and CDT, the vicious cycle in bone metastasis is broken to realize high antitumor efficacy. Therefore, 4T1 breast cancer&#8208;based bone metastasis can be effectively detected and cured by using SPFeNOC as dual&#8208;targeting theranostic nanoagents. This study provides an unusual biomimetic nanoplatform that simultaneously targets osteoclasts and cancer cells for amplified theranostics of bone metastasis.

         <title>A reversible water&#8208;based electrostatic adhesive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible water&#8208;based electrostatic adhesive has been developed through conventional emulsion polymerization using commodity materials. It is made of two formulations, one containing a polycation, and other a polyanion. Detachment is only promoted in highly acidic or alkaline solutions as polyelectrolytes show distinctive charged states. This kind of adhesive would be useful for the recycling and dismantling of products.







Abstract
Commercial adhesives typically fall into two categories: structural or pressure sensitive. Structural glues rely on covalent bonds formed during curing and provide high tensile strength whilst pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives use physical bonding to provide weaker adhesion, but with considerable convenience for the user. Here, a new class of adhesive is presented that is also reversible, with a bond strength intermediate between those of pressure&#8208;sensitive and structural adhesives. Complementary water&#8208;based formulations incorporating oppositely charged polyelectrolytes form electrostatic bonds that may be reversed through immersion in a low or high pH aqueous environment. This electrostatic adhesive has the advantageous property that it exhibits good adhesion to low&#8208;energy surfaces such as polypropylene. Furthermore, it is produced by the emulsion copolymerization of commodity materials, styrene and butyl acrylate, which makes it inexpensive and opens the possibility of industrial production. Bio&#8208;based materials have been also integrated into the formulations to further increase sustainability. Moreover, unlike other water&#8208;based glues, adhesion does not significantly degrade in humid environments. Because such electrostatic adhesives do not require mechanical detachment, they are appropriate for the large&#8208;scale recycling of, e.g., bottle labels or food packaging. The adhesive is also suitable for dismantling components in areas as varied as automotive parts and electronics.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Barcoded Plasmonic Nanostructures for Activity&#8208;Based Protease Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of activity&#8208;based protease sensors, termed DNA&#8208;barcoded plasmonic nanostructures. These probes afford over 100&#8208;fold increase in sensitivity compared to conventional fluorophore&#8208;quencher&#8208;based probes, allow for multiplexed detection of disease&#8208;relevant proteases, and enable the monitoring of active proteases in cancer cells obtained from colorectal cancer patients.







Abstract
We report the development of a new class of protease activity sensors called DNA&#8208;barcoded plasmonic nanostructures. These probes are comprised of gold nanoparticles functionalized with peptide&#8208;DNA conjugates (GPDs), where the peptide is a substrate of the protease of interest. The DNA acts as a barcode identifying the peptide and facilitates signal amplification. Protease&#8208;mediated peptide cleavage frees the DNA from the nanoparticle surface, which is subsequently measured via a CRISPR/Cas12a&#8208;based assay as a proxy for protease activity. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we show activity&#8208;based, multiplexed detection of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;associated protease, 3CL, and the apoptosis marker, caspase 3, with high sensitivity and selectivity. GPDs yield &gt;25&#8208;fold turn&#8208;on signals, 100&#8208;fold improved response compared to commercial probes, and detection limits as low as 58&#8197;pM at room temperature. Moreover, nanomolar concentrations of proteases can be detected visually by leveraging the aggregation&#8208;dependent color change of the gold nanoparticles. We showcase the clinical potential of GPDs by detecting a colorectal cancer&#8208;associated protease, cathepsin B, in three different patient&#8208;derived cell lines. Taken together, GPDs detect physiologically relevant concentrations of active proteases in challenging biological samples, require minimal sample processing, and offer unmatched multiplexing capabilities (mediated by DNA), making them powerful chemical tools for biosensing and disease diagnostics.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Halogenation of Unsaturated Halide and Triflate Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Joint experimental and theoretical techniques highlighted three main catalytic events in an electrochemically driven nickel&#8208;catalyzed halogen exchange reaction of aryl halides: Oxidative addition of Ar&#8722;X to a Ni(0) species first delivers a Ni(II)ArX, which undergoes salt metathesis with chloride to afford Ni(II)ArCl. The latter is electrochemically oxidized to a Ni(III) species, enabling the formation of the product upon reductive elimination.







Abstract
A robust electrochemically driven nickel&#8208;catalyzed halogen exchange of unsaturated halides and triflates (Br to Cl, I to Cl, I to Br, and OTf to Cl) is reported. A combination of NiCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;glyme as the precatalyst, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine as a ligand, NMP as the solvent, and electrochemistry allowed the generation of a nickel species that promotes reductive elimination of the desired product. This paired electrochemical halogenation is compatible with a range of unsaturated halides and triflates, including heterocycles, dihaloarenes, and alkenes with good functional&#8208;group tolerance. Joint experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigations highlighted three catalytic events: i) oxidative addition of the aryl halide to a Ni(0) species to deliver a Ni(II) intermediate; ii) halide metathesis at Ni(II); iii) electrochemical oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III) to enable the formation of the desired aryl halide upon reductive elimination. This methodology allows the replacement of heavy halogens (I or Br) or polar atoms (O) with the corresponding lighter and more lipophilic Cl group to block undesired reactivity or modify the properties of drug and agrochemical candidates.

         <title>Extending Ring&#8208;Chain Coupling Empirical Law to Lithium&#8208;Mediated Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work extends an interesting empirical electrolyte design law (ring&#8208;chain coupling law) to the lithium&#8208;mediated ammonia electrochemical synthesis system, which succeeds in improving the nitrogen fixation performance. Systematic theoretical calculation and experimental evidence jointly decipher the potential correlation between such strategy and enhanced performance from the angle of thermodynamics and mass transfer dynamics.







Abstract
With its efficient nitrogen fixation kinetics, electrochemical lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (LMNRR) holds promise for replacing Haber&#8211;Bosch process and realizing sustainable and green ammonia production. However, the general interface problem in lithium electrochemistry seriously impedes the further enhancement of LMNRR performance. Inspired by the development history of lithium battery electrolytes, here, we extend the ring&#8208;chain solvents coupling law to LMNRR system to rationally optimize the interface during the reaction process, achieving nearly a two&#8208;fold Faradaic efficiency up to 54.78&#177;1.60&#8201;%. Systematic theoretical simulations and experimental analysis jointly decipher that the anion&#8208;rich Li+ solvation structure derived from ring tetrahydrofuran coupling with chain ether successfully suppresses the excessive passivation of electrolyte decomposition at the reaction interface, thus promoting the mass transfer of active species and enhancing the nitrogen fixation kinetics. This work offers a progressive insight into the electrolyte design of LMNRR system.

         <title>Determination of Reaction Kinetics by Time&#8208;Resolved Small&#8208;Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering during Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: Direct Evidence for Monomer&#8208;Swollen Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic SAXS model for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) formulations has been developed by applying the law of conservation of mass. Time&#8208;resolved small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) data are analyzed to determine the kinetics of polymerization directly during the synthesis of spherical nanoparticles. This new analytical approach enables calculation of the mass transport of monomer and solvent in and out of the growing nanoparticles.







Abstract
The kinetics of heterogeneous polymerization is determined directly using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS). This important advancement is exemplified for the synthesis of sterically&#8208;stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) dispersion polymerization of benzyl methacrylate (BzMA) in mineral oil at 90&#8201;&#176;C. The principle of mass balance is invoked to derive a series of equations for the analysis of the resulting time&#8208;resolved SAXS patterns. Importantly, there is a continuous change in the X&#8208;ray scattering length density for the various components within the reaction mixture. This enables the volume fraction of unreacted BzMA monomer to be calculated at any given time point, which enables the polymerization kinetics to be monitored in situ directly without relying on supplementary characterization techniques. Moreover, SAXS enables the local concentration of both monomer and solvent within the growing swollen nanoparticles to be determined during the polymerization. Data analysis reveals that the instantaneous rate of BzMA polymerization is proportional to the local monomer concentration within the nanoparticles. In principle, this powerful new time&#8208;resolved SAXS approach can be applicable to other heterogeneous polymerization formulations.

         <title>Dual Catalysis of Gold Nanoclusters: Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Dehydrogenative Coupling by Cooperation of Superatomic Core and Molecularly Modified Staples
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoclusters were found to show a dual catalysis toward photocatalytic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions between aliphatic tertiary amines and terminal alkynes to produce propargylamine products. The dual catalysis was enabled by the cooperation of the superatomic core and staple moieties for the photooxidation of amines and the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation.







Abstract
Thiolate&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) have attracted significant attention as nano&#8208;catalysts, revealing a superatomic core and gold&#8208;thiolate staples as distinct structural units. Here, we demonstrate the unprecedented dual catalytic activity of thiolate&#8208;protected [Au25(SR)18]&#8722; nanoclusters, involving both photosensitized 1O2 generation by the Au13 superatomic core and catalytic carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation facilitated by Au2(SR)3 staples. This synergistic combination of two different catalytic units enables efficient cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling of terminal alkynes and tertiary aliphatic amines to afford propargylamines in high yields of up to 93&#8201;%. Mixed&#8208;ligand AuNCs bearing both thiolate and alkynyl ligands revealed the intermediacy of the alkynyl&#8208;exchanged AuNCs toward both photosensitization and C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming catalytic cycles. Density functional theory calculations also supported the intermediacy of the alkynyl&#8208;exchanged AuNCs. Thus, the use of ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters has enabled the development of an exceptional multifunctional catalyst, wherein distinct nanocluster components facilitate cooperative photo&#8208; and chemo&#8208;catalysis.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Promoted Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Nitrene Transfer for the Synthesis of Hydrazines and Triazanes through N&#8208;Amidation of Arylamines</title>

Bulky alkylphosphines (PtBu3) can switch the roles from actor to spectator ligands to promote the FeCl2&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;amidation reaction of arylamines with dioxazolones leading to hydrazides in high efficiency and chemoselectivity. The new ligand&#8208;promoted N&#8208;amidation protocols offer a convenient way to access various challenging triazane compounds via double or sequential N&#8208;amidation of primary arylamines.







Abstract
Herein, we report that bulky alkylphosphines such as PtBu3 can switch the roles from actor to spectator ligands to promote the FeCl2&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;amidation reaction of arylamines with dioxazolones, giving hydrazides in high efficiency and chemoselectivity. Mechanistic studies indicated that the phosphine ligands could facilitate the decarboxylation of dioxazolones on the Fe center, and the hydrogen bonding interactions between the arylamines and the ligands on Fe nitrenoid intermediates might play a role in modulating the delicate interplay between the phosphine ligand, arylamine, and acyl nitrene N, favoring N&#8722;N coupling over N&#8722;P coupling. The new ligand&#8208;promoted N&#8208;amidation protocols offer a convenient way to access various challenging triazane compounds via double or sequential N&#8208;amidation of primary arylamines.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report that bulky alkylphosphines such as P&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can switch the roles from actor to spectator ligands to promote the FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-amidation reaction of arylamines with dioxazolones, giving hydrazides in high efficiency and chemoselectivity. Mechanistic studies indicated that the phosphine ligands could facilitate the decarboxylation of dioxazolones on the Fe center, and the hydrogen bonding interactions between the arylamines and the ligands on Fe nitrenoid intermediates might play a role in modulating the delicate interplay between the phosphine ligand, arylamine, and acyl nitrene N, favoring N&#8722;N coupling over N&#8722;P coupling. The new ligand-promoted &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-amidation protocols offer a convenient way to access various challenging triazane compounds via double or sequential &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-amidation of primary arylamines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Class of Activatable NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Dyes for High&#8208;Contrast Bioimaging</title>

A novel class of GX fluorophores have been designed and synthesized as activatable NIR&#8208;II PA dyes, in which the absorption/emission wavelength of GX&#8208;5 extends up to 1082/1360&#8197;nm. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of GX dyes, the first NIR&#8208;II probe GX&#8208;5&#8208;CO activated by CO was engineered and employed to reveal the enhancement of the CO levels in hypertensive mice by high&#8208;contrast NIR&#8208;II PA and FL imaging.







Abstract
Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is emerging as one of the important non&#8208;invasive imaging techniques in biomedical research. Small molecule&#8208; second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) PA dyes combined with imaging data can provide comprehensive and in&#8208;depth in vivo physiological and pathological information. However, the NIR&#8208;II PA dyes usually exhibit &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; properties due to the lack of a readily optically tunable group, which hinders the further applications in vivo. Herein, a novel class of dyes GX have been designed and synthesized as an activatable NIR&#8208;II PA platform, in which the absorption/emission wavelength of GX&#8208;5 extends up to 1082/1360&#8197;nm. Importantly, the GX dyes have a strong tissue penetration depth and high&#8208;resolution for the mouse vasculature structures in NIR&#8208;II PA 3D imaging and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FL) imaging. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of GX dyes, the first NIR&#8208;II PA probe GX&#8208;5&#8208;CO activated by carbon monoxide (CO) was engineered and employed to reveal the enhancement of the CO levels in the hypertensive mice by high&#8208;contrast NIR&#8208;II PA and FL imaging. We expect that many derivatives of GX dyes will be developed to afford versatile NIR&#8208;II PA platforms for designing a wide variety activatable NIR&#8208;II PA probes as biomedical tools.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;bridged Fe&#8208;Cu Atomic Pair Sites for Efficient Electrochemical Ammonia Production and Electricity Generation with Zn&#8208;NO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developed nitrogen&#8208;bridged Fe&#8208;Cu atomic pair sites exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity for producing ammonia from nitrite electroreduction. The constructed Zn&#8208;nitrite battery can generate electricity and manufacture ammonia directly and simultaneously.







Abstract
The development of environmentally sustainable and highly efficient technologies for ammonia production is crucial for the future advancement of carbon&#8208;neutral energy systems. The nitrite reduction reaction (NO2RR) for generating NH3 is a promising alternative to the low&#8208;efficiency nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), owing to the low N=O bond energy and high solubility of nitrite. In this study, we designed a highly efficient dual&#8208;atom catalyst with Fe&#8208;Cu atomic pair sites (termed FeCu DAC), and the as&#8208;developed FeCu DAC was able to afford a remarkable NH3 yield of 24,526&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V, with a Faradaic Efficiency (FE) for NH3 production of 99.88&#8201;%. The FeCu DAC also exhibited exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity in a Zn&#8208;NO2 battery, achieving a record&#8208;breaking power density of 23.6&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maximum NH3 FE of 92.23&#8201;% at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical simulation demonstrated that the incorporation of the Cu atom changed the energy of the Fe 3d orbital and lowered the energy barrier, thereby accelerating the NO2RR. This study not only demonstrates the potential of galvanic nitrite&#8208;based cells for expanding the field of Zn&#8208;based batteries, but also provides fundamental interpretation for the synergistic effect in highly dispersed dual&#8208;atom catalysts.

The first regioselective selenocarbonylation of alkenes is reported. This general protocol provides a variety of branched and linear selenoesters with wide functional group compatibility and tunable regioselectivity.







Abstract
An unprecedented regiodivergent palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation of aromatic alkenes has been developed. Utilizing commercially available Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2 in the presence of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;ferrocenediyl&#8208;bis(tert&#8208;butyl(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphine) ligand L8 diverse selenoesters are obtained in a straightforward manner. Key to success for the control of the regioselectivity of the carbonylation step is the concentration of the acidic co&#8208;catalyst. This general protocol features wide functional group compatibility and good regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that the presence of stoichiometric amounts of acid changes the properties and coordination mode of the ligand leading to reversed regioselectivity.

         <title>Polymer Modification Strategy to Modulate Reaction Microenvironment for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer modification electrodes with a super&#8208;hydrophobic microenvironment show outstanding performance for electroreduction of CO2 with enhancing activity, selectivity and stability simultaneously.







Abstract
Modulation of the microenvironment on the electrode surface is one of the effective means to improve the efficiency of electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (eCO2RR). To achieve high conversion rates, the phase boundary at the electrode surface should be finely controlled to overcome the limitation of CO2 solubility in the aqueous electrolyte. Herein, we developed a simple and efficient method to structure electrocatalyst with a superhydrophobic surface microenvironment by one&#8208;step co&#8208;electrodeposition of Cu and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) on carbon paper. The super&#8208;hydrophobic Cu&#8208;based electrode displayed a high ethylene (C2H4) selectivity with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 67.3&#8201;% at &#8722;1.25&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in an H&#8208;type cell, which is 2.5&#8197;times higher than a regular Cu electrode without PTFE. By using PTFE as a surface modifier, the activity of eCO2RR is enhanced and water (proton) adsorption is inhibited. This strategy has the potential to be applied to other gas&#8208;conversion electrocatalysts.

In this study, benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole/phenyl(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanone (BT/PPO)&#8208;doped long&#8208;wavelength (600&#8197;nm) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) material has been synthesized. The BT/PPO nanoparticles exhibit long&#8208;wavelength afterglow luminescence of 120&#8197;s, with a maximum penetration depth of 10&#8197;mm. Additionally, the potential of BT/PPO nanoparticles for detecting atherosclerotic plaques has been demonstrated.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials have great potential for in vivo imaging because they can circumvent the autofluorescence of biological tissues. In this study, a class of organic&#8208;doped long&#8208;wavelength (&#8776;600&#8197;nm) RTP materials with benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole as a guest was constructed. Both host and guest molecules have simple structures and can be directly purchased commercially at a low cost. Owing to the long phosphorescence wavelength of the doping system, it exhibited good tissue penetration (10&#8197;mm). Notably, these RTP nanoparticles were successfully used to image atherosclerotic plaques, with a signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) of 44.52. This study provides a new approach for constructing inexpensive red organic phosphorescent materials and a new method for imaging cardiovascular diseases using these materials.

         <title>Stabilizing Undercoordinated Zn Active Sites through Confinement in CeO2 Nanotubes for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#948;+/ZnO/CeO2 with hollow core&#8211;shell structure was demonstrated as CO2 reduction catalyst by making use of the CeO2 nanotube confinement effect to stabilize Zn&#948;+ species, achieving enhanced performance and highly CO selectivity of 76.9&#8201;%.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;based catalysts hold great potential to replace the noble metal&#8208;based ones for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Undercoordinated Zn (Zn&#948;+) sites may serve as the active sites for enhanced CO production by optimizing the binding energy of *COOH intermediates. However, there is relatively less exploration into the dynamic evolution and stability of Zn&#948;+ sites during CO2 reduction process. Herein, we present ZnO, Zn&#948;+/ZnO and Zn as catalysts by varying the applied reduction potential. Theoretical studies reveal that Zn&#948;+ sites could suppress HER and HCOOH production to induce CO generation. And Zn&#948;+/ZnO presents the highest CO selectivity (FECO 70.9&#8201;% at &#8722;1.48&#8197;V vs. RHE) compared to Zn and ZnO. Furthermore, we propose a CeO2 nanotube with confinement effect and Ce3+/Ce4+ redox to stabilize Zn&#948;+ species. The hollow core&#8211;shell structure of the Zn&#948;+/ZnO/CeO2 catalyst enables to extremely expose electrochemically active area while maintaining the Zn&#948;+ sites with long&#8208;time stability. Certainly, the target catalyst affords a FECO of 76.9&#8201;% at &#8722;1.08&#8197;V vs. RHE and no significant decay of CO selectivity in excess of 18&#8197;h.

         <title>A Dual Anion Chemistry&#8208;Based Superionic Glass Enabling Long&#8208;Cycling All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new sodium superionic conducting glass, 0.5Na2O2&#8208;TaCl5, based on an oxychloride anionic lattice is developed for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The appealing features of ultrahigh ionic conductivity (4.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1), good formability, and high oxidative stability (&#8776;3.92&#8197;V) of 0.5Na2O2&#8208;TaCl5 contribute to the superior cycling stability of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries at room temperature.







Abstract
Glassy Na&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state electrolytes (GNSSEs) are an important group of amorphous SSEs. However, the insufficient ionic conductivity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art GNSSEs at room temperature lessens their promise in the development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;ion batteries (ASSNIBs) with high energy density and improved safety. Here we report the discovery of a new sodium superionic glass, 0.5Na2O2&#8208;TaCl5 (NTOC), based on dual&#8208;anion sublattice of oxychlorides. The unique local structures with abundant bridging and non&#8208;bridging oxygen atoms contributes to a highly disordered Na&#8208;ion distribution as well as low Na+ migration barrier within NTOC, enabling an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 4.62&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C (more than 20&#8197;times higher than those of previously reported GNSSEs). Moreover, the excellent formability of glassy NTOC electrolyte and its high electrochemical oxidative stability ensure a favourable electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface, contributing to superior cycling stability of ASSNIBs for over 500 cycles at room temperature. The discovery of glassy NTOC electrolyte would reignite research enthusiasm in superionic glassy SSEs based on multi&#8208;anion chemistry.

         <title>High&#8208;efficiency Electroreduction of O2 into H2O2 over ZnCo Bimetallic Triazole Frameworks Promoted by Ligand Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZnCo bimetal&#8208;triazole framework has been developed as high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts. The unique ligand effect of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole optimizes the electronic structure of Co sites and enables an asymmetric &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; adsorption mode of O2 molecule, resulting in an excellent 2e&#8722; ORR performance with a selectivity of &#8776;100&#8201;% and an H2O2 production rate of 5.55&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Co&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as electrocatalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) are highly promising for H2O2 production, but suffer from the intrinsic activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. Herein, we report a ZnCo bimetal&#8208;triazole framework (ZnCo&#8208;MTF) as high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the coordination between 1,2,3&#8208;triazole and Co increases the antibonding&#8208;orbital occupancy on the Co&#8722;N bond, promoting the activation of Co center. Besides, the adjacent Zn&#8722;Co sites on 1,2,3&#8208;triazole enable an asymmetric &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; adsorption mode of O2, favoring the reduction of O2 molecules and desorption of OOH* intermediate. By virtue of the unique ligand effect, the ZnCo&#8208;MTF exhibits a 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity of &#8776;100&#8201;%, onset potential of 0.614&#8197;V and H2O2 production rate of 5.55&#8197;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art zeolite imidazole frameworks. Our work paves the way for the design of 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts with desirable coordination and electronic structure.

By virtue of the unique ligand effect, the ZnCo-MTF exhibits a 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR selectivity of &#8776;100&#8201;%, onset potential of 0.614&#8197;V and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 5.55&#8197;mol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, superior to the state-of-the-art zeolite imidazole frameworks. Our work paves the way for the design of 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR electrocatalysts with desirable coordination and electronic structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Bridged Benzazepines via Photo&#8208;Induced Dearomatization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient protocol is developed to convert simple aromatic substrates into value&#8208;added and structurally complex bridged benzazepines via a photocatalytic dearomatization. The switchable diastereoselectivity could be furnished by the manipulation of base&#8208;promoted or photoinduced intramolecular hydroamination.







Abstract
Bridged benzazepine scaffolds, possessing unique structural and physicochemical activities, are widespread in various natural products and drugs. The construction of these skeletons often requires elaborate synthetic effort with low efficiency. Herein, we develop a simple and divergent approach for constructing various bridged benzazepines by a photocatalytic intermolecular dearomatization of naphthalene derivatives with readily available &#945;&#8208;amino acids. The bridged motif is created via a cascade sequence involving photocatalytic 1,4&#8208;hydroaminoalkylation, alkene isomerization and cyclization. Interestingly, the diastereoselectivity can be regulated through different reaction modes in the cyclization step. Moreover, aminohydroxylation and its further bromination have also been demonstrated to access highly functionalized bridged benzazepines. Preliminary mechanistic studies have been performed to get insights into the mechanism. This method provides a divergent synthetic approach for construction of highly functionalized bridged benzazepines, which have been otherwise difficult to access.

         <title>Defects&#8208;Induced Single&#8208;Atom Anchoring on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical strategy was applied to fabricate the defects on MOFs. And the defects further induced the anchoring of Ru single atoms. The photocatalytic activity in N2 reduction to produce ammonia has been greatly improved to 53.28&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 on Ru1/d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 with an apparent quantum efficiency of 0.34&#8201;% at 300&#8197;nm and 0.04&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Aiming to improve the photocatalytic activity in N2 fixation to produce ammonia, herein, we proposed a photochemical strategy to fabricate defects, and further deposition of Ru single atoms onto UiO&#8208;66 (Zr) framework. Electron&#8208;metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSI) were built between Ru single atoms and the support via a covalently bonding. EMSI were capable of accelerating charge transfer between Ru SAs and UiO&#8208;66, which was favorable for highly&#8208;efficiently photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic production rate of ammonia improved from 4.57&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 to 16.28&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with the fabrication of defects onto UiO&#8208;66, and further to 53.28&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with Ru&#8208;single atoms loading. From the DFT results, it was found that d&#8208;orbital electrons of Ru were donated to N2 &#960;&#10038;&#8208;antibonding orbital, facilitating the activation of the N&#8801;N triple bond. A distal reaction pathway was probably occurred for the photocatalytic N2 reduction to ammonia on Ru1/d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 (single Ru sites decorated onto the nodes of defective UiO&#8208;66), and the first step of hydrogenation of N2 was the reaction determination step. This work shed a light on improving the photocatalytic activity via feasibly anchoring single atoms on MOF, and provided more evidences to understand the reaction mechanism in photocatalytic reduction of N2.

         <title>Grain&#8208;growth Inhibitor with Three&#8208;section&#8208;sintering for Highly Dispersed Single&#8208;crystal NCM90 Cubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly dispersed single&#8208;crystal NCM90 cubic particles were prepared through a three&#8208;section&#8208;sintering strategy with the presence of grain&#8208;growth inhibitor, which show improved cycling stability, superior rate performance and enhanced safety performance.







Abstract
Single crystallization of LiNixCoyMn1&#8208;x&#8208;yO2(NCM) is currently an effective strategy to improve the cycling life of NCM cathode, owing to the reduced surface area and enhanced mechanical strength, but the application of single crystal NCM(SC&#8208;NCM) is being hindered by severe particle agglomeration and poor C&#8208;rate performance. Here, a strategy of three&#8208;section&#8208;sintering(TSS) with the presence of grain&#8208;growth inhibitor was proposed, in which, the TSS includes three sections of phase&#8208;formation, grain&#8208;growth and phase&#8208;preservation. While, the addition of MoO3 inhibits the grain growth and restrains the particle agglomeration. With the help of TSS and 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of MoO3, highly dispersed surface Mo&#8208;doped SC&#8208;NCM(MSC&#8208;NCM) cubes are obtained with the average diameter of 1.3&#8197;&#956;m. Benefiting from the surface Mo&#8208;doping and the reduced surface energy, the Li+&#8208;migration preferred (1&#8201;0&#8201;4) crystalline facet is exposed as the dominant plane in MSC&#8208;NCM cubes, because of which, C&#8208;rate performance is significantly improved compared with the regular SC&#8208;NCM. Furthermore, this preparation strategy is compatible well with the current industrial production line, providing an easy way for the large&#8208;scale production of SC&#8208;NCM.

         <title>Exploration of Chemical Diversity in Intercellular Quorum Sensing Signalling Systems in Prokaryotes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this manuscript, we investigate sets of both closely related and widely diverging quorum sensing (QS) ligand structures to identify orthogonal signalling systems. Our results suggest that structural diversity in QS ligands can be used as a starting point to predict non&#8208;cognate receptor&#8208;ligand binding in intercellular signalling systems.







Abstract
Quorum sensing (QS) serves as a vital means of intercellular signalling in a variety of prokaryotes, which enables single cells to act in multicellular configurations. The potential to control community&#8208;wide responses has also sparked numerous recent biotechnological innovations. However, our capacity to utilize intercellular communication is hindered due to a scarcity of complementary signalling systems and a restricted comprehension of interconnections between these systems caused by variations in their dynamic range. In this study, we utilize uniform manifold approximation and projection and extended&#8208;connectivity fingerprints to explore the available chemical space of QS signalling molecules. We investigate and experimentally characterize a set of closely related QS signalling ligands, consisting of N&#8208;acyl homoserine lactones and the aryl homoserine lactone p&#8208;coumaroyl, as well as a set of more widely diverging QS ligands, consisting of photopyrones, dialkylresorcinols, 3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazin&#8208;2&#8208;ol and autoinducer&#8208;2, and define their performance. We report on a set of six signal&#8208; and promoter&#8208;orthogonal intercellular QS signalling systems, significantly expanding the toolkit for engineering community&#8208;wide behaviour. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ligand diversity can serve as a statistically significant tool to predict much more complicated ligand&#8208;receptor interactions. This approach highlights the potential of dimensionality reduction to explore chemical diversity in microbial dynamics.

We investigate and experimentally characterize a set of closely related QS signalling ligands, consisting of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl homoserine lactones and the aryl homoserine lactone &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-coumaroyl, as well as a set of more widely diverging QS ligands, consisting of photopyrones, dialkylresorcinols, 3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-ol and autoinducer-2, and define their performance. We report on a set of six signal- and promoter-orthogonal intercellular QS signalling systems, significantly expanding the toolkit for engineering community-wide behaviour. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ligand diversity can serve as a statistically significant tool to predict much more complicated ligand-receptor interactions. This approach highlights the potential of dimensionality reduction to explore chemical diversity in microbial dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Photo&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Ultrahigh&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Fluorinated Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust organocatalyzed photo&#8208;controlled radical alternating copolymerization was established, enabling facile access to binary and ternary fluorinated copolymers with predefined ultrahigh molecular weights (UHMWs), well&#8208;defined structures and functional pendants. The UHMW fluoropolymers presented clearly improved physical properties, and furnished anticorrosive, (super)hydrophobic attributes as protective coatings on diverse substrates.







Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (UHMW) polymers with tailored structures are highly desirable for the outstanding properties. In this work, we developed a novel photoorganocatalyzed controlled radical alternating copolymerizations of fluoroalkyl maleimide and diverse vinyl comonomers, enabling efficient preparation of fluorinated copolymers of predetermined UHMWs and well&#8208;defined structures at high conversions. Versatility of this method was demonstrated by expanding to controlled terpolymerization, which allows facial access toward fluorinated terpolymers of UHMWs and functional pendants. The obtained copolymers exhibited attractive physical properties and furnished thermoplastic, anticorrosive and (super)hydrophobic attributes as coatings on different substrates. Molecular simulations provided insights into the coating morphology, which unveiled a fluorous protective layer on the top surface with polar groups attached to the bottom substrate, resulting in good adhesion and hydrophobicity, simultaneously. This synthetic method and customized copolymers shed light on the design of high&#8208;performance coatings by macromolecular engineering.

         <title>Tandem Electro&#8208;Thermo&#8208;Catalysis for the Oxidative Aminocarbonylation of Arylboronic Acids to Amides from CO2 and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>

A tandem electrothermo&#8208;catalytic system that couples overall CO2 electroreduction with thermocatalytic oxidative aminocarbonylation was reported to produce various value&#8208;added amides.







Abstract
Direct CO2 electroreduction to valuable chemicals is critical for carbon neutrality, while its main products are limited to simple C1/C2 compounds, and traditionally, the anodic O2 byproduct is not utilized. We herein report a tandem electrothermo&#8208;catalytic system that fully utilizes both cathodic (i.e., CO) and anodic (i.e., O2) products during overall CO2 electrolysis to produce valuable organic amides from arylboronic acids and amines in a separate chemical reactor, following the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative aminocarbonylation mechanism. Hexamethylenetetramine (HMT)&#8208;incorporated silver and nickel hydroxide carbonate electrocatalysts were prepared for efficient coproduction of CO and O2 with Faradaic efficiencies of 99.3&#8201;% and 100&#8201;%, respectively. Systematic experiments, operando attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical studies reveal that HMT promotes *CO2 hydrogenation/*CO desorption for accelerated CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, and O2 inhibits reductive deactivation of the Pd(II) catalyst for enhanced oxidative aminocarbonylation, collectively leading to efficient synthesis of 10 organic amides with high yields of above 81&#8201;%. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of a tandem electrothermo&#8208;catalytic strategy for economically attractive CO2 conversion and amide synthesis, representing a new avenue to explore the full potential of CO2 utilization.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Reversible Complexation&#8208;Mediated Polymerization (RCMP) from Benzylic Alcohols for Facile Access to Polymer&#8208;Grafted Lignin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first one&#8208;pot synthesis of methacrylic and acrylic polymers from benzylic alcohols (R&#8722;OH) via reversible complexation mediated polymerization (RCMP), namely organocatalyzed living radical polymerization. This method enabled direct initiation from benzylic alcohols of lignin to yield polymer&#8208;grafted lignin in one pot as a practically useful application.







Abstract
One&#8208;pot synthesis of methacrylic and acrylic polymers from benzylic alcohols (R&#8722;OH) used as initiating moieties was developed. R&#8722;OH was converted to alkyl iodide (R&#8722;I), and the generated R&#8722;I was used as an initiator without purification or isolation in the subsequent reversible complexation mediated polymerization (RCMP), leading to one&#8208;pot RCMP from R&#8722;OH. As a useful application, this technique was exploited for one&#8208;pot polymer&#8208;grafting from lignin that is the second most abundant renewable carbon&#8208;source on earth and bears benzylic alcohols. The direct initiation from lignin eliminates tedious initiator attachment and purification, offering a facile access to polymer&#8208;grafted lignin. The obtained polymer&#8208;grafted lignin was utilized to form an efficient UV&#8208;absorbing film with high transparency in visible region. One&#8208;pot RCMP may serve as a practical method to obtain value&#8208;added functional lignin&#8208;polymer composites.

         <title>Enzymatic Dimerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Alanine&#8208;Tyramine Conjugates into Versatile, Uniform, Enzyme&#8208;Loaded Organic Nanoparticles</title>

         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;enzyme&#8208;loaded uniform hollow organic nanoparticles (NPs) can be prepared by enzymatic dimerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (e&#8208;DISA) by employing horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and short alanine&#8208;tyramine conjugates. These NPs allowed efficient detection of salivary glucose levels through s fluorimetry assay of dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Surface modification of these NPs by using different phenolic additives (tyramine/tannic acid) was also possible.







Abstract
Herein, we report a novel enzymatic dimerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (e&#8208;DISA) procedure that converts alanine&#8208;tyramine conjugates into highly uniform enzyme&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPs) or nanocontainers by the action of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in an aqueous medium under ambient conditions. The NP formation was possible with both enantiomers of alanine, and the average diameter could be varied from 150&#8197;nm to 250&#8197;nm (with a 5&#8211;12&#8201;% standard deviation of as&#8208;prepared samples) depending on the precursor concentration. About 60&#8201;% of the added HRP enzyme was entrapped within the NPs and was subsequently utilized for post&#8208;synthetic modification of the NPs with phenolic compounds such as tyramine or tannic acid. One&#8208;pot multi&#8208;enzyme entrapment of glucose oxidase (GOx) and peroxidase (HRP) within the NPs was also achieved. These GOx&#8208;HRP loaded NPs allowed multimodal detection of glucose, including that present in human saliva, with a limit of detection (LoD) of 740&#8197;nM through fluorimetry. The NPs exhibited good cytocompatibility and were stable to changes in pH (acidic to basic), temperature, ultrasonication, and even the presence of organic solvent (EtOH) to a certain extent, since they are stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bonding, &#960;&#8208;&#960;, and CH&#8208;&#960; interactions. The proposed e&#8208;DISA procedure can be widely expanded through the design of diverse enzyme&#8208;responsive precursors.

         <title>Empirical Model of Solvophobic Interactions in Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An empirical model was developed to predict organic solvophobic effects based on the measurements of a series of N&#8208;phenylimide molecular balances. This model can predict organic solvophobic effects for alkyl&#8208;alkyl interactions or varying lengths in a wide range of solvents.







Abstract
An empirical model was developed to predict organic solvophobic effects using N&#8208;phenylimide molecular balances functionalized with non&#8208;polar alkyl groups. Solution studies and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed intramolecular alkyl&#8208;alkyl interactions in their folded conformers. The structural modularity of the balances allowed systematic variation of alkyl group lengths. Control balances were instrumental in isolating weak organic solvophobic effects by eliminating framework solvent&#8208;solute effects. A 19F&#8197;NMR label enabled analysis across 46 deuterated and non&#8208;deuterated solvent systems. Linear correlations were observed between organic solvophobic effects and solvent cohesive energy density (ced) as well as changes in solvent&#8208;accessible surface areas (SASA). Using these empirical relationships, a model was constructed to predict organic solvophobic interaction energy per unit area for any organic solvent with known ced values. The predicted interaction energies aligned with recent organic solvophobic measurements and literature values for the hydrophobic effect on non&#8208;polar surfaces confirmed the model&#8216;s accuracy and utility.

         <title>Turning on Singlet Oxygen Generation by Outer&#8208;Sphere Microenvironment Modulation in Porphyrinic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modulation of the outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment around catalytic metal sites in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse functional groups turns on the activity of 1O2&#8208;mediated photocatalytic oxidation of thioether with the increased electron&#8208;donating ability of the groups. The yields boost from nearly zero in the cyano&#8208;functionalized COF to 98&#8201;% in the methoxy&#8208;functionalized counterpart.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is ubiquitously involved in various photocatalytic oxidation reactions; however, efficient and selective production of 1O2 is still challenging. Herein, we reported the synthesis of nickel porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating functional groups with different electron&#8208;donating/&#8208;withdrawing features on their pore walls. These functional groups established a dedicated outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment surrounding the Ni catalytic center that tunes the activity of the COFs for 1O2&#8208;mediated thioether oxidation. With the increase of the electron&#8208;donating ability of functional groups, the modulated outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment turns on the catalytic activity from a yield of nearly zero by the cyano group functionalized COF to an excellent yield of 98&#8201;% by the methoxy group functionalized one. Electronic property investigation and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the distinct excitonic behaviors attributed to the diverse band energy levels and orbital compositions are responsible for the different activities. This study represents the first regulation of generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) based on the strategy of outer&#8208;sphere microenvironment modulation in COFs.

         <title>Dynamic Stereochemistry of M8Pd6 Supramolecular Cages Based on Metal&#8208;Center Lability for Differential Chiral Induction, Resolution, and Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four multi&#8208;pocket isostructural M8Pd6 supramolecular cages were assembled that display distinct metal&#8208;center lability and distinguishable stereochemical dynamics leading to chiral transitions and differential guest induction. These results offer insights for the design of chiral metal&#8208;organic cages and applications in chiral sensing and asymmetric transformation.







Abstract
A series of isostructural supramolecular cages with a rhombic dodecahedron shape have been assembled with distinct metal&#8208;coordination lability (M8Pd6&#8208;MOC&#8208;16, M=Ru2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Zn2+). The chirality transfer between metal centers generally imposes homochirality on individual cages to enable solvent&#8208;dependent spontaneous resolution of &#916;8/&#923;8&#8722;M8Pd6 enantiomers; however, their distinguishable stereochemical dynamics manifests differential chiral phenomena governed by the cage stability following the order Ru8Pd6&gt;Ni8Pd6&gt;Fe8Pd6&gt;Zn8Pd6. The highly labile Zn centers endow the Zn8Pd6 cage with conformational flexibility and deformation, enabling intrigue chiral&#8208;&#916;8/&#923;8&#8722;Zn8Pd6 to meso&#8208;&#916;4&#923;4&#8722;Zn8Pd6 transition induced by anions. The cage stabilization effect differs from inert Ru2+, metastable Fe2+/Ni2+, and labile Zn2+, resulting in different chiral&#8208;guest induction. Strikingly, solvent&#8208;mediated host&#8211;guest interactions have been revealed for &#916;8/&#923;8&#8722;(Ru/Ni/Fe)8Pd6 cages to discriminate the chiral recognition of the guests with opposite chirality. These results demonstrate a versatile procedure to control the stereochemistry of metal&#8208;organic cages based on the dynamic metal centers, thus providing guidance to maneuver cage chirality at a supramolecular level by virtue of the solvent, anion, and guest to benefit practical applications.

         <title>Corner Engineering: Tailoring Enzymes for Enhanced Resistance and Thermostability in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A directed evolution strategy called corner engineering was developed to tailor enzyme resistance towards deep eutectic solvents (DESs) and high temperatures.







Abstract
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs), heralded for their synthesis simplicity, economic viability, and reduced volatility and flammability, have found increasing application in biocatalysis. However, challenges persist due to a frequent diminution in enzyme activity and stability. Herein, we developed a general protein engineering strategy, termed corner engineering, to acquire DES&#8208;resistant and thermostable enzymes via precise tailoring of the transition region in enzyme structure. Employing Bacillus subtilis lipase A (BSLA) as a model, we delineated the engineering process, yielding five multi&#8208;DESs resistant variants with highly improved thermostability, such as K88E/N89&#8197;K exhibited up to a 10.0&#8208;fold catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) increase in 30&#8201;% (v/v) choline chloride (ChCl): acetamide and 4.1&#8208;fold in 95&#8201;% (v/v) ChCl: ethylene glycol accompanying 6.7&#8208;fold thermal resistance improvement than wild type at &#8776;50&#8201;&#176;C. The generality of the optimized approach was validated by two extra industrial enzymes, endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;1,4&#8208;glucanase PvCel5A (used for biofuel production) and esterase Bs2Est (used for plastics degradation). The molecular investigations revealed that increased water molecules at substrate binding cleft and finetuned helix formation at the corner region are two dominant determinants governing elevated resistance and thermostability. This study, coupling corner engineering with obtained molecular insights, illuminates enzyme&#8208;DES interaction patterns and fosters the rational design of more DES&#8208;resistant and thermostable enzymes in biocatalysis and biotransformation.

         <title>Photocatalytic Generation of Trifluoromethyl Nitrene for Alkene Aziridination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium&#8208;photocatalysed generation of triplet trifluoromethyl nitrene from CF3N3 is reported. The nitrene adds to alkenes to form N&#8208;CF3&#8208;aziridines. Their acid&#8208;mediated [3+2] cycloaddition with nitriles to N&#8208;CF3&#8208;imidazolines and rearrangement to N&#8208;CF3&#8208;imines is investigated.







Abstract
N&#8208;Trifluoromethylated organics may be applied in drug design, agrochemical synthesis, and materials science, among other areas. Yet, despite recent advances in the synthesis of aliphatic, cyclic and heterocyclic N&#8208;trifluoromethyl compounds, no strategy based on trifluoromethyl nitrene has hitherto been explored. Here we describe the formation of triplet trifluoromethyl nitrene from azidotrifluoromethane, a stable and safe&#8208;to&#8208;use precursor, by visible light photocatalysis. The addition of CF3N to alkenes via biradical intermediates afforded previously unknown aziridines substituted with trifluoromethyl group on the nitrogen atom. The obtained aziridines were converted into either N&#8208;trifluoromethylimidazolines, via formal [3+2] cycloaddition with nitriles, mediated by a Lewis acid, or into N&#8208;trifluoromethylaldimines, via ring opening and aryl group migration mediated by a strong Br&#248;nsted acid. Our findings open new opportunities for the development of novel classes of N&#8208;CF3 compounds with possible applications in the life sciences.

         <title>A Rigid Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Core Toward Stable Electroluminescence and Lasing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising rigid and stable multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence lasing core CzBN was proposed. Benefitting from the enhanced molecular rigidity, photo&#8208;, thermal&#8208;stability, and effective separation of excited&#8208;state absorptions, its derivative CzBNPh demonstrated a low lasing threshold of 0.68&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in distributed feedback resonators. Furthermore, CzBNPh exhibited much improved stability in electroluminescent and lasing performance.







Abstract
The investigation of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic laser devices with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules is emerging due to the potential of harnessing triplets. In this work, a boron/nitrogen multiple&#8208;resonance TADF polycyclic framework fusing carbazole units (CzBNPh) was proposed. CzBNPh exhibited a narrowband emission (&lt;30&#8197;nm), a unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and a fast radiative rate. Consequently, CzBNPh demonstrated a low distributed feedback (DFB) lasing threshold of 0.68&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the stimulated emission zone of CzBNPh was effectively separated from its singlet and triplet absorption, thereby minimizing the singlet&#8208;triplet annihilation under long&#8208;pulsed excitation ranging from 20&#8197;&#956;s to 2.5&#8197;ms. Significantly, the enhanced rigid molecular conformation, thermal stability, and photo&#8208;stability resulted in improved lasing and electroluminescence stability compared to that of 5,9&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;diaza&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracene (DABNA)&#8208;core. These findings indicate the potential of CzBN&#8208;core as a promising framework for achieving long&#8208;pulsed wave and electrically&#8208;pumped lasing in the future.

         <title>Preserving Structurally Labile Peptide Nanosheets After Molecular Functionalization of the Self&#8208;Assembling Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a unique way to preserve structurally labile nanosheets after conjugation of a variety of molecules to the self&#8208;assembling peptides. The sheet&#8208;forming peptides afford a staggered alignment for simultaneous separation of external molecules from each other and from the underlying assembly motifs. This strategy allows the functionalization of historically challenging fragile assemblies while maintaining their overall morphology.







Abstract
A significant challenge in creating supramolecular materials is that conjugating molecular functionalities to building blocks often results in dissociation or undesired morphological transformation of their assemblies. Here we present a facile strategy to preserve structurally labile peptide assemblies after molecular modification of the self&#8208;assembling peptides. Sheet&#8208;forming peptides are designed to afford a staggered alignment with the segments bearing chemical modification sites protruding from the sheet surfaces. The staggered assembly allows for simultaneous separation of attached molecules from each other and from the underlying assembly motifs. Strikingly, using PEGs as the external molecules, PEG400&#8208; and PEG700&#8208;peptide conjugates directly self&#8208;associate into nanosheets with the PEG chains localized on the sheet surfaces. In contrast, the sheet formation based on in&#8208;register lateral packing of peptides does not recur upon the peptide PEGylation. This strategy allows for fabrication of densely modified assemblies with a variety of molecules, as demonstrated using biotin (hydrophobic molecule), c(RGDfK) (cyclic pentapeptide), and nucleic acid aptamer (negatively charged ssDNA). The staggered co&#8208;assembly also enables extended tunability of the amount/density of surface molecules, as exemplified by screening ligand&#8208;appended assemblies for cell targeting. This study paves the way for functionalization of historically challenging fragile assemblies while maintaining their overall morphology.

         <title>Chiral Isochalcogenourea&#8208;Catalysed Enantioselective (4+2) Cycloadditions of Allenoates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral isochalcogenoureas (IChU) were successfully established as powerful organocatalysts for the activation and control of allenoates. This unprecedented strategy allows for unique reactivities and high levels of stereocontrol, facilitating reaction pathways that are not possible with the existing methods.







Abstract
Allenoates are versatile building blocks which are primarily activated and controlled using chiral tert. phosphine and tert. amine Lewis bases. We herein report the first example of allenoate activation by using chiral isochalcogenoureas (IChU) for formal (4+2) cycloaddition reactions. Compared to established phosphine and amine catalysis, the use of these easily available Lewis bases enables new stereoselective reaction pathways proceeding with high enantioselectivities, diastereoselectivities, and in good yields. In addition, the factors governing enantioselectivity and the origin of the observed differences compared to other commonly used Lewis bases are explained.

         <title>Preventing Dissolution of Cathode Active Materials by Ion&#8208;anchoring Zeolite&#8208;based Separators for Durable Aqueous Zinc Batteries
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;matrixed zeolite separator (SZ) was designed to tackle the challenges posed by dissolved vanadium (V) ions and dendrite growth in the traditional Zn/V cell system. It effectively immobilizes the dissolved V species from the cathode, thereby preventing continuous dissolution and diffusion of the V&#8208;based compounds and side reactions. Simultaneously, the SZ optimizes the Zn2+ flux, achieving dendrite&#8208;proof capacity.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries have emerged as promising energy storage devices due to their safety and low cost. However, they face challenges such as anodic dendrite formation and cathodic compound dissolution. Here, we present the development of a polymer&#8208;matrixed zeolite separator (SZ) by synthesizing zeolite materials on a flexible polymeric membrane. This separator acts as an effective ionic barrier, preventing the leaching and shuttling of vanadium from the cathode, while significantly inhibiting the formation of by&#8208;products and zinc dendrites. The SZ cells demonstrate stable operation for more than 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an initial capacity of 375.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and over 10,000&#8197;cycles at 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Notably, when pre&#8208;anchored with vanadium ions, the SZ&#8208;V cells exhibited excellent capacity retention of up to 94.6&#8201;% over 1000&#8197;cycles. The SZ separator featuring an ion barrier represents a crucial advancement towards the commercialization of zinc storage devices.

     alt="Preventing Dissolution of Cathode Active Materials by Ion-anchoring Zeolite-based Separators for Durable Aqueous Zinc Batteries**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A polymer-matrixed zeolite separator (SZ) was designed to tackle the challenges posed by dissolved vanadium (V) ions and dendrite growth in the traditional Zn/V cell system. It effectively immobilizes the dissolved V species from the cathode, thereby preventing continuous dissolution and diffusion of the V-based compounds and side reactions. Simultaneously, the SZ optimizes the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux, achieving dendrite-proof capacity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc batteries have emerged as promising energy storage devices due to their safety and low cost. However, they face challenges such as anodic dendrite formation and cathodic compound dissolution. Here, we present the development of a polymer-matrixed zeolite separator (SZ) by synthesizing zeolite materials on a flexible polymeric membrane. This separator acts as an effective ionic barrier, preventing the leaching and shuttling of vanadium from the cathode, while significantly inhibiting the formation of by-products and zinc dendrites. The SZ cells demonstrate stable operation for more than 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with an initial capacity of 375.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and over 10,000&#8197;cycles at 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Notably, when pre-anchored with vanadium ions, the SZ-V cells exhibited excellent capacity retention of up to 94.6&#8201;% over 1000&#8197;cycles. The SZ separator featuring an ion barrier represents a crucial advancement towards the commercialization of zinc storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of two polycyclic norcembranoid diterpenoids is described. Key transformations developed for the synthesis are an intramolecular double Michael addition to construct the [7,6,5,5] tetracyclic skeleton, a Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted acid mediated transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition to introduce the strained ether bridge linking two quaternary carbon atoms, and bio&#8208;inspired conversion of sinulochmodin C into scabrolide A.

Our synthetic route features an intramolecular double Michael addition to construct stereospecifically the [7,6,5,5] tetracyclic skeleton, a vinylogous hydroxylation/oxidation procedure or a stereospecific epoxide opening/oxidation sequence to establish the &#947;&#8208;keto enone intermediate, a Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted acid mediated transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition to fuse the &#946;&#8208;keto tetrahydrofuran moiety, a Mukaiyama hydration/Pd&#8722;C hydrogenation to reverse the C1&#8208;configuration of the isopropenyl unit, and a bioinspired transformation of sinulochmodin C into scabrolide A.

         <title>Mg(C3O4H2)(H2O)2: A New Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Material Derived from KBe2BO3F2 with High Performance and Excellent Water&#8208;Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first alkaline earth metal NLO malonic Mg(C3O4H2)(H2O)2 was synthesized by taking KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) as parent structure. It has a unique two&#8208;dimensional NLO&#8208;favorable electroneutral [Mg(C3O4H2)3(H2O)2]&#8734; layer, resulting in the rare coexistence of a strong SHG response of 3&#215;KDP (@1064&#8197;nm) and short phase&#8208;matching wavelength of 200&#8197;nm. More importantly, it has excellent water resistance, which is rare in ionic organic NLO crystals.







Abstract
Acquiring high&#8208;performance ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials that simultaneously exhibit a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) coefficients, as short as possible SHG phase&#8208;matching (PM) wavelength and non&#8208;hygroscopic properties has consistently posed a significant challenge. Herein, through multicomponent modification of KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), an excellent UV NLO crystal, Mg(C3O4H2)(H2O)2, was successfully synthesized in malonic system. This material possesses a unique 2D NLO&#8208;favorable electroneutral [Mg(C3O4H2)3(H2O)2]&#8734; layer, resulting in the rare coexistence of a strong SHG response of 3&#215;KDP (@1064&#8197;nm) and short PM wavelength of 200&#8197;nm. More importantly, it exhibits exceptional water resistance, which is rare among ionic organic NLO crystals. Theoretical calculations revealed that its excellent water&#8208;resistant may be originated from its small available cavity volumes, which is similar to the famous LiB3O5 (LBO). Therefore, excellent NLO properties and stability against air and moisture indicate it should be a promising UV NLO crystal.

         <title>Click&#8208;Chemistry&#8208;Mediated Cell Membrane Glycopolymer Engineering to Potentiate Dendritic Cell Vaccines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click&#8208;chemistry&#8208;mediated cell membrane glycopolymer engineering is used to potentiate dendritic cell vaccines (DCV). The glycopolymer&#8208;engineering facilitates the adhesion of dendritic cells to T cells, thereby augmenting T cell activation and improving tumor immunotherapy, providing a new strategy for designing enhanced dendritic cell&#8208;based therapeutics.







Abstract
Dendritic cell vaccine (DCV) holds great potential in tumor immunotherapy owing to its potent ability in eliciting tumor&#8208;specific immune responses. Aiming at engineering enhanced DCV, we report the first effort to construct a glycopolymer&#8208;engineered DC vaccine (G&#8208;DCV) via metabolicglycoengineering and copper&#8208;free click&#8208;chemistry. Model G&#8208;DCV was prepared by firstly delivering tumor antigens, ovalbumin (OVA) into dendritic cells (DC) with fluoroalkane&#8208;grafted polyethyleneimines, followed by conjugating glycopolymers with a terminal group of dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) onto dendritic cells. Compared to unmodified DCV, our G&#8208;DCV could induce stronger T cell activation due to the enhanced adhesion between DCs and T cells. Notably, such G&#8208;DCV could more effectively inhibit the growth of the mouse B16&#8208;OVA (expressing OVA antigen) tumor model after adoptive transfer. Moreover, by combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, G&#8208;DCV showed further increased anti&#8208;tumor effects in treating different tumor models. Thus, our work provides a novel strategy to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of DC vaccines.

         <title>Internal Dynamics and Modular Peripheral Binding in Stimuli&#8208;Responsive 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 Host:Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of versatile 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 host/guest complexes has been prepared by combining cucurbit[n]urils with symmetric, linear diviologens. These assemblies have properties typical of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes, but also show a new type of supramolecular translational&#8208;rotational coupling, peripheral complexation amenable to proximal or distal binding, and controllable peripheral ring translocation.







Abstract
Now that the chemistry of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host:guest complexes is well&#8208;established, it is surprising to note that higher stoichiometry (oligomeric) complexes, especially those with excess host, remain largely unexplored. Yet, proteins tend to oligomerize, affording new functions for cell machinery. Here, we show that cucurbit[n]uril (CB[n]) macrocycles combined with symmetric, linear di&#8208;viologens form unusual 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 host:guest complexes exhibiting remarkable dynamic properties, host self&#8208;sorting, and external ring&#8208;translocation. These results highlight the structural tunability of cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) based 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 host:guest complexes in water and their responsiveness toward several stimuli (chemicals, pH, redox).

         <title>A Nanoinhibitor Targeting cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway to Reverse the Homeostatic Imbalance of Inflammation in Psoriasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum&#8208;doped positively charged carbon dots (Pt&#8208;CDs) act as nanoscavengers of cell&#8208;free DNA and reactive oxygen species, inhibiting the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which forms a positive feedback loop between macrophages and keratinocytes and amplifies the inflammatory response in psoriasis.







Abstract
Psoriasis is a chronic skin inflammation characterized by dysregulated crosstalk between immune cells and keratinocytes. Here we show that the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a key regulator of psoriatic inflammation in a mouse model. Platinum&#8208;doped positively charged carbon dots (Pt&#8208;CDs) were designed to inhibit the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. By inhibiting the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway with Pt&#8208;CDs, the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages was reduced, and the proinflammatory cytokines&#8208;induced breakdown of immunological tolerance and overexpression of chemokines in keratinocytes was restored, which reversed the homeostatic imbalance through breaking these cytokines&#8208;mediated intercellular positive feedback loop. Topical Pt&#8208;CDs treatment exhibited therapeutic effects in imiquimod&#8208;induced psoriasis mice without noticeable toxicity. The reversal of elevated expression of STING, phosphorylated STING, and downstream genes within psoriatic lesions indicates that Pt&#8208;CDs effectively inhibit the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. This work suggests a promising strategy for psoriasis treatment by targeting the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway with Pt&#8208;CDs nanoinhibitor to restore skin homeostatic balance.

         <title>Paired Electrosynthesis of Formaldehyde Derivatives from CO2 Reduction and Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical system for the paired electrosynthesis of formaldehyde derivatives through cathodic CO2 reduction and anodic methanol oxidation was constructed. At the cathode, the non&#8208;reducible formic acid was activated by esterification to methyl formate, which was then reduced again to form stable formaldehyde derivatives.







Abstract
Utilizing CO2&#8208;derived formaldehyde derivatives for fuel additive or polymer synthesis is a promising approach to reduce net carbon dioxide emissions. Existing methodologies involve converting CO2 to methanol by thermal hydrogenation, followed by electrochemical or thermochemical oxidation to produce formaldehyde. Adding to the conventional methanol oxidation pathway, we propose a new electrochemical approach to simultaneously generate formaldehyde derivatives at both electrodes by partial methanol oxidation and the direct reduction of CO2. To achieve this, a method to directly reduce CO2 to formaldehyde at the cathode is required. Still, it has been scarcely reported previously due to the acidity of the formic acid intermediate and the facile over&#8208;reduction of formaldehyde to methanol. By enabling the activation and subsequent stabilization of formic acid and formaldehyde respectively in methanol solvent, we were able to implement a strategy where formaldehyde derivatives were generated at the cathode alongside the anode. Further mechanism studies revealed that protons supplied from the anodic reaction contribute to the activation of formic acid and the stabilization of the formaldehyde product. Additionally, it was found that the cathodic formaldehyde derivative Faradaic efficiency can be further increased through prolonged electrolysis time up to 50&#8201;% along with a maximum anodic formaldehyde derivative Faradaic efficiency of 90&#8201;%.

         <title>A Versatile Comonomer Additive for Radically Recyclable Vinyl&#8208;derived Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinyl&#8208;derived polymers are notoriously challenging to recycle chemically. Herein, we report free&#8208;radical copolymerization of a cyclic allyl sulfide with several monomers, generating dynamic linkages for closed&#8208;loop cyclability. Scission via radical addition&#8208;fragmentation&#8208;transfer (AFT) dramatically reduces molar mass and preserves oligomer reactivity. Recycling by oligomer extension imparts tunable recovery molar mass and fosters upcycling.







Abstract
Radically&#8208;formed, vinyl&#8208;derived polymers account for over 30&#8201;% of polymer production. Connected through stable carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, these materials are notoriously challenging to chemically recycle. Herein, we report universal copolymerization of a cyclic allyl sulfide (CAS) additive with multiple monomers under free&#8208;radical conditions, to introduce main&#8208;chain dynamic motifs. Backbone allyl sulfides undergo post&#8208;polymerization radical rearrangement via addition&#8208;fragmentation&#8208;transfer (AFT) that fosters both chain scission and extension. Scission is selectively induced through allyl sulfide exchange with small molecule thiyl radicals, resulting in oligomers as low as 14&#8201;% of the initial molar mass. Crucially, oligomers retain allyl sulfide end groups, enabling their extension with monomer under radical conditions. Extended, i.e., recycled, product molar mass is tunable through the ratio of monomer to oligomer, and can surpass that of the initial copolymer. Two scission&#8208;extension cycles are demonstrated in copolymers with methyl methacrylate and styrene without escalation in dispersity. In illustration of forming higher&#8208;value products, i.e., upcycling, we synthesized block copolymers through the extension of oligomers with a different vinyl monomer. Collectively, our approach to chemical recycling is unparalleled in its ability to 1) function in a variety of vinyl&#8208;derived polymers, 2) complete radical closed&#8208;loop cycling, and 3) upcycle waste material.

         <title>Design of Chiral &#946;&#8208;Double Helices from &#947;&#8208;Peptide Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal and solution conformations have been engineered for right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed &#946;&#8208;double helices derived from a concatenation of achiral (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids and chiral (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids. The structural analogy of these new &#946;&#8208;double helices with natural peptide double helices, and their ion&#8208;transport activities are also discussed.







Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in nature, and homochirality is manifested in many biomolecules. Although &#946;&#8208;double helices are rare in peptides and proteins, they consist of alternating L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids. No peptide double helices with homochiral amino acids have been observed. Here, we report chiral &#946;&#8208;double helices constructed from &#947;&#8208;peptides consisting of alternating achiral (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated 4,4&#8208;dimethyl &#947;&#8208;amino acids and chiral (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids in both single crystals and in solution. The two independent strands of the same peptide intertwine to form a &#946;&#8208;double helix structure, and it is stabilized by inter&#8208;strand hydrogen bonds. The peptides with chiral (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids derived from &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;amino acids adopt a (P)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;double helix, whereas peptides consisting of (E)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;amino acids derived from &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;amino acids adopt an (M)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;double helix conformation. The circular dichroism (CD) signature of the (P) and (M)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;double helices and the stability of these peptides at higher temperatures were examined. Furthermore, ion transport studies suggested that these peptides transport ions across membranes. Even though the structural analogy suggests that these new &#946;&#8208;double helices are structurally different from those of the &#945;&#8208;peptide &#946;&#8208;double helices, they retain ion transport activity. The results reported here may open new avenues in the design of functional foldamers.

         <title>Promoting Piezocatalytic H2O2 Production in Pure Water by Loading Metal&#8208;Organic Cage&#8208;Modified Gold Nanoparticles on Graphitic Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>

A piezocatalyst for H2O2 production gives a yield of 120.21&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure water and air. The metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC) component enhances substrate (O2) and product (H2O2) adsorption via host&#8211;guest interaction and hinder the rapid H2O2 decomposition. The gold nanoparticle (AuNP) component affords a strong interfacial electric field that significantly promotes the migration of electrons from Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) component for O2 reduction reaction.







Abstract
Piezocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production is a green synthesis method, but the rapid complexation of charge carriers in piezocatalysts and the difficulty of adsorbing substrates limit its performance. Here, metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles are anchored on graphitic carbon nitride (MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4) via hydrogen bond to serve as the multifunctional sites for efficient H2O2 production. Experiments and theoretical calculations prove that MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4 simultaneously optimize three key parts of piezocatalytic H2O2 production: i) the MOC component enhances substrate (O2) and product (H2O2) adsorption via host&#8211;guest interaction and hinders the rapid decomposition of H2O2 on MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4, ii) the AuNP component affords a strong interfacial electric field that significantly promotes the migration of electrons from g&#8208;C3N4 for O2 reduction reaction (ORR), iii) holes are used for H2O oxidation reaction (WOR) to produce O2 and H+ to further promote ORR. Thus, MOC&#8208;AuNP/g&#8208;C3N4 can be used as an efficient piezocatalyst to generate H2O2 at rates up to 120.21&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in air and pure water without using sacrificial agents. This work proposes a new strategy for efficient piezocatalytic H2O2 synthesis by constructing multiple active sites in semiconductor catalysts via hydrogen bonding, by enhancing substrate adsorption, rapid separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs and preventing rapid decomposition of H2O2.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Mediated Radiosynthesis of Unprotected Fluorine&#8208;18 Labelled &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;yielding radiofluorination of unprotected &#945;&#8208;tertiary haloamides is described. This method provides a new strategy for radiochemists to install fluorine&#8208;18 into sterically protected environments for positron emission tomography imaging. Preliminary mechanistic studies were leveraged to develop a novel C&#8722;H radiofluorination reaction of N&#8208;sulphonyloxyamides.







Abstract
This report describes the development of a Zn(OTf)2&#8208;mediated method for converting &#945;&#8208;tertiary haloamides to the corresponding fluorine&#8208;18 labelled &#945;&#8208;tertiary fluoroamides with no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [18F]tetramethylammonium fluoride. 1,5,7&#8208;Triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene is an essential additive for achieving high radiochemical conversion. Under the optimised conditions, radiofluorination proceeds at sterically hindered tertiary sites in high radiochemical conversions, yields, and purities. This method has been successfully automated and applied to access &gt;200 mCi (&gt;7.4&#8197;GBq) of several model radiofluorides. Mechanistic studies led to the development of a new, nucleophilic C&#8722;H radiofluorination process using N&#8208;sulphonyloxyamide substrates.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wide chemical diversity in bacterial languages is explored in the Research Article by Markus B. Linder et&#8197;al. (e202314469). The structural similarities were mapped theoretically and sets of both closely related and widely diverging ligand structures experimentally investigated. The results suggest that structural diversity in quorum sensing ligands can be used as a starting point to predict non&#8208;cognate binding in intercellular signalling systems. Orthogonal signalling systems could significantly advance our engineering capabilities of microbial communities. Cover designed by Dr. Ekaterina Osmekhina.

         <dc:description>
Complementary aqueous emulsions stabilized by oppositely charged polyelectrolytes form films that adhere many plastic and other surfaces well. However, at both high and low pH these films can be detached, creating a reversible adhesive. Such a glue has many possibilities to change how industries recycle end&#8208;of&#8208;life components. The glue can coat surfaces just like a paint, has a long shelf life, and does not degrade in humid environments, as reported by Mark Geoghegan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202310750).

         <dc:description>
A fruitful stereochemical scenario of metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) is demonstrated by Cheng&#8208;Yong Su et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202315053). Based on the intrinsic dynamics of different metal ions, it is shown how the dynamic stereochemistry of the cages is correlated with the coordination lability of the metal centers, and how their chiral induction, resolution and recognition behaviors can be maneuvered through multiple guest interactions, which may enable rational design, control and application of chiral&#8208;MOC containers.

         <dc:description>
Dual catalysis of gold nanoclusters protected by thiolate ligands toward photocatalytic cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between aliphatic tertiary amines and terminal alkynes is reported by Katsuhiro Isozaki, Masaharu Nakamura et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202312135). The cooperative catalytic properties of the superatomic core and gold&#8208;thiolate staples were elucidated by mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations of ligand&#8208;exchanged nanoclusters as the catalytically active intermediates.

         <title>Increasing the Magnetic Blocking Temperature of Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite three decades of intensive investigation of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) there are still unexplored roads towards increasing their magnetization blocking temperature. In this Review, after short overview of key SMM compounds, the basic strategies for further enhancement of SMM performance for mononuclear and polynuclear complexes are presented.







Abstract
The synthesis of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), magnetic complexes capable of retaining magnetization blocking for a long time at elevated temperatures, has been a major concern for magnetochemists over the last three decades. In this review, we describe basic SMMs and the different approaches that allow high magnetization&#8208;blocking temperatures to be reached. We focus on the basic factors affecting magnetization blocking, magnetic axiality and the height of the blocking barrier, which can be used to group different families of complexes in terms of their SMM efficiency. Finally, we discuss several practical routes for the design of mono&#8208; and polynuclear complexes that could be applied in memory devices.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Development of Non&#8208;Invasive Imaging Probes for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular imaging is a rapidly growing platform for studying molecular and cellular events in living organisms. This review highlights recent advances in the chemical design of molecular probes with various imaging modalities such as PET, MRI, and optical imaging for early, real&#8208;time assessment of immune responses and prediction of therapeutic outcome in cancer immunotherapy by detecting expression and functional states of specific targets.







Abstract
The last two decades have witnessed a major revolution in the field of tumor immunology including clinical progress using various immunotherapy strategies. These advances have highlighted the potential for approaches that harness the power of the immune system to fight against cancer. While cancer immunotherapies have shown significant clinical successes, patient responses vary widely due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of tumors and immune responses, calling for reliable biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to maximize the benefits of immunotherapy. Especially, stratifying responding individuals from non&#8208;responders during the early stages of treatment could help avoid long&#8208;term damage and tailor personalized treatments. In efforts to develop non&#8208;invasive means for accurately evaluating and predicting tumor response to immunotherapy, multiple affinity&#8208;based agents targeting immune cell markers and checkpoint molecules have been developed and advanced to clinical trials. In addition, researchers have recently turned their attention to substrate and activity&#8208;based imaging probes that can provide real&#8208;time, functional assessment of immune response to treatment. Here, we highlight some of those recently designed probes that image functional proteases as biomarkers of cancer immunotherapy with a focus on their chemical design and detection modalities and discuss challenges and opportunities for the development of imaging tools utilized in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Aldol Condensation for the Construction of Organic Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aldol&#8208;condensation&#8208;derived organic functional materials have exerted a profound influence on n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), organic thermoelectrics (OTEs), and NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion. This all&#8208;encompassing Review highlights the recent decade's developments, charting the course for progress in this growing and multidisciplinary domain.







Abstract
Aldol condensation is a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable synthetic method, offering the advantages of low complexity, substrate universality, and high efficiency. Over the past decade, it has become popular for creating next&#8208;generation organic functional materials, particularly rigid&#8208;rod conjugated (semi)conductors. This review focuses on conjugated small molecules, oligomers, and polymeric (semi)conductors synthesized through aldol condensation, with emphasis on their remarkable features in advancing n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), and organic thermoelectrics (OTEs) as well as NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion. Coherence character, optical properties, microstructure, and chain conformation are investigated to understand material&#8208;property relationships. Future applications and challenges in this area are also discussed.

This Minireview highlights the fundamental aspects and the recent progress made in the emerging field of the formation of electrolyte interphases (EIs) in aqueous electrolytes.







Abstract
The narrow electrochemical stability window of water poses a challenge to the development of aqueous electrolytes. In contrast to non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes, the products of water electrolysis do not contribute to the formation of a passivation layer on electrodes. As a result, aqueous electrolytes require the reactions of additional components, such as additives and co&#8208;solvents, to facilitate the formation of the desired solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the anode and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the cathode. This review highlights the fundamental principles and recent advancements in generating electrolyte interphases in aqueous batteries.

         <title>DNA Nanostructures: Self&#8208;Adjuvant Carriers for Highly Efficient Subunit Vaccines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we provide a concise overview of the unique properties exhibited by DNA nanostructures. Then we delve into the principles behind using DNA nanostructures as self&#8208;adjuvant carriers and review the latest advancements in efficient subunit vaccines construction, and propose potential directions for future development in this field.







Abstract
Subunit vaccines based on antigen proteins or epitopes of pathogens or tumors show advantages in immunological precision and high safety, but are often limited by their low immunogenicity. Adjuvants can boost immune responses by stimulating immune cells or promoting antigen uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs), yet existing clinical adjuvants struggle in simultaneously achieving these dual functions. Additionally, the spatial organization of antigens might be crucial to their immunogenicity. Hence, superior adjuvants should potently stimulate the immune system, precisely arrange antigens, and effectively deliver antigens to APCs. Recently, precisely organizing and delivering antigens with the unique editability of DNA nanostructures has been proposed, presenting unique abilities in significantly improving the immunogenicity of antigens. In this minireview, we will discuss the principles behind using DNA nanostructures as self&#8208;adjuvant carriers and review the latest advancements in this field. The potential and challenges associated with self&#8208;adjuvant DNA nanostructures will also be discussed.

         <title>Active Sites of Cobalt Phthalocyanine in Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic and spectroscopic characterizations of cobalt phthalocyanine on carbon nanotubes (CoPc/CNT) and its catalyst analogs are reported. The results help us understand the nature of the active site for the electrochemical CO2 reduction to methanol.







Abstract
Many metal coordination compounds catalyze CO2 electroreduction to CO, but cobalt phthalocyanine hybridized with conductive carbon such as carbon nanotubes is currently the only one that can generate methanol. The underlying structure&#8211;reactivity correlation and reaction mechanism desperately demand elucidation. Here we report the first in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy characterization, combined with ex situ spectroscopic and electrocatalytic measurements, to study CoPc&#8208;catalyzed CO2 reduction to methanol. Molecular dispersion of CoPc on CNT surfaces, as evidenced by the observed electronic interaction between the two, is crucial to fast electron transfer to the active sites and multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction. CO, the key intermediate in the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol pathway, is found to be labile on the active site, which necessitates a high local concentration in the microenvironment to compete with CO2 for active sites and promote methanol production. A comparison of the electrocatalytic performance of structurally related porphyrins indicates that the bridging aza&#8208;N atoms of the Pc macrocycle are critical components of the CoPc active site that produces methanol. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy identifies the active site as Co(I) and supports an increasingly non&#8208;centrosymmetric Co coordination environment at negative applied potential, likely due to the formation of a Co&#8722;CO adduct during the catalysis.

         <title>Electroreductive Synthesis of Nickel(0) Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical reduction of Ni(II) salts to make Ni(COD)2 on preparative scales is reported. The method was extended to other useful precatalyst complexes such as Ni(COD)(DQ), Ni(tBustb)3, Ni(COD)(DPPF), and Ni(PPh3)4. A 38&#8197;mmol scale&#8208;up was demonstrated with recirculating flow, and the electrochemical platform could be used to reduce a catalytic amount of Ni(II) to initiate a nickel(0)&#8208;catalyzed organic transformation.







Abstract
Over the last fifty years, the use of nickel catalysts for facilitating organic transformations has skyrocketed. Nickel(0) sources act as useful precatalysts because they can enter a catalytic cycle through ligand exchange, without needing to undergo additional elementary steps. However, most Ni(0) precatalysts are synthesized with stoichiometric aluminum&#8211;hydride reductants, pyrophoric reagents that are not atom&#8208;economical and must be used at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that Ni(II) salts can be reduced on preparative scale using electrolysis to yield a variety of Ni(0) and Ni(II) complexes that are widely used as precatalysts in organic synthesis, including bis(1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) [Ni(COD)2]. This method overcomes the reproducibility issues of previously reported methods by standardizing the procedure, such that it can be performed anywhere in a robust manner. It can be transitioned to large scale through an electrochemical recirculating flow process and extended to an in situ reduction protocol to generate catalytic amounts of Ni(0) for organic transformations. We anticipate that this work will accelerate adoption of preparative electrochemistry for the synthesis of low&#8208;valent organometallic complexes in academia and industry.

         <title>Unusual Thermal Quenching of Photoluminescence from an Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid [MnBr4]2&#8722;&#8208;based Halide Mediated by Crystalline&#8211;Crystalline Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual temporary photoluminescence (PL) quenching effect is herein reported for the first time, namely the thermodynamic phase transition of (DMML)2MnBr4 (DMML=N,N&#8208;dimethylmorpholinium) couples highly with PL response. Notably, the intriguing phenomenon will make an important contribution to the further in&#8208;depth exploration of responsive photoluminescence and optical encryption.







Abstract
The ability to generate and manipulate photoluminescence (PL) behavior has been of primary importance for applications in information security. Excavating novel optical effects to create more possibilities for information encoding has become a continuous challenge. Herein, we present an unprecedented PL temporary quenching that highly couples with thermodynamic phase transition in a hybrid crystal (DMML)2MnBr4 (DMML=N,N&#8208;dimethylmorpholinium). Such unusual PL behavior originates from the anomalous variation of [MnBr4]2&#8722; tetrahedrons that leads to non&#8208;radiation recombination near the phase transition temperature of 340&#8197;K. Remarkably, the suitable detectable temperature, narrow response window, high sensitivity, and good cyclability of this PL temporary quenching will endow encryption applications with high concealment, operational flexibility, durability, and commercial popularization. Profited from these attributes, a fire&#8208;new optical encryption model is devised to demonstrate high confidential information security. This unprecedented optical effect would provide new insights and paradigms for the development of luminescent materials to enlighten future information encryption.

Remarkably, the suitable detectable temperature, narrow response window, high sensitivity, and good cyclability of this PL temporary quenching will endow encryption applications with high concealment, operational flexibility, durability, and commercial popularization. Profited from these attributes, a fire-new optical encryption model is devised to demonstrate high confidential information security. This unprecedented optical effect would provide new insights and paradigms for the development of luminescent materials to enlighten future information encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Incargranine A Enabled by Bifunctional Iminophosphorane and Iridium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;incargranine A has been completed in nine steps. An enantioselective, organocatalysed dienone desymmetrising Michael addition and an iridium&#8208;catalysed reductive cyclisation were developed to access a key hemiaminal intermediate that was used to initiate a biomimetic cascade towards the natural product.







Abstract
Herein we report the first enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;incargranine A, in nine steps. The total synthesis was enabled by an enantioselective intramolecular organocatalysed desymmetrising Michael addition of a malonamate ester to a linked dienone substrate that established pivotal stereocentres with excellent enantio&#8208; and complete diastereoselectivity. Furthermore, a key hemiaminal intermediate was accessed by developing an iridium&#8208;catalysed reductive cyclisation, and the scope of this transformation was explored to produce a range of bicyclic hemiaminal motifs. Once installed, the hemiaminal motif was used to initiate a biomimetic cascade to access the natural product directly in a single step.

         <dc:description>
Lithiation and trapping at convenient temperatures (0/&#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C) of five cyclic sulfides such as tetrahydrothiophene, tetrahydrothiopyrans and a thiomorpholine enables straightforward &#945;&#8208;functionalisation.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Catalysed Intermolecular Reductive Coupling of Dienes and Ketones
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, catalytic method for the intermolecular reductive coupling of feedstock dienes and styrenes with ketones and imines is reported. Applications of this straightforward approach include the efficient synthesis of drug molecules and site&#8208;selective late&#8208;stage functionalisation.







Abstract
We report a mild, catalytic method for the intermolecular reductive coupling of feedstock dienes and styrenes with ketones. Our conditions allow concomitant formation of a cobalt hydride species and single&#8208;electron reduction of ketones. Subsequent selective hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer from the cobalt hydride generates an allylic radical which can selectively couple with the persistent radical&#8208;anion of the ketone. This radical&#8208;radical coupling negates unfavourable steric interactions of ionic pathways and avoids the unstable alkoxy radical of previous radical olefin&#8208;carbonyl couplings, which were limited, as a result, to aldehydes. Applications of this novel and straightforward approach include the efficient synthesis of drug molecules, key intermediates in drug synthesis and site&#8208;selective late&#8208;stage functionalisation.

         <title>Sulfonium Cation in the Service of &#960;&#8208;Acid Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a rigid PSP ligand based on sulfonium cation enables a straightforward access to a stable tris&#8208;cationic Pt(II) complex featuring a remarkably short S+&#8722;Pt2+ bond. The presence of a positively charged sulfonium moiety in this complex enhances the electrophilicity of the Pt(II) center (compared to its thioether&#8208;based analog), which leads to an excellent performance as a &#960;&#8208;acid catalyst for alkyne cycloisomerization.







Abstract
While still rare, cationic ligands offer much promise as tunable electron&#8208;withdrawing ligands for &#960;&#8208;acid catalysis. Recently, we introduced pincer&#8208;type sulfonium cations into the list of available strongly &#960;&#8208;acidic ancillary ligands. However, the M&#8722;S bond in sulfonium complexes of these ligands was found highly labile, precluding their catalytic applications. Herein we demonstrate that this obstacle can be overcome by increasing the rigidity of the sulfonium pincer scaffold. X&#8208;ray analyses confirm that despite bearing a formal positive charge, the sulfur atom of this newly designed sulfonium ligand maintains its coordination to the Pt(II)&#8208;center, while DFT calculations indicate that by doing so it strongly enhances the electrophilic character of the metal. Kinetic studies carried out on three model cycloisomerization reactions prove that such a tris&#8208;cationic sulfonium&#8208;Pt(II) complex is highly reactive, compared to its thioether&#8208;based analogue. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study presents the first example of employing sulfonium&#8208;based ligands in homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Nanographene with a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Cavity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanographene with a tri&#8208;N&#8208;doped cavity was synthesized by photo&#8208;induced cyclization. In comparison with nitrogen&#8208;doping at the edge, this tri&#8208;N&#8208;doped holey nanographene exhibited markedly reduced basicity and selective affinity toward Ag+. This nanographene with a N&#8208;doped cavity provides a precise model for understanding the binding in the nano&#8208;confined defects of graphenic materials.







Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped cavities are pervasive in graphenic materials, and represent key sites for catalytic and electrochemical activity. However, their structures are generally heterogeneous. In this study, we present the synthesis of a well&#8208;defined molecular cutout of graphene featuring N&#8208;doped cavity. The graphitization of a macrocyclic pyridinic precursor was achieved through photochemical cyclodehydrochlorination. In comparison to its counterpart with pyridinic nitrogen at the edges, the pyridinic nitrogen atoms in this nanographene cavity exhibit significantly reduced basicity and selective binding to Ag+ ion. Analysis of the protonation and coordination equilibria revealed that the tri&#8208;N&#8208;doped cavity binds three protons, but only one Ag+ ion. These distinct protonation and coordination behaviors clearly illustrate the space confinement effect imparted by the cavities.

         <title>Vitamin B12&#8208;Photocatalyzed Cyclopropanation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Alkenes Using Dichloromethane as the Methylene Source
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 2, January 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a vitamin B12&#8208;photocatalyzed strategy for the cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) as the methylene source. The reaction has excellent functional group tolerance, is highly chemoselective, and the scope can be extended to other 1,1&#8208;dichloroalkanes for the preparation of D2&#8208;cyclopropyl and methyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropyl adducts, all of which are important isosteres in medical chemistry.







Abstract
The cyclopropyl group is of great importance in medicinal chemistry, as it can be leveraged to influence a range of pharmaceutical properties in drug molecules. This report describes a Vitamin B12&#8208;photocatalyzed approach for the cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) as the methylene source. The reaction proceeds in good to excellent yields under mild conditions, has excellent functional group compatibility, and is highly chemoselective. The scope could also be extended to the preparation of D2&#8208;cyclopropyl and methyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropyl adducts starting from CD2Cl2 and 1,1&#8208;dichloroethane, respectively.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Photoreduction to Formate or CO with High Selectivity over a Covalent Organic Framework Covalently Anchored on Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic performance for the reduction of CO2 to HCOO&#8722; or CO can be significantly enhanced by covalently anchoring COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co on the surface of graphene oxide.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been widely studied in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, pristine COFs usually exhibit low catalytic efficiency owing to the fast recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. In this study, we fabricated a stable COF&#8208;based composite (GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co) by covalently anchoring COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Interestingly, in absolute acetonitrile (CH3CN), GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co shows a high selectivity of 94.4&#8201;% for the photoreduction of CO2 to formate, with a formate yield of 15.8&#8197;mmol/g, which is approximately four times higher than that using the pristine COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co. By contrast, in CH3CN/H2O (v&#8201;:&#8201;v=4&#8201;:&#8201;1), the main product for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction over GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co is CO (96.1&#8201;%), with a CO yield as high as 52.2&#8197;mmol/g, which is also approximately four times higher than that using the pristine COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co. Photoelectrochemical experiments demonstrate the covalent bonding of COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co and GO to form the GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co composite facilitates charge separation and transfer significantly, thereby accounting for the enhanced catalytic activity. In addition, theoretical calculations and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveal H2O can stabilize the *COOH intermediate to further form a *CO intermediate via O&#8722;H(aq)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O(*COOH) hydrogen bonding, thus explaining the regulated photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Weak Solvation Effect Induced Optimal Interfacial Chemistry Enables Highly Durable Zn Anodes for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolyte with weakly solvation effect is rationally developed for aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs). Benefiting from the reduced solvated H2O, boosted desolvation kinetics and in situ formed solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, Zn anode cycled in this electrolyte can deliver enhanced cycling stability.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as one of the most reliable energy storage technologies for scale&#8208;up applications, but still suffer from the instability of Zn anode, which is mainly caused by the undesirable dendrite growth and side reactions. To tackle these issues, we formulate a new aqueous electrolyte with weak solvation effect by introducing low&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant acetone to achieve H2O&#8208;poor solvation structure of Zn2+. Experimental and theoretical calculation studies concurrently reveal that such solvation structure can: i)&#8197;relieve the solvated H2O related side reactions, ii)&#8197;suppress the dendrite growth by boosting the desolvation kinetics of Zn2+ and iii)&#8197;in situ form solid electrolyte interface (SEI) to synergistically inhibit the side reaction and dendrite growth. The synergy of these three factors prolongs the cycling life of Cu/Zn asymmetric cell from 30&#8197;h to more than 800&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and can work at more harsh condition of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More encouragingly, Zn/V2O5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O full cell also shows enhanced cycling stability of 95.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000&#8197;cycles, much better than that with baseline electrolyte (failing at &#8776;700th&#8197;cycle).

&lt;p&gt;An electrolyte with weakly solvation effect is rationally developed for aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs). Benefiting from the reduced solvated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, boosted desolvation kinetics and in situ formed solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, Zn anode cycled in this electrolyte can deliver enhanced cycling stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as one of the most reliable energy storage technologies for scale-up applications, but still suffer from the instability of Zn anode, which is mainly caused by the undesirable dendrite growth and side reactions. To tackle these issues, we formulate a new aqueous electrolyte with weak solvation effect by introducing low-dielectric-constant acetone to achieve H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-poor solvation structure of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Experimental and theoretical calculation studies concurrently reveal that such solvation structure can: i)&#8197;relieve the solvated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O related side reactions, ii)&#8197;suppress the dendrite growth by boosting the desolvation kinetics of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and iii)&#8197;in situ form solid electrolyte interface (SEI) to synergistically inhibit the side reaction and dendrite growth. The synergy of these three factors prolongs the cycling life of Cu/Zn asymmetric cell from 30&#8197;h to more than 800&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and can work at more harsh condition of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. More encouragingly, Zn/V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O full cell also shows enhanced cycling stability of 95.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000&#8197;cycles, much better than that with baseline electrolyte (failing at &#8776;700&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cycle).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Disproportionation of Co2+ in the Topochemically Reduced Oxide LaSrCoRuO5</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical reduction of LaSrCoRuO6 yields LaSrCoRuO5 a phase containing Co3+O6, Co1+O4 and Ru3+O5 units, consistent with the coordination&#8208;geometry&#8208;driven disproportionation of Co2+ in an extended oxide.







Abstract
Complex transition&#8208;metal oxides exhibit a wide variety of chemical and physical properties which are a strong function the local electronic states of the transition&#8208;metal centres, as determined by a combination of metal oxidation state and local coordination environment. Topochemical reduction of the double perovskite oxide, LaSrCoRuO6, using Zr, yields LaSrCoRuO5. This reduced phase contains an ordered array of apex&#8208;linked square&#8208;based pyramidal Ru3+O5, square&#8208;planar Co1+O4 and octahedral Co3+O6 units, consistent with the coordination&#8208;geometry driven disproportionation of Co2+. Coordination&#8208;geometry driven disproportionation of d7 transition&#8208;metal cations (e.g. Rh2+, Pd3+, Pt3+) is common in complex oxides containing 4d and 5d metals. However, the weak ligand field experienced by a 3d transition&#8208;metal such as cobalt leads to the expectation that d7+ Co2+ should be stable to disproportionation in oxide environments, so the presence of Co1+O4 and Co3+O6 units in LaSrCoRuO5 is surprising. Low&#8208;temperature measurements indicate LaSrCoRuO5 adopts a ferromagnetically ordered state below 120&#8197;K due to couplings between S=1/2 Ru3+ and S=1 Co1+.

         <title>A Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#8208;Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (MRI&#8208;CEST) Method for the Detection of Water Cycling across Cellular Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#8208;Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (MRI&#8208;CEST) method to image and quantify in vivo water cycling across cell membranes is reported. Parametric MRI&#8208;maps can be obtained that report, for each voxel, the degree of water permeability across cells. Cell membrane water permeability is a biomarker of cancer aggressiveness and can be used to monitor chemotherapy, as demonstrated in murine models of breast cancers.







Abstract
Water cycling across the membrane transporters is considered a hallmark of cellular metabolism and it could be of high diagnostic relevance in the characterization of tumors and other diseases. The method relies on the response of intracellular proton exchanging molecules to the presence of extracellular Gd&#8208;based contrast agents (GBCAs). Paramagnetic GBCAs enhances the relaxation rate of water molecules in the extracellular compartment and, through membrane exchange, the relaxation enhancement is transferred to intracellular molecules. The effect is detected at the MRI&#8208;CEST (Magnetic Resonance Imaging &#8208; Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer) signal of intracellular proton exchanging molecules. The magnitude of the change in the CEST response reports on water cycling across the membrane. The method has been tested on Red Blood Cells and on orthotopic murine models of breast cancer with different degree of malignancy (4T1, TS/A and 168FARN). The distribution of voxels reporting on membrane permeability fits well with the cells&#8217; aggressiveness and acts as an early reporter to monitor therapeutic treatments.

         <title>Advances and Prospects in Understanding London Dispersion Interactions in Molecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It has by now been realized that London dispersion (LD) interactions, the main contributor to the attractive part of the van der Waals potential, are ubiquitously present and need to be taken into consideration in structures and dynamics of chemical reactions. This review highlights recent experimental and theoretical advances in utilizing LD interactions as a design element.







Abstract
London dispersion (LD) interactions are the main contribution of the attractive part of the van der Waals potential. Even though LD effects are the driving force for molecular aggregation and recognition, the role of these omnipresent interactions in structure and reactivity had been largely underappreciated over decades. However, in the recent years considerable efforts have been made to thoroughly study LD interactions and their potential as a chemical design element for structures and catalysis. This was made possible through a fruitful interplay of theory and experiment. This review highlights recent results and advances in utilizing LD interactions as a structural motif to understand and utilize intra&#8208; and intermolecularly LD&#8208;stabilized systems. Additionally, we focus on the quantification of LD interactions and their fundamental role in chemical reactions.

         <title>Shearing Liquid&#8208;Crystalline MXene into Lamellar Membranes with Super&#8208;Aligned Nanochannels for Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene membrane with super&#8208;aligned nanochannels by applying shear forces to liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) MXene nanosheet dispersion. The as&#8208;prepared LC MXene membrane (LCMM) shows excellent in&#8208;plane stacking order and precise interlayer spacing of &#8776;6&#8197;&#197;, demonstrating ultrahigh selectivities toward Li+/Na+, Li+/K+, and Li+/Rb+ (&#8776;45, &#8776;49, and &#8776;59, respectively), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.







Abstract
Ion&#8208;selective membranes are crucial in various chemical and physiological processes. Numerous studies have demonstrated progress in separating monovalent/multivalent ions, but efficient monovalent/monovalent ion sieving remains a great challenge due to their same valence and similar radii. Here, this work reports a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene membrane with super&#8208;aligned slit&#8208;shaped nanochannels with ultrahigh monovalent ion selectivity. The MXene membrane is prepared by applying shear forces to a liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) MXene dispersion, which is conducive to the highly&#8208;ordered stacking of the MXene nanosheets. The obtained LC MXene membrane (LCMM) exhibits ultrahigh selectivities toward Li+/Na+, Li+/K+, and Li+/Rb+ separation (&#8776;45, &#8776;49, and &#8776;59), combined with a fast Li+ transport with a permeation rate of &#8776;0.35&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. Theoretical calculations indicate that in MXene nanochannels, the hydrated Li+ with a tetrahedral shape has the smallest diameter among the monovalent ions, contributing to the highest mobility. Besides, the weakest interaction is found between hydrated Li+ and MXene channels which also contributes to the ultrafast permeation of Li+ through the super&#8208;aligned MXene channels. This work demonstrates the capability of MXene membranes in monovalent ion separation, which also provides a facile and general strategy to fabricate lamellar membranes in a large scale.

         <title>Anion Sensing through Redox&#8208;Modulated Fluorescent Halogen Bonding and Hydrogen Bonding Hosts
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence&#8208;spectroelectrochemical anion sensing is introduced as a powerful method to enable anion detection via simultaneous emission and voltammetry readouts. The combined advantages of both approaches facilitate anion sensing at very low sensor concentrations and in a competitive solvent system using a redox&#8208;active ferrocene&#8208;containing BODIPY anion receptor, wherein photoinduced electron transfer (PET) modulates fluorescence emission.







Abstract
Anion sensing via either optical or electrochemical readouts has separately received enormous attention, however, a judicious combination of the advantages of both modalities remains unexplored. Toward this goal, we herein disclose a series of novel, redox&#8208;active, fluorescent, halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) BODIPY&#8208;based anion sensors, wherein the introduction of a ferrocene motif induces remarkable changes in the fluorescence response. Extensive fluorescence anion titration, lifetime and electrochemical studies reveal anion binding&#8208;induced emission modulation through intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PET), the magnitude of which is dependent on the nature of both the XB/HB donor and anion. Impressively, the XB sensor outperformed its HB congener in terms of anion binding strength and fluorescence switching magnitude, displaying significant fluorescence turn&#8208;OFF upon anion binding. In contrast, redox&#8208;inactive control receptors display a turn&#8208;ON response, highlighting the pronounced impact of the introduction of the redox&#8208;active ferrocene on the optical sensing performance. Additionally, the redox&#8208;active ferrocene motif also serves as an electrochemical reporter group, enabling voltammetric anion sensing in competitive solvents. The combined advantages of both sensing modalities were further exploited in a novel, proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, fluorescence spectroelectrochemical anion sensing approach, enabling simultaneous and sensitive read out of optical and electrochemical responses in multiple oxidation states and at very low receptor concentration.

         <title>Binary Atomic Sites Enable a Confined Bidirectional Tandem Electrocatalytic Sulfur Conversion for Low&#8208;Temperature All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Na&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional hollow sulfur matrix consisting binary atomically dispersed MnN4 and CoN4 hotspots was fabricated. And the catalytic matrix facilitated confined tandem electrocatalysis effects render the successive reversible conversion of both long&#8208; and short&#8208;chain polysulfide intermediators and mitigate the cathodic passivation within the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic membrane architectured solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S cells.







Abstract
The broader implementation of current all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S batteries is still plagued by high operation temperature and inefficient sulfur utilization. And the uncontrollable sulfur speciation pathway along with the sluggish polysulfide redox kinetics further compromise the theoretical potentials of Na&#8722;S chemistry. Herein, we report a confined bidirectional tandem electrocatalysis effect to tune polysulfide electrochemistry in a novel low&#8208;temperature (80&#8201;&#176;C) all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S battery that utilizes Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic membrane as a platform. The bifunctional hollow sulfur matrix consisting binary atomically dispersed MnN4 and CoN4 hotspots was fabricated using a sacrificial template process. Upon discharge, CoN4 sites activate sulfur species and catalyze long&#8208;chain to short&#8208;chain polysulfides reduction, while MnN4 centers substantially accelerate the low&#8208;kinetic Na2S4 to Na2S directly conversion, manipulating the uniform deposition of electroactive Na2S and avoiding the formation of irreversible products (e.g., Na2S2). The intrinsic synergy of two catalytic centers benefits the Na2S decomposition and minimizes its activation barrier during battery recharging and then efficiently mitigate the cathodic passivation. As a result, the stable cycling of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S cell delivers an attractive reversible capacity of 1060&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high CE of 98.5&#8201;% and a high energy of 1008&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgcathode&#8722;1, comparable to the liquid electrolyte cells.

         <title>Counterion Effect in Cobaltate&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The counterion makes a difference in alkene hydrogenations promoted by low&#8208;valence cobaltate salts. The best performing catalyst cleanly hydrogenated various alkenes (including tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted) under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies point toward a homotopic catalyst and show how counterion coordination to hydride intermediates modulates the barrier for the turnover&#8208;limiting migratory insertion.







Abstract
We show that countercations exert a remarkable influence on the ability of anionic cobaltate salts to catalyze challenging alkene hydrogenations. An evaluation of the catalytic properties of [Cat][Co(&#951;4&#8208;cod)2] (Cat=K (1), Na (2), Li (3), (Depnacnac)Mg (4), and N(nBu)4 (5); cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, Depnacnac={2,6&#8208;Et2C6H3NC(CH3)}2CH)]) demonstrated that the lithium salt 3 and magnesium salt 4 drastically outperform the other catalysts. Complex 4 was the most active catalyst, which readily promotes the hydrogenation of highly congested alkenes under mild conditions. A plausible catalytic mechanism is proposed based on density functional theory (DFT) investigations. Furthermore, combined molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and DFT studies were used to examine the turnover&#8208;limiting migratory insertion step. The results of these studies suggest an active co&#8208;catalytic role of the counterion in the hydrogenation reaction through the coordination to cobalt hydride intermediates.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Nanozyme&#8208;Integrated Nanomotors (POMotors) for Self&#8208;Propulsion&#8208;Promoted Synergistic Photothermal&#8208;Catalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalate nanozyme&#8208;integrated polydopamine&#8208;conjugated nanomotors (POMotors) were constructed. They show peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity and NIR&#8208;triggered photothermal properties, therefore exhibiting enzyme&#8208;powered enhanced Brownian motion and NIR&#8208;triggered self&#8208;propulsion. Based on these properties of POMotors, a highly efficient self&#8208;propulsion&#8208;enhanced photothermal&#8208;catalytic synergistic tumor therapy was achieved.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;powered nanomotors have demonstrated promising potential in biomedical applications, especially for catalytic tumor therapy, owing to their ability of self&#8208;propulsion and bio&#8208;catalysis. However, the fragility of natural enzymes limits their environmental adaptability and also therapeutic efficacy in catalysis&#8208;enabled tumor therapy. Herein, polyoxometalate&#8208;nanozyme&#8208;based light&#8208;driven nanomotors were designed and synthesized for targeted synergistic photothermal&#8208;catalytic tumor therapy. In this construct, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the P2W18Fe4 polyoxometalates&#8208;based nanomotors can provide self&#8208;propulsion and facilitate their production of reactive oxygen species thus killing tumor cells, even in the weakly acidic tumor microenvironment. Conjugated polydopamine endows the nanomotors with the capability of light&#8208;driven self&#8208;propulsion behavior. After 10&#8197;min of NIR (808&#8197;nm) irradiation, along with the help of epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, the targeted accumulation and penetration of nanomotors in the tumor enabled highly efficient synergistic photothermal&#8208;catalytic therapy. This approach overcomes the disadvantages of the intrinsically fragile nature of enzyme&#8208;powered nanomotors in physiological environments and, more importantly, provides a motility&#8208;behavior promoted synergistic anti&#8208;tumor strategy.

         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;monitored chemodynamic therapy agent (Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs) is prepared by integrating ferrocene (Fc) into &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;functionalized gold nanoclusters via host&#8211;guest interaction. In addition to producing &#8901;OH, Fenton reaction between redox&#8208;active Fc quencher and H2O2 causes Fc oxidation and consequent NIR&#8208;II fluorescence recovery, allowing renal&#8208;clearable Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs to self&#8208;monitor &#8901;OH formation without undesired &#8901;OH consumption.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) generation is crucial for both the efficacy and safety of chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Although &#8901;OH probe&#8208;integrated CDT agents can track &#8901;OH production by themselves, they often require complicated synthetic procedures and suffer from self&#8208;consumption of &#8901;OH. Here, we report the facile fabrication of a self&#8208;monitored chemodynamic agent (denoted as Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs) by incorporating ferrocene (Fc) into &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;functionalized gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) via host&#8211;guest molecular recognition. The water&#8208;soluble CD served not only as a capping agent to protect AuNCs but also as a macrocyclic host to encapsulate and solubilize hydrophobic Fc guest with high Fenton reactivity for in vivo CDT applications. Importantly, the encapsulated Fc inside CD possessed strong electron&#8208;donating ability to effectively quench the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence of AuNCs through photoinduced electron transfer. After internalization of Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs by cancer cells, Fenton reaction between redox&#8208;active Fc quencher and endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) caused Fc oxidation and subsequent NIR&#8208;II fluorescence recovery, which was accompanied by the formation of cytotoxic &#8901;OH and therefore allowed Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs to in situ self&#8208;report &#8901;OH generation without undesired &#8901;OH consumption. Such a NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;monitored CDT enabled the use of renal&#8208;clearable Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs for efficient tumor growth inhibition with minimal side effects in vivo.

         <title>Selective Synthesis and Functionalization of an Acyclic Methylene&#8208;Bridged&#8208;Arene Trimer in a Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise control of repeating reactions to form oligomeric compounds is challenging because such reactions are controlled only statistically. Here, we show that a coordination cage serves as a nano&#8208;reaction vessel in the iteroselective condensation of a simple aromatic compound and formaldehyde to form a methylene&#8208;bridged arene trimer. The confinement effect for the kinetic protection is also demonstrated by the subsequent iodination of the trimer within the cage.







Abstract
Arene&#8208;formaldehyde condensation is a versatile reaction for producing various oligomeric/polymeric materials. However, the precise control of oligomerization degree is still challenging because the starting materials and intermediates have similar reactivities. Here, we demonstrate the selective synthesis of a methylene&#8208;bridged arene trimer using the confined cavity of a coordination cage. The limited space of the cavity prevents unregulated polymerization. The confinement effect for the kinetic protection is also demonstrated by the subsequent site&#8208;selective iodination of the trimer product within the cage.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Assembly of Luminescent Chiral Gold(I)&#8208;Sulfido Clusters via Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nature, chiral selectivity mainly occurs between different species, such as the production of proteins, enzyme catalysis, or therapeutics using chiral drugs. Thus, great demands are needed to explore the full potential of chiral self&#8208;sorting. In their Research Article (e202316200), Vivian Wing&#8208;Wah Yam et&#8197;al. report different combinations of axial chiral ligands giving rise to distinct chiral gold(I) sulfido clusters through different types of chiral self&#8208;assembly and self&#8208;sorting processes, evolving from homochiral assembly to heterochiral self&#8208;sorting and the unprecedented heterochiral and heteroleptic self&#8208;sorting.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Azomethine Imines and Neuroprotective Activity Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral azomethine imines were efficiently constructed through Cu&#8208; or chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closures of N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylbenzylidene)hydrazides. Biological studies revealed that the (S)&#8208;atropisomer product effectively protects dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by inhibiting oxaliplatin&#8208;induced apoptosis, while the (R)&#8208;atropisomer lacks protective effects, as described by Bo Han, Gu Zhan, Bo Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202312663).

         <title>In&#8208;situ Implanting 3D Carbon Network Reinforced Zinc Composite by Powder Metallurgy for Highly Reversible Zn&#8208;based Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;based batteries have emerged as compelling candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, owing to their intrinsic safety, remarkable theoretical energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Nonetheless, the dendrite formation, side reactions, and corrosion on anode have overshadowed their practical applications. Herein, we present an in situ grown carbon network reinforcing Zn matrix anode prepared by powder metallurgy. This 3D carbon network provides an uninterrupted internal electron transport pathway and optimize the surface electric field distribution, thereby enabling highly reversible Zn deposition. Consequently, symmetrical cells demonstrate impressive stability, running for over 880 h with a low voltage hysteresis (~32 mV). Furthermore, this Zn matrix composite anode exhibits enhanced performance in both the aqueous Zn&#8208;ion and the Zn&#8208;air batteries. Notably, Zn//MnO2 cells display superior rate capabilities, while Zn&#8208;air batteries deliver high power density and impressive Zn utilization (84.9%). This work provides a new idea of powder metallurgy method for modified Zn anodes, showcasing potential for large&#8208;scale production.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally Healable Electrolyte&#8208;Electrode Interface for Sustainable Quasi&#8208;Solid Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;solid zinc&#8208;ion batteries using hydrogel electrolytes show great potential in energy storage devices owing to their intrinsic safety, fewer side reactions and wide electrochemical windows. However, the dendrite issues on the zinc anodes cannot be fundamentally eliminated and the intrinsic anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial interspace is rarely investigated. Here, we design a dynamically healable gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel electrolyte with a highly reversible sol&#8208;gel transition, which can construct a conformal electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface and further evolve into a stable solid&#8208;solid interface by in&#8208;situ solidification. The unique helical gelatin chain structure provides a uniform channel for zinc ion transport by the bridging effect of sulfate groups. As a consequence, the dynamically healable interface enables dendrite&#8208;free zinc anodes and repeatedly repairs the anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial interspaces by the reversible sol&#8208;gel transition of gelatin electrolyte to retain long&#8208;lasting protection for sustainable zinc&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of Achiral Molecules Leading to the Formation of Homochiral Superstructures that Exhibit Mechanoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality, with its intrinsic symmetry&#8208;breaking feature, is frequently utilized in the creation of acentric crystalline functional materials that exhibit intriguing optoelectronic properties. On the other hand, the development of chiral crystals from achiral molecules offers a solution that bypasses the need for enantiopure motifs, presenting a promising alternative and thereby expanding the possibilities of the self&#8208;assembly toolkit. Nevertheless, the rational design of achiral molecules that prefer spontaneous symmetry breaking during crystallization has so far been obscure. In this study, we present a series of six achiral molecules, demonstrating that when these conformationally flexible molecules adopt a cis&#8208;conformation and engage in multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions along a helical path, they collectively self&#8208;assemble into chiral superstructures consisting of single&#8208;handed supramolecular columns. When these homochiral supramolecular columns align in parallel, they form polar crystals that exhibit intense luminescence upon grinding or scraping. We therefore demonstrate our molecular design strategy could significantly increase the likelihood of symmetry breaking in achiral molecular synthons during self&#8208;assembly, offering a facile access to novel chiral crystalline materials with unique optoelectronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Step&#8208;growth Polymerization of Aziridines with Elemental Sulfur: Easy Access to Linear Polysulfides and Their Use as Recyclable Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bulk radical polymerization of bis(aziridine) with molten elemental sulfur resulted in brittle, cross&#8208;linked polymers. However, when the bis(aziridine) was treated with elemental sulfur in the presence of an organobase, the ring&#8208;opening reaction of aziridine with oligosulfide anions occurred, leading to the formation of linear polymers by step&#8208;growth polymerization. These newly synthesized polymers possess repeating units containing a sulfonamide or amide functional moiety and oligosulfide bonds with an average sulfur segment of about two. A small molecular model reaction confirmed the nucleophilic addition reaction of elemental sulfur to aziridine. It was verified that S&#8211;S dynamic bond exchange takes place in the presence of an organic base within the linear chains. The mixture of the synthesized polysulfides with pyridine exhibits exceptional adhesive properties when applied to steel, and aluminum substrates. Notably, these prepared adhesives displayed good reusability due to the dynamic S&#8208;S exchange and complete recyclability due to their solution processability. This elemental sulfur&#8208;involved polymerization approach represents an innovative method for the synthesis of advanced sulfur&#8208;containing polymers, demonstrating the potential for various applications in adhesives and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Perovskite Crystallization through Interfacial Engineering Using a Zwitterionic Additive Potassium Sulfamate for Efficient Pure&#8208;Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites are emerging as efficient emitters in blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), while the imbalanced crystallization of the halide&#8208;mixed system limits further improvements in device performance. The rapid crystallization caused by Cl doping produces massive defects at the interface, leading to aggravated non&#8208;radiative recombination. Meanwhile, unmanageable perovskite crystallization is prone to facilitate the formation of nonuniform low&#8208;dimensional phases, which results in energy loss during the exciton transfer process. Here, we propose a multifunctional interface engineering for nucleation and phase regulation by incorporating the zwitterionic additive potassium sulfamate into the hole transport layer. By using potassium ions (K+) as heterogeneous nucleation seeds, finely controlled growth of interfacial K+&#8208;guided grains is achieved. The sulfamate ions can simultaneously regulate the phase distribution and passivate defects through coordination interactions with undercoordinated lead atoms. Consequently, such synergistic effect constructs quasi&#8208;2D blue perovskite films with smooth energy landscape and reduced trap states, leading to pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 17.32%, spectrally stable emission at 478 nm and the prolonged operational lifetime. This work provides a unique guide to comprehensively regulate the halide&#8208;mixed blue perovskite crystallization by manipulating the characteristics of grain&#8208;growth substrate.</dc:description>

         <title>Perovskite Single Crystals with Self&#8208;Cleaning Surface for Efficient Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskite single crystals are promising for diverse optoelectronic applications. As a universal issue of solution&#8208;grown perovskite single crystals, surface contamination causes adverse effect on material properties and device performance. Herein, learning from the self&#8208;cleaning effect of lotus leaf, we address the surface contamination issue by introducing an amphiphilic long&#8208;chain organic amine into the perovskite crystal growth solution. Self&#8208;assembly of CTAC provides a hydrophobic crystal surface, inducing spontaneous removal of residual growth solution, which results in clean surface and better optoelectronic properties of perovskite single crystals. An impressive efficiency of 23.4% is obtained, setting a new record for FAxMA1&#8208;xPbI3&#160;single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells (PSCs).&#160;Moreover, our strategy also applies to perovskite single crystals with different morphology and composition, which may contribute to improvement of other single&#8208;crystal perovskite optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Binary All&#8208;polymer Solar Cells with a Perhalogenated&#8208;Thiophene&#8208;Based Solid Additive Surpass 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Morphological control of all&#8208;polymer blends is quintessential yet challenging in fabricating high&#8208;performance organic solar cells. Recently, solid additives (SAs) have been approved to be capable in tuning the morphology of polymer: small&#8208;molecule blends improving the performance and stability of devices. Herein, three perhalogenated thiophenes, which are 3,4&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,5&#8208;diiodothiophene (SA&#8208;T1), 2,5&#8208;dibromo&#8208;3,4&#8208;diiodothiophene (SA&#8208;T2), and 2,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;4,5&#8208;diiodothiophene (SA&#8208;T3), were adopted as SAs to optimize the performance of all&#8208;polymer organic solar cells (APSCs). For the blend of PM6 and PY&#8208;IT, benefitting from the intermolecular interactions between perhalogenated thiophenes and polymers, the molecular packing&#160;properties could be finely regulated after introducing these SAs. In&#8208;situ UV&#8208;Vis measurement revealed that these SAs could assist morphological character evolution in the all&#8208;polymer blend, leading to their optimal morphologies. Compared to the as&#8208;cast device of PM6:PY&#8208;IT, all SA&#8208;treated binary devices displayed enhanced power conversion efficiencies of 17.4 &#8211; 18.3% with obviously elevated short&#8208;circuit current densities and fill factors. To our knowledge, the PCE of 18.3% for SA&#8208;T1&#8208;treated binary ranks the highest among all binary APSCs to date. Meanwhile, the universality of SA&#8208;T1 in other all&#8208;polymer blends is demonstrated with unanimously improved device performance. This work provide a new pathway in realizing high&#8208;performance APSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dicarboxylic Acid&#8208;Assisted Surface Oxide Removal and Passivation of Indium Antimonide Colloidal Quantum Dots for Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free III&#8208;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for solution&#8208;processed short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors. Recent progress in the synthesis of indium antimonide (InSb) CQDs with sizes smaller than the Bohr exciton radius enables quantum&#8208;size effect tuning of the bandgap. However, it has been challenging to achieve uniform InSb CQDs with bandgaps below 0.9 eV, as well as to control the surface chemistry of these large&#8208;diameter CQDs. This has, to date, limited the development of InSb CQD photodetectors that are sensitive to &gt;=1400 nm light. Here we adopt solvent engineering to facilitate a diffusion&#8208;limited growth regime, leading to uniform CQDs with a bandgap of 0.89 eV. We then develop a CQD surface reconstruction strategy that employs a dicarboxylic acid to selectively remove the native In/Sb oxides, and enables a carboxylate&#8208;halide co&#8208;passivation with the subsequent halide ligand exchange. We find that this strategy reduces trap density by half compared to controls, and enables electronic coupling among CQDs. Photodetectors made using the tailored CQDs achieve an external quantum efficiency of 25% at 1400 nm, the highest among III&#8208;V CQD photodetectors in this spectral region.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight shaped macrocycles are promising scaffolds for amplifying the chiroptical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. By harnessing the inherent and adaptable conformational dynamics of a chiral C2&#8208;symmetric bispyrrolidinoindoline (BPI) manifold, we developed an enantio&#8208;divergent modular synthetic platform to rapidly generate a diverse range of chiral macrocycles, spanning from 14&#8208; to 66&#8208;membered rings, eliminating the need for optical resolution. Notably, a 32&#8208;membered figure&#8208;eight macrocycle showed excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL: |glum| = 1.1&#215;10&#8722;2) complemented by a robust emission quantum yield (&#934;fl = 0.74), to achieve outstanding CPL brightness (BCPL: &#949;&#215;&#934;fl&#215;|glum|/2 = 480). Using quadruple Sonogashira couplings, this versatile synthetic platform enables precise adjustments of the angle, distance, and length among intersecting &#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores. Our synthetic strategy offers a streamlined and systematic approach to significantly enhance BCPL values for a variety of chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight macrocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Self&#8208;Assembly of Metalloporphyrins and Polyelectrolytes into Hierarchical Supramolecular Nanostructures for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Production in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Polypeptides, as natural polyelectrolytes, are assembled into tailored proteins to integrate chromophores and catalytic sites for photosynthesis. Mimicking nature to create the water&#8208;soluble nanoassemblies from synthetic polyelectrolytes and photocatalytic molecular species for artificial photosynthesis is still rare. Here, we report the enhancement of the full&#8208;spectrum solar light&#8208;driven H2 production within a supramolecular system built by the co&#8208;assembly of anionic metalloporphyrins with cationic polyelectrolytes in water. This supramolecular photocatalytic system achieves a H2 production rate of 793 and 685 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 over 24 h with a combination of Mg or Zn porphyrin as photosensitizers and Cu porphyrin as catalyst, which is more than 23 times higher than that of free molecular controls. With a photosensitizer to catalyst ratio of 10000:1, the highest H2 production rate of &gt; 51,700 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 with a turnover number (TON) of &gt; 1,290 per molecular catalyst was achieved over 24 h irradiation. The hierarchical self&#8208;assembly not only enhances photostability via forming ordered stackings of the metalloporphyrins but also facilitates both energy and electron transfer from antenna molecules to catalysts, and therefore promote the photocatalysis. This research provides structural and mechanistic insights of self&#8208;assembly enhanced photostability and catalytic performance of supramolecular photocatalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Active Diluent&#8208;Anion Synergy Strategy Regulating Nonflammable Electrolytes for High&#8208;Efficiency Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;energy Li metal batteries (LMBs) consisting of Li metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes are promising candidates of the next generation energy&#8208;storage systems owing to their ultrahigh energy density. However, it is still challenging to develop high&#8208;voltage nonflammable electrolytes with superior anode and cathode compatibility for LMBs. Here, we propose an active diluent&#8208;anion synergy strategy to achieve outstanding compatibility with Li metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes by using 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (DFB) with high activity for yielding LiF as an active diluent to regulate nonflammable dimethylacetamide (DMAC)&#8208;based localized high concentration electrolytes (LHCE&#8208;DFB). DFB and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI&#8722;) anion cooperate to construct robust LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), which effectively stabilize DMAC from intrinsic reactions with Li metal anode and enhance the interfacial stability of the Li metal anodes and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes. LHCE&#8208;DFB enables ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency (98.7%), dendrite&#8208;free, extremely stable and long&#8208;term cycling of Li metal anodes in Li||Cu cells and Li||Li cells. The fabricated NCM811||Li cells with LHCE&#8208;DFB display remarkably enhanced long&#8208;term cycling stability and excellent rate capability. This work provides a promising active diluent&#8208;anion synergy strategy for designing high&#8208;voltage electrolytes for high&#8208;energy batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Mixed&#8208;anion&#8208;group Fe&#8208;based phosphate materials, such as&#160;Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7, have emerged as promising cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the synthesis of pure&#8208;phase material has remained a challenge, and the phase evolution during sodium (de)intercalation is debating as well. Herein, a solid&#8208;solution strategy is proposed to&#160;partition Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7&#160;into 2NaFePO4&#183;Na2FeP2O7&#160;from the angle of molecular composition.&#160;Via regulating the starting ratio of&#160;NaFePO4&#160;and Na2FeP2O7&#160;during the synthesis process,&#160;the nonstoichiometric pure&#8208;phase material could be successfully synthesized within a narrow&#160;NaFePO4&#160;content between 1.6 and 1.2. Furthermore, the proposed synthesis strategy demonstrates strong applicability that helps to address the impurity issue of Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7&#160;and nonstoichiometric Na3.4Co2.4(PO4)1.4P2O7&#160;are evidenced to be the pure phase. The&#160;model&#160;Na3.4Fe2.4(PO4)1.4P2O7&#160;cathode&#160;(the content of NaFePO4&#160;equals 1.4)&#160;demonstrates exceptional sodium storage performances, including ultrahigh rate capability under 100 C and ultralong cycle life over 14000 cycles. Furthermore, combined measurements of&#160;ex&#8208;situ&#160;nuclear magnetic resonance,&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;synchrotron diffraction and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy clearly reveal a two&#8208;phase transition during Na+&#160;extraction/insertion, which provides a new insight into the ionic storage process for such kind of mixed&#8208;anion&#8208;group Fe&#8208;based phosphate materials and pave the way for the development of high&#8208;power sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Negative Lattice Expansion in an O3&#8208;Type Transition&#8208;Metal Oxide Cathode for Highly Stable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sodium extraction/insertion in layered transition&#8208;metal oxide (TMO) cathode materials are typically accompanied by slab sliding and lattice changes, leading to microstructure destruction and capacity decay. Herein, negative lattice expansion is observed in an O3 type Ni&#8208;based layered cathode of Na0.9Ni0.32Zn0.08Fe0.1Mn0.3Ti0.2O2 upon Na+ extraction. It is attributed to the weak Zn2+&#8208;O2&#8208; orbital hybridization and increased electron density of the surrounding oxygen for reinforced interlayer O&#8208;O repulsive force. This enables gliding of TMO slabs for the intergrowth phase transition of P3&#8594;OP2 to alleviate lattice strain with moderate lattice shrinkage, which exhibits general interslab spacings and volume changes as low as 2.4% and 1.9%, respectively. The strong Ti&#8208;O bonds accommodate the internal distortion of TMO6 octahedra due to the flexibility of TiO6 octahedra during cycling. These endow a high specific capacity of 144.9 mAh g&#8208;1 and excellent cycling performance of pouch&#8208;type sodium&#8208;ion batteries with 93% capacity retention after 3600 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots Promoted Depolymerization of Oxidized Lignin via Photocatalytic Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation/Reduction Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the demanding depolymerization conditions and limited catalytic efficiency, enhancing lignin valorization remains challenging. Therefore, lowering the bond dissociation energy (BDE) has emerged as a viable strategy for achieving mild yet highly effective cleavage of bonds. In this study, a photocatalytic semi&#8208;hydrogenation/reduction strategy utilizing CsPbBr3 quantum dots (CPB&#8208;QDs) and Hantzsch ester (HEH2) as a synergistic catalytic system was introduced to reduce the BDE of C&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;Ar, achieving effective cleavage of the C&#946;&#8208;O&#8208;Ar bond. This strategy offers a wide substrate scope encompassing various &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model lignin dimers, preoxidized &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 polymers, and native oxidized lignin, resulting in the production of corresponding ketones and phenols. Notably, this approach attained a turnover frequency (TOF) that is 17 times higher than that of the reported Ir&#8208;catalytic system in the photocatalytic depolymerization of the lignin model dimers. It has been observed via meticulous experimentation that HEH2 can be activated by CPB&#8208;QDs via single electron transfer (SET), generating HEH2&#8226;+ as a hydrogen donor while also serving as a hole quencher. Moreover, HEH2&#8226;+ readily forms an active transition state with the substrates via hydrogen bonding.

Therefore, lowering the bond dissociation energy (BDE) has emerged as a viable strategy for achieving mild yet highly effective cleavage of bonds.

         <title>Ammonolysis of Glyoxal at the Air&#8208;Water Nanodroplet Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ammonolysis of glyoxal with dimethylamine occurs at the air&#8208;water nanodroplet interface with the stepwise pathways facilitated by the water dimers, which is highly feasible and plays a pivotal role in removing glyoxal.







Abstract
The reactions of glyoxal (CHO)2) with amines in cloud processes contribute to the formation of brown carbon and oligomer particles in the atmosphere. However, their molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Herein, we investigate the ammonolysis mechanisms of glyoxal with amines at the air&#8208;water nanodroplet interface. We identified three and two distinct pathways for the ammonolysis of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine by using metadynamics simulations at the air&#8208;water nanodroplet interface, respectively. Notably, the stepwise pathways mediated by the water dimer for the reactions of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine display the lowest free energy barriers of 3.6 and 4.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. These results showed that the air&#8208;water nanodroplet ammonolysis reactions of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine were more feasible and occurred at faster rates than the corresponding gas phase ammonolysis, the OH+(CHO)2 reaction, and the aqueous phase reaction of glyoxal, leading to the dominant removal of glyoxal. Our results provide new and important insight into the reactions between carbonyl compounds and amines, which are crucial in forming nitrogen&#8208;containing aerosol particles.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Mediated [3+1] Fragmentation of White Phosphorus: Access to Acylcyanophosphanides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
White phosphorus (P4) can be selectively activated and functionalized via low&#8208;valent cobalt complexes. Subsequent treatment of the acylated P4 ligands with cyanide induces a rare [3+1] fragmentation and yields cyanophosphanides (P1) and triphosphido cobaltate (P3). Additional experiments with neutral cyanide or isocyanide provide insight into a plausible fragmentation mechanism and allow the isolation of potential intermediates.







Abstract
Despite the accessibility of numerous transition metal polyphosphido complexes through transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated activation of white phosphorus, the targeted functionalization of Pn ligands to obtain functional monophosphorus species remains challenging. In this study, we introduce a new [3+1] fragmentation procedure for cyclo&#8208;P4 ligands, leading to the discovery of acylcyanophosphanides and &#8208;phosphines. Treatment of the complex [K(18c&#8208;6)][(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;4&#8208;P4)] ([K(18c&#8208;6)]3, 18c&#8208;6=[18]crown&#8208;6, Ar*=2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;isopropylphenyl, BIAN=1,2&#8208;bis(arylimino)acenaphthene diimine) with acyl chlorides results in the formation of acylated tetraphosphido complexes [(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;4&#8208;P4C(O)R)] (R=tBu, Cy, 1&#8208;Ad, Ph; 4&#8201;a&#8211;d). Subsequent reactions of 4&#8201;a&#8211;d with cyanide salts yield acylated cyanophosphanides [RC(O)PCN]&#8722; (9&#8201;a&#8211;d&#8722;) and the cyclo&#8208;P3 cobaltate anion [(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;3&#8208;P3)(CN)]&#8722; (8&#8722;). Further reactions of 4&#8201;a&#8211;d with trimethylsilyl cyanide (Me3SiCN) and isocyanides provide insight into a plausible mechanism of this [3+1] fragmentation reaction, as these reagents partially displace the P4C(O)R ligand from the cobalt center. Several potential intermediates of the [3+1] fragmentation were characterized. Additionally, the introduction of a second acyl substituent was achieved by treating [K(18c&#8208;6)]9b with CyC(O)Cl, resulting in the first bis(acyl)monocyanophosphine (CyC(O))2PCN (10).

         <title>Precise Methylation Yields Acceptor with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network for High&#8208;Efficiency and Thermally Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed four small&#8208;molecule acceptors (Qo1, Qo2, Qo3 and Qo4) by incorporating a methylation strategy. Solar cells fabricated with polymer donor PM6 and Qo2 realized the highest power conversion efficiency of 18.4&#8201;%, surpassing the efficiencies of devices based on Qo1 (15.8&#8201;%), Qo3 (16.7&#8201;%), and Qo4 (2.4&#8201;%).







Abstract
Utilizing intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions stands for an effective approach in advancing the efficiency and stability of small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) for polymer solar cells. Herein, we synthesized three SMAs (Qo1, Qo2, and Qo3) using indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoxalin&#8208;11&#8208;one (Qox) as the electron&#8208;deficient group, with the incorporation of a methylation strategy. Through crystallographic analysis, it is observed that two Qox&#8208;based methylated acceptors (Qo2 and Qo3) exhibit multiple hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted 3D network transport structures, in contrast to the 2D transport structure observed in gem&#8208;dichlorinated counterpart (Qo4). Notably, Qo2 exhibits multiple and stronger hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions compared with Qo3. Consequently, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Qo2 device realizes the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.4&#8201;%, surpassing the efficiencies of devices based on Qo1 (15.8&#8201;%), Qo3 (16.7&#8201;%), and Qo4 (2.4&#8201;%). This remarkable PCE in PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Qo2 device can be primarily ascribed to the enhanced donor&#8208;acceptor miscibility, more favorable medium structure, and more efficient charge transfer and collection behavior. Moreover, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Qo2 device demonstrates exceptional thermal stability, retaining 82.8&#8201;% of its initial PCE after undergoing annealing at 65&#8201;&#176;C for 250&#8197;hours. Our research showcases that precise methylation, particularly targeting the formation of intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions to tune crystal packing patterns, represents a promising strategy in the molecular design of efficient and stable SMAs.

         <title>Confined Lewis Pairs: Investigation of the X&#8722;&#8594;Si20 Interaction in Halogen&#8208;Encapsulating Silafulleranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A joint theoretical and experimental study on 32 endohedral silafulleranes is presented. Template effects of Cl&#8722; are investigated for the [X@Si20Y20]&#8722; complexes that are classified as &#8220;confined Lewis pairs&#8221;. The origins of the diagnostic 35Cl NMR chemical shifts are elucidated computationally. Finally, we disclose the synthesis of [PPN][Cl@Si20Y20] (Y=Me, Et, Br) including their thorough characterization.







Abstract
A joint theoretical and experimental study on 32 endohedral silafullerane derivatives [X@Si20Y20]&#8722; (X=F&#8208;I Y=F&#8208;I, H, Me, Et) and 
&#8208;[Cl@Si20H12Y8]&#8722; (Y=F&#8208;I) is presented. First, we evaluated the structure&#8208;determining template effect of Cl&#8722; in a systematic series of concave silapolyquinane model systems. Second, we investigated the X&#8722;&#8594;Si20 interaction energy (
) as a function of X&#8722; and Y and found the largest

         <title>Asymmetric Solvents Regulated Crystallization&#8208;Limited Electrolytes for All&#8208;Climate Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel asymmetric solvents regulated crystallization limitation strategy is developed to lower electrolyte operation temperature windows for lithium metal batteries. Mixing asymmetric ethylene sulfite (ES) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) can reduce the molecular interaction and orientation arrangement dynamics, allowing the resulting electrolyte to show fast ion transport even at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Electrolytes that can keep liquid state are one of the most important physical metrics to ensure the ions transfer with stable operation of rechargeable lithium&#8208;based batteries at a wide temperature window. It is generally accepted that strong polar solvents with high melting points favor the safe operation of batteries above room temperatures but are susceptible to crystallization at low temperatures (&#8804;&#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). Here, a crystallization limitation strategy was proposed to handle this issue. We demonstrate that, although the high melting points of ethylene sulfite (ES, &#8722;17&#8201;&#176;C) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC, &#8776;23&#8201;&#176;C), their mixtures can avoid crystallization at low temperatures, which can be attributed to low intermolecular interactions and altered molecular motion dynamics. A suitable ES/FEC ratio (10&#8201;% FEC) can balance the bulk and interface transport of ions, enabling LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2||lithium (NCM811||Li) full cells to deliver excellent temperature resilience and cycling stability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C to +70&#8201;&#176;C. More than 66&#8201;% of the capacity retention was achieved at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C compared to room temperature. The NCM811||Li pouch cells exhibit high cycling stability under realistic conditions (electrolyte weight to cathode capacity ratio (E/C)&#8804;3.5&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, negative to positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P)&#8804;1.09) at different temperatures.

         <title>Dynamic Exchange in 3D Cell Culture Hydrogels Based on Crosslinking of Cyclic Thiosulfinates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic thiosulfinates can generate disulfide&#8208;crosslinked dynamic covalent hydrogels without additional stimuli to gain control over stress relaxation based on thiol content and mode of crosslinker application. Pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes can be 3D cultured in hydrogels containing macromonomers with this chemistry, displaying native behaviours, such as cell spreading and spontaneous beating.







Abstract
Dynamic polymer materials are highly valued substrates for 3D cell culture due to their viscoelasticity, a time&#8208;dependent mechanical property that can be tuned to resemble the energy dissipation of native tissues. Herein, we report the coupling of a cyclic thiosulfinate, mono&#8208;S&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;methyl asparagusic acid, to a 4&#8208;arm PEG&#8208;OH to prepare a disulfide&#8208;based dynamic covalent hydrogel with the addition of 4&#8208;arm PEG&#8208;thiol. Ring opening of the cyclic thiosulfinate by nucleophilic substitution results in the rapid formation of a network showing a viscoelastic fluid&#8208;like behaviour and relaxation rates modulated by thiol content through thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange, whereas its viscoelastic behaviour upon application as a small molecule linear crosslinker is solid&#8208;like. Further introduction of 4&#8208;arm PEG&#8208;vinylsulfone in the network yields a hydrogel with weeks&#8208;long cell culture stability, permitting 3D culture of cell types that lack robust proliferation, such as human pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC&#8208;CMs). These cells display native behaviours such as cell elongation and spontaneous beating as a function of the hydrogel's mechanical properties. We demonstrate that the mode of dynamic cyclic thiosulfinate crosslinker presentation within the network can result in different stress relaxation profiles, opening the door to model tissues with disparate mechanics in 3D cell culture.

         <title>Hydrated [3+2] Cyclotelomerization of Butafulvenes to Create Multiple Contiguous Fully Substituted Carbon Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrated [3+2] cyclotelomerization of butafulvenes has been developed to create spiro fused tricyclic rings with a contiguous fully substituted carbon motif.







Abstract
The construction of multiple continuous fully substituted carbon centers, which serve as unique structural motif in natural products, is a challenging topic in organic synthesis. Herein, we report a hydrated [3+2] cyclotelomerization of butafulvenes to create contiguous fully substituted carbon backbone. In the presence of scandium triflate, all&#8208;carbon skeleton with spiro fused tricyclic ring can be constructed in high diastereoselectivity by utilizing butafulvene as the synthon. Mechanistic studies suggest that this atom&#8208;economic reaction probably proceeds through a synergistic process containing butafulvenes dimerization and nucleophilic attack by water. In addition, the tricyclic product can undergo a series of synthetic derivatizations, which highlights the potential applications of this strategy. The recyclability of Sc(OTf)3 has also been demonstrated to show its robust performance in this hydrated cyclotelomerization.

         <title>Selenium&#8208;Based Catalytic Scavengers for Concurrent Scavenging of H2S and Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2S overproduction is linked to various disease states while chemical tools that can precisely downregulate H2S are still lacking. In this work, selenoxide&#8208;containing compounds were found to be potent H2S scavengers with promising antidotal effects for H2S poisoning. Several diselenides were further developed as catalytic scavengers for both H2S and H2O2.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter that plays important roles in redox signaling. H2S overproduction has been linked to a variety of disease states and therefore, H2S&#8208;depleting agents, such as scavengers, are needed to understand the significance of H2S&#8208;based therapy. It is known that elevated H2S can induce oxidative stress with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, such as in H2S acute intoxication. We explored the possibility of developing catalytic scavengers to simultaneously remove H2S and ROS. Herein, we studied a series of selenium&#8208;based molecules as catalytic H2S/H2O2 scavengers. Inspired by the high reactivity of selenoxide compounds towards H2S, 14 diselenide/monoselenide compounds were tested. Several promising candidates such as S6 were identified. Their activities in buffers, as well as in plasma&#8208; and cell lysate&#8208;containing solutions were evaluated. We also studied the reaction mechanism of this scavenging process. Finally, the combination of the diselenide catalyst and photosensitizers was used to achieve light&#8208;induced H2S removal. These Se&#8208;based scavengers can be useful tools for understanding H2S/ROS regulations.

Herein, we studied a series of selenium-based molecules as catalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scavengers. Inspired by the high reactivity of selenoxide compounds towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, 14 diselenide/monoselenide compounds were tested. Several promising candidates such as &lt;b&gt;S6&lt;/b&gt; were identified. Their activities in buffers, as well as in plasma- and cell lysate-containing solutions were evaluated. We also studied the reaction mechanism of this scavenging process. Finally, the combination of the diselenide catalyst and photosensitizers was used to achieve light-induced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S removal. These Se-based scavengers can be useful tools for understanding H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/ROS regulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Using Redox&#8208;Switchable Polymerization Catalysis to Synthesize a Chemically Recyclable Thermoplastic Elastomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triblock copolymers containing poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) hard blocks and poly(tetrahydrofuran&#8208;co&#8208;cyclohexene oxide) soft blocks were synthesized using redox&#8208;switchable catalysis. The polymers demonstrated improved flexibility and mechanical properties similar to thermoplastic elastomers and underwent depolymerization under reactive distillation using Lewis acid catalysts, showing the material can be chemically recycled for a circular plastics economy.







Abstract
In an effort to synthesize chemically recyclable thermoplastic elastomers, a redox&#8208;switchable catalytic system was developed to synthesize triblock copolymers containing stiff poly(lactic acid) (PLA) end blocks and a flexible poly(tetrahydrofuran&#8208;co&#8208;cyclohexene oxide) (poly(THF&#8208;co&#8208;CHO) copolymer as the mid&#8208;block. The orthogonal reactivity induced by changing the oxidation state of the iron&#8208;based catalyst enabled the synthesis of the triblock copolymers in a single reaction flask from a mixture of monomers. The triblock copolymers demonstrated improved flexibility compared to poly(l&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA) and thermomechanical properties that resemble thermoplastic elastomers, including a rubbery plateau in the range of &#8722;60 to 40&#8201;&#176;C. The triblock copolymers containing a higher percentage of THF versus CHO were more flexible, and a blend of triblock copolymers containing PLLA and poly(d&#8208;lactic acid) (PDLA) end&#8208;blocks resulted in a stereocomplex that further increased polymer flexibility. Besides the low cost of lactide and THF, the sustainability of this new class of triblock copolymers was also supported by their depolymerization, which was achieved by exposing the copolymers sequentially to FeCl3 and ZnCl2/PEG under reactive distillation conditions.

         <title>Solvation Structure and Derived Interphase Tuning for High&#8208;Voltage Ni&#8208;Rich Lithium Metal Batteries with High Safety Using Difluorinated Ionic Liquid Based Dual&#8208;Salt Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stabilizing electrolytes&#160;for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is&#160;crucial yet challenging, as they need to ensure stability against both Li anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes (above 4.5V versus Li/Li+), addressing issues like poor cycling and thermal runaway. Herein, a novel gem&#8208;difluorinated skeleton of ionic liquid (IL)&#160;is designed and synthesized, and its non&#8208;flammable electrolytes successfully overcome aforementioned challenges. By creatively using dual salts, fluorinated ionic liquid and dimethyl carbonate as a co&#8208;solvent, the solvation structure of Li+&#160;ions is efficiently controlled through electrostatic and weak interactions&#160;that are well unveiled and illuminated via&#160;nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The as&#8208;prepared&#160;electrolytes exhibit high security&#160;avoiding thermal runaway&#160;and show excellent compatibility with high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Besides, the solvation structure derives a robust and stable F&#8208;rich interphase, resulting in high reversibility and Li&#8208;dendrite prevention. LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2/Li LMBs&#160;(4.5 V)&#160;demonstrate excellent long&#8208;term stability with a high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of at least 99.99% and a good capacity retention of 90.4% over 300 cycles, even&#160;can work&#160;at a higher voltage of 4.7 V. Furthermore,&#160;the ultrahigh Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.88Co0.09Mn0.03O2/Li system also delivers&#160;excellent electrochemical performance, highlighting the significance of fluorinated IL&#8208;based electrolyte design and enhanced&#160;interphasial chemistry in&#160;improving&#160;battery performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerating the Reaction Kinetics of CO2 Reduction to MultiCarbon Products by Synergistic Effect between Cation and Aprotic Solvent on Copper Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Improving the selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction to multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) is an important and highly challenging topic. In this work, we propose and validate an effective strategy to improve C2+ selectivity on Cu electrodes, by introducing synergistic effect between cation (Na+) and aprotic solvent (DMSO) to the electrolyte. Based on constant potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we first revealed that Na+ facilitates C&#8208;C coupling while inhibits CH3OH/CH4 products via reducing the water network connectivity near the electrode. Furthermore, the water network connectivity was further decreased by introducing an aprotic solvent DMSO, leading to suppression of both C1 production and hydrogen evolution reaction with minimal effect on *OCCO* hydrogenation. The synergistic effect enhancing C2 selectivity was also experimentally verified through electrochemical measurements. The results showed that the Faradaic efficiency of C2 increases from 9.3% to 57% at 50 mA/cm2 under a mixed electrolyte of NaHCO3 and DMSO compared to a pure NaHCO3, which can significantly enhance the selectivity of the C2 product. Therefore, our discovery provides an effective electrolyte&#8208;based strategy for tuning CO2RR selectivity through modulating the microenvironment at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronically Manipulated Molecular Strategy Enabling Highly Efficient Tin Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Buried interface modification can effectively improve the compatibility between interfaces. Given the distinct interface selections in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the applicability of a singular modification material remains limited. Consequently, in response to this challenge, we devised a tailored molecular strategy based on the electronic effects of specific functional groups. Therefore, we prepared three distinct silane coupling agents, and due to the varying inductive effects of these functional groups, the electronic distribution and molecular dipole moments of the coupling agents are correspondingly altered. Among them, trimethoxy (3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyl)&#8208;silane (F3&#8208;TMOS), which possesses electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, generates a molecular dipole moment directed toward the hole transport layer (HTL). This approach lowers the work function of the HTL, optimizes the energy level alignment, reduces the open&#8208;circuit voltage loss, and facilitates carrier transport. Furthermore, through the buffering effect of the coupling agent, the interface strain and lattice distortion caused by annealing the perovskite are reduced, enhancing the stability of the tin&#8208;based perovskite. Encouragingly, tin PSCs treated with F3&#8208;TMOS achieved a champion efficiency of 14.67%. This strategy provides an expedient avenue for the design of buried interface modification materials, enabling precise molecular adjustments in accordance with distinct interfacial contexts to ameliorate mismatched energetics and enhance carrier dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Modulated Ru&#8208;O Covalency in Ru&#8208;Sn Oxide Enabling Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation in Acidic Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RuO2 is one of the benchmark electrocatalysts used as the anode material in proton exchange membrane water electrolyser. However, its long&#8208;term stability is compromised due to the participation of lattice oxygen and metal dissolution during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, weakened covalency of Ru&#8208;O bond was tailored by introducing tensile strain to RuO6 octahedrons in a binary Ru&#8208;Sn oxide matrix, prohibiting the participation of lattice oxygen and the dissolution of Ru, thereby significantly improving the long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the tensile strain also optimized the adsorption energy of intermediates and boosted the OER activity. Remarkably, the RuSnOx electrocatalyst exhibited excellent OER activity in 0.1 M HClO4 and required merely 184 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, it delivered a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for at least 150 h with negligible potential increase. This work exemplifies an effective strategy for engineering Ru&#8208;based catalysts with extraordinary performance toward water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Pentazolate Anion: A Rare and Preferred Five&#8208;Membered Ligand for Constructing Pentasil&#8208;Zeolite Topology Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the fourth full&#8208;nitrogen structure, the pentazolate anion (cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722;) was highly coveted for decades. In 2017, the first air&#8208;stable non&#8208;metal pentazolate salt, (N5)6(H3O)3(NH4)4Cl, was obtained, representing a milestone in this field. As the latest member of the azole family, cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; is comprised of five nitrogen atoms. Although significant attention has been paid to the potential of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; as an energetic material, its poor thermostability hinders any practical application. However, the unique ring structure and multiple coordination capability of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; provide a platform for the fabrication of various structures, among which pentasil&#8208;zeolite topologies are the most intriguing. In addition, the introduction of structure&#8208;directing auxiliaries enables the self&#8208;assembly of diverse topological architectures, potentially imparting cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; with the potential to impact wide&#8208;ranging areas of coordination chemistry and topology. In this minireview, different pentasil&#8208;zeolite topologies based on metal&#8208;pentazolate frameworks are evaluated. To date, three zeolitic and zeolite&#8208;like topologies have been reported, namely the melanophlogite (MEP), chibaite (MTN), and unj topologies. The MEP topology consists of two nanocages, Na20N60 and Na24N60, whereas the MTN topology contains Na20N60 and Na28N80 nanocages. Furthermore, the unj topology features multiple homochiral channels consisting of two helical chains. Various possible strategies for obtaining additional pentasil&#8208;zeolite topologies are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly and Utility of a Drawstring&#8208;Mimetic Supramolecular Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the drawstring structure in daily life, here we report the development of a drawstring&#8208;mimetic supramolecular complex at the molecular scale. This complex consists of a rigid figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight macrocyclic host molecule and a flexible linear guest molecule which could interact through three&#8208;point non&#8208;covalent binding to form a highly selective and efficient host&#8211;guest assembly. The complex not only resembles the drawstring structure, but also mimics the properties of a drawstring with regard to deformations under external forces. The supramolecular drawstring can be utilized as an interlocked crosslinker for poly(methyl acrylate), and the corresponding polymer samples exhibit comprehensive enhancement of macroscopic mechanical performance including stiffness, strength, and toughness.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Azidocyanation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical alkene azidocyanation reaction that is compatible with both alkyl and aryl alkenes was developed. The reactions involving aryl alkenes could be obtained with good enantioselectivities by employing a chiral ligand. Notably, this method of alkene difunctionalization employs readily accessible reagents and is distinguished by its demonstrated functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The difunctionalization of alkenes&#8212;a process that installs two functional groups in a single operation and transforms chemical feedstocks into value&#8208;added products&#8212;is one of the most appealing synthetic methods in contemporary chemistry. However, the introduction of two distinct functional groups via two readily accessible nucleophiles remains a formidable challenge. Existing intermolecular alkene azidocyanation methods, which primarily focus on aryl alkenes and rely on stoichiometric chemical oxidants. We report herein an unprecedented electrochemical strategy for alkene azidocyanation that is compatible with both alkyl and aryl alkenes. This is achieved by harnessing the finely&#8208;tuned anodic electron transfer and the strategic selection of copper/ligand complexes. The reactions of aryl alkenes were rendered enantioselective by employing a chiral ligand. Crucially, the mild conditions and well&#8208;regulated electrochemical process assure exceptional tolerance for various functional groups and substrate compatibility with both terminal and internal alkyl alkenes.

         <title>Zr&#8208;Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as nanoreactor for boosting the formation of hydrogen clathrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microwave&#8208;assisted PCN&#8208;222 nanocrystals has been successfully used as nanoreactors to promote the nucleation and growth of hydrogen clathrates. This research shows that hydrogen can be enclathrated at lower pressure than the bulk system, with fast kinetics and with a nearly complete water&#8208;to&#8208;hydrate conversion.







Abstract
We report the first experimental evidence for rapid formation of hydrogen clathrates under mild pressure and temperature conditions within the cavities of a zirconium&#8208;metalloporphyrin framework, specifically PCN&#8208;222. PCN&#8208;222 has been selected for its 1D mesoporous channels, high water&#8208;stability, and proper hydrophilic behavior. Firstly, we optimize a microwave (MW)&#8208;assisted method for the synthesis of nanosized PCN&#8208;222 particles with precise structure control (exceptional homogeneity in morphology and crystalline phase purity), taking advantage of MW in terms of rapid/homogeneous heating, time and energy savings, as well as potential scalability of the synthetic method. Second, we explore the relevance of the large mesoporous 1D open channels within the PCN&#8208;222 to promote the nucleation and growth of confined hydrogen clathrates. Experimental results show that PCN&#8208;222 drives the nucleation process at a lower pressure than the bulk system (1.35&#8197;kbar vs 2&#8197;kbar), with fast kinetics (minutes), using pure water, and with a nearly complete water&#8208;to&#8208;hydrate conversion. Unfortunately, PCN&#8208;222 cannot withstand these high pressures, which lead to a significant alteration of the mesoporous structure while the microporous network remains mainly unchanged.

         <title>Anchoring Fe Species on the Highly Curved Surface of S and N Co&#8208;Doped Carbonaceous Nanosprings for Oxygen Electrocatalysis and a Flexible Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anchoring Fe species on the highly curved surface of S and N co&#8208;doped carbonaceous nanosprings has been achieved (denoted as FeNS/Fe3C@CNS). FeNS/Fe3C@CNS exhibits high activities and stabilities in both alkaline and acidic medium. The excellent performance is attributed to the high curved surface and the incorporation of S that enhances the inherent catalytic activity of Fe single&#8208;atom active sites.







Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of critical significance in the advancement of fuel cells and zinc&#8208;air batteries. The iron&#8208;nitrogen (Fe&#8722;Nx) sites exhibited exceptional reactivity towards ORR. However, the task of designing and controlling the local structure of Fe species for high ORR activity and stability remains a challenge. Herein, we have achieved successful immobilization of Fe species onto the highly curved surface of S, N co&#8208;doped carbonaceous nanosprings (denoted as FeNS/Fe3C@CNS). The induction of this twisted configuration within FeNS/Fe3C@CNS arose from the assembly of chiral templates. For electrocatalytic ORR tests, FeNS/Fe3C@CNS exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91&#8197;V in alkaline medium and a E1/2 of 0.78&#8197;V in acidic medium. The Fe single atoms and Fe3C nanoparticles are coexistent and play as active centers within FeNS/Fe3C@CNS. The highly curved surface, coupled with S substitution in the coordination layer, served to reduce the energy barrier for ORR, thereby enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity of the Fe single&#8208;atom sites. We also assembled a wearable flexible Zn&#8208;air battery using FeNS/Fe3C@CNS as electrocatalysts. This work provides new insights into the construction of highly curved surfaces within carbon materials, offering high electrocatalytic efficacy and remarkable performance for flexible energy conversion devices.

A Bi12O17Cl2 piezo&#8208;catalyst was prepared with peculiar [Bi3O4.25] layers. The existence of [Bi3O4.25] not only serves as active sites but also satisfies energy band structure for 2e&#8722; ORR and 2e&#8722; WOR, realizing the dual pathway for adequate H2O2 synthesis. Expectedly, the constructed Bi12O17Cl2&#8208;PESF emerges superior degradation activity for pollutants attributed to sufficient use of in situ produced H2O2 to abundant &#8901;OH.







Abstract
Piezo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton system (PESF) has been emerging as a promising water treatment technology but suffering from unsatisfied H2O2 production efficiency. Herein, we rationally design a Bi12O17Cl2 piezo&#8208;catalyst with multiple [Bi&#8722;O]n interlayers towards highly efficient H2O2 production. The introduction of [Bi3O4.25] layers initiates dual two&#8208;electron pathway for H2O2 generation by altering the interlayer properties. It is found that the additional [Bi3O4.25] layers not only enhance the polarization electric field but also serve as active sites for triggering dual pathways of two&#8208;electron O2 reduction and H2O oxidation reaction for H2O2 production. Therefore, the Bi12O17Cl2 exhibits an ultrahigh rate of H2O2 generation (7.76&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) in pure water. Based on the adequate H2O2 yield, a PESF was constructed for acetaminophen (ACE) degradation with an apparent rate constant of 0.023&#8197;min&#8722;1. This work not only presents a potential strategy of tuning the activity of bismuth based piezo&#8208;catalysts but also provides a good example on the construction of highly efficient PESF for environmental remediation by using natural mechanical energy.

         <title>Asymmetric Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation by a Versatile Chiral&#8208;Amide&#8208;Directing Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile chiral amide directing group has been studied in the context of the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. Six transformations have been achieved, affording a series of valuable chiral products. With this tool, concise syntheses of many natural products and biologically active compounds (e.g., Montroumarin, Cyclosporone E, Cyclosporone Q, Concentricolide, Chuangxinol, and Eleutherol) were accomplished.







Abstract
A versatile and readily available chiral amide directing group has been developed for the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. Asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of the related chiral benzamides with various olefins, aldehydes and propargylic alcohols has been accomplished with high stereoselectivities, affording a series of chiral products including 3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarins (up to 96&#8201;%&#8201;ee), isocoumarins (up to 92&#8201;%&#8201;ee), phthalides (up to 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee), chiral bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr), 4&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarins (up to 97&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and allenes (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). Importantly, our methodologies enabled concise syntheses of many biologically active compounds and natural products (e.g., Montroumarin, Cyclosporone E, Cyclosporone Q, Concentricolide, Chuangxinol, and Eleutherol).

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelling Macroscale Sheets Powered by Enzyme Pumps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedded nano&#8208;sized enzymes, in the presence of their respective substrates, can drive centimeter&#8208;scale polymer sheets along directed linear paths and rotational trajectories on the air/water interface.







Abstract
Nanoscale enzymes anchored to surfaces act as chemical pumps by converting chemical energy released from enzymatic reactions into spontaneous fluid flow that propels entrained nano&#8208; and microparticles. Enzymatic pumps are biocompatible, highly selective, and display unique substrate specificity. Utilizing these pumps to trigger self&#8208;propelled motion on the macroscale has, however, constituted a significant challenge and thus prevented their adaptation in macroscopic fluidic devices and soft robotics. Using experiments and simulations, we herein show that enzymatic pumps can drive centimeter&#8208;scale polymer sheets along directed linear paths and rotational trajectories. In these studies, the sheets are confined to the air/water interface. With the addition of appropriate substrate, the asymmetric enzymatic coating on the sheets induces chemically driven, buoyancy flows that controllably propel the sheet's motion on the air/water interface. The directionality and speed of the motion can be tailored by changing the pattern of the enzymatic coating, type of enzyme, and nature and concentration of the substrate. This work highlights the utility of biocompatible enzymes for generating motion in macroscale fluidic devices and robotics and indicates their potential utility for in vivo applications.

         <title>A Breast Cancer Stem Active Cobalt(III)&#8208;Cyclam Complex Containing Flufenamic Acid with Immunogenic Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the first investigation into the cytotoxic and immunogenic potential of a cobalt complex within the context of anti&#8208;cancer stem cell (CSC) drug discovery. The cobalt complex is able to deliver flufenamic acid to CSCs, which perturbs the inhibitory damage&#8208;associated molecular pattern axis and promotes immunogenic cell death. This subsequently leads to the phagocytosis of CSCs by macrophages.







Abstract
The cytotoxic and immunogenic&#8208;activating properties of a cobalt(III)&#8208;cyclam complex bearing the non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, flufenamic acid is reported within the context of anti&#8208;cancer stem cell (CSC) drug discovery. The cobalt(III)&#8208;cyclam complex 1 displays sub&#8208;micromolar potency towards breast CSCs grown in monolayers, 24&#8208;fold and 31&#8208;fold greater than salinomycin (an established anti&#8208;breast CSC agent) and cisplatin (an anticancer metallopharmaceutical), respectively. Strikingly, the cobalt(III)&#8208;cyclam complex 1 is 69&#8208;fold and 50&#8208;fold more potent than salinomycin and cisplatin towards three&#8208;dimensionally cultured breast CSC mammospheres. Mechanistic studies reveal that 1 induces DNA damage, inhibits cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 expression, and prompts caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. Breast CSCs treated with 1 exhibit damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns characteristic of immunogenic cell death and are phagocytosed by macrophages. As far as we are aware, 1 is the first cobalt complex of any oxidation state or geometry to display both cytotoxic and immunogenic&#8208;activating effects on breast CSCs.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;H Monoalkylation of Symmetric Polyols in the Presence of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transient carbonation of polyols under a CO2 atmosphere enables their C&#8722;H monoalkylation by photoredox catalysis. This reactivity results from an unprecedented C&#8722;H activation through intramolecular hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Achieving the selective modification of symmetric poly&#8208;hydroxylated compounds presents a significant challenge due to the presence of identical active sites. Herein, we address this challenge through the design of a ternary catalytic system that includes a photoredox catalyst, a hydrogen atom transfer promotor and a carbonation catalyst. This catalytic system enables the reversible carbonation of acyclic polyols under CO2 atmosphere, which modulates the reactivity of its distinct C&#8722;H bonds toward hydrogen atom transfers. An exquisite selectivity for the monoalkylation is achieved in a variety of unprotected light polyols, yielding valuable building blocks in short reaction times. Mechanistic and computational studies demonstrate that the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the transient carbonate and the free alcohol is pivotal for the kinetic and thermodynamic activation of a specific alcohol.

         <title>Boosting the Catalase&#8208;Like Activity of SAzymes via Facile Tuning of the Distances between Neighboring Atoms in Single&#8208;Iron Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile mechano&#8208;assisted in situ MOF capsulation strategy enables facile access to neighboring M2&#8208;SAzyme (M=Fe, Ir, Pt), even up to a 1000&#8197;grams scale. Typically, Fe2&#8208;SAzyme mimicks catalase to efficiently trap and decompose H2O2 into O2 via cooperative hydrogen&#8208;bonding induced end&#8208;bridge adsorption, featuring double activity and ~6 times catalase/peroxidase selectivity than those of random Fe1&#8208;SAzyme, H2O2 affinity similar as bioenzyme.







Abstract
A nanozyme with neighboring single&#8208;iron sites (Fe2&#8208;SAzyme) was introduced as a bioinspired catalase mimic, featuring excellent activity under varied conditions, twice as high as that of random Fe1&#8208;SAzyme and ultrahigh H2O2 affinity as that of bioenzymes. Surprisingly, the interatomic spacing tuning between adjacent iron sites also suppressed the competitive peroxidase pathway, remarkably increasing the catalase/peroxidase selectivity up to ~6 times compared to Fe1&#8208;SAzyme. This dramatically switched the catalytic activity of Fe&#8208;SAzymes from generating (i.e. Fe1&#8208;SAzymes, preferably mimicking peroxidase) to scavenging ROS (i.e. Fe2&#8208;SAzymes, dominantly mimicking catalase). Theoretical and experimental investigations suggested that the pairwise single&#8208;iron sites may serve as a robust molecular tweezer to efficiently trap and decompose H2O2 into O2, via cooperative hydrogen&#8208;bonding induced end&#8208;bridge adsorption. The versatile mechano&#8208;assisted in situ MOF capsulation strategy enabled facile access to neighboring M2&#8208;SAzyme (M=Fe, Ir, Pt), even up to a 1000&#8197;grams scale, but with no obvious scale&#8208;up effect for both structures and performances.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthetic Ensembling Design of Hierarchically Ordered FAU&#8208;type Zeolite Frameworks for Vacuum Gas Oil Hydrocracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel post&#8208;synthetic ensembling design comprising methodical incision of conventional FAU&#8208;type zeolites into unit&#8208;cell level zeolitic fragments and their subsequent reorganization into hierarchically ordered zeolites exhibiting 2D&#8208;hexagonal/3D&#8208;cubic mesopore channels. This approach eludes the kinetic constraints of conventional crystallization to produce hierarchical zeolites having excellent catalytic properties in hydrocracking applications.







Abstract
Zeolites hold importance as catalysts and membranes across numerous industrial processes that produce most of the world's fuels and chemicals. In zeolite catalysis, the rate of molecular diffusion inside the micropore channels defines the catalyst's longevity and selectivity, thereby influencing the catalytic efficiency. Decreasing the diffusion pathlengths of zeolites to the nanoscopic level by fabricating well&#8208;organized hierarchically porous architecture can efficiently overcome their intrinsic mass&#8208;transfer limitations without losing hydrothermal stability. We report a rational post&#8208;synthetic design for synthesizing hierarchically ordered FAU&#8208;type zeolites exhibiting 2D&#8208;hexagonal (P6mm) and 3D&#8208;cubic (Ia
d) mesopore channels. The synthesis involves methodical incision of the parent zeolite into unit&#8208;cell level zeolitic fragments by in situ generated base and bulky surfactants. The micellar ensembles formed by these surfactant&#8208;zeolite interactions are subsequently reorganized into various ordered mesophases by tuning the micellar curvature with ion&#8208;specific interactions (Hofmeister effect). Unlike conventional crystallization, which offers poor control over mesophase formation due to kinetic constraints, crystalline mesostructures can be developed under dilute, mild alkaline conditions by controlled reassembly. The prepared zeolites with nanometric diffusion pathlengths have demonstrated excellent yields of naphtha and middle&#8208;distillates in vacuum gas oil hydrocracking with decreased coke deposition.

         <title>Confinement of p&#8208;Xylene in the Pores of a Bilanthanide Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Highly Selective Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The porosity's significance in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has often been overlooked in luminescent sensing applications. A luminescent MOF NKU&#8208;999 was synthesized with tailored pores for highly selective and quantitative p&#8208;xylene recognition. The sensing mechanism was investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and dynamic magnetic susceptibilities.







Abstract
The rapid and accurate sensing of p&#8208;xylene, an essential raw material with a multi&#8208;billion&#8208;dollar market, in xylene mixture is of great significance in industry; however, the highly similar molecular structures, energy levels, and spectral characteristics of xylene isomers make the selective recognition extremely challenging. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibiting tailorable pores and potential binding sites provide prospects for xylene sensing but a comprehensive understanding of the pore effect is still elusive, primarily due to the intricacies involved in the sensing process. Herein, we reported a robust bilanthanide MOF NKU&#8208;999&#8208;EuTb with precisely engineered pores to accommodate p&#8208;xylene, of which the binding sites were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and dynamic magnetic susceptibilities. NKU&#8208;999&#8208;EuTb exhibits high&#8208;performance in selective recognition for p&#8208;xylene towards its isomers. Through a systematical study, it was revealed that absorbing p&#8208;xylene into the pores governs the sensing performance. This work provides insights for developing advanced sensing materials for complex isomers.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction via Self&#8208;Relaxation of Asymmetric Coordination in Fe&#8208;Based Single Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We implemented an asymmetric coordination Fe&#8722;S1N3 SAC with significant geometric distortion. The Fe&#8722;S1N3 sites demonstrate distinctive self&#8208;relaxation behavior in response to different adsorption intermediates during the CO2RR process. The dynamic change in bond length enabled independent regulation of the *COOH and *CO intermediates adsorption energies, effectively breaking the linear scale relationship and enhancing the intrinsic activity.







Abstract
Addressing the limitations arising from the consistent catalytic behavior observed for various intermediates during the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) poses a significant challenge in the optimization of catalytic activity. In this study, we aimed to address this challenge by constructing an asymmetric coordination Fe single atom catalyst (SCA) with a dynamically evolved structure. Our catalyst, consisting of a Fe atom coordinated with one S atom and three N atoms (Fe&#8722;S1N3), exhibited exceptional selectivity (CO Faradaic efficiency of 99.02&#8201;%) and demonstrated a high intrinsic activity (TOF of 7804.34&#8197;h&#8722;1), and remarkable stability. Using operando XAFS spectra and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidated the self&#8208;relaxation of geometric distortion and dynamic evolution of bond lengths within the catalyst. These structure changes enabled independent regulation of the *COOH and *CO intermediate adsorption energies, effectively breaking the linear scale relationship and enhancing the intrinsic activity of CO2RR. This study provides valuable insights into the dynamic evolution of SACs and paves the way for targeted catalyst designs aimed to disrupt the linear scaling relationships.

         <title>Probing Degradation in Lithium Ion Batteries with On&#8208;Chip Electrochemistry Mass Spectrometry
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In batteries, the formation of gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide and ethylene accompanies degradation. Ultrasensitive on chip electrochemistry mass spectrometry reveals previously undetectable gas evolution in lithium ion batteries. The ensuing insight will enable battery scientists to predict degradation mechanisms and discover new strategies to stabilise device performance.







Abstract
The rapid uptake of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) for large scale electric vehicle and energy storage applications requires a deeper understanding of the degradation mechanisms. Capacity fade is due to the complex interplay between phase transitions, electrolyte decomposition and transition metal dissolution; many of these poorly understood parasitic reactions evolve gases as a side product. Here we present an on&#8208;chip electrochemistry mass spectrometry method that enables ultra&#8208;sensitive, fully quantified and time resolved detection of volatile species evolving from an operating LIB. The technique's electrochemical performance and mass transport is described by a finite element model and then experimentally used to demonstrate the variety of new insights into LIB performance. We show the versatility of the technique, including (a) observation of oxygen evolving from a LiNiMnCoO2 cathode and (b) the solid electrolyte interphase formation reaction on graphite in a variety of electrolytes, enabling the deconvolution of lithium inventory loss (c) the first direct evidence, by virtue of the improved time resolution of our technique, that carbon dioxide reduction to ethylene takes place in a lithium ion battery. The emerging insight will guide and validate battery lifetime models, as well as inform the design of longer lasting batteries.

&lt;p&gt;In batteries, the formation of gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide and ethylene accompanies degradation. Ultrasensitive on chip electrochemistry mass spectrometry reveals previously undetectable gas evolution in lithium ion batteries. The ensuing insight will enable battery scientists to predict degradation mechanisms and discover new strategies to stabilise device performance.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Property Interplay Within Microporous Manganese Dioxide Tunnels For Sustainable Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The characteristic sub&#8208;nanoscale tunnel framework of manganese dioxides endows this family of materials with rich physiochemical properties and wide applications in sustainable energy storage. This review timely covers recent advancements related to such materials, with a focus on the atomistic insights into their structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationships that are critical to further advance these applications.







Abstract
Tunnel&#8208;structured manganese dioxides (MnO2), also known as octahedral molecule sieves (OMS), are widely studied in geochemistry, deionization, energy storage and (electro)catalysis. These functionalities originate from their characteristic sub&#8208;nanoscale tunnel framework, which, with a high degree of structural polymorphism and rich surface chemistry, can reversibly absorb and transport various ions. An intensive understanding of their structure&#8211;property relationship is prerequisite for functionality optimization, which has been recently approached by implementation of advanced (in situ) characterizations providing significant atomistic sciences. This review will thus timely cover recent advancements related to OMS and their energy storage applications, with a focus on the atomistic insights pioneered by researchers including our group: the origins of structural polymorphism and heterogeneity, the evolution of faceted OMS crystals and its effect on electrocatalysis, the ion transport/storage properties and their implication for processing OMS. These studies represent a clear rational behind recent endeavors investigating the historically applied OMS materials, the summary of which is expected to deepen the scientific understandings and guide material engineering for functionality control.

         <title>Cable Bacteria Skeletons as Catalytically Active Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological cables as electrodes: Electrically conducting filamentous cable bacteria skeletons were used as free&#8208;standing biological electrodes and displayed catalytic selectivity towards oxygen. The skeletons convert water to oxygen and oxygen back to water. We show that the reactions can be driven either by an external electric field or by simply exposing the cables to a gradient of oxygen concentration.







Abstract
Cable bacteria are multicellular, filamentous bacteria that use internal conductive fibers to transfer electrons over centimeter distances from donors within anoxic sediment layers to oxygen at the surface. We extracted the fibers and used them as free&#8208;standing bio&#8208;based electrodes to investigate their electrocatalytic behavior. The fibers catalyzed the reversible interconversion of oxygen and water, and an electric current was running through the fibers even when the potential difference was generated solely by a gradient of oxygen concentration. Oxygen reduction as well as oxygen evolution were confirmed by optical measurements. Within living cable bacteria, oxygen reduction by direct electrocatalysis on the fibers and not by membrane&#8208;bound proteins readily explains exceptionally high cell&#8208;specific oxygen consumption rates observed in the oxic zone, while electrocatalytic water oxidation may provide oxygen to cells in the anoxic zone.

         <title>Acyl and CO Ligands in the [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Cofactor Scramble upon Photolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase cofactor contains an acyl&#8208; and two CO&#8208;ligands. Biosynthesis using stable isotopes demonstrated the formation of the acyl ligand from the carboxy group of the precursor, and MS/MS analysis indicated that the acyl and CO ligands exchanged during photolysis. Time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy revealed the presence of an acyl&#8208;Fe(CO)3 intermediate during photolysis, which could explain the acyl/CO ligand exchange.







Abstract
[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase harbors the iron&#8208;guanylylpyridinol (FeGP) cofactor, in which the Fe(II) complex contains acyl&#8208;carbon, pyridinol&#8208;nitrogen, cysteine&#8208;thiolate and two CO as ligands. Irradiation with UV&#8208;A/blue light decomposes the FeGP cofactor to a 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;4&#8208;guanylyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone (GP) and other components. Previous in vitro biosynthesis experiments indicated that the acyl&#8208; and CO&#8208;ligands in the FeGP cofactor can scramble, but whether scrambling occurred during biosynthesis or photolysis was unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the [18O1&#8208;carboxy]&#8208;group of GP is incorporated into the FeGP cofactor by in vitro biosynthesis. MS/MS analysis of the 18O&#8208;labeled FeGP cofactor revealed that the produced [18O1]&#8208;acyl group is not exchanged with a CO ligand of the cofactor, indicating that the acyl and CO ligands are scrambled during photolysis rather than biosynthesis, which ruled out any biosynthesis mechanisms allowing acyl/CO ligands scrambling. Time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy indicated that an acyl&#8208;Fe(CO)3 intermediate is formed during photolysis, in which scrambling of the CO and acyl ligands can occur. This finding also suggests that the light&#8208;excited FeGP cofactor has a higher affinity for external CO. These results contribute to our understanding of the biosynthesis and photosensitive properties of this unique H2&#8208;activating natural complex.

         <title>Two&#8208;Electron Redox Reactivity of Thorium Supported by Redox&#8208;Active Tripodal Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two electrons can be stored in the arene anchor of robust tripodal siloxide frameworks by chemical reduction of their Th(IV) complexes. The two electrons become available at the metal center for the controlled two&#8208;electron reduction of a broad range of substrates (N2O, COT, CHT, Ph2N2, Ph3PS and O2) while the ligand framework is retained in its original form.







Abstract
The high stability of the + IVoxidation state limits thorium redox reactivity. Here we report the synthesis and the redox reactivity of two Th(IV) complexes supported by the arene&#8208;tethered tris(siloxide) tripodal ligands [(KOSiR2Ar)3&#8208;arene)]. The two&#8208;electron reduction of these Th(IV) complexes generates the doubly reduced [KTh((OSi(OtBu)2Ar)3&#8208;arene)(THF)2] (2OtBu) and [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)][Th((OSiPh2Ar)3&#8208;arene)(THF)2](2Ph&#8208;crypt) where the formal oxidation state of Th is +II. Structural and computational studies indicate that the reduction occurred at the arene anchor of the ligand. The robust tripodal frameworks store in the arene anchor two electrons that become available at the metal center for the two&#8208;electron reduction of a broad range of substrates (N2O, COT, CHT, Ph2N2, Ph3PS and O2) while retaining the ligand framework. This work shows that arene&#8208;tethered tris(siloxide) tripodal ligands allow implementation of two&#8208;electron redox chemistry at the thorium center while retaining the ligand framework unchanged.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Online monitoring of formose reaction by ion&#8208;mobility&#8208;separation mass&#8208;spectrometry reveals the growth of the size and complexity of sugar molecules. Chemometrics analysis identified the key reaction mixture components and their contribution to the dynamic reaction changes. The results allowed the reconstruction of the reaction networks and analysis of the kinetics of early steps of formose reaction.







Abstract
Complex reaction mixtures, like those postulated on early Earth, present an analytical challenge because of the number of components, their similarity, and vastly different concentrations. Interpreting the reaction networks is typically based on simplified or partial data, limiting our insight. We present a new approach based on online monitoring of reaction mixtures formed by the formose reaction by ion&#8208;mobility&#8208;separation mass&#8208;spectrometry. Monitoring the reaction mixtures led to large data sets that we analyzed by non&#8208;negative matrix factorization, thereby identifying ion&#8208;signal groups capturing the time evolution of the network. The groups comprised &#8776;300 major ion signals corresponding to sugar&#8208;calcium complexes formed during the formose reaction. Multivariate analysis of the kinetic profiles of these complexes provided an overview of the interconnected kinetic processes in the solution, highlighting different pathways for sugar growth and the effects of different initiators on the initial kinetics. Reconstructing the network's topology further, we revealed so far unnoticed fast retro&#8208;aldol reaction of ketoses, which significantly affects the initial reaction dynamics. We also detected the onset of sugar&#8208;backbone branching for C6&#8197;sugars and cyclization reactions starting for C5&#8197;sugars. This top&#8208;down analytical approach opens a new way to analyze complex dynamic mixtures online with unprecedented coverage and time resolution.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Live Imaging of Osteoclast Activation via Cathepsin K Activity in Bone Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new two&#8208;photon fluorogenic probe, CatKP1, has been developed to detect cathepsin K and enable the real&#8208;time monitoring of osteoclast activity in hindlimb long bones during pathologic bone loss. This highlights the importance of CatKP1 as a valuable tool for studying aberrant osteoclast behavior and exploring new therapeutic strategies.







Abstract
Intravital fluorescence imaging of functional osteoclasts within their intact disease context provides valuable insights into the intricate biology at the microscopic level, facilitating the development of therapeutic approaches for osteoclast&#8208;associated bone diseases. However, there is a lack of studies investigating osteoclast activity within deep&#8208;seated bone lesions using appropriate fluorescent probes, despite the advantages offered by the multi&#8208;photon excitation system in enhancing deep tissue imaging resolution. In this study, we report on the intravital tracking of osteoclast activity in three distinct murine bone disease models. We utilized a cathepsin K (CatK)&#8208;responsive two&#8208;photon fluorogenic probe (CatKP1), which exhibited a notable fluorescence turn&#8208;on response in the presence of active CatK. By utilizing CatKP1, we successfully monitored a significant increase in osteoclast activity in hindlimb long bones and its attenuation through pharmacological intervention without sacrificing mice. Thus, our findings highlight the efficacy of CatKP1 as a valuable tool for unraveling pathological osteoclast behavior and exploring novel therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Unlocking the Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Tetrasubstituted Acyclic Enones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast and highly selective Ir&#8208;catalysts have been developed for the asymmetric hydrogenation of challenging tetrasubstituted acyclic enones. The mechanism and the effects of the catalyst and reaction parameters on selectivity have been unraveled by means of deuterogenation experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of tetrasubstituted olefins generating two stereocenters is still an open topic. There are only a few reports on the AH of tetrasubstituted olefins with conjugated functional groups, while this process can create useful intermediates for the subsequent elaboration of relevant end products. Most of the tetrasubstituted olefins successfully submitted to AH belong to a small number of functional classes; remarkably, the AH of tetrasubstituted acyclic enones still represents an unsolved challenge. Herein, we disclose a class of air&#8208;stable Ir&#8722;P,N catalysts, prepared in three steps from commercially available amino alcohols, that can hydrogenate, in minutes, a wide range of electronically and sterically diverse acyclic tetrasubstituted enones (including exocyclic ones) with high yields and high enantioselectivities. The factors responsible for the excellent selectivities were elucidated by combining deuterogenation experiments and theoretical calculations. The calculations indicated that the reduction follows an IrI/IrIII mechanism, in which enantioselectivity is controlled in the first migratory insertion of the hydride to the most electrophilic olefinic C&#946; and the formation of the hydrogenated product via reductive elimination takes place prior to the coordination of dihydrogen and the subsequent oxidative addition. The potential of the new catalytic systems is demonstrated by the derivatization of hydrogenation products.

         <title>Werner Salt as Nickel and Ammonia Source for Photochemical Synthesis of Primary Aryl Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Werner salt [Ni(NH3)6]Cl2 can be used as both a nitrogen and a catalytic nickel source that allow for the efficient amination of aryl chlorides in the presence of a catalytic amount of bipyridine ligand under the irradiation of 390&#8211;395&#8197;nm light without the need of any additional catalysts, solving the problem of easy deactivation and difficult recovery of transition metal nickel catalysts.







Abstract
Cheap, stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle Werner ammine salts have been known for more than a century; but they have been rarely used in organic synthesis. Herein, we report that the Werner hexammine complex [Ni(NH3)6]Cl2 can be used as both a nitrogen and a catalytic nickel source that allow for the efficient amination of aryl chlorides in the presence of a catalytic amount of bipyridine ligand under the irradiation of 390&#8211;395&#8197;nm light without the need of any additional catalysts. More than 80&#8197;aryl chlorides, including more than 20 drug molecules, were aminated, demonstrating the practicality and generality of this method in synthetic chemistry. A slow NH3 release mechanism is in operation, obviating the problem of catalyst poisoning. Still interestingly, we show that the Werner salt can be easily recovered and reused, solving the problem of difficult recovery of transition metal nickel catalysts. The protocol thus provides an efficient new strategy for the synthesis of primary aryl amines.

         <title>Reference&#8208;Quality Free Energy Barriers in Catalysis from Machine Learning Thermodynamic Perturbation Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Free energy barriers of acid&#8208;catalyzed cracking and isomerization reactions of alkenes are computed at an unprecedented level of theory, combining dynamic effects investigated by ab initio molecular dynamics and high&#8208;level electronic energy calculations with Machine Learning thermodynamic Perturbation Theory. The results are close to chemical accuracy.







Abstract
For the first time, we report calculations of the free energies of activation of cracking and isomerization reactions of alkenes that combine several different electronic structure methods with molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that the use of a high level of theory (here Random Phase Approximation&#8212;RPA) is necessary to bridge the gap between experimental and computed values. These transformations, catalyzed by zeolites and proceeding via cationic intermediates and transition states, are building blocks of many chemical transformations for valorization of long chain paraffins originating, e.g., from plastic waste, vegetable oils, Fischer&#8211;Tropsch waxes or crude oils. Compared with the free energy barriers computed at the PBE+D2 production level of theory via constrained ab initio molecular dynamics, the barriers computed at the RPA level by the application of Machine Learning thermodynamic Perturbation Theory (MLPT) show a significant decrease for isomerization reaction and an increase of a similar magnitude for cracking, yielding an unprecedented agreement with the results obtained by experiments and kinetic modeling.

         <title>Chemical Approaches to Optimize the Properties of Organic Fluorophores for Imaging and Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review has clarified the reasons for the insufficient properties of fluorophores, including short absorption and emission wavelength, low brightness, poor stability, small Stokes shift, and unsuitable permeability, and summarizes the methods for optimizing these properties developed in recent years. The review will provide a theoretical guidance and helpful insights for the design of high&#8208;performance fluorophores.







Abstract
Organic fluorophores are indispensable tools in cells, tissue and in vivo imaging, and have enabled much progress in the wide range of biological and biomedical fields.

&lt;p&gt;Organic fluorophores are indispensable tools in cells, tissue and in vivo imaging, and have enabled much progress in the wide range of biological and biomedical fields. However, many available dyes suffer from insufficient performances, such as short absorption and emission wavelength, low brightness, poor stability, small Stokes shift, and unsuitable permeability, restricting their application in advanced imaging technology and complex imaging. Over the past two decades, many efforts have been made to improve these performances of fluorophores. Starting with the luminescence principle of fluorophores, this review clarifies the mechanisms of the insufficient performance for traditional fluorophores to a certain extent, systematically summarizes the modified approaches of optimizing properties, highlights the typical applications of the improved fluorophores in imaging and sensing, and indicates existing problems and challenges in this area.

         <title>Leveraging Radiation&#8208;triggered Metal Prodrug Activation Through Nanosurface Energy Transfer for Directed Radio&#8208;chemo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy for radiation&#8208;triggered metal prodrug activation via nanosurface energy transfer, from electrons of a gold nanocluster core to reductive Ru (II) active center in the hybrid layer, is presented to overcome the limitations of insufficient and easily quenched reactive species. The proposed nanoplatform&#8208;directed radiochemotherapy leads to profound outcomes for combined cancer treatment in an efficient and controllable manner.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based drugs currently dominate the field of chemotherapeutic agents; however, achieving the controlled activation of metal prodrugs remains a substantial challenge. Here, we propose a universal strategy for the radiation&#8208;triggered activation of metal prodrugs via nanosurface energy transfer (NSET). The core&#8211;shell nanoplatform (Ru&#8208;GNC) is composed of gold nanoclusters (GNC) and ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;containing organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid coatings. Upon X&#8208;ray irradiation, chemotherapeutic Ru (II) complexes were released in a controlled manner through a unique NSET process involving the transfer of photoelectron energy from the radiation&#8208;excited Ru&#8208;GNCs to the Ru&#8208;containing hybrid layer. In contrast to the traditional radiation&#8208;triggered activation of prodrugs, such an NSET&#8208;based system ensures that the reactive species in the tumor microenvironment are present in sufficient quantity and are not easily quenched. Additionally, ultrasmall Ru&#8208;GNCs preferably target mitochondria and profoundly disrupt the respiratory chain upon irradiation, leading to radiosensitization by generating abundant reactive oxygen species. Consequently, Ru&#8208;GNC&#8208;directed radiochemotherapy induces immunogenic cell death, resulting in significant therapeutic outcomes when combined with the programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8722;L1) checkpoint blockade. This NSET strategy represents a breakthrough in designing radiation&#8208;triggered nanoplatforms for metal&#8208;prodrug&#8208;mediated cancer treatment in an efficient and controllable manner.

         <title>Azonia&#8208;Naphthalene: A Cationic Hydrophilic Building Block for Stable N&#8208;Type Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel hydrophobic building block, 4a&#8208;azonia&#8208;naphthalene (AN), for n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors. AN have the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, and exhibit strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, leading to smaller &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, interesting ion diffusion behavior, and good morphology stability, resulting in improved ion diffusion/injection speed and operational stability of organic electrochemical transistors.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers that can efficiently transport both ionic and electronic charges have broad applications in next&#8208;generation optoelectronic, bioelectronic, and energy storage devices. To date, almost all the conjugated polymers have hydrophobic backbones, which impedes efficient ion diffusion/transport in aqueous media. Here, we design and synthesize a novel hydrophilic polymer building block, 4a&#8208;azonia&#8208;naphthalene (AN), drawing inspiration from biological systems. Because of the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of AN, the AN&#8208;based polymers show typical n&#8208;type charge transport behaviors. We find that cationic aromatics exhibit strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, leading to smaller &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, interesting ion diffusion behavior, and good morphology stability. Additionally, AN enhances the hydrophilicity and ionic&#8208;electronic coupling of the polymer, which can help to improve ion diffusion/injection speed, and operational stability of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). The integration of cationic building blocks will undoubtedly enrich the material library for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers.

         <title>Catechol&#8208;Isolated Atomically Dispersed Nanocatalysts for Self&#8208;Motivated Cocatalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catechol&#8208;isolated mesoporous single iron atomic nanocatalysts (mSAFe NCs) with ligand&#8208;field&#8208;effect&#8208;promoted cocatalytic Fenton catalysis have been constructed. The catechols from dopamine serve as both an iron coordination site for atomic isolation and a reductive ligand to generate a field&#8208;effect&#8208;based cocatalytic system that instantly reduces FeIII species to FeII species within the mSAFe NCs, thereby promoting in vivo Fenton catalytic effects against tumors.







Abstract
Nanocatalytic tumor therapy based on Fenton nanocatalysts has attracted considerable attention because of its therapeutic specificity, enhanced outcomes, and high biocompatibility. Nevertheless, the rate&#8208;determining step in Fenton chemistry, which involves the transition of a high&#8208;valence metallic center (FeIII) to a Fenton&#8208;active low&#8208;valence metallic center (FeII), has hindered advances in nanocatalyst&#8208;based therapeutics. In this study, we constructed mesoporous single iron atomic nanocatalysts (mSAFe NCs) by employing catechols from dopamine to coordinate and isolate single iron atoms. The catechols also serve as reductive ligands, generating a field&#8208;effect&#8208;based cocatalytic system that instantly reduces FeIII species to FeII species within the mSAFe NCs. This self&#8208;motivated cocatalytic strategy enabled by mSAFe NCs accelerates the kinetics of the Fenton catalytic reaction, resulting in remarkable performance for nanocatalytic tumor therapy both in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>Reversal of Regioselectivity in Asymmetric C&#8722;H Bond Annulation with Bromoalkynes under Cobalt Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we demonstrate the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric desymmetrization of phosphinamides with haloalkynes with excellent enantioinduction and inverse regioselectivity. In a single step, the approach provides access to several P&#8208;chiral molecules. Based on control experiments and preliminary study, a plausible mechanism is provided.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H bond annulation strategy offers a versatile platform, allowing the construction of complex P&#8208;chiral molecules through atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical fashion. However, regioselective insertion of &#960;&#8208;coupling partner between M&#8722;C bond with high enantio&#8208;induction remain elusive. Using commercially available Co(II) salt and chiral&#8208;Salox ligands, we demonstrate an unusual protocol for the regio&#8208;reversal, enantioselective C&#8722;H bond annulation of phosphinamide with bromoalkyne through desymmetrization. The reaction proceeds through ligand&#8208;assisted enantiodetermining cyclocobaltation followed by regioselective insertion of bromoalkyne between Co&#8722;C, subsequent reductive elimination, and halogen exchange with carboxylate resulted in P&#8208;stereogenic compounds in excellent ee (up to &gt;99&#8201;%). The isolation of cobaltacycle involved in the catalytic cycle and the outcome of control experiments provide support for a plausible mechanism.

The singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap was modulated by controlling the inter&#8208;cluster interaction defined by the supramolecular arrangements of Ag12 nanoclusters.







Abstract
Silver cluster&#8208;based solids have garnered considerable attention owing to their tunable luminescence behavior. While surface modification has enabled the construction of stable silver clusters, controlling interactions among clusters at the molecular level has been challenging due to their tendency to aggregate. Judicious choice of stabilizing ligands becomes pivotal in crafting a desired assembly. However, detailed photophysical behavior as a function of their cluster packing remained unexplored. Here, we modulate the packing pattern of Ag12 clusters by varying the nitrogen&#8208;based ligand. CAM&#8208;1 formed through coordination of the tritopic linker molecule and NC&#8208;1 with monodentate pyridine ligand; established via non&#8208;covalent interactions. Both the assemblies show ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMMCT) based cluster&#8208;centered emission band(s). Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectra exhibit blue shifts at higher temperatures, which is attributed to the extent of the thermal reverse population of the S1 state from the closely spaced T1 state. The difference in the energy gap (&#916;EST) dictated by their assemblies played a pivotal role in the way that Ag12 cluster assembly in CAM&#8208;1 manifests a wider &#916;EST and thus requires higher temperatures for reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) than assembly of NC&#8208;1. Such assembly&#8208;defined photoluminescence properties underscore the potential toolkit to design new cluster&#8208; assemblies with tailored optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Direct Decarboxylation of Trifluoroacetates Enabled by Iron Photocatalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron photocatalysis enables repurposing inexpensive trifluoroacetates as reagents for the C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation. Thanks to the complementary inner&#8208;sphere electron&#8208;transfer pathway, photodecarboxylation occurs under mild conditions and can be applied to complex molecules, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Trifluoroacetates are the most abundant and accessible sources of trifluoromethyl groups, which are key components in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The generation of trifluoromethyl reactive radicals from trifluoroacetates requires their decarboxylation, which is hampered by their high oxidation potential. This constitutes a major challenge for redox&#8208;based methods, because of the need to pair the redox potentials with trifluoroacetate. Here we report a strategy based on iron photocatalysis to promote the direct photodecarboxylation of trifluoroacetates that displays reactivity features that escape from redox limitations. Our synthetic design has enabled the use of trifluoroacetates for the trifluoromethylation of more easily oxidizable organic substrates, offering new opportunities for late&#8208;stage derivatization campaigns using chemical feedstocks, Earth&#8208;abundant catalysts, and visible&#8208;light.

         <title>Full&#8208;Spectrum Responsive Naphthalimide/Perylene Diimide with a Giant Internal Electric Field for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;spectrum responsive naphthalimide/perylene diimide (NDINH/PDINH) supramolecular photocatalysts are obtained by co&#8208;assembly through a rapid solution dispersion method, creating a giant internal electric field (IEF) via the larger local dipole. The IEF can effectively inhibit the recombination of photogenerated carriers and promote charge&#8208;transfer excitation. The photocatalysts are capable of efficient overall water splitting.







Abstract
The co&#8208;assembly naphthalimide/perylene diimide (NDINH/PDINH) supramolecular photocatalysts were successfully synthesized via a rapid solution dispersion method. A giant internal electric field (IEF) in co&#8208;assembly structure was built by the larger local dipole. NDINH coated on PDINH could reduce the reflected electric field over PDINH to improve its responsive activity to ultraviolet light. Resultantly, an efficient full&#8208;spectrum photocatalytic overall water splitting activity with H2 and O2 evolution rate of 317.2 and 154.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for NDINH/PDINH together with optimized O2 evolution rate with 2.61&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 using AgNO3 as a sacrificial reagent were achieved. Meanwhile, its solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency was enhanced to 0.13&#8201;%. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was primarily attributed to the IEF between NDINH and PDINH, significantly accelerating transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, a direct Z&#8208;Scheme pathway of carriers contributed to a high redox potential. The strategy provided a new perspective for the design of supramolecular photocatalysts.

         <title>Stereoselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Olefination of Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new look at catalytic Wittig&#8208;type olefinations. We explored the use of transition metal catalysis to form ylide equivalents from readily available starting materials leading to the development of a highly E&#8208;selective copper&#8208;catalyzed olefination of imines with alkenyl boronate esters as coupling partners.







Abstract
Alkenes are an important class of organic molecules found among synthetic intermediates and bioactive compounds. They are commonly synthesized through stoichiometric Wittig&#8208;type olefination of carbonyls and imines, using ylides or their equivalents. Despite the importance of Wittig&#8208;type olefination reactions, their catalytic variants remain underdeveloped. We explored the use of transition metal catalysis to form ylide equivalents from readily available starting materials. Our investigation led to a new copper&#8208;catalyzed olefination of imines with alkenyl boronate esters as coupling partners. We identified a heterobimetallic complex, obtained by hydrocupration of the alkenyl boronate esters, as the key catalytic intermediate that serves as an ylide equivalent. The high E&#8208;selectivity observed in the reaction is due to the stereoselective addition of this intermediate to an imine, followed by stereospecific anti&#8208;elimination.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive (3+2) Annulation of Lactams Enabling the Rapid Total Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Eburnamonine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reductive (3+2) annulation of lactams was developed through a sequential process consisting of iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of the lactam carbonyl group followed by iridium&#8208;catalyzed photoredox coupling with &#945;&#8208;bromoacetic acid. The method was successfully applied to the four&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;eburnamonine.







Abstract
A reductive (3+2) annulation of lactams through iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and photoredox coupling with &#945;&#8208;bromoacetic acid was developed. The iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of the lactam carbonyl group and subsequent elimination provide a transient cyclic enamine, which undergoes iridium&#8208;catalyzed photoredox coupling with &#945;&#8208;bromoacetic acid in a one&#8208;pot process. The developed conditions show high functional&#8208;group tolerance and provide cyclic N,O&#8208;acetals containing a quaternary carbon center. The resulting N,O&#8208;acetals undergo a variety of acid&#8208;mediated nucleophilic addition reactions via iminium ions to give substituted cyclic amines. The developed sequence including reductive (3+2) annulation and acid&#8208;mediated nucleophilic addition was successfully applied to the four&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;eburnamonine.

         <title>Adjusting the Architecture of Heptagonal Metallo&#8208;Macrocycles by Embedding Metal Nodes into the Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two giant metallo&#8208;macrocycles with double&#8208;layer and triple&#8208;layer concentric heptagonal structures (DA and TA, respectively) have been successfully assembled by embedding coordination sites in the ligand backbone. The angle between the two arms at position 4 of the central terpyridine (tpy) units increased after complexation with metal ions, leading to precise control over the topology.

Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly has been extensively employed for the bottom&#8208;up construction of discrete metallo&#8208;macrocycles. However, the prevalent use of benzene rings as the backbone limits the formation of large metallo&#8208;macrocycles with more than six edges. Herein, by embedding metal nodes into the ligand backbone, we successfully regulated the ligand arm angle and assembled two giant heptagonal metallo&#8208;macrocycles with precise control. The angle between two arms at position 4 of the central terpyridine (tpy) extended after complexation with metal ions, leading to ring expansion of the metallo&#8208;macrocycle. The assembled structures were straightforwardly identified through multi&#8208;dimensional NMR spectroscopy (1H, COSY, NOESY), multidimensional mass spectrometry analysis (ESI&#8208;MS and TWIM&#8208;MS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In addition, the catalytic performances of metallo&#8208;macrocycles in the oxidation of thioanisole were studied, with both supramolecules exhibiting good conversion rates. Furthermore, fiber&#8208;like nanostructures were observed from single&#8208;molecule heptagons by hierarchical self&#8208;assembly.

&lt;p&gt;Two giant metallo-macrocycles with double-layer and triple-layer concentric heptagonal structures (&lt;b&gt;DA&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;TA&lt;/b&gt;, respectively) have been successfully assembled by embedding coordination sites in the ligand backbone. The angle between the two arms at position 4 of the central terpyridine (tpy) units increased after complexation with metal ions, leading to precise control over the topology.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Bis(Boronic) Esters Featuring Acyclic, Non&#8208;Adjacent 1,3&#8208;Stereocenters</title>

         <dc:description>
We have developed an efficient method for synthesizing chiral 1,2&#8208;bis(boronic) esters bearing non&#8208;adjacent, acyclic 1,3&#8208;stereocenters. Notably, a novel activation mode for gem&#8208;diborylalkanes in asymmetric catalysis has been uncovered, avoiding two potential side&#8208;products encountered when using classical conditions. This innovative approach exhibits excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
The construction of acyclic, non&#8208;adjacent 1,3&#8208;stereogenic centers, prevalent motifs in drugs and bioactive molecules, has been a long&#8208;standing synthetic challenge due to acyclic nucleophiles being distant from the chiral environment. In this study, we successfully synthesized highly valuable 1,2&#8208;bis(boronic) esters featuring acyclic and nonadjacent 1,3&#8208;stereocenters. Notably, this reaction selectively produces migratory coupling products rather than alternative deborylative allylation or direct allylation byproducts. This approach introduces a new activation mode for selective transformations of gem&#8208;diborylmethane in asymmetric catalysis. Additionally, we found that other gem&#8208;diborylalkanes, previously challenging due to steric hindrance, also successfully participated in this reaction. The incorporation of 1,2&#8208;bis(boryl)alkenes facilitated the diversification of the alkenyl and two boron moieties in our target compounds, thereby enabling access to a broad array of versatile molecules. DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and shed light on the factors responsible for the observed excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. These were determined to arise from ligand&#8208;substrate steric repulsions in the syn&#8208;addition transition state.

         <title>Pauling&#8208;Type Adsorption of O2 Induced by Heteroatom Doped ZnIn2S4 for Boosted Solar&#8208;Driven H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cleavage of O&#8722;O bonds drastically hinder the H2O2 production performance. This work presents a strategy that atomically heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 at substitutional and interstitial sites, which not only optimizes the coordination environment of Zn active sites but also facilitates electron transfer to the Zn sites and improves charge density, avoiding the breakage of O&#8722;O bonds and reducing the energy barriers to H2O2 production.







Abstract
Breaking the trade&#8208;off between activity and selectivity has perennially been a formidable endeavor in the field of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis, especially the side&#8208;on configuration of oxygen (O2) on the catalyst surface will cause the cleavage of O&#8722;O bonds, which drastically hinders the H2O2 production performance. Herein, we present an atomically heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 catalyst with tunable oxygen adsorption configuration to accelerate the ORR kinetics essential for solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production. Indeed, the spectroscopy characterizations (such as EXAFS and in situ FTIR) and DFT calculations reveal that heteroatom P doped ZnIn2S4 at substitutional and interstitial sites, which not only optimizes the coordination environment of Zn active sites, but also facilitates electron transfer to the Zn sites and improves charge density, avoiding the breakage of O&#8722;O bonds and reducing the energy barriers to H2O2 production. As a result, the oxygen adsorption configuration is regulated from side&#8208;on (Yeager&#8208;type) to end&#8208;on (Pauling&#8208;type), resulting in the accelerated ORR kinetics from 874.94 to 2107.66&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This finding offers a new avenue toward strategic tailoring oxygen adsorption configuration by the rational design of doped photocatalyst.
