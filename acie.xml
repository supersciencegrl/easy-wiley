      <title>Large and Highly Emissive Crystals from Carbon Quantum Dots onto Interfacial Organized Templates</title>
      <dc:description>Large and highly emissive crystals from carbon quantum dots (CQD) have been rarely demonstrated because of severe quenching effects of densely packed dots.&#160; Here,  we report template&#8208;assisted assembly of emissive CQD microcrystals on organized cellulose nanocrystals templates at the liquid&#8208;air interface.&#160; We suggest that this large&#8208;scale assembly is facilitated by the complementary amphiphilic character of CQDs and cellulose nanocrystals in organized nematic phase. &#160;The resulting large microcrystals up to 200 &#181;m across show unusually high emission that is not observed for limited CQDs aggregates.&#160; We suggest that the dense crystal packing of CQDs in the layered fashion suppresses local molecular rotations and vibrations, thus restricting the intermolecular energy transfer and corresponding quenching phenomena  . The as&#8208;prepared crystals are mechanically stable and can be exploited for recyclable catalysis, enabling prospective applications beyond the individual nanoparticles or their disordered aggregates. Additionally, the ligand&#8208;templated assembly can be versatilely used to diversify CQD crystal architectures to guide formation of fibers, microplates and micro&#8208;flowers, through different ligands templating.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Amides and Esters by Pd0&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative C(sp3)&#8211;H Activation</title>
      <dc:description>The 1,4&#8208;Pd shift strategy allows the functionalization of remote C&#8211;H bonds that are difficult to reach directly. We report a domino reaction proceeding via C(sp3)&#8211;H activation, 1,4&#8208;Pd shift and amino&#8208; or alkoxycarbonylation, which generates a variety of amides and esters bearing a quaternary &#946; carbon.

      <title>Selective loading of atomic Pt on a RuCeOx support enables stable hydrogen evolution at high current densities</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) have an important role to play in the development of renewable energy. Despite the enormous efforts to find cheaper alternative materials, platinum remains the most efficient known HER electrocatalyst. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to maximize Pt utilization in actual practical applications. Here we demonstrate a facile strategy for synthesizing RuCeO  x  &#8208;supported selectively loaded atomic Pt (0.49 wt.%) (denoted Pt/RuCeO  x  &#8208;PA) by photoactivation at ambient temperature and pressure. Due to the photoelectron transfer at the Mott&#8211;Schottky heterojunction in RuCeO  x  , Pt atoms became directionally embedded into the RuO  2  lattice. The resulting selectively loaded Pt&#8211;O&#8211;Ru moieties in Pt/RuCeO  x  &#8208;PA exhibit a stronger hydrogen spillover effect than Pt complexes randomly loaded by either chemical activation or thermal activation. As a result, Pt/RuCeO  x  &#8208;PA shows superior HER performance to the materials prepared by random loading and is even better than a commercial Pt/C catalyst with much higher Pt loading (20 wt.%) at high current densities (from 50&#8211;600 mA cm  &#8211;2  ). The selective loading strategy employed in our work not only provides an effective approach for constructing controllable active sites in HER catalysts but should also be applicable in the fabrication of other atomic catalysts.</dc:description>

Here we demonstrate a facile strategy for synthesizing RuCeO  x  &#8208;supported selectively loaded atomic Pt (0.49 wt.%) (denoted Pt/RuCeO  x  &#8208;PA) by photoactivation at ambient temperature and pressure. Due to the photoelectron transfer at the Mott&#8211;Schottky heterojunction in RuCeO  x  , Pt atoms became directionally embedded into the RuO  2  lattice. The resulting selectively loaded Pt&#8211;O&#8211;Ru moieties in Pt/RuCeO  x  &#8208;PA exhibit a stronger hydrogen spillover effect than Pt complexes randomly loaded by either chemical activation or thermal activation. As a result, Pt/RuCeO  x  &#8208;PA shows superior HER performance to the materials prepared by random loading and is even better than a commercial Pt/C catalyst with much higher Pt loading (20 wt.%) at high current densities (from 50&#8211;600 mA cm  &#8211;2  ). The selective loading strategy employed in our work not only provides an effective approach for constructing controllable active sites in HER catalysts but should also be applicable in the fabrication of other atomic catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Trifunctional soluble redox mediator enabled high&#8208;capacity and stable Li&#8208;O2 batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Li&#8208;O  2  batteries with ultrahigh theoretical energy densities usually suffer from low practical discharge capacities and inferior cycling stability owing to the cathode passivation caused by insulating discharge products and by&#8208;products. Here, we firstly introduce a new kind of trifunctional ether&#8208;based redox mediator, 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dimethoxybenzene (DBDMB), into the electrolyte to capture the reactive O  2  &#8208;  and alleviate the rigorous oxidative environment during cycling of Li&#8208;O  2  batteries. Thanks to the strong solvation of DBDMB towards Li  +  and O  2  &#8208;  , it can not only reduce the formation of by&#8208;products (a high Li  2  O  2  yield of 96.6%), but also promote the solution growth of large&#8208;sized Li  2  O  2  particles, avoiding the passivation of cathode as well as enabling a large discharge capacity. More encouragingly, DBDMB makes the oxidization of Li  2  O  2  and the decomposition of main by&#8208;products (Li  2  CO  3  and LiOH) proceed in a highly effective manner, prolonging the stability of Li&#8208;O  2  batteries (243 cycles at 1000 mAh g  &#8208;1  and 1000 mA g  &#8208;1  ). DFT calculations also unravel the intrinsic functional mechanism of DBDMB for facilitating the reversible O  2  involved redox reactions. Our strategy of using trifunctional electrolyte additive to capture reactive discharge intermediates with reduced formation of by&#8208;products, regulate solution growth of Li  2  O  2  , and co&#8208;oxidize Li  2  O  2  and by&#8208;products, will open up a new avenue to promote the performance of Li&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

Abstract
Cupin proteins share a double&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;helix fold, form one of the largest protein superfamilies, and possess remarkable functional diversity. They usually exist in homooligomeric states. Goss and co&#8208;workers recently reported that the cupin protein Pac13, which is a dehydratase that mediates the formation of the 3&#8242;&#8208;deoxy nucleoside of pacidamycins, is an unusual small monomer. However, a careful analysis of the biophysical and structural data provided by the authors suggests that Pac13 is in fact a homodimer, similar to many other cupin proteins.

Goss and co&#8208;workers recently reported that the cupin protein Pac13, which is a dehydratase that mediates the formation of the 3&#8242;&#8208;deoxy nucleoside of pacidamycins, is an unusual small monomer. However, analysis of the biophysical and structural data provided by the authors suggests that Pac13 is in fact a homodimer, similar to many other cupin proteins.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cupin proteins share a double&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;helix fold, form one of the largest protein superfamilies, and possess remarkable functional diversity. They usually exist in homooligomeric states. Goss and co&#8208;workers recently reported that the cupin protein Pac13, which is a dehydratase that mediates the formation of the 3&#8242;&#8208;deoxy nucleoside of pacidamycins, is an unusual small monomer. However, a careful analysis of the biophysical and structural data provided by the authors suggests that Pac13 is in fact a homodimer, similar to many other cupin proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>From  Glucose to Polymers&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;A Continuous Chemoenzymatic Process</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:    Aiming for sustainable development, the syntheses of degradable polymers from renewable resources are highly encouraging. Unfortunately, such efforts are deterred by technical and economic challenges; especially, the conversion of natural building blocks to polymerizable monomers is inefficient, requiring multistep synthesis and chromatographic purification. Herein we report a chemoenzymatic process to address these challenges. In this work, a novel enzymatic reaction system was designed, which allowed for regioselective functional group transformation efficiently, converting glucose to a polymerizable monomer in quantitative yield, thus removing the need for chromatographic purification. With this key success, we further designed a continuous, 3&#8208;step process, which enabled the synthesis of a sugar polymer [sugar poly(orthoester)] directly from glucose in high yield (73% from glucose). The work reported here may provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in developing technically and economically viable approaches to address the many issues associated with current petroleum&#8208;based polymers.</dc:description>

      <title>CO2&#8208;Folded Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles as Recyclable, Intensified Carboxylase Mimics</title>
      <dc:description>Emulating the function of natural carboxylases to convert CO2 under atmospheric condition is a grand challenge.

      <title>Cut and Paste for Cancer Treatment: a DNA Nanodevice that cuts out an RNA Marker Sequence to Activate a Therapeutic Function</title>
      <dc:description>DNA nanotechnology uses oligonucleotide strands to assemble molecular structures capable of performing useful operations. Here, we assembled a multifunctional prototype DNA nanodevice, DOCTR, that recognizes a single nucleotide mutation in a cancer marker RNA followed by cutting out a signature sequence and using it as an activator for a &#8216;therapeutic&#8217; function: cleavage of another RNA sequence. The proposed design is a prototype for a gene therapy DNA machine that cleaves a housekeeping gene only in the presence of a cancer&#8208;causing point mutation and suppresses exclusively cancer cells with minimal side effects to normal cells.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Having control: Stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels with triggered stiffness properties are attracting growing interest as smart materials for different applications. The Review discusses the design of biomolecule&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels and their applications as self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;memory, and controlled drug&#8208;release matrices, as well as mechanical actuators.

Abstract
This Review presents polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, nucleic acids, peptides, and proteins as functional stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer scaffolds that yield hydrogels with controlled stiffness. Different physical or chemical triggers can be used to structurally reconfigure the crosslinking units and control the stiffness of the hydrogels. The integration of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular complexes and stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecular units as crosslinkers leads to hybrid hydrogels undergoing reversible triggered transitions across different stiffness states. Different applications of stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecule&#8208;based hydrogels are discussed. The assembly of stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecule&#8208;based hydrogel films on surfaces and their applications are discussed. The coating of drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles with stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels for controlled drug release is also presented.

      <title>Reversible Luminescent Switching in an Organic Cocrystal: Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Induced Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Crystal Phase Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>
The crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transformation of organic cocrystals under multiple external stimuli, such as solvent vapor and heating, accompanied by reversible luminescent switching, is demonstrated by B. Xu et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002220). The results indicate that the luminescence switching originates from the unique molecular rearrangement of a hydrogen/halogen bond&#8208;directed stack to a &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction&#8208;directed stack in response to an external stimulus.

      <title>PI by NMR: Probing CH&#8211;&#960; Interactions in Protein&#8211;Ligand Complexes by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
The CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between the CH donor groups of Trp81&#8208;&#950; and Trp81&#8208;&#951; with the aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems of ligand 3 (stylized in blue and green, respectively) are illustrated in the cover picture. The backdrop shows a NMR chemical shift scale into which the Trp81 CH cross peaks are schematically drawn. In the complexed form the CH groups are shifted by up to 2.3&#8197;ppm as they are shielded by the aromatic ring systems of the ligand. As explained by G. Platzer, M. Mayer et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003732), these upfield shifts are indicative of favorable CH&#8211;&#960; interactions, which are difficult to detect directly in solution by other methods.

&lt;p&gt;The CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between the CH donor groups of Trp81&#8208;&#950; and Trp81&#8208;&#951; with the aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems of ligand 3 (stylized in blue and green, respectively) are illustrated in the cover picture. The backdrop shows a NMR chemical shift scale into which the Trp81 CH cross peaks are schematically drawn. In the complexed form the CH groups are shifted by up to 2.3&#8197;ppm as they are shielded by the aromatic ring systems of the ligand. As explained by G. Platzer, M. Mayer et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20200373210.1002/anie.202003732&lt;/a&gt;), these upfield shifts are indicative of favorable CH&#8211;&#960; interactions, which are difficult to detect directly in solution by other methods.

      <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive smart photosensitizer (PS) nanoassemblies that allow enhanced delivery and controllable release of PSs are promising for imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumors. However, the lack of high&#8208;sensitivity and spatial&#8208;resolution signals and fast washout of released PSs from tumor tissues have impeded PDT efficacy in vivo.

NP&#8208;RGD  show high  r  1  relaxivity but quenched fluorescence and PDT activity; disulfide reduction by glutathione (GSH) promotes efficient disassembly into small&#8208;molecule probe (  2&#8208;RGD  ) and organic PS (PPa&#8208;SH), which could further bind with intracellular albumin, allowing (1) prolonged retention and (2) cascade activation of fluorescence and PDT activity to ablate tumors.

      <title>Size&#8208;dependent Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts for selective CO2 reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle by converting CO  2  into reusable chemicals is recognized as an attractive solution to mitigate rising concentrations of CO  2  in the atmosphere. Herein, we prepared Ni metal catalysts ranging in size from single atoms to over 100 nm and distributed them across N&#8208;doped carbon substrates obtained from converted zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF). Results show variance in CO  2  reduction performance with variance in Ni metal size. Ni single atoms demonstrate a superior Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO selectivity of ~97% at &#8722;0.8 V  vs.  RHE, while results for 4.1 nm Ni nanoparticles are slightly lower (~93%). Further increase the particle size to 37.2 nm in Ni allows the H  2  evolution reaction (HER) to compete with CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR), with a FE towards CO production decrease to &lt; 30% and HER efficiency increase to &gt; 70%. These results uncover a size&#8208;dependent tendency towards CO  2  reduction for various sizes of Ni metal catalysts. The successful demonstration of metal size effects towards CO  2  RR resulting from this study will not only benefit renewable utilization for CO  2  , but also guide the future design of size&#8208;controlled electrocatalysts for efficient conversion of CO  2  into more useful chemicals.</dc:description>

      <title>Replacement of the Cobalt&#8208;Center of Vitamin B12 by Nickel &#8208; 

Nibalamin and Nibyric Acid Prepared from Metal&#8208;Free B12&#8208;Ligands Hydrogenobalamin and Hydrogenobyric Acid</title>
      <dc:description>The (formal) replacement of the cobalt&#8208;centre in cobalamin (Cbl) by a Ni(II) generates nibalamin (Nibl), a new type of transition metal analogue of vitamin B12. Here, we describe Nibl, synthesized by incorporation of a Ni(II)&#8208;ion into the complete metal&#8208;free B12&#8208;ligand hydrogenobalamin (Hbl), which was prepared from hydrogenobyric acid (Hby). The related Ni(II)&#8208;corrin nibyric acid (Niby) was similarly synthesized from Hby, the metal&#8208;free cobyric acid ligand. The solution structures of Hbl, as well as of the Ni&#8208;corrins Niby and Nibl, were characterized by detailed spectroscopic studies that included heteronuclear NMR. The metal&#8208;free corrin Hbl featured two inner protons bound at N2 and at N4 of the corrin ligand, as discovered in Hby. An X&#8208;ray analysis of single crystals of Niby provided detailed insights into both the structural adaptation of the natural corrin ligand to Ni(II)&#8208;ions and the coordination behavior of Ni(II) when corrin&#8208;bound. The diamagnetic d8&#8208;metal corrins Niby and Nibl, and corresponding iso&#8208;electronic Co(I)&#8208;corrins, were deduced to be closely iso&#8208;structural from DFT&#8208;calculated models. Nibl represents a specific new structural mimic of 4&#8208;coordinate base&#8208;off Cbls, a conclusion verified by its ability to act as a strong inhibitor of the bacterial adenosyltransferase (BtuR), which mediates its reaction through such an intermediate.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The (formal) replacement of the cobalt&#8208;centre in cobalamin (Cbl) by a Ni(II) generates nibalamin (Nibl), a new type of transition metal analogue of vitamin B12. Here, we describe Nibl, synthesized by incorporation of a Ni(II)&#8208;ion into the complete metal&#8208;free B12&#8208;ligand hydrogenobalamin (Hbl), which was prepared from hydrogenobyric acid (Hby). The related Ni(II)&#8208;corrin nibyric acid (Niby) was similarly synthesized from Hby, the metal&#8208;free cobyric acid ligand. The solution structures of Hbl, as well as of the Ni&#8208;corrins Niby and Nibl, were characterized by detailed spectroscopic studies that included heteronuclear NMR. The metal&#8208;free corrin Hbl featured two inner protons bound at N2 and at N4 of the corrin ligand, as discovered in Hby. An X&#8208;ray analysis of single crystals of Niby provided detailed insights into both the structural adaptation of the natural corrin ligand to Ni(II)&#8208;ions and the coordination behavior of Ni(II) when corrin&#8208;bound. The diamagnetic d8&#8208;metal corrins Niby and Nibl, and corresponding iso&#8208;electronic Co(I)&#8208;corrins, were deduced to be closely iso&#8208;structural from DFT&#8208;calculated models. Nibl represents a specific new structural mimic of 4&#8208;coordinate base&#8208;off Cbls, a conclusion verified by its ability to act as a strong inhibitor of the bacterial adenosyltransferase (BtuR), which mediates its reaction through such an intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Light Induced Self&#8208;Escape of Spherical Nucleic Acid from Endo/Lysosome for Efficient Non&#8208;Cationic Gene Delivery</title>
      <dc:description>Developing non&#8208;cationic gene carrier and achieving efficient endo/lysosome escape of functional nucleic acids in cytosol are two major challenges faced by the field of gene delivery. Herein, we demonstrate a concept of self&#8208;escape spherical nucleic acid (SNA) to achieve light controlled non&#8208;cationic gene delivery with sufficient endo/lysosome escape capacity. In this system, Bcl&#8208;2 antisense oligonucleotides (OSAs) were conjugated onto the surface of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer (PS) nanoparticles to form core&#8208;shell SNAs. Once the SNAs were uptaken by tumor cells, upon light irradiation, the accumulative  1  O  2  produced by AIE PSs could rupture the lysosome structure to promote OSA escape. Prominent in vitro and in vivo results validated that the AIE based core&#8208;shell SNAs could remarkably downregulate the anti&#8208;apoptosis protein (Bcl&#8208;2) and induce tumor cell apoptosis without any transfection reagent.</dc:description>

      <title>Molten Salt Assisted Synthesis of Bismuth Nanosheets for Long&#8208;term Continuously Electrocatalytic Conversion CO2 to Formate</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monometallic pnictogens (antimony or Sb, and bismuth or Bi) nanosheets, thanks to their unique physical&#8208;chemical, electronic and optical properties, show great potential for applications in a variety of fields including quantum devices, catalysis, biomedical, and energy, while the development of general and high&#8208;efficiency route for preparation of high&#8208;quality pnictogens nanosheets remains a challenge yet. In this work, we report a general method for the synthesis of Sb and Bi nanosheets in high yields (&gt; 90%), which is implemented by molten salts&#8208;assisted aluminothermic reduction process. The electrocatalytic properties toward CO  2  reduction are systematically studied on bismuth nanosheets, which shows high catalytic selectively to reduce CO  2  to formate with a considerable current density at a low overpotential, and holds quite impressive stability over one&#8208;month catalysis operation. The theory calculations suggest that the edge sites of Bi are far more active than terrace sites based on its lowest thermodynamic barrier. We further demonstrate the Bi nanosheets hold the ultrahigh catalytic stability for continuously conversion of CO  2  into formate with a yield rate of 787.5 mmol cm  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  in a flow cell upon one&#8208;month running. The present study shed light on a promising route to facilely prepare monometallic nanosheets and a system&#8208;engineering strategy for sustainable conversion of CO  2  into valuable chemicals by virtue of the highly desirable catalytic selectivity and stability of Bi nanosheets.</dc:description>

      <title>Facile Synthesis of Sub&#8208;Nanometric Cu Clusters via a Double&#8208;Confinement Enables Selective Reduction of Carbon Dioxide towards Methane</title>
      <dc:description>Previous density functional theory (DFT) calculations have fully proven that the sub&#8208;nanometric Cu clusters (i.e., 13 atoms) are more favorable for the generation of CH  4  from CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) than larger nanoparticles (NPs) due to the upshifted d center. However, it still lacks direct experimental evidence and remains unclear. Herein, we developed a facile impregnation&#8208;calcination route for the crafting of Cu clusters in diameter of ~1.0 nm with ~10 atoms via a double&#8208;confinement of carbon defects and micropores. The obtained Cu clusters enable a high selectivity for the CO  2  RR with a maximum Faraday efficiency of 81.7% towards CH  4  . Both DFT calculations and experimental results reveal that the Cu clusters can enhance the adsorption strength of *H and *CO intermediates and thus promotes the generation of CH  4  other than H  2  and CO, compared with larger Cu nanoparticles (~19 nm). Moreover, the strong interaction between Cu clusters and defective carbon optimizes the electronic structures of Cu clusters for further enhancing the selectivity and stability towards generation of CH  4  . Clearly, this work provides the first experimental evidence that the sub&#8208;nanometric Cu clusters indeed facilitate the production of CH  4  from CO  2  RR.</dc:description>

      <title>Novel strategy for synthesis of ultra&#8208;stable single&#8208;site Mo&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>The current energy transition presents many technological challenges, such as the development of highly stable catalysts. Herein, we report a novel &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; synthesis approach for preparation of a single&#8208;site Mo&#8208;containing nanosized ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite possessing atomically dispersed framework&#8208;molybdenum homogenously distributed through the zeolite crystals. The introduction of Mo heals most of the native point defects in the zeolite structure resulting in an extremely stable material. The important features of this single&#8208;site Mo&#8208;containing ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite are provided by an in&#8208;depth spectroscopic and microscopic analysis. The material demonstrates superior thermal (up to 1000 &#176;C), hydrothermal (steaming), and catalytic (converting methane to hydrogen and higher hydrocarbons) stability, maintaining the atomically disperse Mo, structural integrity of the zeolite, and preventing the formation of silanols.</dc:description>

The introduction of Mo heals most of the native point defects in the zeolite structure resulting in an extremely stable material. The important features of this single&#8208;site Mo&#8208;containing ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite are provided by an in&#8208;depth spectroscopic and microscopic analysis. The material demonstrates superior thermal (up to 1000 &#176;C), hydrothermal (steaming), and catalytic (converting methane to hydrogen and higher hydrocarbons) stability, maintaining the atomically disperse Mo, structural integrity of the zeolite, and preventing the formation of silanols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Advancing nanomedicine with cross&#8208;link functionalized nanoparticles for rapid excretion</title>
      <dc:description>Nanoparticles have been widely investigated for preclinical animal models as imaging, therapeutic or theranostic agent. However, a very limited number of nanoscale materials are approved for human use due to retention and toxicity concerns. Recent years have seen in vivo fluorescence imaging in the long end of the second near infrared window (NIR&#8208;IIb, 1,500&#8208;1,700 nm), affording deeper tissue penetration and higher imaging clarity owing to reduced light scattering and near&#8208;zero autofluorescence. Most NIR&#8208;IIb fluorophores are nanoparticle based probes with long retention&#160;in the body. Here, we applied a novel cross&#8208;linked coating to functionalize core/shell lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide quantum dots (PbS/CdS QDs) emitting at ~1,600 nm. The coating was comprised of an amphiphilic polymer followed by three crosslinked amphiphilic polymeric layers (branched PEG&#8208;linear PAA&#8208;branched PEG, P  3  coating), imparting high biocompatibility and &gt; 90% excretion of QDs within 2 weeks of intravenous administration. The P  3  &#8208;QDs were utilized for conjugation to an engineered anti&#8208;CD8 diabody to afford in vivo molecular imaging of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in response to anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 therapy. Two&#8208;plex molecular imaging in combination with down&#8208;conversion Er nanoparticles was performed for real&#8208;time in vivo monitoring of PD&#8208;L1+&#160;tumor cells and CD8+&#160;CTLs&#160;with cellular resolution by non&#8208;invasive NIR&#8208;IIb light sheet microscopy (LSM). In another application, angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment was imaged with P  3  &#8208;QDs conjugated to TRC105, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD105. Further, P  3  &#8208;QDs afforded imaging of lymph nodes deep in the body with a signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio of up to ~170. Lastly, we show that the P  3  coating on magnetic nanoparticles also afforded rapid excretion in &lt; 2 weeks, establishing generality of the approach. The ability of eliminating various nanoparticles from a body opens up many possibilities of nanomedicine for human use.</dc:description>

      <title>A Direct Mapping Approach to Understand Carrier Relaxation Dynamics in Varied Regions of a Polycrystalline Perovskite Film</title>
      <dc:description>We developed a direct mapping approach to overlay the image of a polycrystalline perovskite film obtained from the transient absorption microscope (TAM) with that from the scanning electron microscope (SEM). By mapping these imaging data pixel by pixel, we are able to observe the relaxation dynamics of the photo&#8208;generated charge carriers on varied regions of the film. The carrier relaxation dynamics contain a dominated single&#8208;exponential decay component due to the recombination of charge carriers. We found that the lifetime distribution of charge recombination shows a bimodal feature, for which the rapid and slow distributions are assigned as free and trapped carriers, respectively. The charge recombination was slower in the grain boundary (GB) region than in the grain interior (GI) region. The small grains have longer lifetimes than the large grains for the crystal size smaller than 500 nm. Our results thus indicate that GB with retarded charge recombination might play a positive role in a perovskite solar cell.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Abstract: Designing deep&#8208;Ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals is of the current research interests but faces a great challenge. In order to overcome the problem of crystal growth and the toxicity of BeO raw materials in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), the only applicable DUV NLO crystal so far, we substitute Be2+ cations with Zn2+ in the KBBF structure and modify the halogen anions, by which three new Zn&#8208;containing KBBF&#8208;like compounds, CsZn2BO3X2 (X = F, Cl and F&amp;Cl), have been successfully synthesized. They all exhibit excellent NLO properties, including improved SHG responses (2.8&#8208;3.5 &#215; KDP) and short UV cut&#8208;off edges (&lt;190 nm). In comparison with KBBF, CsZn2BO3X2 (X = F, Cl and F&amp;Cl) are all chemically benign and have better growth habits, so they are all promising as the DUV NLO crystals. The further study on the structure&#8208;property relationship indicates that the mixing of halogen anions is a feasible strategy to enhance the SHG responses of the KBBF family.</dc:description>

      <title>Evanescent Wave&#8208;guided Growth of Organic Supramolecular Nanowire Array</title>
      <dc:description>Ordered assembly of molecules within a specific space of nanoscale, such as surface, holds great promise in advanced micro&#8208;/nanostructure fabrication for various applications. Herein, we demonstrated the evanescent wave (EW)&#8208;guided organization of small molecules into long&#8208;range ordered nanowire (NW) array.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ordered assembly of molecules within a specific space of nanoscale, such as surface, holds great promise in advanced micro&#8208;/nanostructure fabrication for various applications. Herein, we demonstrated the evanescent wave (EW)&#8208;guided organization of small molecules into long&#8208;range ordered nanowire (NW) array. Experiment and simulation revealed that the orientation and periodicity of the NW array were feasibly regulated by altering the propagation direction and the wavelength of EW, respectively. The generality of this approach was further demonstrated by using different molecule precursors.

      <title>Biosynthesis of Indole Diterpene Lolitrems: Radical&#8208;Induced Cyclization of an Epoxyalcohol Affording a Characteristic Lolitremane Skeleton</title>
      <dc:description>Lolitrems  are tremorgenic indole diterpenes that exhibit a unique 5/6 bicyclic system of the indole&#160; moiety. Although genetic analysis has indicated that prenyltransferase LtmE and cytochrome P450 LtmJ are involved in the construction of this unique structure, the detailed mechanism remains to be elucidated. Herein, we reconstitute the biosynthetic pathway for lolitrems employing a recently established genome&#8208;editing technique for the expression host Aspergillus oryzae. Heterologous expression and bioconversion of the various intermediates revealed that LtmJ catalyzes multistep oxidation to furnish the lolitrem core. We also isolated the key reaction intermediate with an epoxyalcohol moiety. This observation allowed us to establish the mechanism of radical&#8208;induced cyclization, which was firmly supported by density functional theory calculations and a model experiment with a synthetic analog.</dc:description>

      <title>Electroreduction of CO2 to Formate with low overpotential using Cobalt Pyridine Thiolate Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added products provides a viable alternative to the use of carbon sources derived from fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the ability to carry out these transformations at reasonable energetic costs, e.g. with low overpotential, remains a significant challenge.

To this end, we investigated here a series of cheap cobalt(III) pyridine&#8208;thiolate complexes as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. The effect of the ligands and proton sources on activity was examined.

      <title>Chiral cyclopentadienyl ligands: design, syntheses and applications in asymmetric catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The creation of new chiral ligands capable of providing high stereocontrol in metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions is crucial in modern organic synthesis. The production of bioactive molecules as single enantiomers is increasingly required, and asymmetric catalysis with metal complexes constitutes one of the most efficient synthetic strategies to access optically active compounds. Herein we offer a historical overview on the development of chiral derivatives of the ubiquitous cyclopentadienyl ligand (Cp  X  ), and detail their successful application in a broad range of metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations. Those include the functionalization of challenging C&#8211;H bonds and beyond, giving access to an extensive catalogue of valuable chiral molecules. A critical comparison of the existing ligand families, their design, synthesis and complexation to different metals is also provided. In addition, future research directions are discussed to further enhance the performance and application of Cp  X  ligands in enantioselective catalysis.</dc:description>

Those include the functionalization of challenging C&#8211;H bonds and beyond, giving access to an extensive catalogue of valuable chiral molecules. A critical comparison of the existing ligand families, their design, synthesis and complexation to different metals is also provided. In addition, future research directions are discussed to further enhance the performance and application of Cp  X  ligands in enantioselective catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Polarization Effect in Surface Plasmon&#8208;Induced Photocatalysis on Au/TiO2 Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling the interaction of polarization light with an asymmetric nanostructure such as a metal/semiconductor heterostructure provides opportunities for tuning the surface plasmon excitation and near&#8208;field spatial distribution. However, the effects of light polarization on interfacial charge transport and consequently the photocatalysis of plasmonic metal/semiconductor photocatalysts, remain unclear.

We also quantitatively uncover the relationship between the local charge density and polarization angle by investigating the polarization&#8208;dependent surface photovoltage (SPV).

      <title>Cationic Lipid&#8208;based Intracellular Delivery of Bacterial Effectors for Rewiring Malignant Cell Signaling</title>

      <title>Ambient Chemical Fixation of CO2 Using a Robust Ag27 Cluster&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>Coinage metals (Cu, Ag, Au)&#8208;based catalysts have been widely used in organic synthesis chemistry, however, robust and  heterogeneous silver&#8208;based catalysts are hard to access due to its high photosensitivity and chemical instability. Herein, the unprecedented double S  2  &#8722;  templated Ag  27  clusters have been stabilized by 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin (TPyP&#8208;H  2  ) ligands to afford a robust 2D metal&#8208;organic framework (  Ag27&#8208;MOF  ). This silver cluster&#8208;assembled material serves as a highly efficient (TON &gt; 1000) heterogeneous catalyst for the cyclization of both terminal and internal propargylamines with CO  2  under atmospheric pressure. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the high catalytic activity and broad substrate scope are attributable to the saddle&#8208;shaped metallic node in  Ag27&#8208;MOF  , which features an accessible platform with high&#8208;density silver atoms as  &#960;  &#8208;Lewis acid sites for activating C&#8801;C triple bonds. As a result, different sterically hindered alkyne substrates can be effectively activated through &#960;&#8208;interactions with these cationic silver centers.

The new species exhibit strong &#960;&#8208;accepting/&#963;&#8208;donating properties and are able to ligate two metal centres simultaneously. The redox activity was demonstrated by the reversible chemical oxidation of a heterobimetallic Fe  0  /Rh  I  example, which affords an isolable ligand&#8208;based radical cation. The reversible redox process was then applied in the catalytic hydrosilylation of 4,4&#8217;&#8208;difluorobenzophenone, where the reaction rate could be reversibly controlled as a function of the catalyst oxidation state. The new NHC exhibits high electrophilicity and nucleophilicity, which was demonstrated in the reversible activation of alcohols and amines. The electronic structure of the resulting complexes was investigated through various spectroscopic and computational methods.</dc:description>

      <title>Photorelease of Pyridines Using the Metal&#8208;free Photoremovable Protecting Group</title>
      <dc:description>Photorelease of bioactive molecules has emerged as a valuable tool in biochemistry. Nevertheless, many important bioactive molecules, such as pyridine derivatives&#65292;cannot benefit from currently available organic photoremovable protecting groups (PPGs). We found that inefficient photorelease of pyridines is attributed to intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from PPGs to pyridiniums. To alleviate PET, we rationally designed a strategy to drive excited state of PPG from S  1  to T  1  with heavy atom, and synthesized a new PPG by substitution of atom H at 3&#8208;position of 7&#8208;Dietheylamino&#8208;coumarin&#8208;4&#8208;methyl (  DEACM  ) with Br or I. This resulted in an improved photolytic efficiency of the pyridinium with hundreds of times in water solution. The PPG can be applied to various pyridine derivatives. The successful photorelease of a microtubule inhibitor, indibulin, in living cells was demonstrated for the potential application of this strategy in biochemical research.</dc:description>

      <title>Meta Junction Promoting Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>The meta junction is proposed to realize efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated polymers. Based on triphenylamine as D and dicyanobenzene as A, as a proof of concept, a series of D&#8208;A conjugated polymers has been developed by changing their connection sites. When the junction between D and A is tuned from para to meta, the singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting (&#8710;  E  ST  ) is found to be significantly decreased from 0.44 to 0.10 eV because of the increasing hole&#8208;electron separation. Unlike the para&#8208;linked analogue with no TADF, consequently, the meta&#8208;linked polymer shows a strong delayed fluorescence. Its corresponding solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) achieve a promising external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.4% (51.9 cd A  &#8208;1  , 50.9 lm W  &#8208;1  ) and Commission Internationale de l&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.34, 0.57). The results first highlight the bright future of D&#8208;A conjugated polymers used for TADF OLEDs.</dc:description>

      <title>An electrochemical biosensor architecture leveraging protein folding and supporting real&#8208;time measurements directly in whole blood</title>
      <dc:description>The ability to monitor drug and biomarker concentrations in the body with high frequency and in real time would revolutionize our understanding of biology and our capacity to personalize medicine. The few in&#8208;vivo molecular sensors that currently exist, however, all rely on the specific chemical or enzymatic reactivity of their targets and thus are not generalizable. In response, we demonstrate here an electrochemical sensing architecture based on binding&#8208;induced protein folding that is (1) independent of the reactivity of its targets, (2) reagentless, real&#8208;time, and seconds&#8208;resolved, and (3) selective enough to deploy in undiluted bodily fluids. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle we&#160;use&#160;the&#160;SH3 domain from human Fyn kinase&#160;to build a sensor that discriminates between the protein&#8217;s peptide targets and responds rapidly and quantitatively even in when challenged in whole blood. The resulting sensor architecture could drastically expand the chemical space accessible to continuous, real&#8208;time biosensors.</dc:description>
