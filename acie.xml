         <title>A Terminal Imido Complex of an Iron&#8211;Sulfur Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and characterization of the first terminal imido complex of an Fe&#8211;S cluster, (IMes)3Fe4S4=NDipp (2; IMes = 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphen&#173;yl), which is generated by oxidative group transfer from DippN3&#160;to the all&#8208;ferrous cluster (IMes)3Fe4S4(PPh3). This two&#8208;electron process is achieved by formal one&#8208;electron oxidation of the imido&#8208;bound Fe site and one&#8208;electron oxidation of two IMes&#8208;bound Fe sites. Structural, spectroscopic, and computational studies establish that the Fe&#8211;imido site is best described as a high&#8208;spin Fe3+&#160;center, which is reflected in its long Fe&#8211;N(imido) distance of 1.763(2)&#160;&#197;. Cluster&#160;2&#160;abstracts hydrogen atoms from 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene to yield the corresponding anilido complex, demonstrating competency for C&#8211;H activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Atom Pd Nanozyme for Ferroptosis&#8208;Boosted Mild&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal therapy (PTT) is extremely promising tumor therapeutic modality. However, excessive heat inevitably injures normal tissues nearby tumors, and the cancer cells damage caused by mild hyperthermia is easily repaired by stress&#8208;induced heat shock proteins (HSPs). Thus, maximizing the PTT efficiency and minimizing healthy tissues damage simultaneously by adopting appropriate therapeutic temperature is imperative. Herein, an innovative strategy is firstly reported of ferroptosis&#8208;boosted mild PTT based on single atom nanozyme (SAzyme). The Pd SAzyme with atom&#8208;economic utilization of the catalytic centers exhibits peroxidase (POD) and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx) mimic enzyme activities, and photothermal conversion performance, which can result in ferroptosis featuring the up&#8208;regulation of lipid peroxides (LPO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The accumulation of LPO and ROS provides a powerful approach for cleaving HSPs, which enables Pd SAzyme&#8208;mediated mild&#8208;temperature PTT.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aromatic Oligomer Micelle: Large Enthalpic Stabilization and Selective&#160;Oligothiophene Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An aromatic oligomer micelle, featuring both&#160;  high stability  and&#160;  high uptake ability  , was quantitatively formed in water from amphiphilic oligomers,&#160;composed of three bent polyaromatic amphiphiles connected alternately by two hydrophilic chains. The well&#8208;defined micelle, with a diameter of ~2 nm,&#160;remains intact even under highly diluted conditions (~3 &#956;M) and at elevated temperature (&gt;130 &#186;C), due to the polyaromatic chelate effect. The&#160;thermodynamic studies reveal that large enthalpic gain (  &#916; H&#160;  =&#160;&#8211;110 kJ mol  &#8211;1  ) is the key for the micelle formation. The oligomer micelle selectively encapsulates unsubstituted oligothiophenes (&#8805;4&#8208;mer) to a high degree and the resultant, aqueous host&#8208;guest complexes display unusual emission derived from the multiply stacked oligomers. Furthermore, facile uptake and release of unsubstituted polythiophenes can be achieved using the oligomer micelle.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid Electrolyte Interphase Design for Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn batteries are challenged by water decomposition and dendrite growth due to the absence of a dense Zn&#8208;ion conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we design a low&#8208;concentration aqueous Zn(OTF)2&#8208;Zn(NO3)2  electrolyte to in situ form a robust inorganic ZnF2&#8208;Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6&#8208;organic bi&#8208;layer SEI where the inorganic inner layer promotes Zn&#8208;ion diffusion while the organic outer layer suppresses water penetration. Comprehensive characterization reveals that insulating Zn5(OH)8(NO3)2&#183;2H2O layer is first formed on Zn anode surface by self&#8208;terminated chemical reaction of NO3&#8208;  with Zn2+  and OH&#8208;  generated via HER, and then it transforms into Zn&#8208;ion conducting Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6  which in&#8208;turn promots ZnF2  formation as the inner layer. The organic dominated outer layer is formed by the reduction of OTF&#8208;  . The in situ formed SEI enables a high Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.8% for 200 h in Ti||Zn cells, and a high energy density (168&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8211;1  ) with 96.5% retention for 700 cycles in Zn||MnO2  cells with a low Zn/MnO2  capacity ratio of 2:1.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Contrast Fluorescence Diagnosis of Cancer Cells/Tissues Based on &#946;&#8208;Lapachone&#8208;Triggered ROS Amplification Specific in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discrimination of cancer cells/tissues from normal ones is of critical importance for early diagnosis and treatment of cancers. Herein, we present a new strategy for high&#8208;contrast fluorescence diagnosis of cancer cells/tissues based on b&#8208;Lapachone (b&#8208;Lap, an anticancer agent) triggered ROS (reactive oxygen species) amplification specific in cancer cells/tissues. With the strategy, a wide range of cancer cells/tissues, including surgical tissue specimens harvested from patients, were distinguished from normal ones by using a combination of b&#8208;Lap and a Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based NIR fluorescent ROS probe  PSiR3  developed in this work with average tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) ratios up to 15 in cell level and 24 in tissue level, far exceeding the  clinically acceptable threshold of 2.0  .  What&#8217;s more  , the strategy allowed the fluorescence discrimination of tumor tissues from inflammatory ones based on whether a marked fluorescence enhancement could be induced when treated with  PSiR3  and b&#8208;Lap/  PSiR3  combination, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Vapochromism and Magnetochemical Switching of a Ni(II) Paddlewheel Complex by Reversible NH3 Uptake and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of [NiCl  2  (  PnH  )  4  ] (  1  ) (  PnH  = 6&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;pyridazine&#8208;3&#8208;thione) with NiCl  2  affords the binuclear paddlewheel (PW) complex [Ni  2  (  Pn  )  4  ] (  2  ). Diamagnetic complex  2  is the first example of a PW complex capable of reversibly binding and releasing NH  3  . The NH  3  ligand in [Ni  2  (  Pn  )  4  (NH  3  )] (  2  &#183;NH  3  ) enforces major spectroscopic and magnetic susceptibility changes, thus displaying vapochromic properties (&#955;  max  (  2  ) = 532 nm, &#955;  max  (  2  &#183;NH  3  ) = 518 nm) and magnetochemical switching (  2  : S&#160;= 0;  2  &#183;NH  3  : S&#160;= 1). Upon repeated adsorption/desorption cycles of NH  3  the PW core remains intact. Compound  2  can be embedded into thin polyurethane films (  2  P  ) under retention of its sensing abilities. Therefore,  2  qualifies as reversible optical probe for ammonia. The magnetochemical switching of  2  and  2  &#183;NH  3  was studied in detail by SQUID measurements showing that in  2  &#183;NH  3  , solely the Ni atom coordinated the NH  3  molecule is responsible for the paramagnetic behavior.</dc:description>

The magnetochemical switching of  2  and  2  &#183;NH  3  was studied in detail by SQUID measurements showing that in  2  &#183;NH  3  , solely the Ni atom coordinated the NH  3  molecule is responsible for the paramagnetic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrating concentration gradient generator and single&#8208;cell trapper array for high&#8208;throughput screening bioeffects of nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The need of generating nanomaterial gradients is increasing. However, the previously reported gradient generators may lead to the aggregation or uneven dilution of nanomaterials, which will inevitably hinder their applications. To address this issue, we herein develop a concentration gradient generator (CGG) on a microfluidic chip for diluting different nanoparticles. Specifically designed compact disk (CD)&#8208;shaped microchannels in the CGG module could thoroughly mix the flowing solutions and generate linear concentration gradient of nanoparticles without aggregation. We combine the CGG with a single&#8208;cell trapper array (SCA) on microfluidics to evaluate the concentration&#8208;dependent bioeffects of the nanoparticles.  The precise control of the spatiotemporal generation of nanoparticle concentration on the CGG module and the single&#8208;cell&#8208;level monitoring of the cell behaviors on the SCA module by a high&#8208;content system in real&#8208;time,  render  the CGG&#8208;SCA system a highly precise platform, which can exclude the average effect of cell population and reflect the response of individual cells to the gradient concentrations accurately. In addition, the CGG&#8208;SCA system provides an automated platform for high&#8208;throughput screening of nanomedicines with high precision and low sample consumption.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Prebiotic Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Threofuranosyl Cytidine by Photochemical Anomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TNA cytidine, a candidate precursor to RNA cytidine at the origin of life, is synthesized from prebiotic precursors via a high&#8208;yielding, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective, protecting&#8208;group free synthesis utilizing an efficient photochemical anomerization. Phosphorylation also enables selective photodestruction of the contaminating erythro&#8208;diastereomer enriching any potential pool of TNA monomers.







Abstract
The structure of life's first genetic polymer is a question of intense ongoing debate. The &#8220;RNA world theory&#8221; suggests RNA was life's first nucleic acid. However, ribonucleotides are complex chemical structures, and simpler nucleic acids, such as threose nucleic acid (TNA), can carry genetic information. In principle, nucleic acids like TNA could have played a vital role in the origins of life. The advent of any genetic polymer in life requires synthesis of its monomers. Here we demonstrate a high&#8208;yielding, stereo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and furanosyl&#8208;selective prebiotic synthesis of threo&#8208;cytidine 3, an essential component of TNA. Our synthesis uses key intermediates and reactions previously exploited in the prebiotic synthesis of the canonical pyrimidine ribonucleoside cytidine 1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that erythro&#8208;specific 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic phosphate synthesis provides a mechanism to photochemically select TNA cytidine. These results suggest that TNA may have coexisted with RNA during the emergence of life.

         <title>A Rod&#8208;Packing Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Suitable Pore Confinement for Benchmark Ethane/Ethylene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rod&#8208;packing microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonding framework with functional surfaces and suitable cavity spaces for C2H6 uptake exhibited simultaneously high capacity and C2H6/C2H4 selectivity (see picture). The excellent C2H6/C2H4 separation occurred with record&#8208;high C2H4 productivity of 0.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 under high humidity and ambient conditions.







Abstract
For the separation of ethane from ethylene, it remains challenging to target both high C2H6 adsorption and selectivity in a C2H6&#8208;selective material. Herein, we report a reversible solid&#8208;state transformation in a labile hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework to generate a new rod&#8208;packing desolvated framework (ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;1) with suitable cavity spaces and functional surfaces to optimally interact with C2H6. ZJU&#8208;HOF&#8208;1 thus exhibits simultaneously high C2H6 uptake (88&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K) and C2H6/C2H4 selectivity (2.25), which are significantly higher than those of most top&#8208;performing materials. Theoretical calculations revealed that the cage&#8208;like cavities and functional sites synergistically &#8220;match&#8221; better with C2H6 to provide stronger multipoint interactions with C2H6 than C2H4. In combination with its high stability and ultralow water uptake, this material can efficiently capture C2H6 from 50/50 C2H6/C2H4 mixtures in ambient conditions under 60&#8201;% RH, providing a record polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 productivity of 0.98&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Selective Implantation of Diamines for Cooperative Catalysis in Isoreticular Heterometallic Titanium&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different affinity of Ti(IV) and Ca(II) sites to direct selective coordination of amines was used. This enables the combination of Lewis acid and available &#8208;NH2 sites in sizeable pores for cooperative cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides. MUV&#8208;12 displays full conversion of propylene oxide at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in absence of additional co&#8208;catalysts and with excellent cyclability.







Abstract
We introduce the first example of isoreticular titanium&#8211;organic frameworks, MUV&#8208;10 and MUV&#8208;12, to show how the different affinity of hard Ti(IV) and soft Ca(II) metal sites can be used to direct selective grafting of amines. This enables the combination of Lewis acid titanium centers and available &#8208;NH2 sites in two sizeable pores for cooperative cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The selective grafting of molecules to heterometallic clusters adds up to the pool of methodologies available for controlling the positioning and distribution of chemical functions in precise positions of the framework required for definitive control of pore chemistry.

         <title>Opening up the Single&#8208;Cell Toolbox for Microbial Natural Products Research</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New chemistry from single cells: The challenge of studying uncultivated microbes is a significant impediment to efforts to mine the natural world for useful molecules. Single&#8208;cell analysis techniques have achieved significant success in the study of microbial ecology but are only beginning to gain traction in the search for microbial natural products. This review highlights successful implementations and promising techniques for future studies.







Abstract
The diverse microbes that produce natural products represent an important source of novel therapeutics, drug leads, and scientific tools. However, the vast majority have not been grown in axenic culture and are members of complex communities. While meta&#8208;&#8217;omic methods such as metagenomics, &#8208;transcriptomics, and &#8208;proteomics reveal collective molecular features of this &#8220;microbial dark matter&#8221;, the study of individual microbiome members can be challenging. To address these limits, a number of techniques with single&#8208;bacterial resolution have been developed in the last decade and a half. While several of these are embraced by microbial ecologists, there has been less use by researchers interested in mining microbes for natural products. In this review, we discuss the available and emerging techniques for targeted single&#8208;cell analysis with a particular focus on applications to the discovery and study of natural products.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diverse microbes that produce natural products represent an important source of novel therapeutics, drug leads, and scientific tools. However, the vast majority have not been grown in axenic culture and are members of complex communities. While meta&#8208;&#8217;omic methods such as metagenomics, &#8208;transcriptomics, and &#8208;proteomics reveal collective molecular features of this &#8220;microbial dark matter&#8221;, the study of individual microbiome members can be challenging. To address these limits, a number of techniques with single&#8208;bacterial resolution have been developed in the last decade and a half. While several of these are embraced by microbial ecologists, there has been less use by researchers interested in mining microbes for natural products. In this review, we discuss the available and emerging techniques for targeted single&#8208;cell analysis with a particular focus on applications to the discovery and study of natural products.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The interrelated effect of cations and electrolyte pH on the hydrogen evolution reaction on gold electrodes in alkaline media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we study the role of alkali metal cation concentration and electrolyte pH in altering the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at gold (Au) electrodes. We show that at moderately alkaline pH (pH =11), increasing cation concentration significantly enhances the HER activity on Au electrodes (with a reaction order ~0.5). Based on these results we suggest that cations play a central role in stabilizing the transition state of the rate&#8208;determining Volmer step by favorably interacting with the dissociating water molecule (*H&#8208;&#8208;OH  &#948;&#8208;  &#8208;&#8208;cat  +  ). Moreover, we show that increasing electrolyte pH (pH 10 to pH 13) tunes the local field strength which in turn indirectly enhances the activity of HER by tuning the near&#8208;surface cation concentration. Interestingly, a too high near&#8208;surface cation concentration (at high pH and high cation concentration) leads to a lowering of the HER activity, which we ascribe to a blockage of the surface by near&#8208;surface cations.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Core&#8208;shell Gold Nanoparticles and Controllable Assemblies for SERS Ratiometric Detection of MicroRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their unique optical properties that depend on shape, morphology, and orientation, diverse plasmonic nanostructures have been the focus of vigorous development and study. Herein, we present a series of Janus nanogap gold nanoparticles (JAuNNPs) with varying proportions of Au shell coverage of approximately 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%. The internal nanogap between the partial Au shell and core caused asymmetric optical behavior, in addition to their tunability being highly dependent on the degree of Au shell coverage and structural asymmetry. Importantly, the &#8220;shell&#8208;to&#8208;shell&#8221; or &#8220;core&#8208;to&#8208;core&#8221; JAuNNDs(50%) were self&#8208;assembled from amphiphilic JAuNNPs(50%) merely by tuning the hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer brushes on the Au core or shell. The positions of electromagnetic field enhancement of JAuNNDs varied with geometrical configurations because of hybridized plasmonic coupling effects based on the calculation results. Furthermore, DNA linkers were utilized to form JAuNND  12  (50%). By combining with Raman molecules, ratiometric SERS signals could be generated, enabling JAuNND  12  (50%) to image the distribution of miR&#8208;21 in living cells and tumors. Consequently, asymmetric JAuNNPs allowed facile conjugation of various linkage molecules to fabricate dimeric nanostructures, representing powerful SERS ratiometric nanoprobes for biosensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Primed Native Chemical Ligation Produces Autoinducing Cyclopeptides in Clostridia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The genome&#8208;guided discovery of an autoinducing peptide (AIP) that controls endospore formation in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum is reported. A combination of chemical synthesis and chemical complementation assays with a mutant strain reveals that the genuine chemical mediator is a homodetic cyclopeptide (cAIP).







Abstract
Clostridia coordinate many important processes such as toxin production, infection, and survival by density&#8208;dependent communication (quorum sensing) using autoinducing peptides (AIPs). Although clostridial AIPs have been proposed to be (thio)lactone&#8208;containing peptides, their true structures remain elusive. Here, we report the genome&#8208;guided discovery of an AIP that controls endospore formation in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum. Through a combination of chemical synthesis and chemical complementation assays with a mutant strain, we reveal that the genuine chemical mediator is a homodetic cyclopeptide (cAIP). Kinetic analyses indicate that the mature cAIP is produced via a cryptic thiolactone intermediate that undergoes a rapid S&#8594;N acyl shift, in a manner similar to intramolecular native chemical ligation (NCL). Finally, by implementing a chemical probe in a targeted screen, we show that this novel enzyme&#8208;primed, intramolecular NCL is a widespread feature of clostridial AIP biosynthesis.

         <title>ReI Tricarbonyl Complexes as Coordinate Covalent Inhibitors for the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Cysteine Protease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8212;coronavirus 2 has impacted the life quality and cost hundreds&#8208;of&#8208;thousands of lives worldwide. Herein, a novel approach using ReI tricarbonyl complexes as coordinate covalent inhibitors for the main protease is presented. These complexes target the active site cysteine residue and show selective inhibition of the main protease over several human proteases.







Abstract
Since its outbreak, the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8212;coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has impacted the quality of life and cost hundreds&#8208;of&#8208;thousands of lives worldwide. Based on its global spread and mortality, there is an urgent need for novel treatments which can combat this disease. To date, the 3&#8208;chymotrypsin&#8208;like protease (3CLpro), which is also known as the main protease, is considered among the most important pharmacological targets. The vast majority of investigated 3CLpro inhibitors are organic, non&#8208;covalent binders. Herein, the use of inorganic, coordinate covalent binders is proposed that can attenuate the activity of the protease. ReI tricarbonyl complexes were identified that demonstrate coordinate covalent enzymatic inhibition of 3CLpro. Preliminary studies indicate the selective inhibition of 3CLpro over several human proteases. This study presents the first example of metal complexes as inhibitors for the 3CLpro cysteine protease.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Selective Photopolymerization of Hybrid Acrylate&#8208;Oxetane Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wavelength&#8208;selective photopolymerization process of a hybrid acrylate&#8208;oxetane cholesteric liquid crystal monomer mixture was developed. Control over the sequence and rate of both polymerizations allows for control over phase separation within the interpenetrating network structure. The structurally colored cholesteric coatings could be used to monitor the phase separation.







Abstract
We report on the wavelength&#8208;selective photopolymerization of a hybrid acrylate&#8208;oxetane cholesteric liquid crystal monomer mixture. By controlling the sequence and rate of the orthogonal free&#8208;radical and cationic photopolymerization reactions, it is possible to control the degree of phase separation in the resulting liquid crystal interpenetrating networks. We show that this can be used to tune the reflective color of the structurally colored coatings produced. Conversely, the structural color can be used to monitor the degree of phase separation. Our new photopolymerization procedure allows for structuring liquid crystal networks in three dimensions, which has great potential for fabricating liquid crystal polymer materials with programmable functional properties.

         <title>Precisely Constructed Silver Active Sites in Gold Nanoclusters for Chemical Fixation of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailor&#8208;made catalytic sites for the chemical fixation of CO2 were achieved by implementing Ag atoms at different levels of liberation in atomically precise Au clusters. Au19Ag4(S&#8208;Adm)15 with a completely open surface Ag site has the best catalytic activity, Au20Ag1(S&#8208;Adm)15 with a partially open Ag site is least efficient, and Au21(S&#8208;Adm)15 without a Ag site exhibits decent catalytic performance.







Abstract
Precise control of the composition and structure of active sites in an atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom fashion remains insuperable for heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Design Strategy to Construct Smart Fluorescent Probes for the Precise Tracking of Senescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a two&#8208;dimensional design strategy to construct smart fluorescent probes for the precise tracking of senescence. Our approach relies on the detection of senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase activity in combination with the monitoring of lysosomal microenvironmental pH since de&#8208;acidification is a unique feature of the lysosomes in senescent cells.







Abstract
The tracking of cellular senescence usually depends on the detection of senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase (SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal). Previous probes for SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal with this purpose only cover a single dimension: the accumulation of this enzyme in lysosomes. However, this is insufficient to determine the destiny of senescence because endogenous &#946;&#8208;gal enriched in lysosomes is not only related to senescence, but also to some other physiological processes. To address this issue, we introduce our fluorescent probes including a second dimension: lysosomal pH, since de&#8208;acidification is a unique feature of the lysosomes in senescent cells. With this novel design, our probes achieved excellent discrimination of SA&#8208;&#946;&#8208;gal from cancer&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;gal, which enables them to track cellular senescence as well as tissue aging more precisely. Our crystal structures of a model enzyme E. coli &#946;&#8208;gal mutant (E537Q) complexed with each probe further revealed the structural basis for probe recognition.

         <title>Honeycomb Carbon Nanofibers: A Superhydrophilic O2&#8208;Entrapping Electrocatalyst Enables Ultrahigh Mass Activity for the Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Honeycomb carbon nanofibers behave as a superb electrocatalyst for selective H2O2 production (97.3&#8201;%) via 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction, capable of attaining an ultrahigh mass activity of 220&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a H2O2 yield rate of 6.37&#8197;mmol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The catalytic mechanism is revealed by in situ Raman analysis and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction has emerged as a promising alternative to the energy&#8208; and waste&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process for distributed H2O2 production. This process, however, suffers from strong competition from the four&#8208;electron pathway leading to low H2O2 selectivity. Herein, we report using a superhydrophilic O2&#8208;entrapping electrocatalyst to enable superb two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction electrocatalysis. The honeycomb carbon nanofibers (HCNFs) are robust and capable of achieving a high H2O2 selectivity of 97.3&#8201;%, much higher than that of its solid carbon nanofiber counterpart. Impressively, this catalyst achieves an ultrahigh mass activity of up to 220&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, surpassing all other catalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. The superhydrophilic porous carbon skeleton with rich oxygenated functional groups facilitates efficient electron transfer and better wetting of the catalyst by the electrolyte, and the interconnected cavities allow for more effective entrapping of the gas bubbles. The catalytic mechanism is further revealed by in situ Raman analysis and density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Mechanochemical Prebiotic Peptide Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of amino acids on the prebiotic Earth, either stemming from endogenous chemical routes or delivered by meteorites, is consensually accepted. In contrast, prebiotically plausible pathways to achieve peptides from inactivated amino acids are still unclear since most oligomerization approaches rely on thermodynamically disfavored reactions in solution. Here, we show that the combination of prebiotically plausible minerals and mechanochemical activation enables the oligomerization of glycine at ambient temperature in the absence of water. Raising the reaction temperature increases the degree of oligomerization concomitantly with the formation of a commonly unwanted cyclic glycine dimer (DKP). However, we show here that DKP is a productive intermediate in the mechanochemical oligomerization of glycine. The findings of this research show that mechanochemical peptide bond formation is a dynamic process that provides alternative routes towards oligopeptides and establishes new synthetic approaches for prebiotic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubling the Stakes: The Promise of Halide Double Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two B sites in combination dictate the properties of halide double perovskites (A2BB&#8242;X6; A=monocation, X=halide). This Minireview gives a brief overview of the rich history of halide double perovskites, highlights key structural and electronic aspects, and describes the current understanding on how to correctly select the B&#8208;site pairs that afford the desired properties.







Abstract
When the stakes are doubled in a wager, a player must correctly place two consecutive bets to win, but the payout is larger. Similarly, two B sites in combination dictate the properties of A2BB&#8242;X6 (A=monocation, X=halide) double perovskites. Correctly picking two B sites is more challenging than picking just one, as in the AIBIIX3 single perovskites, but the options are greater and, we believe, the rewards are higher when the stakes are doubled. In this Minireview, we emphasize fundamental aspects of halide double perovskites to provide a foundation for interested readers to explore this extraordinary class of materials. In particular, we highlight the differences and similarities between double and single perovskites and describe how the double perovskite structure potentially offers greater control over photophysical properties.

         <title>Controlled Ligand Exchange Between Ruthenium Organometallic Cofactor Precursors and a Na&#239;ve Protein Scaffold Generates Artificial Metalloenzymes Catalysing Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium organometallic complex is transformed into an effective transfer hydrogenation catalyst upon exchanging ligands with a na&#239;ve protein. The direct coordination of protein sidechains to the metal is an underutilised feature in artificial metalloenzymes.







Abstract
Many natural metalloenzymes assemble from proteins and biosynthesised complexes, generating potent catalysts by changing metal coordination. Here we adopt the same strategy to generate artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) using ligand exchange to unmask catalytic activity. By systematically testing RuII(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(bipyridine) complexes designed to facilitate the displacement of functionalised bipyridines, we develop a fast and robust procedure for generating new enzymes via ligand exchange in a protein that has not evolved to bind such a complex. The resulting metal cofactors form peptidic coordination bonds but also retain a non&#8208;biological ligand. Tandem mass spectrometry and 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy were used to characterise the organometallic cofactors and identify the protein&#8208;derived ligands. By introduction of ruthenium cofactors into a 4&#8208;helical bundle, transfer hydrogenation catalysts were generated that displayed a 35&#8208;fold rate increase when compared to the respective small molecule reaction in solution.

&lt;p&gt;A ruthenium organometallic complex is transformed into an effective transfer hydrogenation catalyst upon exchanging ligands with a na&#239;ve protein. The direct coordination of protein sidechains to the metal is an underutilised feature in artificial metalloenzymes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many natural metalloenzymes assemble from proteins and biosynthesised complexes, generating potent catalysts by changing metal coordination. Here we adopt the same strategy to generate artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) using ligand exchange to unmask catalytic activity. By systematically testing Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;arene)(bipyridine) complexes designed to facilitate the displacement of functionalised bipyridines, we develop a fast and robust procedure for generating new enzymes via ligand exchange in a protein that has not evolved to bind such a complex. The resulting metal cofactors form peptidic coordination bonds but also retain a non&#8208;biological ligand. Tandem mass spectrometry and &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy were used to characterise the organometallic cofactors and identify the protein&#8208;derived ligands. By introduction of ruthenium cofactors into a 4&#8208;helical bundle, transfer hydrogenation catalysts were generated that displayed a 35&#8208;fold rate increase when compared to the respective small molecule reaction in solution.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Radical&#8208;Pairing Interactions in a Molecular Switch Evidenced by Ion Mobility Spectrometry and Infrared Ion Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;phase non&#8208;dissociative electron transfer is used for charge reduction of a donor&#8208;acceptor oligorotaxane foldamer (green). The consecutive co&#8208;conformational transition is monitored using ion mobility spectrometry and infrared ion spectroscopy. Comparing the collision cross section distributions (blue) and infrared spectra (red) recorded for analogous closed&#8208;shell and radical systems highlights differences that can be attributed to radical&#8208;pairing interactions.







Abstract
The digital revolution sets a milestone in the progressive miniaturization of working devices and in the underlying advent of molecular machines. Foldamers involving mechanically entangled components with modular secondary structures are among the most promising designs for molecular switch&#8208;based applications. Characterizing the nature and dynamics of their intramolecular network following the application of a stimulus is the key to their performance. Here, we use non&#8208;dissociative electron transfer as a reductive stimulus in the gas phase and probe the consecutive co&#8208;conformational transitions of a donor&#8208;acceptor oligorotaxane foldamer using electrospray mass spectrometry interfaced with ion mobility and infrared ion spectroscopy. A comparison of collision cross section distributions for analogous closed&#8208;shell and radical molecular ions sheds light on their respective formation energetics, while variations in their respective infrared absorption bands evidence changes in intramolecular organization as the foldamer becomes more compact. These differences are compatible with the advent of radical&#8208;pairing interactions.

         <title>Selective Inhibition of the Hsp90&#945; Isoform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 90&#8201;kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that processes nascent polypeptides into their biologically active conformations. A structure&#8208;based approach was used to design the first Hsp90&#945;&#8208;selective inhibitors, which exhibit &gt;50&#8208;fold selectivity versus other Hsp90 isoforms.







Abstract
The 90&#8201;kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that processes nascent polypeptides into their biologically active conformations. Many of these proteins contribute to the progression of cancer, and consequently, inhibition of the Hsp90 protein folding machinery represents an innovative approach toward cancer chemotherapy. However, clinical trials with Hsp90 N&#8208;terminal inhibitors have encountered deleterious side effects and toxicities, which appear to result from the pan&#8208;inhibition of all four Hsp90 isoforms. Therefore, the development of isoform&#8208;selective Hsp90 inhibitors is sought to delineate the pathological role played by each isoform. Herein, we describe a structure&#8208;based approach that was used to design the first Hsp90&#945;&#8208;selective inhibitors, which exhibit &gt;50&#8208;fold selectivity versus other Hsp90 isoforms.

         <title>Aqueous&#8208;Organic Solvent Derived Recombinant Spider Silk Gels as Depots for Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels are widely used in various biomedical applications, as they cannot only serve as materials for biofabrication but also as depots for the administration of drugs. However, the possibilities of formulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs in hydrogels are rather limited. In this study, we assembled recombinant spider silk gels using a new processing route with aqueous&#8208;organic co&#8208;solvents, and the properties of these gels could be controlled by the choice of the co&#8208;solvent. The presence of the organic co&#8208;solvent further enabled the incorporation of hydrophobic drugs as exemplary shown for 6&#8208;mercaptopurine. The developed gels showed shear&#8208;thinning behaviour and could be easily injected to serve e.g. as drug depots and could even be 3D printed to serve as scaffolds for biofabrication. With this new processing route, the formulation of water&#8208;insoluble drugs in spider silk&#8208;based depots is possible, circumventing common pharmaceutical solubility issues.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron Catalyzed Water Oxidation: O&#8208;O Bond Formation via Intramolecular Two Oxo Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported the importance of structure regulation on the O&#8208;O bond formation process in binuclear iron catalysts. Three complexes, [Fe  2  (  &#956;  &#8208;O)(OH  2  )  2  (TPA)  2  ]  4+  (  1  ), [Fe  2  (  &#956;  &#8208;O)(OH  2  )  2  (6&#8208;HPA)]  4+  (  2  ) and [Fe  2  (  &#956;  &#8208;O)(OH  2  )  2  (BPMAN)]  4+  (  3  ) have been designed as electrocatalysts for water oxidation in 0.1 M NaHCO  3  solution(pH 8.4). All results indicate that  1  and  2  are the molecular catalysts and the O&#8208;O bond formation via oxo&#8208;oxo coupling rather than WNA pathway. However, complex  3  displays negligible catalytic activity in both cyclic voltammetry and bulk electrolysis. DFT calculations suggested that the  anti  to  syn  isomerization of the two high&#8208;valent Fe=O moieties has to take place via the axial rotation of one Fe=O around the Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Fe center. This is followed by the O&#8208;O bond formation via an oxo&#8208;oxo coupling pathway with a barrier of 19.2 kcal/mol at the Fe(IV)Fe(IV) state or via oxo&#8208;oxyl coupling pathway with a barrier of 12.7 kcal/mol at the Fe(IV)Fe(V) state for  2  . The alternative water nucleophilic attack pathway has a much higher barrier of 23.8 kcal/mol. Importantly, the rigid ligand of BPMAN based diiron(III) complex  3  limits the  anti  to  syn  isomerization and axial rotation of the Fe=O moiety, which has a barrier of over 30 kcal/mol and thus accounts for the negligible catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>CCascade reactions appeared as a cutting&#8208;edge strategy  [1]  to streamline the assembly of complex structural scaffolds from naturally available precursors in an atom&#8208;, as well as time, labor&#8208; and cost&#8208;efficient way  [2,3]  . We herein report a strategy to control cationic cyclization cascades by exploiting the ability of anchoring dynamic substrates in the active site of terpene cyclases  via  designed hydrogen bonding. Thereby, it is possible to induce &#8216;directed&#8217; cyclizations in contrast to established &#8216;non&#8208;stop&#8217; cyclizations  [4,5]  (99:1) and predestinate cascade termination at otherwise catalytically barely accessible intermediates. As a result, we are able to provide efficient access to naturally widely occurring apocarotenoids  [6,7]  , value&#8208;added flavors and fragrances in gram&#8208;scale by replacing multi&#8208;stage synthetic routes to a single step with unprecedented selectivity (&gt;99.5%  ee  ) and high yields (up to 89%).</dc:description>

         <title>A Cavity&#8208;Tailored Metal&#8208;Organic Cage Entraps Gases Selectively in Solution and the Amorphous Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the subcomponent self&#8208;assembly of a truxene&#8208;faced Zn4L4  tetrahedron, which is capable of binding the smallest hydrocarbons in solution under ambient conditions. By deliberately incorporating inward&#8208;facing ethyl groups on the truxene faces, the resulting partially&#8208;filled cage cavity was tailored to encapsulate methane, ethane, and ethene  via  van der Waals interactions at atmospheric pressure in acetonitrile, and also in the amorphous solid state. Interestingly, gas capture followed a contrasting selectivity in solution and the amorphous solid state, in which an order of methane &gt; ethane &gt; ethene was observed for the former. The selective binding may prove useful in designing new processes for the purification of methane and ethane as feedstocks for chemical synthesis</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand controls the activity of light&#8208;driven water oxidation catalyzed by nickel(II) porphyrin complexes in neutral homogeneous aqueous solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Finding photostable, first&#8208;row transition metal&#8208;based molecular systems for photocatalytic water oxidation is a critical milestone towards sustainable solar fuel production. Herein, we discovered that nickel(II) hydrophilic porphyrins form great molecular catalysts for photocatalytic water oxidation in neutral to acidic aqueous solutions using [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  as photosensitizer and [S  2  O  8  ]  2&#8208;  as sacrificial electron acceptor. Electron&#8208;poorer Ni&#8208;porphyrins bearing 8 fluorine or 4 methylpyridinium substituents as electron&#8208;poorer porphyrins afforded 6&#8208;fold higher TOFs (~0.65 min  &#8208;1  ) than electron&#8208;richer analogues. However, the electron&#8208;poorest Ni&#8208;porphyrin bearing 16 fluorine substituents was found photocatalytically inactive under such conditions, because the potential at which catalytic O  2  evolution starts was too high (+1.23 V vs. NHE) to be driven by the photochemically generated [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  3+  . Critically, these Ni&#8208;porphyrin catalysts showed excellent stability in photocatalytic conditions, as a second photocatalytic run re&#8208;plenished with a new dose of photosensitizer, afforded only 1&#8208;3% less O  2  than during the first photocatalytic run. Overall, optimizing the balance between the overpotential of the water oxidation catalyst and the driving force of electron transfer between the catalyst and the photogenerated oxidant [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  3+  , appears as critical for photocatalytic water oxidation kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Bisfunctionalization of Two&#8208;dimensional Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent functionalization of two&#8208;dimensional molybdenum disulfide (2D MoS2) holds great promise in developing robust organic&#8208;MoS2 hybrid structures. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate an approach to building up a bisfunctionalized MoS2 hybrid structure through successively reacting activated MoS2 with alkyl iodide and aryl diazonium salts. This approach can be utilized to modify both colloidal and substrate supported MoS2 nanosheets. We have discovered that compared to the adducts formed through the reactions of MoS2 with diazonium salts, those formed through the reactions of MoS2 with alkyl iodides display higher reactivity towards further reactions with electrophiles. We are convinced that our systematic study on the formation and reactivity of covalently functionalized MoS2 hybrids will provide some practical guidance on multi&#8208;angle tailoring of the properties of 2D MoS2 for various potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Gate&#8208;Controlled Therapeutics for Overcoming Bacterium&#8208;Induced Drug Resistance and Potentiating Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of bacteria in the tumor can cause cancer resistance to chemotherapeutics. To fight against bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance, herein we design self&#8208;traceable nanoreservoirs that are simultaneously loaded with gemcitabine and antibiotics ciprofloxacin and are decorated with hyaluronic acid for active tumor targeting. The nanoreservoirs have a pH&#8208;sensitive gate and an enzyme&#8208;responsive gate that can be opened in the acidic and hyaluronidase&#8208;abundant tumor microenvironment to control drug release rates. Moreover, the nanoreservoirs can specifically target the tumor regions without eliciting evident toxicity to normal tissues, kill the intratumoral bacteria, and inhibit the tumor growth even in the presence of the bacteria. Unexpectedly, the nanoreservoirs can activate T cell&#8208;mediated immune responses through promoting antigen&#8208;presenting dendritic cell maturation and depleting immunosuppressive myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells in bacterium&#8208;infected tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets as Robust Oxygen Evolution Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) on nickel foam (NF) by assembling nickel chloride hexahydrate and 1,1&#180;&#8208;ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (NiFc&#8208;MOF/NF). The NiFc&#8208;MOF/NF exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with an overpotential of 195 mV and 241 mV at 10 and 100 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  , respectively and long&#8208;term stability up to 40 h under alkaline conditions. Electrochemical results demonstrate that the superb OER performance originates from the ferrocene units that serve as efficient electron transfer intermediates. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the ferrocene units within the MOF crystalline structure enhance the overall electron transfer capacity, thereby leading to a theoretical overpotential of 0.52 eV, which is lower than that (0.81 eV) of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NiFe double hydroxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Biosynthesis and mechanism of action of the cell wall targeting antibiotic hypeptin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypeptin is a cyclodepsipeptide antibiotic produced by  Lysobacter sp.  K5869, isolated from an environmental sample by the iChip technology, dedicated to the cultivation of previously uncultured microorganisms. Hypeptin shares structural features with teixobactin and exhibits potent activity against a broad spectrum of gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Using comprehensive  in vivo  and  in vitro  analyses, we show that hypeptin blocks bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by binding to multiple undecaprenyl pyrophosphate&#8208;containing biosynthesis intermediates, forming a stoichiometric 2:1 complex. Resistance to hypeptin did not readily develop  in vitro.  Analysis of the hypeptin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) supported a model for the synthesis of the octapeptide. Within the BGC, two hydroxylases were identified and characterized, responsible for the stereoselective &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of four building blocks when bound to peptidyl carrier proteins.  In vitro  hydroxylation assays corroborate the biosynthetic hypothesis and lead to the proposal of a refined structure for hypeptin.</dc:description>

         <title>Local deuteration enables NMR observation of methyl groups in proteins from eukaryotic and cell&#8208;free expression systems.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Therapeutically relevant proteins such as GPCRs, antibodies and kinases face clear limitations in NMR studies due to the challenges in site&#8208;specific isotope labeling and deuteration in eukaryotic expression systems. Here we describe an efficient and simple method to observe the methyl groups of leucine residues in proteins expressed in bacterial, eukaryotic or cell&#8208;free expression systems without modification of the expression protocol. The method relies on simple stereo&#8208;selective&#160;  13C&#8208;labeling and deuteration of leucine that alleviates the need for additional deuteration of the protein. The spectroscopic benefits of &#8216;local&#8217; deuteration are examined in detail through Forbidden Coherence Transfer (FCT) experiments and simulations. The utility of this labeling method is demonstrated in the cell&#8208;free synthesis of bacteriorhodopsin and in the insect&#8208;cell expression of the RRM2 domain of human RBM39.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles of CeO  2  obtained in molecular form, so&#8208;called &#8216;molecular nanoparticles&#8217;, have been limited to date to a family whose largest member is of nuclearity Ce  40  with a {Ce  40  O  58  } core atom count. Herein we report that a synthetic procedure has been developed to the cation [Ce  100  O  149  (OH)  18  (O  2  CPh)  60  (PhCO  2  H)  12  (H  2  O)  20  ]  16+  , a member with a much higher Ce  100  nuclearity and a {Ce  100  O  167  } core that is more akin to the smallest ceria nanoparticles. Its crystal structure reveals it to possess a 2.4 nm size and high D  2d  symmetry, and it has also allowed identification of core surface features including facet composition, the presence and location of Ce  3+  and H  +  (i.e. HO  &#8208;  ) ions, and the binding modes of the ligand monolayer of benzoate, benzoic acid, and water ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical probe identification of a small&#8208;molecule inhibitor binding site in Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mammalian membrane&#8208;bound  O  &#8208;acyltransferase (MBOAT) superfamily is involved in biological processes including growth, development and appetite sensing. MBOATs are attractive drug targets in cancer and obesity; however, information on the binding site and molecular mechanisms underlying small&#8208;molecule inhibition is elusive. This study reports rational development of a photochemical probe to interrogate a novel small&#8208;molecule inhibitor binding site in the human MBOAT Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT). Structure&#8208;activity relationship investigation identified single enantiomer  IMP&#8208;1575  , the most potent HHAT inhibitor reported to&#8208;date, and guided design of photocrosslinking probes that maintained HHAT&#8208;inhibitory potency. Photocrosslinking and proteomic sequencing of HHAT delivered identification of the first small&#8208;molecule binding site in a mammalian MBOAT. Topology and homology data suggested a potential mechanism for HHAT inhibition which was confirmed via kinetic analysis. Our results provide an optimal HHAT tool inhibitor  IMP&#8208;1575  (  K  i  &#160;=&#160;38&#160;nM) and a strategy for mapping small molecule interaction sites in MBOATs.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Direct Cyclization Constructs Spiro&#8208;acridan Derivatives for Highly Efficient TADF emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spiro&#8208;acridan (  SpA  ) derivatives possess a great potential in preparing efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters. However, the conventional synthetic routes are cost&#8208;expensive and time&#8208;consuming. The development of a simple procedure to synthesize  SpA  s is still in urgent pursuing appreciated by academic and industrial communities. In this contribution, we present a feasible acid&#8208;catalyzed solvent&#8208;free metal&#8208;free cyclization between diarylamines and ketones to construct  SpA  s. The as&#8208;constructed moieties provide a wide possibility to assemble efficient TADF emitters. As an illustrated example,  D2T&#8208;TR  with high photoluminescent quantum yield and proper TADF character is applied in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) which achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 27.1%. This work shows us a bright inspiration on developing excellent organic optoelectronic materials and an effective tool to realize it.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8211;Antibody Conjugates (PACs) &#8211; A Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Strategy for Covalent Conjugation and Targeted Intracellular Delivery of Pristine Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>W e report here on protein&#8208;antibody conjugates (PACs) that are used for antibody&#8208;directed delivery of protein therapeutics to specific cells. PACs have the potential to judiciously combine the merits of two prolific therapeutic approaches,&#160;  viz.  biologics and antibody&#8208;drug conjugates. We utilize&#160;spherical polymer brushes to construct PACs using the combination of two simple and efficient functionally orthogonal click chemistries. In addition to the synthesis and characterization of these nanoparticles, we demonstrate that PACs are indeed capable of specifically targeting cells based on the presence of target antigen on the cell surface to deliver proteins. The potentially broad adaptability of PACs opens up new opportunities for targeted biologics in therapeutics and sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Electrochemistry: Expanding the Scope of Paired Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Paired electrochemical reactions offer an exciting opportunity to optimize both the atom and energy economy of oxidation and reduction reactions. While many paired electrochemical reactions take advantage of perfectly matched reactions at the anode and cathode, this matching of substrates in not necessary. In a constant current electrolysis, the potential at both electrodes will adjust to the substrates in solution. So, in principle any oxidation reaction can be paired with any reduction reaction. Previously, various oxidation reactions conducted on the anodic side of the electrolysis were paired with the generation and use of hydrogen gas at the cathode. This work nicely demonstrated the generality of the anodic process in a paired electrolysis and how the auxiliary reaction required for the oxidation could be used to generate a substrate for a non&#8208;electrolysis reaction. In this manuscript, this work is combined with variations on the cathodic side of the electrolysis in order to complete the picture and illustrate how various oxidation and reduction reactions can be mixed and matched</dc:description>

         <title>Unified Synthesis of Polycyclic Alkaloids via Complementary Carbonyl Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A complementary dual carbonyl activation strategy for the syn&#173;thesis of polycyclic alkaloids has been developed.    Successful appli&#173;cations include the synthesis of tetracyclic alkaloids harmalanine, harmalacinine, pentacyclic indolo&#173;quinolizidine alkaloid nortetoyobyrine, and octacyclic &#946;&#8209;carboline alkaloid peganumine A. The latter synthesis features a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free assembly and an asymmetric disulfon&#173;imide catalyzed cyclization. Furthermore, formal syntheses of hirsutine, deplancheine, 10&#8208;desbromo&#173;arborescidine A, and oxindole alkaloids rhynchophylline and isorhyncho&#173;phylline have been achieved. Finally, a concise synthesis of berberine alkaloid ilicifoline B was completed.</dc:description>

         <title>Genetic engineering in combination with semisynthesis leads to a new route for gram&#8208;scale production of the immunosuppressive natural product brasilicardin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Brasilicardin A (    1    ) consists of an unusual anti/syn/anti&#8208;perhydrophenanthrene skeleton with a carbohydrate side chain and an amino acid moiety. It exhibits potent immunosuppressive activity, yet its mode of action differs from standard drugs that are currently in use. Further pre&#8208;clinical evaluation of this promising, biologically active natural product is hampered by restricted access to the ready material, as its synthesis requires both a low&#8208;yielding fermentation process using a pathogenic organism and an elaborate, multi&#8208;step total synthesis. Our semi&#8208;synthetic approach included a) the heterologous expression of the brasilicardin A gene cluster in different non&#8208;pathogenic bacterial strains producing brasilicardin A aglycone (    5    ) in excellent yield and b) the chemical transformation of the aglycone    5    into the trifluoroacetic acid salt of brasilicardin A (    1a    ) via a short and straightforward 5 step synthetic route. Additionally, we report the first preclinical data for brasilicardin A.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Highly Ordered Glyco&#8208;Inside Nano&#8208;Assemblies through RAFT Dispersion Polymerization of Galactose&#8208;Decorated Monomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies containing numerous intermediate morphologies are fabricated by leveraging RAFT polymerization of a galactose&#8208;decorated monomer for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. This method establishes a powerful route to fabricate glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies with tunable morphologies and variable sizes, which is significant to expand the large&#8208;scale fabrication and wide application of glyco&#8208;assemblies.







Abstract
Glyco&#8208;assemblies derived from amphiphilic sugar&#8208;decorated block copolymers (ASBCs) have emerged prominently due to their wide application, for example, in biomedicine and as drug carriers. However, to efficiently construct these glyco&#8208;assemblies is still a challenge. Herein, we report an efficient technology for the synthesis of glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies by utilizing RAFT polymerization of a galactose&#8208;decorated methacrylate for polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). Using this approach, a series of highly ordered glyco&#8208;inside nano&#8208;assemblies containing intermediate morphologies were fabricated by adjusting the length of the hydrophobic glycoblock and the polymerization solids content. A specific morphology of complex vesicles was captured during the PISA process and the formation mechanism is explained by the morphology of its precursor and intermediate. Thus, this method establishes a powerful route to fabricate glyco&#8208;assemblies with tunable morphologies and variable sizes, which is significant to enable the large&#8208;scale fabrication and wide application of glyco&#8208;assemblies.

         <title>p&#8208;Type Charge Transfer Doping of Graphene Oxide with (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx for Air&#8208;Stable, All&#8208;Inorganic CsPbIBr2 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
(NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx decorated GO is used as a hole booster in all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC. A champion efficiency of 10.95&#8201;% is achieved arising from the charge transfer doping effect between (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx and GO.







Abstract
The precise regulation of interfacial charge distribution highly determines the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, inorganic (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx nanoparticle decorated graphene oxide (GO) is successfully demonstrated as a hole booster for all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC free of precious metal electrode. Arising from the spontaneous electron transfer induced p&#8208;type doping of GO from edged oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups to (NiCo)1&#8722;yFeyOx, the best all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 PSC achieves an efficiency of 10.95&#8201;% under one standard sun owing to the eliminated paradox between charge extraction and charge localization in GO surface. Furthermore, the champion device exhibits an excellent long&#8208;term stability at 10&#8201;% relative humidity without encapsulation over 70&#8197;days because of the suppressed ions migration.

         <title>Nitrone and Alkyne Cascade Reactions for Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective 1&#8208;Pyrroline Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of 1&#8208;pyrrolines from  N  &#8208;alkenylnitrones and alkynes has been explored as a retrosynthetic alternative to traditional approaches. These cascade reactions are formal [4+1] cycloadditions that proceed through a proposed dipolar cycloaddition and  N  &#8208;alkenylisoxazoline [3,3&#8217;]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement. A variety of cyclic alkynes and terminal alkynes have been shown to undergo the transformation with  N  &#8208;alkenylnitrones under mild conditions to provide the corresponding spirocyclic and densely&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;pyrrolines with high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies provide insight into the balance of steric and electronic effects that promote the cascade process and control the diastereo&#8208;and regioisomeric preferences of the 1&#8208;pyrroline products. Diastereoselective derivatization of the 1&#8208;pyrrolines prepared by the cascade reaction demonstrate the divergent synthetic utility of the new method.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging reagent modulation and remote anchimeric assistance for glycosylation: highly stereoselective synthesis of a&#8208;glycans up to a 30&#8208;mer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient synthesis of long, branched and complex carbohydrates containing multiple 1,2&#8208;  cis  glycosidic linkages remains one of long&#8208;standing challenges in chemistry. Here, we report a merging reagent modulation and 6&#8208;  O  &#8208;Levulinoyl remote anchimeric assistance glycosylation strategy, which is successfully applied to the first highly stereoselective synthesis of the branched  Dendrobium Huoshanense  glycans and the linear Longan glycans containing up to 30 contiguous 1,2&#8208;  cis  glucosidic bonds. DFT calculations shed light on the origin of the much higher stereoselectivities of 1,2&#8208;  cis  glucosylation with 6&#8208;  O  &#8208;levulinoyl group than 6&#8208;  O  &#8208;acetyl or 6&#8208;  O  &#8208;benzoyl groups. Furthermore, orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl  ortho  &#8208;alkynylbenzoates and  ortho  &#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates has been demonstrated in the efficient synthesis of complex glycans, which precludes such issues as aglycon transfer inherent to orthogonal one&#8208;pot synthesis based on thioglycosides. The present work will open a new avenue toward the streamlined synthesis of the long, branched and complicated glycans with multiple 1,2&#8208;  cis  glycosidic linkages.</dc:description>

         <title>Hematite Photoanodes for Water Oxidation &#8208;&#160;Electronic Transitions, Carrier Dynamics, and Surface Energetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We review the up&#8208;to&#8208;date understanding of charge carriers in model hematite photoanodes at different stages. The origin of charge carriers is discussed based on the electronic structure and absorption features, highlighting the controversial assignment of the electronic transitions near the absorption edge. Next, the dynamic evolution of charge carriers is analyzed both on the ultrafast and on the surface reaction timescales, with special emphasis on the arguable spectroscopic assignment of electrons/holes and their kinetics. Further, the competitive charge transfer centers at the solid&#8208;liquid interface are reviewed, and the chemical nature of relevant surface states is updated. Finally, an overview on the function of widely employed surface cocatalysts is given to illustrate the complex influence of physiochemical modifications on the charge carrier dynamics. Understanding of charge carriers from their origin all the way to their interfacial transfer is vital for the future of photoanode design.</dc:description>

The coordination between iron catalyst and the nitrogen atom of N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones was identified to be important in overcoming the reduction potential limitation of sulfones in the intermolecular single electron transfer process, which enables both fluoroalkyl N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones (with relatively high reduction potentials) and nonfluorinated alkyl N&#8208;heteroaryl sulfones (with low reduction potentials) to serve as powerful alkylation reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Tetrabutylammonium Cation Intercalation to Heal Inorganic CsPbI3 Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The in&#8208;situ formation of reduced dimensional perovskite layer via post&#8208;synthesis ion exchange has been an effective way of passivating organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites. In contrast, cesium ions in Cs based inorganic perovskite with strong ionic binding energy cannot exchange with those well&#8208;known organic cations to form reduced dimensional perovskite. Herein, we demonstrate that tetrabutylammonium (TBA  +  ) cation can intercalate into CsPbI  3  to effectively substitute the Cs cation to form one&#8208;dimensional (1D) TBAPbI  3  layer in the post&#8208;synthesis TBAI treatment. Such TBA cation intercalation leads to in&#8208;situ formation of TBAPbI  3  protective layer to heal defects at surface of inorganic CsPbI  3  perovskite. The TBAPbI  3  &#8208;CsPbI  3  perovskite exhibited enhanced stability and lower defect density, and the corresponding perovskite solar cell devices achieved an improved efficiency up to 18.32% compared to the control one&#8217;s efficiency of 15.85%. Our findings would inspire further investigation and development of reduced dimensional perovskite protection strategy for inorganic perovskites.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Stranded DNA as Supramolecular Template for One&#8208;Dimensional Palladium(II) Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;DNA hybrids with an uninterrupted one&#8208;dimensional PdII array running through the center of the helixes have been prepared using a bottom&#8208;up approach by a self&#8208;assembly reaction between adenine homopolymers (dA) and complementary palladium complexes. The complexes bind to each adenine forming sequential Watson&#8211;Crick Pd&#8208;mediated base pairs.







Abstract
Atomic&#8208;level control over the position and growth of a single and continuous metal chain is an ambitious goal that often requires complex and costly processes. Herein, we demonstrate that 1Pd&#8208;DNA molecules, comprising a continuous single chain of PdII ions, can be prepared by a simple self&#8208;assembly reaction between the complex [Pd(Cheld)(CH3CN)] (1Pd_CH3CN) (Cheld=chelidamic acid) and single&#8208;stranded DNA homopolymers (ss&#8208;DNA) containing adenine (A) or 7&#8208;deazaadenine (X) bases. The single PdII&#8208;base pairs [1Pd(N1&#8208;A)] and [1Pd(N1&#8208;X)] were synthesized and characterized in solution and solid&#8208;state (X&#8208;ray diffraction) revealing an arrangement similar to that of natural Watson&#8211;Crick base pairs. Subsequently, 1Pd&#8208;DNA hybrids were prepared, characterized, and their structures studied by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and ab&#8208;initio calculations. The results indicate that the 1Pd&#8208;DNA structures resemble that of double&#8208;stranded DNA, with one strand being replaced by a supramolecular stack of continuous PdII complexes.

         <title>Division and Regrowth of Phase&#8208;Separated Giant Unilamellar Vesicles**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate division of phase&#8208;separated lipid vesicles following quantitative predictions from an analytical model. The division is controlled by metabolic decomposition or light&#8208;triggered uncaging of a fluorophore. This provides spatiotemporal control over the division of a target vesicle. We regrow phase&#8208;separated vesicles by targeted fusion using DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
Success in the bottom&#8208;up assembly of synthetic cells will depend on strategies for the division of protocellular compartments. Here, we describe the controlled division of phase&#8208;separated giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). We derive an analytical model based on the vesicle geometry, which makes four quantitative predictions that we verify experimentally. We find that the osmolarity ratio required for division is 
, independent of the GUV size, while asymmetric division happens at lower osmolarity ratios. Remarkably, we show that a suitable osmolarity change can be triggered by water evaporation, enzymatic decomposition of sucrose or light&#8208;triggered uncaging of CMNB&#8208;fluorescein. The latter provides full spatiotemporal control, such that a target GUV undergoes division whereas the surrounding GUVs remain unaffected. Finally, we grow phase&#8208;separated vesicles from single&#8208;phased vesicles by targeted fusion of the opposite lipid type with programmable DNA tags to enable subsequent division cycles.

         <title>Consecutive O&#8722;S/N&#8722;S Bond Cleavage in Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Rearrangement Reactions of Alkynyl N&#8208;Sulfinylimines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The O&#8722;S and N&#8722;S bonds of alkynyl N&#8208;sulfinylimines were cleaved in gold&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement reactions to afford S&#8208;functionalized 2H&#8208;azirines in good to excellent yields (see scheme). The reactions proceed via a thiooxime intermediate directly bound to an &#945;&#8208;oxo gold carbene moiety.







Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkynyl N&#8208;sulfinylimines were used to produce the corresponding 2H&#8208;azirines possessing sulfenyl and acyl groups at the 3&#8208;position of the azirine ring in good to excellent yields. These reactions involved internal transfer of the sulfinyl oxygen atom to form a thiooxime intermediate tethered to an &#945;&#8208;oxo gold carbene moiety. Subsequent insertion of the carbene into the N&#8722;S bond resulted in ring construction.

         <title>Crystal Structures and Catalytic Mechanism of l&#8208;erythro&#8208;3,5&#8208;Diaminohexanoate Dehydrogenase and Rational Engineering for Asymmetric Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate binding and catalytic mechanism of l&#8208;erythro&#8208;3,5&#8208;diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase, the only known member of the &#946;&#8208;amino acid dehydrogenase family, are shown to be quite different from those of its &#945;&#8208;counterparts. Subsequent rational engineering expanded the substrate scope without reducing the enantioselectivity, enabling efficient asymmetric synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract
Amino acid dehydrogenases (AADHs) have shown considerable potential as biocatalysts in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amino acids. However, compared to the widely studied &#945;&#8208;AADHs, limited knowledge is available about &#946;&#8208;AADHs that enable the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids. Herein, we report the crystal structures of a l&#8208;erythro&#8208;3,5&#8208;diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase and its variants, the only known member of &#946;&#8208;AADH family. Crystal structure analysis, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies and quantum chemical calculations revealed the differences in the substrate binding and catalytic mechanism from &#945;&#8208;AADHs. A number of rationally engineered variants were then obtained with improved activity (by 110&#8211;800 times) toward various aliphatic &#946;&#8208;amino acids without an enantioselectivity trade&#8208;off. Two &#946;&#8208;amino acids were prepared by using the outstanding variants with excellent enantioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee) and high isolated yields (86&#8211;87&#8201;%). These results provide important insights into the molecular mechanism of 3,5&#8208;DAHDH, and establish a solid foundation for further design of &#946;&#8208;AADHs for the asymmetric synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids.

However, compared to the widely studied &#945;&#8208;AADHs, limited knowledge is available about &#946;&#8208;AADHs that enable the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids. Herein, we report the crystal structures of a &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;&lt;i&gt;erythro&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;3,5&#8208;diaminohexanoate dehydrogenase and its variants, the only known member of &#946;&#8208;AADH family. Crystal structure analysis, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies and quantum chemical calculations revealed the differences in the substrate binding and catalytic mechanism from &#945;&#8208;AADHs. A number of rationally engineered variants were then obtained with improved activity (by 110&#8211;800 times) toward various aliphatic &#946;&#8208;amino acids without an enantioselectivity trade&#8208;off. Two &#946;&#8208;amino acids were prepared by using the outstanding variants with excellent enantioselectivity (&amp;gt;99&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;) and high isolated yields (86&#8211;87&#8201;%). These results provide important insights into the molecular mechanism of 3,5&#8208;DAHDH, and establish a solid foundation for further design of &#946;&#8208;AADHs for the asymmetric synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>S&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides: Ultrafast and Selective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerizations Towards Well&#8208;defined Functionalized Polythioesters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;carboxyanhydride (SCA) monomers derived from amino acids are introduced. The SCA monomers are significantly more reactive than thiolactones for ultrafast and selective ring&#8208;opening polymerization. The polymerizations reach complete conversion within minutes at room temperature, yielding polythioesters with predictable molecular weight, low dispersities, and retained stereoregularity.







Abstract
Aliphatic polythioesters are popular polymers because of their appealing performance such as metal coordination ability, high refractive indices, and biodegradability. One of the most powerful approaches for generating these polymers is the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of cyclic monomers. However, the synthesis of precisely controlled polythioesters via ROP of thiolactones still faces formidable challenges, including the minimal functional diversity of available thiolactone monomers, as well as inevitable transthioesterification side reactions. Here we introduce a hyperactive class of S&#8208;carboxyanhydride (SCA) monomers derived from amino acids that are significantly more reactive than thiolactones for ultrafast and selective ROP. Inclusion of the initiator PPNOBz ([PPN]=bis(triphenylphosphine)&#8208;iminium) with chain transfer agent benzoic acid, the polymerizations that can be operated in open vessels reach complete conversion within minutes (1&#8211;2&#8197;min) at room temperature, yielding polythioesters with predictable molecular weight, low dispersities, retained stereoregularity and chemical recyclability. Most fascinating are the functionalized SCAs that allow the incorporating of functional groups along the polythioester chain and thus finely tune their physicochemical performance. Computational studies were carried out to explore the origins of the distinctive rapidity and exquisite selectivity of the polymerizations, offering mechanistic insight and explaining why high polymerizability of SCA monomer is able to facilitate exquisitely selective ring&#8208;opening for enchainment over competing transthioesterification and backbiting reactions.

         <title>Iodide&#8208;Mediated Rapid and Sensitive Surface Etching of Gold Nanostars for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We outline a rapid and sensitive nanoparticle etching&#8208;based strategy for biosensing. Iodide modulates the plasmonic features of gold nanostars by etching them into spherical nanoparticles, being a versatile biosensing platform for enzyme detection and plasmonic immunoassays.







Abstract
Iodide&#8208;mediated surface etching can tailor the surface plasmon resonance of gold nanostars through etching of the high&#8208;energy facets of the nanoparticle protrusions in a rapid and sensitive way. By exploring the underlying mechanisms of this etching and the key parameters influencing it (such as iodide, oxygen, pH, and temperature), we show its potential in a sensitive biosensing system. Horseradish peroxidase&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of iodide enables control of the etching of gold nanostars to spherical gold nanoparticles, where the resulting spectral shift in the surface plasmon resonance yields a distinct color change of the solution. We further develop this enzyme&#8208;modulated surface etching of gold nanostars into a versatile platform for plasmonic immunoassays, where a high sensitivity is possible by signal amplification via magnetic beads and click chemistry.

         <title>MOF Nanosheet Reconstructed Two&#8208;Dimensional Bionic Nanochannel for Protonic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MOF thin film&#8208;based bionic proton field&#8208;effect transistor (H+&#8208;FET) has been fabricated for the first time. It displays the highest proton mobility and highest on&#8211;off ratio among all reported H+&#8208;FETs.







Abstract
The construction of hydrophobic nanochannel with hydrophilic sites for bionic devices to proximally mimick real bio&#8208;system is still challenging. Taking the advantages of MOF chemistry, a highly oriented CuTCPP thin film has been successfully reconstructed with ultra&#8208;thin nanosheets to produce abundant two&#8208;dimensional interstitial hydrophobic nanochannels with hydrophilic sites. Different from the classical active&#8208;layer material with proton transport in bulk, CuTCPP thin film represents a new type of active&#8208;layer with proton transport in nanochannel for bionic proton field&#8208;effect transistor (H+&#8208;FETs). The resultant device can reversibly modulate the proton transport by varying the voltage on its gate electrode. Meanwhile, it shows the highest proton mobility of &#8776;9.5&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and highest on&#8208;off ratio of 4.1 among all of the reported H+&#8208;FETs. Our result demonstrates a powerful material design strategy for proximally mimicking the structure and properties of bio&#8208;systems and constructing bionic electrical devices.

         <title>Prediction of Novel van der Waals Boron Oxides with Superior Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An 18&#8208;membered&#8208;ring boron oxide (18MR&#8208;B2O3) is predicted with 1:1 ratio of [BO3] triangles and [B3O6] boroxol rings. Its van der Waals stackings, AA and AB, satisfy all the stringent criteria for deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (DUV NLO) materials, exhibiting short second harmonic generation (SHG) phase&#8208;matching (PM) wavelength and large SHG response.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (DUV NLO) materials are attracting increasing attention because of their structural diversity and complexity. Using the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystal structure prediction method combined with the first&#8208;principles calculations, here we propose layered 18&#8208;membered&#8208;ring (18MR) boron oxide B2O3 polymorphs as high&#8208;performance NLO materials. 18MR&#8208;B2O3 with the AA and AB stackings are potential DUV NLO materials. The superior performing 18MR&#8208;B2O3AB has an unprecedentedly high second harmonic generation coefficient of 1.63&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1, the largest among the DUV NLO materials, three times larger than that of the advanced DUV NLO material KBe2BO3F2 and comparable to that of &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4. Its unusually large birefringence of 0.196 at 400&#8197;nm guarantees the phase&#8208;matching wavelength &#955;PM to reach this material's extreme absorption edge of &#8776;154&#8197;nm.

         <title>Linear Paired Electrolysis&#8212;Realising 200&#8201;% Current Efficiency for Stoichiometric Transformations&#8212;The Electrochemical Bromination of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromination of Alkenes 2.0&#8212;can a stoichiometric chemical transformation exceed a 100&#8201;% yield? No! But there is a way to achieve an eletrochemical current efficiency of up to 200&#8201;% when oxygen is used as the sacrifical starting material. The cathodic reduction of oxygen to H2O2 led to the bromination of alkenes in a linear paired electrolysis in up to perfect 200&#8201;% current efficiency.







Abstract
The generation of bromine by oxidation of bromide anions at the anode and reduction of molecular oxygen at the cathode to hydrogen peroxide resulted in the overall formation of two molecules of Br2 (=four electron oxidation) by passing just two electrons through the solution. The bromine was used for the bromination of alkenes and thereby a linear paired electrolysis was attained which resulted in current efficencies of up to 200&#8201;%. Also, the diiodination of cyclohexene as well as the electrophilic aromatic bromination of an electron&#8208;rich arene were realised both in 168&#8201;% current efficiencies.

         <title>Complete Biosynthetic Pathway of Alazopeptin, a Tripeptide Consisting of Two Molecules of 6&#8208;Diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;l&#8208;norleucine and One Molecule of Alanine</title>

The complete biosynthetic pathway of alazopeptin, the tripeptide consisting of two molecules of DON (6&#8208;diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;l&#8208;norleucine) and one alanine, is revealed. The heterologous production of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;DON in Streptomyces albus was also established. Most interestingly, the transmembrane protein AzpL was indicated to catalyze diazotization using 5&#8208;oxolysine and nitrous acid as substrates.







Abstract
DON (6&#8208;diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;l&#8208;norleucine), a diazo&#8208;containing amino acid, has been studied for more than 60&#8197;years as a potent antitumor agent, but its biosynthesis has not been elucidated. Here we reveal the complete biosynthetic pathway of alazopeptin, the tripeptide Ala&#8208;DON&#8208;DON, which has antitumor activity, by gene inactivation and in vitro analysis of recombinant enzymes. We also established heterologous production of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;DON in Streptomyces albus. DON is synthesized from lysine by three enzymes and converted to alazopeptin by five enzymes and one carrier protein. Most interestingly, transmembrane protein AzpL was indicated to catalyze diazotization using 5&#8208;oxolysine and nitrous acid as substrates. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of AzpL indicated that the hydroxy group of Tyr&#8208;93 is important for the diazotization. These findings expand our knowledge of the enzymology of N&#8722;N bond formation.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Based Identification of New IDO1 Modulator Chemotypes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heme&#8208;competitive idoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO1) small&#8208;molecule modulators are under&#8208;represented as heme displacement is delayed in in&#8197;vitro assays. This limitation can be overcome by cell&#8208;based screening as employed in this study, which revealed novel chemotypes that potently inhibit IDO1 activity and kynurenine production by competing with heme.







Abstract
The immunoregulatory enzyme idoleamine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO1) strengthens cancer immune escape, and inhibition of IDO1 by means of new chemotypes and mechanisms of action is considered a promising opportunity for IDO1 inhibitor discovery. IDO1 is a cofactor&#8208;binding, redox&#8208;sensitive protein, which calls for monitoring of IDO1 activity in its native cellular environment. We developed a new, robust fluorescence&#8208;based assay amenable to high throughput, which detects kynurenine in cells. Screening of a ca. 150&#8201;000&#8208;member compound library discovered unprecedented, potent IDO1 modulators with different mechanisms of action, including direct IDO1 inhibitors, regulators of IDO1 expression, and inhibitors of heme synthesis. Three IDO1&#8208;modulator chemotypes were identified that bind to apo&#8208;IDO1 and compete with the heme cofactor. Our new cell&#8208;based technology opens up novel opportunities for medicinal chemistry programs in immuno&#8208;oncology.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Semiconductive and Photoactive Heterobimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Capsule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed Fe3+/Co2+&#8208;seamed capsule comprising multiple heterometallic metal&#8211;metal interactions is presented. This capsule displays unexpected semiconducting and photoelectric conversion properties.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a novel metal&#8211;organic capsule constructed from six pyrogallol[4]arene macrocycles, which are switched together by 16&#8201;FeIII and 16&#8201;CoII ions. This supramolecular structure is the first instance of a spheroidal heterometallic nanocage assembled through a one&#8208;step metal&#8211;ligand coordination approach. This new assembly also demonstrates an important proof of concept through the formation of multiple heterometallic metal&#8211;metal interactions within the capsule framework. Photophysical and electrochemical studies of self&#8208;assembled capsule films indicate their potential as semiconductors. These materials display unexpected photoelectric conversion properties, thus representing an emergent phenomenon in discrete metal&#8211;organic supramolecular assemblies.

         <title>Effects of Sequence and Base Composition on the CD and TDS Profiles of i&#8208;DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
i&#8208;DNA is an emerging non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure that represents a suitable target in anticancer therapy. A multivariate data analysis unveiled peculiar TDS and CD spectral regions that could be used for the structural determination of i&#8208;DNA&#8208;forming sequences.







Abstract
The i&#8208;motif DNA, also known as i&#8208;DNA, is a non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure formed by cytosine&#8208;rich sequences, consisting of two intercalated parallel&#8208;stranded duplexes held together by hemi&#8208;protonated cytosine&#8211;cytosine+ (C:C+) base pairs. The growing interest in the i&#8208;DNA structure as a target in anticancer therapy increases the need for tools for a rapid and meaningful interpretation of the spectroscopic data of i&#8208;DNA samples. Herein, we analyzed the circular dichroism (CD) and thermal difference UV&#8208;absorbance spectra (TDS) of 255 DNA sequences by means of multivariate data analysis, aiming at unveiling peculiar spectral regions that could be used as diagnostic features during the analysis of i&#8208;DNA&#8208;forming sequences.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Selenium&#8208;Catalysed Isomerisation of para&#8208;Hydroxamic Acids into para&#8208;Aminophenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prepare for trouble&#8212;and make it double: A organoselenium&#8208;catalysed, regiospecific para&#8208;hydroxylation starting from N&#8208;aryl hydroxamic acids through double [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement to form para&#8208;aminophenols was developed. This operationally easy reaction delivers useful para&#8208;aminophenol building blocks on small and large scales and its mechanism is supported through quantum chemical calculations as well as labeling experiments.







Abstract
A selenium&#8208;catalysed para&#8208;hydroxylation of N&#8208;aryl&#8208;hydroxamic acids is reported. Mechanistically, the reaction comprises an N&#8722;O bond cleavage and consecutive selenium&#8208;induced [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement to deliver para&#8208;hydroxyaniline derivatives. The mechanism is studied through both 18O&#8208;crossover experiments as well as quantum chemical calculations.

&lt;p&gt;Prepare for trouble&#8212;and make it double: A organoselenium&#8208;catalysed, regiospecific &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;hydroxylation starting from &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aryl hydroxamic acids through double [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement to form &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aminophenols was developed. This operationally easy reaction delivers useful &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aminophenol building blocks on small and large scales and its mechanism is supported through quantum chemical calculations as well as labeling experiments.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A selenium&#8208;catalysed &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;hydroxylation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aryl&#8208;hydroxamic acids is reported. Mechanistically, the reaction comprises an N&#8722;O bond cleavage and consecutive selenium&#8208;induced [2,3]&#8208;rearrangement to deliver &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;hydroxyaniline derivatives. The mechanism is studied through both &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O&#8208;crossover experiments as well as quantum chemical calculations. This redox&#8208;neutral transformation provides an unconventional synthetic approach to &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aminophenols.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Janus Nanocages of Platinum&#8208;Group Metals and Their Use as Effective Dual&#8208;Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus nanocages of platinum&#8208;group metals were fabricated with a uniform size and well&#8208;defined {100} facets, together with porous, ultrathin, asymmetric walls up to 1.6&#8197;nm thick. When tested as dual&#8208;electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, the Janus nanocages based on Pt and Ir exhibited superior activities depending on the thickness and spatial positions of the metal layer.







Abstract
Janus nanocages with distinctive platinum&#8208;group metals on the outer and inner surfaces can naturally catalyze at least two different reactions. Here we report a general method based on successive deposition and then selective etching for the facile synthesis of such nanocages. We have fabricated 11 different types of Janus nanocages characterized by a uniform size and well&#8208;defined {100} facets, together with porous, ultrathin, asymmetric walls up to 1.6&#8197;nm thick. When tested as dual&#8208;electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, the Janus nanocages based on Pt and Ir exhibited superior activities depending on the thickness and relative position of the metal layer. Density functional theory studies suggest that the alloy composition and surface structure of the nanocages both play important roles in enhancing the electrocatalytic activities by modulating the stability of key reaction intermediates.

         <title>Functionalization of Silk by AIEgens through Facile Bioconjugation: Full&#8208;Color Fluorescence and Long&#8208;Term Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silkworm silk is a promising natural biopolymer for textile and biomedical applications for its remarkable flexibility, excellent biocompatibility and controllable biodegradability. The functionalization of silks makes them more versatile for flexible displays and visible bioscaffolds. However, fluorescent silks are normally fabricated through unstable physical absorption or complicated chemical reactions under harsh conditions. Herein, we developed a simple strategy for preparing fluorescent silks. Five aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) with activated alkynes were synthesized by rational molecular design, and then reacted with silk fibers through facile metal&#8208;free click bioconjugation. The resulting conjugates show bright full&#8208;color emissions and high stability. A white light&#8208;emitting silk was fabricated by simultaneous bioconjugation with red&#8208;, green&#8208; and blue&#8208;emissive AIEgens. The red&#8208;emissive AIEgen&#8208;functionalized silks were successfully applied for long&#8208;term cell tracking and two&#8208;photon bioimaging, demonstrating great potential for tissue engineering and bioscaffold monitoring.</dc:description>

         <title>An Integrated Design of a Polypseudorotaxane&#8208;Based Sea Cucumber Mimic</title>

Cyclodextrin&#8208;triggered stiffening: A sidechain polypseudorotaxane&#8208;based sea cucumber mimic was designed from molecular entities, which exhibited multi&#8208;stage shape persistence and stiffness variations.







Abstract
The development of integrated systems that mimic the multi&#8208;stage stiffness change of marine animals such as the sea cucumber requires the design of molecularly tailored structures. Herein, we used an integrated biomimicry design to fabricate a sea cucumber mimic using sidechain polypseudorotaxanes with tunable nano&#8208;to&#8208;macroscale properties. A series of polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;based sidechain copolymers were synthesized to form sidechain polypseudorotaxanes with &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;CDs). By tailoring the copolymers&#8217; molecular weights and their PEG grafting densities, we rationally tuned the sizes of the formed polypseudorotaxanes crystalline domain and the physical crosslinking density of the hydrogels, which facilitated 3D printing and the mechanical adaptability to these hydrogels. After 3D printing and photo&#8208;crosslinking, the obtained hydrogels exhibited large tensile strain and broad elastic&#8208;to&#8208;plastic variations upon &#945;&#8208;CD (de)threading. These discoveries enabled a successful fabrication of a sea cucumber mimic, demonstrating multi&#8208;stage stiffness changes.

         <title>Guidelines for Tuning the Excited State H&#252;ckel&#8211;Baird Hybrid Aromatic Character of Pro&#8208;Aromatic Quinoidal Compounds**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To assist in the H&#252;ckel versus Baird tug&#8208;of&#8208;war over the control of the aromaticity in the central ring of pro&#8208;aromatic quinoidal compounds in their lowest&#8208;lying singlet and triplet excited states, which is mostly won by H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromaticity, we identify several strategies that enhance the Baird&#8208;aromaticity of the central ring.







Abstract
Pro&#8208;aromatic molecules have higher&#8208;energy diradicaloid states that are significantly influenced by resonance structures in which conjugated rings take on H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromatic character. Recently, it has been argued that there are also pro&#8208;aromatic molecules that adopt central units with 4n&#960;&#8208;electron Baird&#8208;aromatic character in the T1 state, although detailed analysis suggests that these compounds are better labelled as T1 H&#252;ckel&#8211;Baird hybrid molecules where H&#252;ckel&#8208;aromaticity dominates. Herein, we consider a series of symmetrically substituted conjugated rings with potential Baird aromaticity in the lowest excited triplet and singlet states. Our computational results allow us to establish general guidelines for the rational design of molecules with excited state H&#252;ckel/Baird aromaticity in pro&#8208;aromatic quinoidal compounds. We found two main strategies to promote high Baird aromatic character: 1)&#8197;anionic and small conjugated rings with electron donating groups as substituents and small exocyclic groups with electron withdrawing substituents, or 2)&#8197;electron deficient conjugated rings with exocyclic electron&#8211;donor substitution.

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroaminoalkylation of Alkenes with Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tertiary amines can be used as substrates for the highly regioselective intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation of alkenes in the presence of a cationic titanium catalyst generated in situ from tetrabenzyltitanium and Ph3C[B(C6F5)4]. While in most cases, the involved C&#8722;H bond activation reaction occurs at N&#8208;methyl groups, N&#8208;methylazepane and N&#8208;methylpyrrolidine also undergo alkylation at the methylene group in position &#945; to the nitrogen atom.







Abstract
The first cationic titanium catalyst system for the intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation of alkenes with various tertiary alkylamines is presented. Corresponding reactions which involve the addition of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of a tertiary amine across the C&#8722;C double bond of an alkene take place at temperatures close to room temperature with excellent regioselectivity to deliver the branched products exclusively. Interestingly, for selected amines, &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond activation occurs not only at N&#8208;methyl but also at N&#8208;methylene groups.

         <title>Peroxo Species Formed in the Bulk of Silicate Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peroxo moieties formed in the bulk of carbon&#8208;coated Mn&#8208;doped Li2CoSiO4 are characterized by concurrent signatures in the form of an O&#8208;K pre&#8208;edge peak (XAS) and a peroxo O&#8211;O stretching mode (Raman). Peroxo formation proves to be a reversible oxygen redox mechanism for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes in real&#8208;world battery applications.







Abstract
Oxygen redox in Li&#8208;rich oxides may boost the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries by incorporating oxygen chemistry in solid cathodes. However, oxygen redox in the bulk usually entangles with voltage hysteresis and oxygen release, resulting in a prolonged controversy in literature on oxygen transformation. Here, we report spectroscopic evidence of peroxo species formed and confined in silicate cathodes amid oxygen redox at high voltage, accompanied by Co2+/Co3+ redox dominant at low voltage. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that localized electrons on dangling oxygen drive the O&#8208;O dimerization. The covalence between the binding cation and the O&#8208;O dimer determines the degree of electron transfer in oxygen transformation. Dimerization induces irreversible structural distortion and slow kinetics. But peroxo formation can minimize the voltage drop and volume expansion in cumulative cationic and anionic redox. These findings offer insights into oxygen redox in the bulk for the rational design of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Assisted Cation Adduction and Fragmentation of Small Metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoparticle&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry is studied for cation adduction and fragmentation of small metabolites. This work establishes the rules of cation&#8211;metabolite affinity and multiple cation adductions in charge transfer, characterizes the loss of given groups during fragmentation, and enhances the atomic/fragment coverage as defined for metabolite identification toward profiling.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry (MS) promises small&#8208;metabolite profiling as a tool of the future and calls for the comprehensive understanding of key procedures to enhance its capability. Herein, we studied cation adduction and fragmentation of small metabolites by a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches, via nanoparticle&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (LDI)&#8208;MS and MS/MS. We calculated the energies of adduction conformers and atomic bond orders to establish the rules of cation&#8211;metabolite affinity and multiple cation adductions in charge transfer. Further, we demonstrated the reaction paths of adducted ions and mapped the potential energy surfaces to characterize the loss of given groups during fragmentation. Finally, we successfully controlled metabolite fragmentation by selected and multiple adductions to enhance the atomic/fragment coverage as defined for metabolite identification toward profiling. Considering the success of MS in the analysis of large biomolecules, our work may have an impact and guide to advanced analysis of small metabolites.

         <title>Programming Gels Over a Wide pH Range Using Multicomponent Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that a multicomponent supramolecular gel with two opposite ionizable pendant groups on different components can exhibit unusual phase behavior involving cooperative hydrogen bonding between the components, allowing it to maintain a gel phase across a wide pH range. Autonomous programming between these two gel states is possible by an enzymatic reaction which allows the preparation of gels with improved mechanical properties.







Abstract
Multicomponent hydrogels offer a tremendous opportunity for preparing useful and exciting materials that cannot be accessed using a single component. Here, we describe an unusual multi&#8208;component low&#8208;molecular weight gelling system that exhibits pH&#8208;responsive behavior involving cooperative hydrogen bonding between the components, allowing it to maintain a gel phase across a wide pH range. Unlike traditional acid&#8208;triggered gels, our system undergoes a change in the underlying molecular packing and maintains the &#946;&#8208;sheet structure both at acidic and basic pH. We further establish that autonomous programming between these two gel states is possible by an enzymatic reaction which allows us to prepare gels with improved mechanical properties.

         <title>Thermal and pH Stabilities of i&#8208;DNA: Confronting in vitro Experiments with Models and In&#8208;Cell NMR Data</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
i&#8208;DNA is an emerging non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure as an anticancer target and as a basic element in the programmable bionanotechnology. A large number of i&#8208;DNA&#8208;prone sequences were tested to disclose how primary sequences determine the i&#8208;DNA stability both in vitro and in cells.







Abstract
Recent studies indicate that i&#8208;DNA, a four&#8208;stranded cytosine&#8208;rich DNA also known as the i&#8208;motif, is actually formed in vivo; however, a systematic study on sequence effects on stability has been missing. Herein, an unprecedented number of different sequences (271) bearing four runs of 3&#8211;6 cytosines with different spacer lengths has been tested. While i&#8208;DNA stability is nearly independent on total spacer length, the central spacer plays a special role on stability. Stability also depends on the length of the C&#8208;tracts at both acidic and neutral pHs. This study provides a global picture on i&#8208;DNA stability thanks to the large size of the introduced data set; it reveals unexpected features and allows to conclude that determinants of i&#8208;DNA stability do not mirror those of G&#8208;quadruplexes. Our results illustrate the structural roles of loops and C&#8208;tracts on i&#8208;DNA stability, confirm its formation in cells, and allow establishing rules to predict its stability.

         <title>Targeting the Main Protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2: From the Establishment of High Throughput Screening to the Design of Tailored Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main protease (Mpro) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has been recognized as a significant drug target to treat COVID&#8208;19. The design of a new fluorogenic substrate, the recombinant expression of Mpro and the development of an HTS assay were combined with a structure&#8208;based rational approach leading to the discovery of tailored azanitriles and indole pyridyl esters as novel, outstandingly potent Mpro inhibitors.







Abstract
The main protease of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (Mpro), the causative agent of COVID&#8208;19, constitutes a significant drug target. A new fluorogenic substrate was kinetically compared to an internally quenched fluorescent peptide and shown to be ideally suitable for high throughput screening with recombinantly expressed Mpro. Two classes of protease inhibitors, azanitriles and pyridyl esters, were identified, optimized and subjected to in&#8208;depth biochemical characterization. Tailored peptides equipped with the unique azanitrile warhead exhibited concomitant inhibition of Mpro and cathepsin&#8197;L, a protease relevant for viral cell entry. Pyridyl indole esters were analyzed by a positional scanning. Our focused approach towards Mpro inhibitors proved to be superior to virtual screening. With two irreversible inhibitors, azanitrile 8 (kinac/Ki=37&#8201;500&#8197;m&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, Ki=24.0&#8197;nm) and pyridyl ester 17 (kinac/Ki=29&#8201;100&#8197;m&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, Ki=10.0&#8197;nm), promising drug candidates for further development have been discovered.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission toward Harvesting Cold White Light from Warm White Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) behavior of undoped two&#8208;dimensional perovskite (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)2PbCl4 ((PEA)2PbCl4) nanocrystals was studied. An intriguing 5 times PIE phenomenon was achieved at a mild pressure of 0.4&#8197;GPa and, more importantly, the emission of cold white light, which is 1.6 times ambient photoluminescence intensity, can be successfully quenched by pressure treatment.







Abstract
The pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) behavior of halide perovskites has attracted widespread attention and has potential application in pressure sensing. However, high&#8208;pressure reversibility largely inhibits practical applications. Here, we describe the emission enhancement and non&#8208;doping control of the color temperature in two&#8208;dimensional perovskite (C6H5CH2CH2NH3)2PbCl4 ((PEA)2PbCl4) nanocrystals (NCs) through high&#8208;pressure processing. A remarkable 5 times PIE was achieved at a mild pressure of 0.4&#8197;GPa, which was highly associated with the enhanced radiative recombination of self&#8208;trapped excitons. Of particular importance is the retention of the 1.6 times emission of dense (PEA)2PbCl4 NCs upon the complete release of pressure, accompanied by a color change from &#8220;warm&#8221; (4403&#8197;K) to &#8220;cold&#8221; white light with 14295&#8197;K. The irreversible pressure&#8208;induced structural amorphization, which facilitates the remaining local distortion of inorganic Pb&#8208;Cl octahedra with respect to the steric hindrance of organic PEA+ cations, should be greatly responsible for the quenched high&#8208;efficiency photoluminescence.

         <title>Ligand Strain and Its Conformational Complexity Is a Major Factor in the Binding of Cyclic Dinucleotides to STING Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complexity of the thermodynamics associated with the binding of fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated cyclic dinucleotides to the STING protein was analyzed and explained by employing a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. Large enthalpy/entropy compensations can only be explained by complementing the structural and energetic analysis of the complex with conformational analysis of free ligands.







Abstract
STING (stimulator of interferon genes) is a key regulator of innate immunity that has recently been recognized as a promising drug target. STING is activated by cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) which eventually leads to expression of type I interferons and other cytokines. Factors underlying the affinity of various CDN analogues are poorly understood. Herein, we correlate structural biology, isothermal calorimetry (ITC) and computational modeling to elucidate factors contributing to binding of six CDNs&#8212;three pairs of natural (ribo) and fluorinated (2&#8242;&#8208;fluororibo) 3&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;CDNs. X&#8208;ray structural analyses of six {STING:CDN} complexes did not offer any explanation for the different affinities of the studied ligands. ITC showed entropy/enthalpy compensation up to 25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for this set of similar ligands. The higher affinities of fluorinated analogues are explained with help of computational methods by smaller loss of entropy upon binding and by smaller strain (free) energy.

         <title>Efficient Aerobic Oxidation of Organic Molecules by Multistep Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in aerobic oxidations using electron transfer mediators (ETMs) via multistep electron relay is highlighted. The coupled catalytic systems significantly facilitate the transport of the electrons from the reduced substrate&#8208;selective redox catalyst (SSRC) to O2, thereby increasing the efficiency of the aerobic oxidation. This strategy has become powerful and valuable in synthetic organic chemistry.







Abstract
This Minireview presents recent important homogenous aerobic oxidative reactions which are assisted by electron transfer mediators (ETMs). Compared with direct oxidation by molecular oxygen (O2), the use of a coupled catalyst system with ETMs leads to a lower overall energy barrier via stepwise electron transfer. This cooperative catalytic process significantly facilitates the transport of electrons from the reduced form of the substrate&#8208;selective redox catalyst (SSRCred) to O2, thereby increasing the efficiency of the aerobic oxidation. In this Minireview, we have summarized the advances accomplished in recent years in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed as well as metal&#8208;free aerobic oxidations of organic molecules in the presence of ETMs. In addition, the recent progress of photochemical and electrochemical oxidative functionalization using ETMs and O2 as the terminal oxidant is also highlighted. Furthermore, the mechanisms of these transformations are showcased.

         <title>Cascade Oxidative C&#8722;H Annulation of Thiophenes: Heck&#8208;Type Pathway Enables Concise Access to Thienoacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pursuit of efficient synthetic route to thienoacenes represents an appealing yet challenging task in the fields of both organic synthetic chemistry and organic functional materials. In this work, we disclose a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cascade C&#8722;H annulation of phenacyl phosphoniums with (benzo)thiophenes via a Heck&#8208;type pathway to provide a new class of planar thienoacenes, which involves the formation of three Caryl&#8722;Caryl bonds and one Caryl&#8722;O bond in a single operation. The neutral S,O&#8208;heteroacenes exhibit superior stability and adopt a herringbone&#8208;like packing mode with efficient &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking in the crystals, suggesting their potential in organic semiconducting materials. This work first exemplifies the superiority of cascade oxidative C&#8722;H annulation involving a Heck&#8208;type pathway in the development of concise access to heteroacenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Threefold Collaborative Stabilization of Ag14&#8208;Nanorods by Hydrophobic Ti16&#8208;Oxo Clusters and Alkynes: Designable Assembly and Solid&#8208;State Optical&#8208;Limiting Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ag nanoclusters have received increasing attention due to their atomically precise and diverse structures and intriguing optical properties. Nevertheless, the inherent instability of Ag nanoclusters has seriously hindered their practical applications. In this work, for the first time, Ag cluster is collaboratively protected by hydrophobic Ti&#8208;oxo cluster and alkyne ligand. At the beginning, a pyramidal Ag5  cluster terminated with  tBuC&#8801;C&#8208;  and CH3CN was inserted into the cavity of a  Ti8&#8208;oxo nanoring to form  Ag5@Ti8. To further overcome the instability of acetonitrile terminated silver site, such two  Ag5@Ti8&#160;clusters could sandwich an Ag4  unit to form Ag14&#8208;Nanorod@Ti16&#8208;oxo&#8208;Nanoring (Ag14@Ti16) in the absence of CH3CN, which is peripherally protected by fluorophenyl groups and alkyne caps. As a result, such threefold protected (hydrophobic fluorinated organic layer, Ti&#8208;O shell and terminal alkyne ligands)  Ag14@Ti16  exhibits superhydrophobicity and excellent ambient stability, enabling it with solid&#8208;state optical limiting characteristics. The success of this work provides meaningful guidance for improving the stability of metallic clusters to extend their future practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of in&#8208;cell protein crystal for environmentally responsive construction of a supramolecular filament</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein assemblies can be designed for development of nano&#8208;bio materials. This has been achieved by modulating protein&#8208;protein interactions. However, fabrication of highly ordered protein assemblies remains challenging. Protein crystals, which have highly ordered arrangements of protein molecules, provide useful source matrices for synthesizing artificial protein assemblies. Here, we describe construction of a supramolecular filament structure by engineering covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions in a protein crystal. Performing in&#8208;cell crystallization of  Trypanosoma brucei  cysteine protease cathepsin B (TbCatB), we achieved a precise arrangement of protein molecules while suppressing random aggregation due to disulfide bonds. We succeeded in synthesizing bundled filament from the crystals by autoxidation of cysteinyl thiols after the isolation of the crystals from living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Potent Cyclic Tetrapeptide for Lead Detoxification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead (Pb) is a ubiquitous poisonous metal, affecting the health of vast populations worldwide. Medications to treat Pb poisoning suffer from various limitations and are often toxic due to insufficient metal selectivity. Here, we report a cyclic tetrapeptide that selectively binds Pb and eradicates its toxic effect on the cellular level, with superior potency than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art drugs. The Pb&#8208;peptide complex is remarkably strong and was characterized experimentally and computationally. Accompanied by the lack of toxicity and enhanced stability of this peptide, these qualities indicate its merit as a potential remedy for Pb poisoning.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Defluorinative Alkylation of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes: Switching Regioselectivity via Simple Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional approaches on Pd&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening cross&#8208;couplings of  gem  &#8208;difluorocyclopropanes with nucleophiles predominantly deliver the &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkene scaffolds (linear selectivity). Herein, we report a cooperative strategy that can completely switch the reaction selectivity to give the alkylated &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkene skeletons (branched selectivity). The unique reactivity of hydrazones that enabling analogous inner&#8208;sphere 3,3&#8242;&#8208;reductive elimination driven by denitrogenation, as well as the assistance of steric&#8208;embedded  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, are the key to the success tto switch the regioselectivity. A wide range of hydrazones that derived from naturally abundant aryl and alkyl aldehydes are well applicable, and various  gem  &#8208;difluorocyclopropanes, including those pharmaceutical and biological molecule&#8208;modified ones, can be efficiently functionalized with  high value alkylated &#945;&#8208;fluor  inated alkene motifs under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Film for Three&#8208;State&#160;Near&#8208;Infrared Electrochromism and&#160;Molecular&#160;Logic Gate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Kagome structure covalent organic framework (COF) film with three&#8208;state near&#8208;infrared (NIR) electrochromic properties was designed and synthesized. The morphology and structure characterization revealed that the COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film was composed of hexagonal nanosheets with high crystallinity. The COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film exhibit three reversible color states at different applied potentials, and high absorption spectra changes in the NIR region, which can be ascribed to the strong intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) interaction of the Class III mixed&#8208;valence systems of the conjugated triphenylamine species. The COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film showed the sub&#8208;second response time (1.3 s for coloring and 0.7 s for bleaching at 1050 nm) and the long retention time in the NIR region. In comparison with the amorphous film with the same monomers, COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film show superior NIR electrochromic properties in term of response time and stability, which could be attributed to the highly ordered porous structure and the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking structure of the COFTPDA&#8208;PDA architecture. Furthermore, the COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film was successfully applied in mimicking flip&#8208;flop logic gate with optical memory functions.</dc:description>

The key features of our synthesis include: a) introduction of chirality via enantioselective deprotonation of a prochiral 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone; b) use of methoxymethyl (MOM) ether as both a hydroxyl protective group and a latent oxonium species for the formation of bridged oxepane and c) domino double reductive cyclization to build both the indole and the piperidine ring at the end of the synthesis. The synthesis confirmed the absolute configuration of these natural products assigned based on the biogenetic hypothesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical strategies for making strong graphene materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene materials have been widely applied in various fields due to their remarkable mechanical and electrical properties. However, two obstacles arise during the assembly of the graphene platelets into macroscale graphene materials and composites that impair the performance of the resultant graphene materials. The first is the voids between the graphene platelets, and the second is the wrinkling of the graphene platelets. In the past decade, several strategies have been developed to eliminate these obstacles. These strategies result in strong macroscale graphene materials, such as graphene fibers with a tensile strength over 3.4 GPa and sheets with a tensile strength over 1.5 GPa. Therefore, the resultant strong graphene materials are used in many practical applications. This review summarizes these developed effective strategies for assembling graphene materials and compares their advantages and drawbacks. Moreover, the process of preparation, the fundamental mechanical properties (tensile strength, toughness, and Young&#8217;s modulus), and the wide spectrum of electrical and magnetic properties (electrical conductivity, electromagnetic interference shielding, thermal conductance, ion transport, and electrochemical energy storage) are also discussed. Finally, our outlook for this field&#8217;s future is presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Structural Diversity of Protein Building Blocks with Noncanonical Amino Acids Biosynthesized from Aromatic Thiols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nearly 50 novel noncanonical amino acids were efficiently biosynthesized in cells from simple aromatic thiol precursors and incorporated into proteins via genetic code expansion. Expression yields of proteins containing biosynthesized reactive amino acids were high, which allowed subsequent bioorthogonal chemical conjugation for both research and therapeutic applications.







Abstract
Incorporation of structurally novel noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins is valuable for both scientific and biomedical applications. To expand the structural diversity of available ncAAs and to reduce the burden of chemically synthesizing them, we have developed a general and simple biosynthetic method for genetically encoding novel ncAAs into recombinant proteins by feeding cells with economical commercially available or synthetically accessible aromatic thiols. We demonstrate that nearly 50 ncAAs with a diverse array of structures can be biosynthesized from these simple small&#8208;molecule precursors by hijacking the cysteine biosynthetic enzymes, and the resulting ncAAs can subsequently be incorporated into proteins via an expanded genetic code. Moreover, we demonstrate that bioorthogonal reactive groups such as aromatic azides and aromatic ketones can be incorporated into green fluorescent protein or a therapeutic antibody with high yields, allowing for subsequent chemical conjugation.

         <title>Reversing the Chirality of Surface Ligands Can Improve the Biosafety and Pharmacokinetics of Cationic Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Severe toxicity and rapid  in vivo  clearance of cationic nanomaterials seriously hinder their clinical translation. Present strategies to improve the biosafety and  in vivo  performance of cationic nanomaterials require neutralization of positive charge, which often compromises their efficacy. Herein, we report that substituting L&#8208;glutathione (L&#8208;GSH) on cationic gold nanoclusters (GNCs) with its D&#8208;counterpart can effectively improve the biosafety and pharmacokinetics. Compared with L&#8208;GNCs, D&#8208;GNCs do not exhibit cellular cytotoxicity, hemolysis, or acute damage to organs. Cationic D&#8208;GNCs show less cell internalization than L&#8208;GNCs, and do not induce cellular apoptosis.  In vivo  , the chirality of surface ligands distinctly affects the pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting abilities of D&#8208; /L&#8208;GNCs. D&#8208;GNCs show higher extended circulation time in blood plasma compared to similarly&#8208;sized and poly (ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles. This work demonstrates that the choice of chirality of surface ligands can determine toxicities and pharmacokinetics of cationic nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfering with Metabolic Profile of Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer using Rationally&#8208;Designed Metformin Prodrugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. Even though TNBC patients respond well to chemotherapy, they quickly relapse, resulting in poor prognoses and low survival rates. TNBCs are characterized by an aberrant metabolic phenotype with high metastatic capacity due to reprogramming of metabolic pathways to fulfill their bioenergetics demands. We designed a series of novel Au  III  cyclometalated prodrugs of energy&#8208;disrupting Type II antidiabetic drugs namely, metformin and phenformin. Prodrug activation and release of the metformin ligand was achieved by tuning the cyclometalated Au  III  fragment. The lead complex  3  met  was 6000&#8208;fold more cytotoxic compared to uncoordinated metformin and demonstrated synergistic action of metformin and Au  III  species. Importantly,  3  met  significantly reduced tumor burden in mice with aggressive breast cancers and caused lymphocytic infiltration into tumor tissues, indicating activation of immune system. We ascribe these effects to the ability of  3  met  to target energy&#8208;dependent TNBCs through the interference with cancer cell energy production and inhibition of associated cellular pro&#8208;survival responses to selectively induce deadly metabolic catastrophe.</dc:description>

         <title>Multinuclear Ag Clusters Sandwiched by Pt Complex Units: Fluxional Behavior and Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Cluster Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New types of multinuclear sandwich complexes consisting of an Ag3 core and Pt complex units are reported. The first observation of CD and CPL properties from a multinuclear sandwich complex was achieved after optical resolution using a chiral anion.







Abstract
Multinuclear Ag clusters sandwiched by Pt complex units were synthesized and characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR studies. The sandwich&#8208;shaped multinuclear Ag complexes showed two different types of fluxional behavior in solution: rapid slippage of Pt complex units on the Ag3 core and a reversible demetalation&#8211;metalation reaction by the treatment with Cl anion and Ag ion, respectively. The Ag2 complex obtained by demetalation reaction from the Ag3 complex displayed U to Z isomerization. These multinuclear Ag complexes showed strong photoluminescence whose properties depended on the existence of Pt&#8594;Ag dative bonds. The Ag3 complex, identified to be &#8220;chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cluster&#8221;, was optically resolved by the formation of a diastereomeric salt with a chiral anion. The enantiomers show circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties which is unprecedented for compounds based on a chiral sandwich structure. Theoretical calculations allow to understand their structural features and photophysical properties.

         <title>Development of Generic G Protein Peptidomimetics Able to Stabilize Active State Gs Protein&#8208;Coupled Receptors for Application in Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the crystal structure of the &#946;2AR coupled to the Gs protein, a helical key epitope was chosen as a template to design peptidomimetics able to stabilize active&#8208;state Gs protein&#8208;coupled receptors. Radioligand assays were performed in the presence of the peptide mimetics and demonstrated the stabilization of Gs receptors in active conformation, opening a gateway for fragment&#8208;based, agonist&#8208;earmarked drug discovery programs.







Abstract
G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent an important group of membrane proteins that play a central role in modern medicine. Unfortunately, conformational promiscuity hampers full therapeutic exploitation of GPCRs, since the largest population of the receptor will adopt a basal conformation, which subsequently challenges screens for agonist drug discovery programs. Herein, we describe a set of peptidomimetics able to mimic the ability of G proteins in stabilizing the active state of the &#946;2 adrenergic receptor (&#946;2AR) and the dopamine 1 receptor (D1R). During fragment&#8208;based screening efforts, these (un)constrained peptide analogues of the &#945;5 helix in Gs proteins, were able to identify agonism pre&#8208;imprinted fragments for the examined GPCRs, and as such, they behave as a generic tool, enabling an engagement in agonist earmarked discovery programs.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Homochiral Radical Cage with Paramagnetic Behaviors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homochiral radical cage containing four spin centers was self&#8208;assembled in high yield by imine condensation in a one&#8208;pot manner, without purification. Intramolecular interactions such as [CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] and hydrogen&#8208;bonding endow the cage with stable homochirality. Magnetic measurements demonstrated that the tetra&#8208;radical cage exhibits a typical spin&#8208;half paramagnetic behavior with a spin concentration of 3.58 spins/cage, indicating that each radical within a cage is weakly coupled.







Abstract
Condensation of an inherently C3&#8208;symmetric polychlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical trisaldehyde with tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TREN) yields a [4+4] tetrahedral radical cage as a racemic pair of homochiral enantiomers in 75&#8201;% isolated yield. The structure was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, confirming the homochirality of each cage framework. The homochirality results from intramolecular [CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions within the cage framework. The four PTM radicals in a cage undergo weak through&#8208;space coupling. Magnetic measurements demonstrated that each cage bears 3.58 spins.

         <title>The Protein Corona Leads to Deformation of Spherical Micelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fructose&#8208;based block copolymer was self&#8208;assembled into four different micelles with various shell polymer densities. The most brush&#8208;like micelle was observed to have the highest amount of protein adsorption and the lowest cellular uptake. Small angle scattering revealed that the protein corona transformed the spherical micelles into spheroidal micelles and the nanoparticles used in the biological experiment were therefore non&#8208;spherical.







Abstract
The formation of a non&#8208;specific protein corona around nanoparticles (NPs) has been identified as one of the culprits for failed nanomedicine. The amount and type of adsorbed protein from the blood plasma are known to determine the fate of NPs and the accessibility of targeting ligands. Herein, we show that the adsorbed protein may not only enlarge the NPs and change their surface properties but also, in the case of soft NPs such as polymer micelles, lead to deformation. Poly(1&#8208;O&#8208;methacryloyl &#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;fructopyranose)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(methylmethacrylate) (P(1&#8208;O&#8208;MAFru)&#8208;b&#8208;PMMA) block co&#8208;polymers were self&#8208;assembled into NPs with a spherical core&#8211;shell morphology as determined by small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Upon incubation with albumin, TEM, SANS, and small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) revealed the adsorption of albumin and deformation of the NPs with a spheroid geometry. Removal of the protein led to the reversal of the morphology back to the spherical core&#8211;shell structure. Structural studies and cell studies of uptake of the NPs imply that the observed deformation may influence blood circulation time and cell uptake.

         <title>Activation of 2&#8208;Cyclohexenone by BF3 Coordination: Mechanistic Insights from Theory and Experiment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis acid complex of 2&#8208;cyclohexenone and BF3 relaxes to the active triplet state after photoexcitation in less than a picosecond. This process can be followed by XMS&#8208;CASPT2 dynamics and transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
Lewis acids have recently been recognized as catalysts enabling enantioselective photochemical transformations. Mechanistic studies on these systems are however rare, either due to their absorption at wavelengths shorter than 260&#8197;nm, or due to the limitations of theoretical dynamic studies for larger complexes. In this work, we overcome these challenges and employ sub&#8208;30&#8208;fs transient absorption in the UV, in combination with a highly accurate theoretical treatment on the XMS&#8208;CASPT2 level. We investigate 2&#8208;cyclohexenone and its complex to boron trifluoride and analyze the observed dynamics based on trajectory calculations including non&#8208;adiabatic coupling and intersystem crossing. This approach explains all ultrafast decay pathways observed in the complex. We show that the Lewis acid remains attached to the substrate in the triplet state, which in turn explains why chiral boron&#8208;based Lewis acids induce a high enantioselectivity in photocycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Pseudo Natural Products&#8212;Chemical Evolution of Natural Product Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;Natural Products provide new opportunities in the discovery of bioactive small molecules and can be regarded as a human&#8208;driven chemical evolution of natural product structure.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;natural products (PNPs) combine natural product (NP) fragments in novel arrangements not accessible by current biosynthesis pathways. As such they can be regarded as non&#8208;biogenic fusions of NP&#8208;derived fragments. They inherit key biological characteristics of the guiding natural product, such as chemical and physiological properties, yet define small molecule chemotypes with unprecedented or unexpected bioactivity. We iterate the design principles underpinning PNP scaffolds and highlight their syntheses and biological investigations. We provide a cheminformatic analysis of PNP collections assessing their molecular properties and shape diversity. We propose and discuss how the iterative analysis of NP structure, design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of PNPs can be regarded as a human&#8208;driven branch of the evolution of natural products, that is, a chemical evolution of natural product structure.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Liquids Based on Siloxybinaphthyls: Best Binaphthyl Dihedral Angle in the Excited State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) neat liquids based on siloxybinaphthyls were developed. The position of the substitution has a crucial effect on the CPL activity and liquefaction. In the excited state, the binaphthyls specifically adopt a transoid conformation with a dihedral angle of 121&#176;, which is close to the best binaphthyl dihedral angle for the high CPL activity.







Abstract
A series of axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyls with trialkylsiloxy (OSiR3) groups were synthesized. Among them, 1&#8201;a&#8211;c possessing OSiR3 groups at the 7,7&#8242;&#8208;positions and methyl groups at the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;positions were liquids at room temperature, and the neat liquids showed circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) (R=Bu; &#934;fl,liquid=0.21, |glum,liquid|=1.6&#215;10&#8722;3). The |glum,liquid| value is the highest of pure liquids. These compounds remained liquid over a broad range of temperatures, down to &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C. Time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations indicated that in the excited state, the binaphthyls adopt a transoid conformation with a small angle between the electric and magnetic transition dipole moments (&#952;&#956;,m=77&#176;), which is a key factor in their CPL activity. The best binaphthyl dihedral angle in the excited state is approximately 110&#176;.

These silicon&#8208;based macrocycles are obtained from 2D2/s&#8208;block metaliodide/gallium(III)&#8208;iodide (2D2=(Me4Si2O)2) Lewis&#8208;acid systems which enable s&#8208;block metal templated Si&#8722;O bond activation and subsequent oligomerization. The coordination ability of these macrocycles is evaluated and a mechanism of formation is suggested by means of DFT calculations.







Abstract
We herein report the synthesis, structures, coordination ability, and mechanism of formation of silicon analogs of crown ethers. An oligomerization of 2D2 (I) (2Dn,=(Me4Si2O)n) was achieved by the reaction with GaI3 and MIx (M=Li, Na, Mg, Ca, Sr). In these reactions the metal cations serve as template and the anions (I&#8722;/[GaI4]&#8722;) are required as nucleophiles. In case of MIx=LiI, [Li(2D3)GaI4] (1) is formed. In case of MIx=NaI, MgI2, CaI2, and SrI2 the compounds [M(2D4)(GaI4)x] (M=Mg2+ (3), Ca2+ (4), Sr2+ (5) are obtained. Furthermore the proton complex [H(2D3)][Ga2I7] (6) was isolated and structurally characterized. All complexes were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, DOSY experiments and, except for compound 3, also by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Quantum chemical calculations were carried out to compare the affinity of M+ to 2Dn and other ligands and to shed light on the formation of larger rings from smaller ones.

         <title>Assembly of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membrane on Solid Electrocatalyst: Introducing Molecular&#8208;Level Control Over Heterogeneous CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemically active Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have been progressively recognized for their use in solar fuel production schemes. Typically, they are utilized as platforms for heterogeneous tethering of exceptionally large concentration of molecular electrocatalysts onto electrodes. Yet so far, the potential influence of their extraordinary chemical modularity on electrocatalysis has been overlooked. Herein, we demonstrate that, when assembled on a solid Ag CO2 reduction electrocatalyst, a non&#8208;catalytic UiO&#8208;66 MOF acts as a porous membrane that systematically tunes the active site&#8217;s immediate chemical environment, leading to a drastic enhancement of electrocatalytic activity and selectivity. Electrochemical analysis shows that the MOF membrane improves catalytic performance through physical and electrostatic regulation of reactants delivery towards the catalytic sites. The MOF also stabilizes catalytic intermediates via modulation of active site&#8217;s secondary coordination sphere. This concept can be expanded to a wide range of proton&#8208;coupled electrochemical reactions, providing new means for precise, molecular&#8208;level manipulation of heterogeneous solar fuels systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Porous ionic liquids are non volatile, versatile materials that associate porosity and fluidity. New porous ionic liquids, based on the ZIF&#8208;8 metal&#8208;organic framework and on phosphonium acetate or levulinate salts, were prepared and show an increased capacity to absorb carbon dioxide at low pressures. Porous suspensions based on phosphonium levulinate ionic liquid absorb reversibly 103% more carbon dioxide per mass than pure ZIF&#8208;8 per mass at 1bar and 303K . We show how the rational combination of MOFs with ionic liquids can greatly enhance low pressure CO 2 absorption, paving the way toward a new generation of high&#8208;performance, readily available liquid materials for effective low pressure carbon capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon dots based white light&#8208;emitting diodes with adjustable correlated color temperature guided by machine learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) have attracted extensive attention in white light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) research due to their inherent optical advantages, such as emission wavelength tunability, high quantum yield (QY) and low photobleaching properties. However, their wide emission spectrum and the electron transfer between CDs make the fabrication of their light&#8208;emitting devices very complicated and difficult. Here, we show the fabrication of the CDs with green and orange emissions from PTCDA (perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride). Using these CDs as emitters, the orange (or green) CDs LEDs were fabricated, which show electroluminescence (EL) spectra centered at 560 nm (or 498 nm) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.98% (1.76%) adhering a luminescence of 626 cd/m2 (or 519 cd/m2). We successfully constructed the machine learning model to predict PL CCT value. With the model, we achieve white photoluminescence (PL) emission with adjustable correlated color temperature (CCT) from 3093 to 11018 K via combining blue, green and orange CDs. We obtain the warm white CDs LEDs with CCT of 3107, 4071 and 4548 K, and cold white CDs LEDs with CCT of 5632 (CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33), EQE: 1.18%, luminescence: 598 cd/m2) and 6034 K accurately.</dc:description>

         <title>An Affinity&#8208;Based, Cysteine&#8208;Specific ATP Analog for Kinase&#8208;Catalyzed Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Characterization of kinase&#8211;substrate pairs is an enabling strategy to understand kinase&#8208;related diseases and identify new drug targets. An affinity&#8208;based kinase&#8208;dependent crosslinker, ATP&#8208;MAc, is introduced to capture kinase&#8211;substrate interactions under physiological conditions. Unlike prior ATP&#8208;photocrosslinking analogs, ATP&#8208;MAc covalently links only cysteine&#8208;containing kinases with their substrates without the need for UV light.







Abstract
Kinases mediate cell signaling pathways by catalyzing protein phosphorylation. Irregularities in kinase activity are directly associated with disease conditions. Therefore, methods to identify substrates of a particular kinase are needed to understand signaling cascades in normal and diseased states. Photocrosslinking ATP analogs provide powerful tools to study kinases by covalently linking kinases with substrates. However, the involvement of UV light and nonspecific reactivity of current ATP&#8208;photocrosslinkers challenge kinase&#8211;substrate identification. We report here an affinity&#8208;based crosslinking ATP analog, ATP&#8208;methylacrylamide (ATP&#8208;MAc), that contains a cysteine&#8208;reactive acrylamide crosslinking group, which avoids the UV irradiation and non&#8208;specific reactivity of prior analogs. Using in&#8197;vitro kinase assays, ATP&#8208;MAc acts as a kinase co&#8208;substrate and covalently crosslinks only kinases containing cysteines in the active site. ATP&#8208;MAc was also able to crosslink cellular proteins in lysates, documenting compatibility with cell&#8208;based studies.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteoliposome carriers for mass spectrometric analysis of membrane&#8208;associated proteins and peptides enable the investigation of lipid clusters, protein oligomers, and protein&#8211;lipid interactions. This approach is versatile, applicable to many peripheral membrane proteins/peptides, and can be linked with functional assays.







Abstract
Membrane proteins are key players of the cell. Their structure and the interactions they form with their lipid environment are required to understand their function. Here we explore liposomes as membrane mimetics for mass spectrometric analysis of peripheral membrane proteins and peptides. Liposomes are advantageous over other membrane mimetics in that they are easy to prepare, can be varied in size and composition, and are suitable for functional assays. We demonstrate that they dissociate into lipid clusters in the gas phase of a mass spectrometer while intact protein and protein&#8211;lipid complexes are retained. We exemplify this approach by employing different liposomes including proteoliposomes of two model peptides/proteins differing in size. Our results pave the way for the general application of liposomes for mass spectrometric analysis of membrane&#8208;associated proteins.

&lt;p&gt;Membrane proteins are key players of the cell. Their structure and the interactions they form with their lipid environment are required to understand their function. Here we explore liposomes as membrane mimetics for mass spectrometric analysis of peripheral membrane proteins and peptides. Liposomes are advantageous over other membrane mimetics in that they are easy to prepare, can be varied in size and composition, and are suitable for functional assays. We demonstrate that they dissociate into lipid clusters in the gas phase of a mass spectrometer while intact protein and protein&#8211;lipid complexes are retained. We exemplify this approach by employing different liposomes including proteoliposomes of two model peptides/proteins differing in size. Our results pave the way for the general application of liposomes for mass spectrometric analysis of membrane&#8208;associated proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Probing Physical Oxidation State by Resonant X&#8208;ray Emission Spectroscopy: Applications to Iron Model Complexes and Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assigning transition&#8208;metal physical oxidation states is a major goal of X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. However, competing influences of covalency and d&#8208;count on K&#946; XES spectra often make assignments ambiguous. It is now shown that resonant K&#946; X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (RXES) yields unambiguous oxidation&#8208;state determinations for iron monomers, dimers, cubanes, and metalloenzymes.







Abstract
The ability of resonant X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (XES) to recover physical oxidation state information, which may often be ambiguous in conventional X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, is demonstrated. By combining K&#946; XES with resonant excitation in the XAS pre&#8208;edge region, resonant K&#946; XES (or 1s3p RXES) data are obtained, which probe the 3dn+1 final&#8208;state configuration. Comparison of the non&#8208;resonant and resonant XES for a series of high&#8208;spin ferrous and ferric complexes shows that oxidation state assignments that were previously unclear are now easily made. The present study spans iron tetrachlorides, iron sulfur clusters, and the MoFe protein of nitrogenase. While 1s3p RXES studies have previously been reported, to our knowledge, 1s3p RXES has not been previously utilized to resolve questions of metal valency in highly covalent systems. As such, the approach presented herein provides chemists with means to more rigorously and quantitatively address challenging electronic&#8208;structure questions.

         <title>A SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Binding DNA Aptamer that Inhibits Pseudovirus Infection by an RBD&#8208;Independent Mechanism**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SP6 is a DNA aptamer binding to the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein and inhibits pseudovirus infection of cells. As the aptamer does not interfere with the CoV&#8208;2S ACE2 receptor binding domain, it provides an RBD&#8208;independent mechanism of virus inhibition.







Abstract
The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of the coronavirus SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (CoV2&#8208;S) binds to the human angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) representing the initial contact point for leveraging the infection cascade. We used an automated selection process and identified an aptamer that specifically interacts with CoV2&#8208;S. The aptamer does not bind to the RBD of CoV2&#8208;S and does not block the interaction of CoV2&#8208;S with ACE2. Nevertheless, infection studies revealed potent and specific inhibition of pseudoviral infection by the aptamer. The present study opens up new vistas in developing SARS&#8208;CoV2 infection inhibitors, independent of blocking the ACE2 interaction of the virus, and harnesses aptamers as potential drug candidates and tools to disentangle hitherto inaccessible infection modalities, which is of particular interest in light of the increasing number of escape mutants that are currently being reported.

         <title>Antitumor Agents Based on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design principles and structure&#8211;function relationships of antitumor agents based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks are summarized, and the current challenges and opportunities are also discussed.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise for biomedical applications owing to their unique properties. The porous structures make MOFs excellent candidates for the delivery of different drugs; the flexibility in choosing metal ions and organic ligands makes it feasible to prepare MOFs with intrinsic antitumor activities and further devise MOF&#8211;drug synergistic systems; many other types of antitumor agents could also be developed using MOFs as the precursors/templates. Thus, the past two decades have witnessed the great development of MOF&#8208;based drugs, especially in the antitumor field. This Minireview mainly focuses on the design and applications of MOF&#8208;based antitumor agents. Four aspects covering the whole field are introduced: MOFs as carriers, MOFs as antitumor agents, MOF&#8211;drug synergistic systems, and MOF&#8208;derived antitumor agents. The challenges and opportunities of MOFs for clinical antitumor applications are also discussed.

         <dc:description>
An inverse sandwich&#8208;type cluster dimer of [K(2,2,2&#8208;crypt)]4{[K2ZnSn8(ZnMes)]2} was synthesized. The highly charged [Sn8]6&#8722; is captured by mixed&#8208;valence ZnI/ZnII to form the closo&#8208;[Zn2Sn8] bridged by a ZnI&#8208;ZnI bond. The Zn&#8211;Sn compound not only indicates the [Sn8]6&#8722; can act as a novel bridging ligand like arene, but shows the interdisciplinary integration of cluster chemistry and zinc chemistry.







Abstract
Since [Sn8]6&#8722; was discovered from the solid&#8208;state phase in 2000, its solution chemistry has been elusive due to the high charges and chemical activity. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of an inverse sandwich&#8208;type cluster dimer {[K2ZnSn8(ZnMes)]2}4&#8722; (1&#8201;a), in which the highly charged [Sn8]6&#8722; is captured by mixed&#8208;valence ZnI/ZnII to form the dimer {closo&#8208;[Zn2Sn8]}2 moieties bridged by a Zn&#8208;Zn bond. Such Zn&#8208;Sn cluster not only exhibits a novel example of mixed&#8208;valence ZnI/ZnII for stabilizing highly active anion species, but also indicates the [Sn8]6&#8722; cluster can act as a novel bridging ligand, like arene, with a &#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;fashion. Theoretical calculations indicate that a significant delocalization of electrons over Zn atoms plays a vital role in the stabilization of the [Sn8]6&#8722; species. The AdNDP and magnetic response analyses clearly showed the presence of local &#963;&#8208;aromaticity in three cluster fragments: two ZnSn4 caps and Sn8 square antiprism.

         <title>New Synthetic Approaches to N&#8208;Aryl and &#960;&#8208;Expanded Diketopyrrolopyrroles as New Building Blocks for Organic Optoelectronic Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new easily handled synthetic method toward N&#8208;aryl DPPs was reported through the reaction of H&#8208;DPP with diaryliodonium salt in the presence of CuI. The N&#8208;aryl DPPs are fluorescent in solutions and solid states. Furthermore, the reaction can lead to &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs by using Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst. These &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs exhibit good semiconducting properties, demonstrating their potential applications in organic semiconductors of high performance.







Abstract
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as a building block has been intensively investigated for organic semiconductors and light emitting materials. The synthesis of N&#8208;aryl DPPs remains challenging. Herein, we firstly report a new easily handled synthetic method toward N&#8208;aryl DPPs through H&#8208;DPP with diaryliodonium salt in the presence of CuI, which shows broad reaction scope. Sixteen N&#8208;aryl DPPs, including phenyl, furan and thiophene as flanking aromatic groups, were synthesized with yields up to 78&#8201;%. These N&#8208;aryl DPPs are fluorescent in both solutions and solid states, with quantum yields up to 96&#8201;% and 40&#8201;%, respectively. Moreover, we show that the reaction between H&#8208;DPP and diaryliodonium salt can lead to &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs by using Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst. Nine &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs were obtained in 27&#8211;61&#8201;% yields. These &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs exhibit good semiconducting properties with hole mobility of 0.71&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, demonstrating that they are useful building blocks for high performance organic semiconductors.

&lt;p&gt;A new easily handled synthetic method toward &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aryl DPPs was reported through the reaction of H&#8208;DPP with diaryliodonium salt in the presence of CuI. The &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aryl DPPs are fluorescent in solutions and solid states. Furthermore, the reaction can lead to &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs by using Pd(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as catalyst. These &#960;&#8208;expanded DPPs exhibit good semiconducting properties, demonstrating their potential applications in organic semiconductors of high performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as a building block has been intensively investigated for organic semiconductors and light emitting materials. The synthesis of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aryl DPPs remains challenging. Herein, we firstly report a new easily handled synthetic method toward &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;aryl DPPs through H&#8208;DPP with diaryliodonium salt in the presence of CuI, which shows broad reaction scope.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Responsive Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composite Membranes for CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart two&#8208;dimensional composite membranes containing flexible metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MONs) and graphene oxide nanosheets are developed for pressure&#8208;responsive CO2 separations through a CO2&#8208;induced &#8220;gate opening&#8221; effect. Huge jumps of CO2 permeance and CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivity occur above the gate&#8208;opening pressure of the flexible MONs, indicating a stimulus&#8208;responsive behavior with greatly enhanced CO2 separation performance.







Abstract
The regulation of permeance and selectivity in membrane systems may allow effective relief of conventional energy&#8208;intensive separations. Here, pressure&#8208;responsive ultrathin membranes (&#8776;100&#8197;nm) fabricated by compositing flexible two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (MONs) with graphene oxide nanosheets for CO2 separation are reported. By controlling the gas permeation direction to leverage the pressure&#8208;responsive phase transition of the MONs, CO2&#8208;induced gate opening and closing behaviors are observed in the resultant membranes, which are accompanied with the sharp increase of CO2 permeance (from 173.8 to 1144 gas permeation units) as well as CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 selectivities (from 4.1 to 22.8 and from 4 to 19.6, respectively). The flexible behaviors and separation mechanism are further elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations. This work establishes the relevance of structural transformation&#8208;based framework dynamics chemistry in smart membrane systems.

         <title>Natural Glycoforms of Human Interleukin 6 show atypical plasma clearance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A library of glycoforms of human interleukin 6 (IL&#8208;6) comprising complex and mannosidic N&#8208;glycans was generated by semisynthesis. The three segments were connected by sequential native chemical ligation followed by&#160;two&#8208;step&#160;refolding. The central glycopeptide&#160;segments&#160;were assembled by pseudoproline&#8208;assisted&#160;Lansbury aspartylation and subsequent enzymatic elongation of complex N&#8208;glycans. Nine IL&#8208;6 glycoforms were synthesized, 7 of which were evaluated for&#160;in vivo&#160;plasma clearance in rats and compared to non&#8208;glycosylated recombinant IL&#8208;6 from&#160;E. coli.&#160;Each IL&#8208;6 glycoform was tested in three animals and reproducibly showed individual serum clearances depending on the structure of the N&#8208;glycan. The clearance rates were atypical, since the 2,6&#8208;sialylated glycoforms of IL&#8208;6 cleared faster than the corresponding asialo IL&#8208;6 with terminal galactoses. Compared to non&#8208;glycosylated IL&#8208;6 the plasma clearance of IL&#8208;6 glycoforms was delayed in the presence of larger and multibranched N&#8208;glycans in most cases.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their intrinsic rigidity, three&#8208;dimensionality and structural novelty, spirocyclic molecules have become increasingly sought&#8208;after moieties in drug discovery. Herein, we report a strain&#8208;release driven synthesis of azetidine&#8208;containing spirocycles by harnessing the inherent ring strain of the azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane (ABB) fragment. Novel ABB&#8208;ketone precursors bearing silyl&#8208;protected alcohols were synthesised in a single step and shown to engage in electrophile&#8208;induced spirocyclization&#8208;desilylation reactions. Primary, secondary and tertiary silyl ethers were effectively transformed into a library of new spiro&#8208;azetidines, with a range of substituents and ring sizes. In addition, the products are generated with synthetically useful ketone and protected&#8208;amine functional groups, which provides the potential for further elaboration and for this chemistry to be utilized in the rapid assembly of medicinally relevant compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Mobility in the Interfacial Liquid Layer of Ice/Clay Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7697-7702, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using quasi&#8208;elastic neutron scattering (QENS), the mobility of water molecules confined in the premelting layer of three different ice/clay nanocomposites is quantified. Layers of low&#8208;density liquid water are formed adjacent to ice&#8197;Ih and clay mineral interfaces. This leads to a reduction of the translational diffusion coefficient within the premelting layer.







Abstract
At solid/ice interfaces, a premelting layer is formed at temperatures below the melting point of bulk water. However, the structural and dynamic properties within the premelting layer have been a topic of intense debate. Herein, we determined the translational diffusion coefficient Dt of water in ice/clay nanocomposites serving as model systems for permafrost by quasi&#8208;elastic neutron scattering. Below the bulk melting point, a rapid decrease of Dt is found for charged hydrophilic vermiculite, uncharged hydrophilic kaolin, and more hydrophobic talc, reaching plateau values below &#8722;4&#8201;&#176;C. At this temperature, Dt in the premelting layer is reduced up to a factor of two compared to supercooled bulk water. Adjacent to charged vermiculite the lowest water mobility was observed, followed by kaolin and the more hydrophobic talc. Results are explained by the intermolecular water interactions with different clay surfaces and interfacial segregation of the low&#8208;density liquid water (LDL) component.

Dozens of macrolide antibiotics are known that differ from each other only in the decoration of an otherwise highly conserved 16&#8208;membered lactone core and in the lateral glycosylation pattern.

The key building block was formed on scale by an asymmetric vinylogous Mukaiyama aldol reaction; its alkene terminus was then converted either into the corresponding methyl ketone by Wacker oxidation or into a chain&#8208;extended aldehyde by catalyst&#8208;controlled branch&#8208;selective asymmetric hydroformylation. These transformations ultimately opened access to two structurally distinct series of macrolide targets. Notable late&#8208;stage maneuvers comprise a rare example of a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed redox isomerization of an 1,3&#8208;enyne&#8208;5&#8208;ol into a 1,3&#8208;diene&#8208;5&#8208;one derivative, as well as the elaboration of a tertiary propargylic alcohol into an acyloin by trans&#8208;hydrostannation/Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;type coupling.

&lt;p&gt;Dozens of macrolide antibiotics are known that differ from each other only in the decoration of an otherwise highly conserved 16&#8208;membered lactone core and in the lateral glycosylation pattern. A unified approach was explored that holds the promise of bringing numerous members of this type into reach from a single &#8220;eastern&#8221; building block.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced 1,3&#8208;Aminopyridylation of [1.1.1]Propellane with N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Salts</title>

Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced aminopyridylation of propellane by photoabsorbing electron donor&#8211;acceptor complexes has been developed by employing N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as bifunctional reagents. This strategy can be extended to P&#8208;centered and CF3 radicals for the direct incorporation of these functional groups across the bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) core, thus enabling straightforward construction of valuable pyridine&#8208;containing BCP chemical entities.







Abstract
Through the formation of an electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex, strain&#8208;release aminopyridylation of [1.1.1]propellane with N&#8208;aminopyridinium salts as bifunctional reagents enabled the direct installation of amino and pyridyl groups onto bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) frameworks in the absence of an external photocatalyst. The robustness of this method to synthesize 1,3&#8208;aminopyridylated BCPs under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage modification of structurally complex biorelevant molecules. Moreover, the strategy was extended to P&#8208;centered and CF3 radicals for the unprecedented incorporation of such functional groups with pyridine across the BCP core in a three&#8208;component coupling. This practical method lays the foundation for the straightforward construction of new valuable C4&#8208;pyridine&#8208;functionalized BCP chemical entities, thus significantly expanding the range of accessibility of BCP&#8208;type bioisosteres for applications in drug discovery.

         <title>Protic Ionic Liquid as Reagent, Catalyst, and Solvent: 1&#8208;Methylimidazolium Thiocyanate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7927-7934, March 29, 2021. </description>

A resplendent trio: Protic ionic liquids (PILs) with nucleophilic anions served in concert as regenerable reaction medium, Br&#248;nsted acid, and a source of nucleophile. Heating of donor&#8211;acceptor cyclopropanes with 1&#8208;methylimidazolium thiocyanate (B:&#8901;HNCS) afforded products of formal (3+2)&#8208; and (4+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of isothiocyanic acid.







Abstract
We propose a new concept of the triple role of protic ionic liquids with nucleophilic anions: a) a regenerable solvent, b) a Br&#248;nsted acid inducing diverse transformations via general acid catalysis, and c) a source of a nucleophile. The efficiency of this strategy was demonstrated using thiocyanate&#8208;based protic ionic liquids for the ring&#8208;opening of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes. A wide variety of activated cyclopropanes were found to react with 1&#8208;methylimidazolium thiocyanate under mild metal&#8208;free conditions via unusual nitrogen attack of the ambident thiocyanate ion on the electrophilic center of the three&#8208;membered ring affording pyrrolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thiones bearing donor and acceptor substituents at the C(5) and C(3) atoms, respectively, in a single time&#8208;efficient step. The ability of 1&#8208;methylimidazolium thiocyanate to serve as a triplex reagent was exemplarily illustrated by (4+2)&#8208;annulation with 1&#8208;acyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)cyclopropane, epoxide ring&#8208;opening and other organic transformations.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Adsorption&#8208;Driven Mechanism for MOFs&#8208;Based Yolk&#8211;Shell Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7802-7808, March 29, 2021. </description>

MOFs&#8208;based yolk&#8211;shell nanostructures (ZIF&#8208;8@mSiO2) are controllably synthesized via a solvent&#8208;dependent adsorption&#8208;driven mechanism. The ZIF&#8208;8@mSiO2 structures exhibit excellent sonodynamic performance for generating reactive oxygen species under acoustic cavitation.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;based yolk&#8211;shell nanostructures have drawn enormous attention recently due to their multifunctionality. However, the regulations of the size and morphology of yolk&#8211;shell nanostructures are still limited by the unclear formation mechanism. Herein, we first demonstrated a solvent&#8208;dependent adsorption&#8208;driven mechanism for synthesizing yolk&#8211;shelled MOFs&#8208;based nanostructures coated with mesoporous SiO2 shells (ZIF&#8208;8@mSiO2) with tunable size and morphology. The selective and competitive adsorption of methanol (CH3OH) and water (H2O) on ZIF&#8208;8 core were found to have decisive effects on inducing the morphology evolution of yolk&#8211;shell nanostructures. The obtained yolk&#8211;shelled ZIF&#8208;8@mSiO2 nanostructures show great promise in generating acoustic cavitation effect for sonodynamic cancer therapy in vitro. We believe that this work will not only help us to design novel MOFs&#8208;based yolk&#8211;shell nanostructures, but also promote the widespread application of MOFs materials.

         <title>Scalable De Novo Synthesis of Aldgarose and Total Synthesis of Aldgamycin&#8197;N</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7900-7905, March 29, 2021. </description>

One sugar has to be attached before the transannular ketone is revealed from an alkyne precursor to render the first successful total synthesis ever of a member of the aldgamycin family of antibiotics. Although this phasing of events implies that the precious branched monosaccharide must be carried through several steps, a practical and scalable synthesis of the required aldgarose fragment greatly mitigates the &#8220;cost&#8221; of this strategy.







Abstract
Since the accompanying study had shown that the introduction of the eponymous aldgarose sugar to the C5&#8208;OH group of the macrocyclic aglycone of aldgamycin N is most difficult, if not even impossible, the synthesis route was revised and the glycosidation performed at an earlier stage. To mitigate the &#8220;cost&#8221; of this strategic amendment, a practical and scalable de novo synthesis of this branched octose was developed. The glycoside formation required mild conditions; it commenced with the reaction of the aglycone with the trichloroacetimidate donor to give a transient orthoester, which slowly rearranged to the desired aldgaropyranoside. The presence of the polar peripheral groups in the product did not impede the selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of the macrolide ring itself: the contained propargylic alcohol entity was readily transformed into the characteristic acyloin motif of the target by a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed trans&#8208;hydrostannation followed by a modified Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;type coupling.

The glycoside formation required mild conditions; it commenced with the reaction of the aglycone with the trichloroacetimidate donor to give a transient orthoester, which slowly rearranged to the desired aldgaropyranoside. The presence of the polar peripheral groups in the product did not impede the selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of the macrolide ring itself: the contained propargylic alcohol entity was readily transformed into the characteristic acyloin motif of the target by a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;hydrostannation followed by a modified Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;type coupling.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Anomalous Cis&#8208;Conformation Regioselectivity of Heterocycle&#8208;Fused Sc3N@D3h&#8208;C78 Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7880-7886, March 29, 2021. </description>

Sc3N@D3h&#8208;C78 was reacted with carbonyl ylide to form two isomeric monoadducts 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b bearing anomalous cis&#8208;conformation regioselectivity and a [6,6]&#8208;closed addition pattern. Whereas isomeric monoadducts 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b with cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;conformations were produced simultaneously for C60 under the same conditions. Adduct stability, reactivity of the addition site, and the nature of intermediates play a role in the different regioselectivity.







Abstract
Endohedral clusterfullerenes exhibit unique chemical properties due to intramolecular electron transfer of the encaged metal cluster to the outer fullerene cages. We report the synthesis of two Sc3N@D3h&#8208;C78 monoadducts 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b through the 1,3&#8208;dipolar reaction of Sc3N@D3h&#8208;C78 with carbonyl ylide bearing anomalous cis&#8208;conformation regioselectivity. The molecular structures of these monoadducts are unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, revealing that both 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b have cis&#8208;conformations with the furan moiety grafted via [6,6]&#8208;closed addition patterns. Under the same conditions, the control reaction of C60 with carbonyl ylide affords two monoadducts 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b, which exhibit cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;conformations, respectively, with [6,6]&#8208;closed addition patterns. According to theoretical calculations, the exclusive formation of the cis&#8208;only Sc3N@D3h&#8208;C78 monoadducts is a consequence of conjunct effects of thermodynamic stability of adducts, the reactivity of the addition site, and the cis&#8208;dipole intermediate from trans 1.

         <title>Cooperative Syngas Production and C&#8722;N Bond Formation in One Photoredox Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7962-7970, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A function&#8208;oriented strategy of engineering black phosphorus quantum dots&#8208;ZnIn2S4 heterostructures for solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to syngas, paired with selectively oxidative C&#8722;N bond formation, in one redox cycle is reported. The promoted charge&#8208;carrier separation, enriched active sites and optimized adsorption strength of key reaction intermediates for CO2 reduction, as well as the cooperative photoredox manner, jointly contribute to the enhanced photoactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven syngas production by CO2 reduction provides a sustainable strategy to produce renewable feedstocks. However, this promising reaction often suffers from tough CO2 activation, sluggish oxidative half&#8208;reaction kinetics and undesired by&#8208;products. Herein, we report a function&#8208;oriented strategy of deliberately constructing black phosphorus quantum dots&#8208;ZnIn2S4 (BP/ZIS) heterostructures for solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction to syngas, paired with selectively oxidative C&#8722;N bond formation, in one redox cycle. The optimal BP/ZIS heterostructure features the enhanced charge&#8208;carrier separation and enriched active sites for cooperatively photocatalytic syngas production with a tunable ratio of CO/H2 and efficient oxidation of amines to imines with high conversion and selectivity. This prominent catalytic performance arises from the efficient electronic coupling between black phosphorus quantum dots and ZnIn2S4, as well as the optimized adsorption strength for key reaction intermediates, as supported by both experimental and theoretical investigations. We also demonstrate a synergistic interplay between CO2 reduction and amine dehydrogenation oxidation, rather than simply collecting these two single half&#8208;reactions in this dual&#8208;functional photoredox system.

A radical N2O2.&#8722; intermediate formed during a nitric oxide reductive coupling reaction was captured at a copper center in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). Strict site isolation in the solid state is key in stabilizing this intermediate.







Abstract
Dianionic hyponitrite (N2O22&#8722;) is often proposed, based on model complexes, as the key intermediate in reductive coupling of nitric oxide to nitrous oxide at the bimetallic active sites of heme&#8208;copper oxidases and nitric oxide reductases. In this work, we examine the gas&#8208;solid reaction of nitric oxide with the metal&#8211;organic framework CuI&#8208;ZrTpmC* with a suite of in situ spectroscopies and density functional theory simulations, and identify an unusual chelating N2O2.&#8722; intermediate. These results highlight the advantage provided by site&#8208;isolation in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for studying important reaction intermediates, and provide a mechanistic scenario compatible with the proposed one&#8208;electron couple in these enzymes.

         <title>The Formation/Decomposition Equilibrium of LiH and its Contribution on Anode Failure in Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7770-7776, March 29, 2021. </description>

On&#8208;line D2O titration on a Li anode suggests that the amount of LiH accumulation is negatively correlated with cyclability of practical lithium metal batteries. It is revealed that a temperature&#8208;sensitive equilibrium (Li + 1/2&#8201;H2 &#8652; LiH) governs formation and decomposition process of LiH at Li anodes.







Abstract
Discovering the underlying reason for Li anode failure is a critical step towards applications of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). In this work, we conduct deuterium&#8208;oxide (D2O) titration experiments in a novel on&#8208;line gas analysis mass spectrometry (MS) system, to determine the content of metallic Li and lithium hydride (LiH) in cycled Li anodes disassembled from practical LiCoO2/Li LMBs. The practical cell is comprised of ultrathin Li anode (50&#8197;&#956;m), high loading LiCoO2 (17&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 2.805&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and different formulated electrolytes. Our results suggest that the amount of LiH accumulation is negatively correlated with cyclability of practical LMBs. More importantly, we reveal a temperature sensitive equilibrium (Li + 1/2&#8201;H2 &#8652; LiH) governing formation and decomposition process of LiH at Li anode. We believe that the unusual understanding provided by this study will draw forth more insightful efforts to realize efficient Li protection and the ultimate applications of &#8220;holy grail&#8221; LMBs.

In this work, we conduct deuterium&#8208;oxide (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) titration experiments in a novel &lt;i&gt;on&#8208;line&lt;/i&gt; gas analysis mass spectrometry (MS) system, to determine the content of metallic Li and lithium hydride (LiH) in cycled Li anodes disassembled from practical LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Li LMBs. The practical cell is comprised of ultrathin Li anode (50&#8197;&#956;m), high loading LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (17&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 2.805&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and different formulated electrolytes. Our results suggest that the amount of LiH accumulation is negatively correlated with cyclability of practical LMBs. More importantly, we reveal a temperature sensitive equilibrium (Li + 1/2&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#8652; LiH) governing formation and decomposition process of LiH at Li anode. We believe that the unusual understanding provided by this study will draw forth more insightful efforts to realize efficient Li protection and the ultimate applications of &#8220;holy grail&#8221; LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Large Starphene Comprising Pentacene Branches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7752-7758, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starphenes show promising optoelectronic properties. Notably, HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap presumably decreases with their increasing size, making larger homologues extremely desirable. Unfortunately, with the size, their instability and insolubility also increase, challenging classical synthetic ways. A new method has been developed, enabling synthesis of large starphenes in a quantity sufficient for their full characterisation and further applications.







Abstract
Starphenes are attractive compounds due to their characteristic physicochemical properties that are inherited from acenes, making them interesting compounds for organic electronics and optics. However, the instability and low solubility of larger starphene homologs make their synthesis extremely challenging. Herein, we present a new strategy leading to pristine [16]starphene in preparative scale. Our approach is based on a synthesis of a carbonyl&#8208;protected starphene precursor that is thermally converted in a solid&#8208;state form to the neat [16]starphene, which is then characterised with a variety of analytical methods, such as 13C CP&#8208;MAS NMR, TGA, MS MALDI, UV/Vis and FTIR spectroscopy. Furthermore, high&#8208;resolution STM experiments unambiguously confirm its expected structure and reveal a moderate electronic delocalisation between the pentacene arms. Nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shifts NICS(1) are also calculated to survey its aromatic character.

         <title>Tweaking a BODIPY Spherical Self&#8208;Assembly to 2D Supramolecular Polymers Facilitates Excited&#8208;State Cascade Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7851-7859, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designed Y&#8208;shaped BODIPY exhibits a solvent&#8208;dependent morphology transition with distinct excited&#8208;state behavior. In methylcyclohexane, spherical assemblies are formed with normal emission in the visible region, whereas in n&#8208;decane, 2D supramolecular sheets with multiple emission in the visible to NIR region are formed.







Abstract
Excited state properties such as emission, exciton transport, electron transfer, etc., are strongly dependent on the shape, size and molecular arrangement of chromophore based supramolecular architectures. Herein, we demonstrate creation and control of distinct supramolecular energy landscapes for the reversible control of the excited&#8208;state emission processes through cascade energy transfer in chromophore assemblies, facilitated by an unprecedented solvent effect. In methylcyclohexane, a tailor&#8208;made Y&#8208;shaped BODIPY derivative self&#8208;assembles to form an unusual spherical architecture of 400&#8211;1200&#8197;nm size, which exhibits a single emission at 540&#8197;nm upon 475&#8197;nm excitation through a normal excitation deactivation process. However, in n&#8208;decane, the same BODIPY derivative forms two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular sheets, exhibiting multiple emission peaks at 540, 610, 650, 725 and 790&#8197;nm with 475&#8197;nm excitation due to cascade energy transfer. Further control on the morphology and excitation energy transfer is possible with variable solvent composition and ultrasound stimulation, resulting in enhanced near&#8208;infrared emission with an overall pseudo Stokes shift of 7105&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Exclusively Relativistic: Periodic Trends in the Melting and Boiling Points of Group&#8197;12</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7703-7709, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only very recently has it become possible to obtain accurate melting and boiling points from quantum&#8208;chemical simulations. These show that the periodic trends observed for the Group&#8197;12 elements are exclusively relativistic in nature, which can be rationalized in terms of the relativistic change in the corresponding cohesive energies.







Abstract
First&#8208;principles simulations can advance our understanding of phase transitions but are often too costly for the heavier elements, which require a relativistic treatment. Addressing this challenge, we recently composed an indirect approach: A precise incremental calculation of absolute Gibbs energies for the solid and liquid with a relativistic Hamiltonian that enables an accurate determination of melting and boiling points (MPs and BPs). Here, we apply this approach to the Group&#8197;12 elements Zn, Cd, Hg, and Cn, whose MPs and BPs we calculate with a mean absolute deviation of only 5&#8201;% and 1&#8201;%, respectively, while we confirm the previously predicted liquid aggregate state of Cn. At a non&#8208;relativistic level of theory, we obtain surprisingly similar MPs and BPs of 650&#177;30&#8197;K and 1250&#177;20&#8197;K, suggesting that periodic trends in this group are exclusively relativistic in nature. Ultimately, we discuss these results and their implication for Groups&#8197;11 and&#8197;14.

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidation of Functionalized Aldimines as 1,4&#8208;Dipoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7913-7919, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiodivergent organocatalysis has been successfully developed via a 1,4&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of functionalized aldimines with trifluoromethyl ketones catalyzed by carbene catalysts with the same absolute configuration, leading to both (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208; enantiomers of six&#8208;membered heterocycles. These new 1,4&#8208;dipoles can also react with isatin and its imines under carbene catalysis, allowing for access to the spiro oxindoles with excellent enantiomeric ratios.







Abstract
The use of functionalized aldimines has been demonstrated as newly structural 1,4&#8208;dipole precursors under carbene catalysis. More importantly, enantiodivergent organocatalysis has been successfully developed using carbene catalysts with the same absolute configuration, leading to both (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208; enantiomers of six&#8208;membered heterocycles with quaternary carbon centers. This strategy features a broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions, and good enantiomeric ratio. DFT calculation results indicated that hydrogen bond C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interactions between the catalyst and substrate are the key factors for controlling and even switching the enantioselectivity. These new 1,4&#8208;dipoles can also react with isatin and its imines under carbene catalysis, allowing for access to the spiro oxindoles with excellent enantiomeric ratios.

Cu(OTf)2 promotes the oxidative arylation of nitriles and N&#8208;heterocycles to generate ionic products. Mechanistic studies suggest the process operates via reductive elimination from a CuIII complex bearing neutral N&#8208;ligands to generate nitrilium and pyridinium products. The reaction is general for a range of N(sp) and N(sp2) precursors and can be applied to drug synthesis and late&#8208;stage N&#8208;arylation.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling generally forms C&#8722;N bonds by reductive elimination from metal complexes bearing covalent C&#8208; and N&#8208;ligands. We have identified a Cu&#8208;mediated C&#8211;N cross&#8208;coupling that uses a dative N&#8208;ligand in the bond&#8208;forming event, which, in contrast to conventional methods, generates reactive cationic products. Mechanistic studies suggest the process operates via transmetalation of an aryl organoboron to a CuII complex bearing neutral N&#8208;ligands, such as nitriles or N&#8208;heterocycles. Subsequent generation of a putative CuIII complex enables the oxidative C&#8211;N coupling to take place, delivering nitrilium intermediates and pyridinium products. The reaction is general for a range of N(sp) and N(sp2) precursors and can be applied to drug synthesis and late&#8208;stage N&#8208;arylation, and the limitations in the methodology are mechanistically evidenced.

A diene&#8208;platinum complex, (COD)Pt(TFA)2, serves as an efficient and chemoselective catalyst for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;desaturation of cyclic ketones through direct Pt&#8208;enolate formation. Distinct from known ketone dehydrogenation methods, a wide range of sensitive functional groups are tolerated. Mechanistic studies suggest a fast reversible &#945;&#8208;deprotonation followed by rate&#8208;determining &#946;&#8208;H elimination.







Abstract
The development of a platinum&#8208;catalyzed desaturation of cyclic ketones to their conjugated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated counterparts is reported in this full article. A unique diene&#8208;platinum complex was identified to be an efficient catalyst, which enables direct metal&#8208;enolate formation. The reaction operates under mild conditions without using strong bases or acids. Good to excellent yields can be achieved for diverse and complex scaffolds. A wide range of functional groups, including those sensitive to acids, bases/nucleophiles, or palladium species, are tolerated, which represents a distinct feature from other known desaturation methods. Mechanistically, this platinum catalysis exhibits a fast and reversible &#945;&#8208;deprotonation followed by a rate&#8208;determining &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination process, which is different from the prior Pd&#8208;catalyzed desaturation method. Promising preliminary enantioselective desaturation using a chiral&#8208;diene&#8208;platinum complex has also been obtained.

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Fused Perylene Oligomers with up to 13 Linearly Annulated Rings</title>

A new series of discrete oligomeric linearly fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) stabilized by peri&#8208;annulation in described. The intrinsic perylene units of the novel PAHs with up to 13(!) linearly fused rings are responsible for colorful and bright photophysical properties.







Abstract
The longer acenes with more than six linearly fused six&#8208;membered rings are still fascinating chemists and physicists because of their unique photophysical properties and their high potential for organic electronics applications. Unfortunately, with increasing size (seven and more rings) these compounds rapidly lose chemical stability. Besides kinetic and chemical stabilization approaches introducing either bulky or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups or both, such systems also have been stabilized by peri&#8208;annulation. Although strictly spoken, these peri&#8208;annulated compounds are no longer real acenes, they have fascinating properties as well. Herein, we describe the first synthesis of a new series of peri&#8208;annulated acenes with up to 13 linearly fused rings, which is unprecedented till date. Furthermore, this new series contains perylene units connected through benzene rings along their [b,k]edges, responsible for unique absorption and emission properties.

         <title>A Fast Room&#8208;Temperature Self&#8208;Healing Glassy Polyurethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7947-7955, March 29, 2021. </description>

A glassy polyurethane (GPU) assembled by linear oligomers carrying abundant weak hydrogen bonds is presented. It is not only colorless, transparent, and stiff, but also shows fast room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing owing to the high mobility of the loosely packed hydrogen bonds in the glassy state. Molecular&#8208;level events that occur in this process are established.







Abstract
We designed and synthesized a colorless transparent glassy polyurethane assembled using low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight oligomers carrying a large number of loosely packed weak hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds), which has a glass transition temperature (Tg) up to 36.8&#8201;&#176;C and behaves unprecedentedly robust stiffness with a tensile Young's modulus of 1.56&#177;0.03&#8197;GPa. Fast room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing was observed in this polymer network: the broken glassy polyurethane (GPU) specimen can recover to a tensile strength up 7.74&#177;0.76&#8197;MPa after healing for as little as 10&#8197;min, which is prominent compared to reported room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing polymers. The high density of loose&#8208;packed hydrogen bonds can reversibly dissociate/associate below Tg of GPU (that is secondary relaxation), which enables the reconfiguration of the damaged network in the fractured interfaces, despite the extremely slow diffusion dynamics of molecular chains under room temperature. This GPU shows potential application as an optical lens.

         <title>Controllable Self&#8208;Assembly of Peptide&#8208;Cyanine Conjugates In Vivo as Fine&#8208;Tunable Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7809-7819, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of peptide&#8208;cyanine conjugates that intracellularly self&#8208;assemble into a one&#8208;dimensional column with controlled cyanine aggregation exhibit distinct imaging or photothermal properties. Through rational molecular design, the assembly behavior of cyanine dyes is precisely regulated in biological systems, resulting in two kinds of assemblies with different properties. The relationship between structure and function has been studied in detail.







Abstract
The fabrication of functional assemblies with defined structures through controllable molecular packing under physiological conditions is challenging. Here, modularly designed peptide&#8208;cyanine conjugates that intracellularly self&#8208;assembly into 1D columnar superstructures with controlled cyanine aggregation were designed, and they exhibit distinct imaging or photothermal properties. The peptide backbone is cleaved by caspase&#8208;3/7 after entering the cells. Then the self&#8208;assembled residue, with a double cyanine substitution (Pr&#8208;2Cy), forms a P helical column in which H&#8208;aggregated cyanine dyes show 3.4&#8208;fold photothermal conversion efficiency compared to free ones. The self&#8208;assembled residue with a single cyanine substitution (Pr&#8208;1Cy) forms a loose column, in which cyanine dyes with undefined structure have a fluorescence quantum yield of up to 9.5&#8201;% (emission at 819&#8197;nm in H2O). This work provides a simple way to modify in vivo self&#8208;assembled peptides with functional molecules for achieving desired bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>Observation of Carbonic Acid Formation from Interaction between Carbon Dioxide and Ice by Using In Situ Modulation Excitation IR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7860-7865, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that carbonic acid (H2CO3) can be formed from CO2 and H2O on an ice surface without neither high energy irradiation nor protonation of bicarbonate or carbonate by strong acids. This was possible by using in&#8197;situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy combined with modulation excitation spectroscopy.







Abstract
Carbonic acid, H2CO3, is of fundamental importance in nature both in living and non&#8208;living systems. Providing direct spectroscopic evidence for carbonic acid formation is however a challenge. Here we provide clear evidence by in&#8197;situ attenuated total reflection IR spectroscopy combined with modulation excitation spectroscopy and phase&#8208;sensitive detection that CO2 adsorption on ice surfaces is accompanied by carbonic acid formation. We demonstrate that carbonic acid can be formed from CO2 on ice in the absence of high&#8208;energy irradiation and without protonation by strong acids. The formation of carbonic acid is favored at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it rapidly dissociates to form bicarbonate (HCO3&#8722;) and carbonate (CO32&#8722;). The direct formation of carbonic acid from adsorption of CO2 on ice could play a role in the upper troposphere in cirrus clouds, where all the necessary ingredients to form carbonic acid, that is, low temperature, CO2 gas, and ice, are present.

         <title>Polaron Delocalization in Donor&#8211;Acceptor Polymers and its Impact on Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7777-7785, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monomer selection in organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conduction polymers is shown to directly impact their polaron delocalization and consequently their performance in (bio)electronic devices, thus outlining molecular design guidelines for the development of next generation high&#8208;performance materials.







Abstract
Donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) polymers are promising materials for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), as they minimize detrimental faradaic side&#8208;reactions during OECT operation, yet their steady&#8208;state OECT performance still lags far behind their all&#8208;donor counterparts. We report three D&#8208;A polymers based on the diketopyrrolopyrrole unit that afford OECT performances similar to those of all&#8208;donor polymers, hence representing a significant improvement to the previously developed D&#8208;A copolymers. In addition to improved OECT performance, DFT simulations of the polymers and their respective hole polarons also reveal a positive correlation between hole polaron delocalization and steady&#8208;state OECT performance, providing new insights into the design of OECT materials. Importantly, we demonstrate how polaron delocalization can be tuned directly at the molecular level by selection of the building blocks comprising the polymers&#8217; conjugated backbone, thus paving the way for the development of even higher performing OECT polymers.

The defects in MOFs and the strong Coulombic interactions were found to be the most important factors determining the loading capacity of MOF&#8208;based drug&#8208;delivery systems (see picture). The drug&#8211;carrier interaction and loading conformations of drug molecules were revealed by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance characterization and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Understanding of drug&#8211;carrier interactions is essential for the design and application of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based drug&#8208;delivery systems, and such drug&#8211;carrier interactions can be fundamentally different for MOFs with or without defects. Herein, we reveal that the defects in MOFs play a key role in the loading of many pharmaceuticals with phosphate or phosphonate groups. The host&#8211;guest interaction is dominated by the Coulombic attraction between phosphate/phosphonate groups and defect sites, and it strongly enhances the loading capacity. For similar molecules without a phosphate/phosphonate group or for MOFs without defects, the loading capacity is greatly reduced. We employed solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and molecular simulations to elucidate the drug&#8211;carrier interaction mechanisms. Through a synergistic combination of experimental and theoretical analyses, the docking conformations of pharmaceuticals at the defects were revealed.

         <title>Kinetics of H2 Adsorption at the Metal&#8211;Support Interface of Au/TiO2 Catalysts Probed by Broad Background IR Absorbance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7735-7743, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
FTIR studies during H2 activation over Au/TiO2 present clear spectroscopic evidence of H2 activation between Au and Ti&#8208;OH groups at the metal&#8211;support interface. Electron transfer to the support shifts the broad background absorbance (BBA), enabling the differentiation of activation barriers forH2(D2) adsorption and surface (Ti&#8208;OH) H/D exchange.







Abstract
H2 adsorption on Au catalysts is weak and reversible, making it difficult to quantitatively study. We demonstrate H2 adsorption on Au/TiO2 catalysts results in electron transfer to the support, inducing shifts in the FTIR background. This broad background absorbance (BBA) signal is used to quantify H2 adsorption; adsorption equilibrium constants are comparable to volumetric adsorption measurements. H2 adsorption kinetics measured with the BBA show a lower Eapp value (23&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) for H2 adsorption than previously reported from proxy H/D exchange (33&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). We also identify a previously unreported H&#8208;O&#8208;H bending vibration associated with proton adsorption on electronically distinct Ti&#8208;OH metal&#8208;support interface sites, providing new insight into the nature and dynamics of H2 adsorption at the Au/TiO2 interface.

         <title>Liquid Phase Peptide Synthesis via One&#8208;Pot Nanostar Sieving (PEPSTAR)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7786-7795, March 29, 2021. </description>

PEPSTAR, a &#8220;rising star&#8221; in peptide synthesis, features a &#8220;nanostar&#8221; support to grow peptides with organic solvent nanofiltration for isolation. The three&#8208;armed and monodisperse nanostar enables efficient nanofiltration and real&#8208;time reaction monitoring. A cycle consists of coupling, Fmoc removal and nanofiltration, which all performed continuously in a synthesizer to produce high purity peptide crudes through a one&#8208;pot approach.







Abstract
Herein, a one&#8208;pot liquid phase peptide synthesis featuring iterative addition of amino acids to a &#8220;nanostar&#8221; support, with organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) for isolation of the growing peptide after each synthesis cycle is reported. A cycle consists of coupling, Fmoc removal, then sieving out of the reaction by&#8208;products via nanofiltration in a reactor&#8208;separator, or synthesizer apparatus where no phase or material transfers are required between cycles. The three&#8208;armed and monodisperse nanostar facilitates both efficient nanofiltration and real&#8208;time reaction monitoring of each process cycle. This enabled the synthesis of peptides more efficiently while retaining the full benefits of liquid phase synthesis. PEPSTAR was validated initially with the synthesis of enkephalin&#8208;like model penta&#8208; and decapeptides, then octreotate amide and finally octreotate. The crude purities compared favorably to vendor produced samples from solid phase synthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, a one&#8208;pot liquid phase peptide synthesis featuring iterative addition of amino acids to a &#8220;nanostar&#8221; support, with organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) for isolation of the growing peptide after each synthesis cycle is reported. A cycle consists of coupling, Fmoc removal, then sieving out of the reaction by&#8208;products via nanofiltration in a reactor&#8208;separator, or synthesizer apparatus where no phase or material transfers are required between cycles. The three&#8208;armed and monodisperse nanostar facilitates both efficient nanofiltration and real&#8208;time reaction monitoring of each process cycle. This enabled the synthesis of peptides more efficiently while retaining the full benefits of liquid phase synthesis. PEPSTAR was validated initially with the synthesis of enkephalin&#8208;like model penta&#8208; and decapeptides, then octreotate amide and finally octreotate. The crude purities compared favorably to vendor produced samples from solid phase synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed Activation of Remote Nitrogen Atoms of (Benz)imidazole&#8208;Derived Aldimines for Enantioselective Synthesis of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7906-7912, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mode of carbene&#8208;catalyzed activation and reaction of nitrogen atom is disclosed. The reaction starts with the addition of the carbene catalyst to imine to form an aza&#8208;Breslow intermediate to eventually form NHC&#8208;bound triaza&#8208;diene as the key intermediate. This triaza&#8208;diene intermediate then undergoes highly enantioselective reactions with activated ketones through a concerted asynchronous pathway.







Abstract
A new mode of carbene&#8208;catalyzed heteroatom activation and asymmetric reactions is disclosed. The reaction starts with addition of a carbene catalyst to a (benz)imidazole&#8208;derived aldimine substrate. Subsequent oxidation and proton transfer lead to the formation of a catalyst&#8208;bound triaza&#8208;diene as the key intermediate, in which the nitrogen atom at a site remote to the catalyst&#8208;substrate bond is activated. This unusual triaza&#8208;diene intermediate then undergoes highly enantioselective reactions with activated ketones through a concerted asynchronous pathway, as supported by mechanistic studies and preliminary density function theory calculation.

         <title>Effect of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF) Database Selection on the Assessment of Gas Storage and Separation Potentials of MOFs</title>

We examined thousands of common materials in two widely used computation&#8208;ready metal&#8211;organic framework databases (MOF DBs) to reveal how structural discrepancies affect simulated CH4, H2, CO2 uptakes and CH4/H2 separation performances of MOFs. Identification of the top&#8208;performing materials for gas separation was shown to strongly depend on the DB used in simulations.







Abstract
Development of computation&#8208;ready metal&#8211;organic framework databases (MOF DBs) has accelerated high&#8208;throughput computational screening (HTCS) of materials to identify the best candidates for gas storage and separation. These DBs were constructed using structural curations to make MOFs directly usable for molecular simulations, which caused the same MOF to be reported with different structural features in different DBs. We examined thousands of common materials of the two recently updated, very widely used MOF DBs to reveal how structural discrepancies affect simulated CH4, H2, CO2 uptakes and CH4/H2 separation performances of MOFs. Results showed that DB selection has a significant effect on the calculated gas uptakes and ideal selectivities of materials at low pressure. A detailed analysis on the curated structures was provided to isolate the critical elements of MOFs determining the gas uptakes. Identification of the top&#8208;performing materials for gas separation was shown to strongly depend on the DB used in simulations.

         <title>A Universal Approach for Controllable Synthesis of n&#8208;Specific Layered 2D Perovskite Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7866-7872, March 29, 2021. </description>

Single&#8208;phase 2D lead&#8208; and tin&#8208;based perovskite nanoplates with a designated n value can be successfully prepared through kinetic control of the nucleation process. This approach can effectively avoid the multipeak photoluminescence generally observed in multilayer 2D perovskite nanomaterials.







Abstract
2D perovskites with chemical formula A&#8242;2An&#8722;1BnX3n+1 have recently attracted considerable attention due to their tunable optical and electronic properties, which can be attained by varying the chemical composition. While high color&#8208;purity emitting perovskite nanomaterials have been accomplished through changing the halide composition, the preparation of single&#8208;phase, specific n&#8208;layer 2D perovskite nanomaterials is still pending because of the fast nucleation process of nanoparticles. We demonstrate a facile, rational and efficacious approach to synthesizing single&#8208;phase 2D perovskite nanoplates with a designated n number for both lead&#8208; and tin&#8208;based perovskites through kinetic control. Casting carboxylic acid additives in the reaction medium promotes selective formation of the kinetic product&#8212;multilayer 2D perovskite&#8212;in preference to the single&#8208;layer thermodynamic product. For the n&#8208;specific layered 2D perovskites, decreasing the number of octahedral layers per inorganic sheet leads to an increase of photoluminescence energy, radiative decay rate, and a significant boost in photostability.

         <title>The Reduced Nitridogermanates(III) Ca6[Ge2N6] and Sr6[Ge2N6] with Ge&#8722;Ge Bonds</title>

The nitridogermanates(III), Ca6[Ge2N6] and Sr6[Ge2N6], contain the hitherto unknown molecular anion [Ge2N6]12&#8722; featuring a Ge&#8722;Ge&#8208;bond and thus represent the first members of a novel class of compounds virtually unknown in the nitride chemistry of tetrel elements.







Abstract
The first nitridogermanates(III) Ca6[Ge2N6] and Sr6[Ge2N6] were synthesized from sodium flux and structurally characterized by powder and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, respectively. They crystallize isostructurally to each other and homeotypic to Ca6[Cr2N6]H in space group R
. They feature unprecedented, mutually isolated, ethane&#8208;like [GeIII2N6]12&#8722; anions in a staggered conformation. The compounds are semiconductors according to resistivity measurements and electronic structure calculations, yielding band gaps of 1.1&#8197;eV for Ca6[Ge2N6] and 0.2&#8197;eV for Sr6[Ge2N6].

         <title>Handedness Inversion of Chiral 3&#8208;Aminophenol Formaldehyde Resin Nanotubes Mediated by Metal Coordination</title>

A metal ion&#8208;mediated supramolecular co&#8208;templating method was employed for the first time to fabricate chiral 3&#8208;aminophenol formaldehyde resin nanotubes with controllable helical sense and optical activity with an enantiomerically pure template system.







Abstract
Precise adjustment of microstructure and handedness of chiral nanomaterials is important to regulate their properties and performance. Herein, helical 3&#8208;aminophenol formaldehyde resin (APF) nanotubes and corresponding carbonaceous nanotubes with controllable handedness and optical activity were obtained via an external metal ion&#8208;mediated supramolecular co&#8208;templating method in an enantiomerically pure template system, in which an appropriate amount of Mn2+ (Co2+ or Ni2+) with moderate coordination abilities can reverse the spatial arrangement of the phenylglycine&#8208;based amphiphilic template molecules through metal coordination. Different stacking modes of coordination complexes in disparate metal ion systems lead to diverse helical senses (diameter and pitch) of the obtained helical APF. In addition, this coordination mode of metal intervention can be applied to other amine&#8208;based helical polymer synthesis systems, which paves the way for the design of high&#8208;quality chiral nanomaterials with satisfactory physical parameters and properties.

         <title>Generation of Elemental Fluorine through the Electrolysis of Copper Difluoride at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7887-7892, March 29, 2021. </description>

The generation of fluorine gas is achieved at room temperature through the electrolysis of CuF2 in a CsF&#8208;2.45HF molten salt without the evolution of H2 gas. Stable electrolysis with a Ni anode over 100&#8197;h (F2 purity over 99&#8201;%), with the potential to operate under one&#8208;compartment electrolysis, led to a safe and propitious method for the generation of high&#8208;purity fluorine gas for small&#8208;scale lab and industrial applications.







Abstract
The safe generation of F2 gas at room temperature by using simple cell configurations has been the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; of fluorine research for centuries. Thus, to address this issue, we report generation of F2 gas through the electrolysis of CuF2 in a CsF&#8208;2.45HF molten salt without the evolution of H2 gas. The CuF2 is selected through a series of thermodynamic and kinetic assessments of possible metal fluorides. Anode assessments on graphite and glass&#8208;like carbon demonstrate the effect of the absence of the anode during generation of F2 gas owing to stabilized operations at room temperature. Although the Ni anode dissolves during electrolysis in the conventional medium&#8208;temperature cell, herein, it facilitates stable electrolysis over 100&#8197;h, achieving an F2 gas purity of over 99&#8201;% with the potential to operate using one&#8208;compartment electrolysis. This work presents a safe and propitious method for the generation of high&#8208;purity F2 gas for small&#8208;scale lab and industrial applications.

         <title>Synergetic Lipid Extraction with Oxidative Damage Amplifies Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Destructive Stresses and Enables Rapid Sterilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7744-7751, March 29, 2021. </description>

A rapid sterilization approach using MoS2 nanosheets is reported. The MoS2 nanosheets enabled the extraction of lipids from cell membranes causing subsequent membrane disruptions. Additionally, the nanosheets activated permonosulfate molecules to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that both refreshed the MoS2 surface and attacked the cell membrane, thereby amplifying the cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;destructive stresses toward pathogenic microorganisms.







Abstract
Here, we introduce an innovative &#8220;poison arrowhead&#8221; approach for disinfection based on a nanosheet bacterial inactivation system that acts synergistically to achieve sterilization rates of &gt;99.99&#8201;% (Escherichia coli) over an ultrashort time period (&#8776;0.5&#8197;min). The two&#8208;dimensional MoS2 &#8220;arrowhead&#8221; configuration has a sharp edge structure that enables the vigorous extraction of lipids from cell membranes and subsequent membrane disruptions. In the presence of permonosulfate, a strong oxidant, sulfur vacancies containing MoS2 activate the stable molecules, which in turn produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) from edge sites to basal areas. This process not only scavenges some portion of the phospholipids to allow for MoS2 surface refreshment but also directly attacks proteins thereby inflicting further damage to injured cells and amplifying the cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;destructive stresses toward pathogenic microorganisms. With small amounts of the new material, we successfully disinfected natural water (&#8776;99.93&#8201;% inactivation in terms of total bacteria) within 30&#8197;s.

Poly(alkyl&#8208;terphenyl piperidinium) membranes and ionomers display outstanding hydrogen&#8208;barrier properties and mechanical properties as well as excellent hydroxide&#8208;ion conductivity that results in an excellent power density of 2.58&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1.38&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C in H2/O2 and H2/air, respectively, along with a new, outstanding specific power in alkaline&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells.







Abstract
Aryl&#8208;ether&#8208;free anion&#8208;exchange ionomers (AEIs) and membranes (AEMs) have become an important benchmark to address the insufficient durability and power&#8208;density issues associated with AEM fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, we present aliphatic chain&#8208;containing poly(diphenyl&#8208;terphenyl piperidinium) (PDTP) copolymers to reduce the phenyl content and adsorption of AEIs and to increase the mechanical properties of AEMs. Specifically, PDTP AEMs possess excellent mechanical properties (storage modulus&gt;1800&#8197;MPa, tensile strength&gt;70&#8197;MPa), H2 fuel&#8208;barrier properties (&lt;10&#8197;Barrer), good ion conductivity, and ex&#8208;situ stability. Meanwhile, PDTP AEIs with low phenyl content and high&#8208;water permeability display excellent peak power densities (PPDs). The present AEMFCs reach outstanding PPDs of 2.58&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&gt;7.6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density) and 1.38&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C in H2/O2 and H2/air, respectively, along with a specific power (PPD/catalyst loading) over 8&#8197;W&#8201;mg&#8722;1, which is the highest record for Pt&#8208;based AEMFCs so far.

Abstract
Monodispersed metal and semiconductor nanocrystals have attracted great attention in fundamental and applied research due to their tunable size, morphology, and well&#8208;defined chemical composition. Utilizing these nanocrystals in a controllable way is highly desirable especially when using them as building blocks for the preparation of nanostructured materials. Their deposition onto oxide materials provide them with wide applicability in many areas, including catalysis. However, so far deposition methods are limited and do not provide control to achieve high particle loadings. This study demonstrates a general approach for the deposition of hydrophobic ligand&#8208;stabilized nanocrystals on hydrophilic oxide supports without ligand&#8208;exchange. Surface functionalization of the supports with primary amine groups either using an organosilane ((3&#8208;aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane) or bonding with aminoalcohols (3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2&#8208;propanediol) were found to significantly improve the interaction between nanocrystals and supports achieving high loadings (&gt;10&#8197;wt.&#8201;%). The bonding method with aminoalcohols guarantees the opportunity to remove the binding molecules thus allowing clean metal/oxide materials to be obtained, which is of great importance in the preparation of supported nanocrystals for heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Fluorescent and Water Dispersible Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles: Core&#8211;Shell Structured Compartmentation</title>

The internal structure of single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) has been investigated, forming nanosized domains preformed during the crosslinking process. We present proof for the presence of nano&#8208;compartments within SCNPs via a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and fluorescence spectroscopy. A novel strategy to encapsulate labels within such water dispersible SCNPs is presented.







Abstract
Single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) are highly versatile structures resembling proteins, able to function as catalysts or biomedical delivery systems. Based on their synthesis by single&#8208;chain collapse into nanoparticular systems, their internal structure is complex, resulting in nanosized domains preformed during the crosslinking process. In this study we present proof of such nanocompartments within SCNPs via a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and fluorescence spectroscopy. A novel strategy to encapsulate labels within these water dispersible SCNPs with hydrodynamic radii of &#8776;5&#8197;nm is presented, based on amphiphilic polymers with additional covalently bound labels, attached via the copper catalyzed azide/alkyne &#8220;click&#8221; reaction (CuAAC). A detailed profile of the interior of the SCNPs and the labels&#8217; microenvironment was obtained via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, followed by an assessment of their photophysical properties.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Loaded Nanoreactors Enable the Continuous Regeneration of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide in Artificial Metabolisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7728-7734, March 29, 2021. </description>

The right combination: An artificial enzyme combination is presented that continuously produces NAD+ from oxygen and water and a catalytic amount of pyruvate, without additional substrates and without generating byproducts. Three enzymes are covalently encapsulated into a substrate&#8208;permeable silica nanoreactor by a mild fluoride&#8208;catalyzed sol&#8211;gel process. NAD+ from the nanoreactors was successfully used for the continuous production of NAD+ for sensing glucose and for rapidly reducing the non&#8208;oxygen binding methemoglobin to oxygen&#8208;binding hemoglobin.







Abstract
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential coenzyme for numerous biocatalytic pathways. While in nature, NAD+ is continuously regenerated from NADH by enzymes, all synthetic NAD+ regeneration strategies require a continuous supply of expensive reagents and generate byproducts, making these strategies unattractive. In contrast, we present an artificial enzyme combination that produces NAD+ from oxygen and water continuously; no additional organic substrates are required once a minimal amount pyruvate is supplied. Three enzymes, i.e., LDH, LOX, and CAT, are covalently encapsulated into a substrate&#8208;permeable silica nanoreactor by a mild fluoride&#8208;catalyzed sol&#8211;gel process. The enzymes retain their activity inside of the nanoreactors and are protected against proteolysis and heat. We successfully used NAD+ from the nanoreactors for the continuous production of NAD+ i)&#8197;to sense glucose in artificial glucose metabolism, and ii)&#8197;to reduce the non&#8208;oxygen binding methemoglobin to oxygen&#8208;binding hemoglobin. This latter conversion might be used for the treatment of Methemoglobinemia. We believe that this versatile tool will allow the design of artificial NAD+&#8208;dependent metabolisms or NAD+&#8208;mediated redox&#8208;reactions.

An atom&#8208;economical method for the direct B&#8722;H functionalization of nido&#8208;carboranes (7,8&#8208;nido&#8208;C2B9H12&#8722;) has been developed under electrochemical reaction conditions. In this reaction system, anodic oxidation serves as a green alternative for traditional chemical oxidants in the oxidation of nido&#8208;carboranes. Coupling nido&#8208;carboranes with thioethers, selenides, tellurides, N&#8208;heterocycles, phosphates, phosphines, arsenides and antimonides demonstrates high site&#8208;selectivity and efficiency.

         <title>Double &#960;&#8208;Extended Undecabenzo[7]helicene</title>

More than double: This paper presents the first double &#960;&#8208;extended undecabenzo[7]helicene. It is a chiral nanographene, displaying an extremely strong light absorption capability with a record high ECD intensity in the visible spectral range known for any discrete PAH compound.







Abstract
This work reports the first double &#960;&#8208;extended undecabenzo[7]helicene 1, which is a large chiral nanographene, composed of 65 fused rings and 186 conjugated carbon atoms. The molecular identity of 1 has been confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. A wine coloured solution of 1 in dichloromethane absorbs light from ultraviolet to the near infrared, featuring an extremely large molar absorption coefficient of 844&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 573&#8197;nm. Optically pure 1 shows a record high electronic circular dichroism intensity in the visible spectral range (|&#916;&#1013;|=1375&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 430&#8197;nm) known for any discrete polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. These unusual photophysical properties of 1 contrast sharply with those of a mono&#8208;undecabenzo[7]helicene derivative 2.

Optically pure &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; shows a record high electronic circular dichroism intensity in the visible spectral range (|&#916;&lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt;|=1375&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 430&#8197;nm) known for any discrete polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. These unusual photophysical properties of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; contrast sharply with those of a mono&#8208;undecabenzo[7]helicene derivative &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Sulfimidation Mediated by Hydrogen Bonding Interactions</title>

A picky ligand: A chiral phenanthroline ligand allows for the site&#8208; and enantioselective imidation (Ns=para&#8208;nitrosulfonyl) of a variety of sulfides. Silver acts in concert with an achiral 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (1,10&#8208;phen) ligand as the catalytically active center.







Abstract
An enantioselective sulfimidation of 3&#8208;thiosubstituted 2&#8208;quinolones and 2&#8208;pyridones was achieved with a stoichiometric nitrene source (PhI=NNs) and a silver&#8208;based catalyst system. Key to the success of the reaction is the use of a chiral phenanthroline ligand with a hydrogen bonding site. The enantioselectivity does not depend on the size of the two substituents at the sulfur atom but only on the binding properties of the heterocyclic lactams. A total of 21 chiral sulfimides were obtained in high yields (44&#8211;99&#8201;%) and with significant enantiomeric excess (70&#8211;99&#8201;% ee). The sulfimidation proceeds with high site&#8208;selectivity and can also be employed for the kinetic resolution of chiral sulfoxides. Mechanistic evidence suggests the intermediacy of a heteroleptic silver complex, in which the silver atom is bound to one molecule of the chiral ligand and one molecule of an achiral 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline. Support for the suggested reaction course was obtained by ESI mass spectrometry, DFT calculations, and a Hammett analysis.

The dynamic structure of liquid water can be disrupted by the presence of non&#8208;polar organic molecules, in a process known as hydrophobic solvation. Maria Gim&#233;nez&#8208;L&#243;pez, Francisco Rivadulla et&#8197;al. demonstrate in their Communication on page&#8197;7540 that the particular orientation of hydrocarbon chains in tetraalkylammonium and phosphonium salts induces a peculiar structure of water molecules different from the bulk, changing its physicochemical properties.

A red star is born A new route for the preparation of large and insoluble molecular starphenes by decarbonylation of soluble precursors in the solid state is described in the Research Article on page&#8197;7752 by Andrej Jancarik, Andre Gourdon, and co&#8208;workers. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy in ultrahigh vacuum and absorption spectroscopy in frozen matrices, with both experiments run at liquid helium temperature, show that the electronic delocalization among the three pentacene branches is rather limited.

This Review critically discusses recent breakthroughs and future challenges in research on polyoxovanadate energy materials. The use of polyoxovanadates in batteries, redox&#8208;flow batteries, light&#8208;driven catalysis, and electrocatalysis is described together with an outlook on emerging themes and areas of future application.







Abstract
Molecular vanadium oxides, or polyoxovanadates (POVs), have recently emerged as a new class of molecular energy conversion/storage materials, which combine diverse, chemically tunable redox behavior and reversible multielectron storage capabilities. This Review explores current challenges, major breakthroughs, and future opportunities in the use of POVs for energy conversion and storage. The reactivity, advantages, and limitations of POVs are explored, with a focus on their use in lithium and post&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion batteries, redox&#8208;flow batteries, and light&#8208;driven energy conversion. Finally, emerging themes and new research directions are critically assessed to provide inspiration for how this promising materials class can advance research in sustainable energy technologies.

The integration and encapsulation of perovskite nanocrystals into multifunctional metal&#8211;organic frameworks results in new features and paves the way to promising applications. This Minireview summarizes the recent progress of perovskite NC@MOF composites from the perspective of synthetic chemistry, functional mechanisms, and potential applications.







Abstract
As an emerging optical material, perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties and show great potential for various optoelectronic applications. However, the inherent inferior stability against moisture, oxygen, light and heat limit their practical application. As well, the exploration and development of perovskite NCs with novel properties and functions are new challenges. To achieve these goals, the integration and encapsulation of perovskite NCs with multifunctional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to form perovskite NC@MOF composites, is a promising strategy for enhancing the stability and broadening the application scope. In this minireview, we summarize and discuss the synthesis strategies and functional mechanisms of perovskite NC@MOF composites, along with applications of light emitting diodes (LED), information security, photocatalysis, sensing, and detection. We further briefly point out the current challenges as well as the future opportunities for the emerged composite materials.

Fluorescence imaging facilitated by NIR&#8208;II emissive aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) is an emerging research field. This minireview summarizes recent efforts on developing novel NIR&#8208;II AIEgens in terms of molecular design strategies and bioapplications, and discusses current challenges and future prospects.







Abstract
Fluorescence imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window facilitated by aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) is an emerging research field. NIR&#8208;II AIEgens overcome limitations imposed by penetration depth and fluorescence efficiency, offering high&#8208;performance imaging with enhanced precision. Some reported NIR&#8208;II AIEgens demonstrate capabilities for fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging, and fluorescence imaging guided photothermal therapy, which not only improves diagnosis accuracy but provides an efficient theranostic platform to accelerate preclinical translation as well. This minireview summarizes recent efforts on exploiting NIR&#8208;II AIEgens with regard to molecular design strategies and bioapplications, and puts forward current challenges and promising prospects. This timely sketch should benefit the further exploitation of diverse and multifunctional NIR&#8208;II AIEgens for a wide array of applications.

This review provides a complete account of the on&#8208;surface spin&#8208;state switching behavior of films of spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complexes of molecular to multilayer thickness. SCO&#8208;based molecular and thin&#8208;film device architectures fabricated employing vacuum sublimation are also described.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) active transition metal complexes are an important class of switchable molecular materials due to their bistable spin&#8208;state switching characteristics at or around room temperature. Vacuum&#8208;sublimable SCO complexes are a subclass of SCO complexes suitable for fabricating ultraclean spin&#8208;switchable films desirable for applications, especially in molecular electronics/spintronics. Consequently, on&#8208;surface SCO of thin&#8208;films of sublimable SCO complexes have been studied employing spectroscopy and microscopy techniques, and results of fundamental and technological importance have been obtained. This Review provides complete coverage of advances made in the field of vacuum&#8208;sublimable SCO complexes: progress made in the design and synthesis of sublimable functional SCO complexes, on&#8208;surface SCO of molecular and multilayer thick films, and various molecular and thin&#8208;film device architectures based on the sublimable SCO complexes.

         <title>Tracing Tumor&#8208;Derived Exosomal PD&#8208;L1 by Dual&#8208;Aptamer Activated Proximity&#8208;Induced Droplet Digital PCR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7582-7586, March 29, 2021. </description>

We developed a dual&#8208;target&#8208;specific aptamer recognition system combined with droplet digital PCR for precise quantitative analysis of exosomal PD&#8208;L1 (Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1). This method can distinguish tumor&#8208;derived from non&#8208;tumor&#8208;derived Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1, holding great potential for the analysis of exosome subtypes and offering unprecedented opportunities for the study of the biological functions of exosomes and their conversion into reliable clinical indicators.







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;derived exosomal proteins have emerged as promising biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, but the quantitation accuracy is hindered by large numbers of normal cell&#8208;derived exosomes. Herein, we developed a dual&#8208;target&#8208;specific aptamer recognition activated in&#8197;situ connection system on exosome membrane combined with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) (TRACER) for quantitation of tumor&#8208;derived exosomal PD&#8208;L1 (Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1). Leveraging the high binding affinity of aptamers, excellent selectivity of dual&#8208;aptamer recognition, and the high sensitivity of ddPCR, this method exhibits significant sensitivity and selectivity for tracing tumor&#8208;derived Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 in a wash&#8208;free manner. Due to the excellent sensitivity, the level of tumor&#8208;derived Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 detected by TRACER can distinguish cancer patients from healthy donors, and for the first time was identified as a more reliable tumor diagnostic marker than total Exo&#8208;PD&#8208;L1. The TRACER strategy holds great potential for converting exosomes into reliable clinical indicators and exploring the biological functions of exosomes.

         <title>cis&#8208;Quinacridone&#8208;Based Delayed Fluorescence Emitters: Seemingly Old but Renewed Functional Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7643-7648, March 29, 2021. </description>

Linear cis&#8208;quinacridone (cis&#8208;QA), a structural isomer of the renowned linear trans&#8208;quinacridone with a variation in the substitution positions of two amino and carbonyl groups, has been in a state of low visibility and unmarked as functional materials for a century. This contribution unveils the fascinating functionality and usefulness of cis&#8208;QA derivatives as narrowband deep&#8208;blue delayed fluorescence emitters.







Abstract
Herein, we report a material design of linear cis&#8208;quinacridone (cis&#8208;QA) derivatives as delayed fluorescence luminogens. In contrast to the widely studied traditional trans&#8208;isomers, the functionality of cis&#8208;QA and its derivatives remains unexplored and unclarified. Through combined computational and experimental investigations, we revealed that cis&#8208;QA derivatives can function as fascinating narrowband deep&#8208;blue delayed fluorescence emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The best&#8208;performing deep&#8208;blue OLEDs incorporating these cis&#8208;QA luminogens achieved high external electroluminescence quantum efficiencies of up to 19.0&#8201;% and high color purity with chromaticity coordinates of (0.13, 0.14).

         <title>Nanoscale Amperometry Reveals that Only a Fraction of Vesicular Serotonin Content is Released During Exocytosis from Beta Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7593-7596, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exocytosis from beta cells monitored by amperometry is compared to the vesicle content assessed from intracellular vesicle impact cytometry to determine if partial release is dominant. Serotonin was used as an electroactive proxy for insulin as it is co&#8208;released. The fraction of release from insulin&#8208;containing granules in beta cells was found to be at most 34&#8201;%, providing a new perspective on insulin release for diabetes research.







Abstract
Recent work has shown that chemical release during the fundamental cellular process of exocytosis in model cell lines is not all&#8208;or&#8208;none. We tested this theory for vesicular release from single pancreatic beta cells. The vesicles in these cells release insulin, but also serotonin, which is detectible with amperometric methods. Traditionally, it is assumed that exocytosis in beta cells is all&#8208;or&#8208;none. Here, we use a multidisciplinary approach involving nanoscale amperometric chemical methods to explore the chemical nature of insulin exocytosis. We amperometrically quantified the number of serotonin molecules stored inside of individual nanoscale vesicles (39&#8201;317&#177;1611) in the cell cytoplasm before exocytosis and the number of serotonin molecules released from single cells (13&#8201;310&#177;1127) for each stimulated exocytosis event. Thus, beta cells release only one&#8208;third of their granule content, clearly supporting partial release in this system. We discuss these observations in the context of type&#8208;2 diabetes.

We tested this theory for vesicular release from single pancreatic beta cells. The vesicles in these cells release insulin, but also serotonin, which is detectible with amperometric methods. Traditionally, it is assumed that exocytosis in beta cells is all&#8208;or&#8208;none. Here, we use a multidisciplinary approach involving nanoscale amperometric chemical methods to explore the chemical nature of insulin exocytosis. We amperometrically quantified the number of serotonin molecules stored inside of individual nanoscale vesicles (39&#8201;317&#177;1611) in the cell cytoplasm before exocytosis and the number of serotonin molecules released from single cells (13&#8201;310&#177;1127) for each stimulated exocytosis event. Thus, beta cells release only one&#8208;third of their granule content, clearly supporting partial release in this system. We discuss these observations in the context of type&#8208;2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hierarchy Control of MFI Zeolite Membrane towards Superior Butane Isomer Separation Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7659-7663, March 29, 2021. </description>

Through combining hollow&#8208;structured MFI nanoseeds and single&#8208;mode microwave heating during membrane processing, a hierarchical MFI zeolite membrane exhibiting superior n&#8208;/i&#8208;butane isomer separation performance was facilely prepared.







Abstract
Microstructural optimization (such as thickness and preferred orientation) is a major concern for performance enhancement of zeolite membranes. In this study, we demonstrated that the introduction of hierarchy easily enabled concurrent thickness reduction and orientation control of zeolite membranes. Specifically, hierarchical MFI zeolite membranes comprising higher degree of (h0h) preferentially oriented ultrathin (ca. 390&#8197;nm) selective top layers and porous intermediate layers on porous &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 substrates were fabricated. The use of hollow&#8208;structured MFI nanoseeds and the employment of single&#8208;mode microwave heating during membrane processing were found indispensable for the preparation of MFI zeolite membranes with superior butane isomer separation performance, thereby surpassing the current n&#8208;/i&#8208;butane selectivity versus n&#8208;butane permeance trade&#8208;off limits of MFI zeolite membranes prepared via solution&#8208;based synthetic protocols.

         <title>Complementary Syntheses Giving Access to a Full Suite of Differentially Substituted Phthalocyanine&#8208;Porphyrin Hybrids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7632-7636, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two pathways are proposed for the synthesis of an important class of functionalized phthalocyanine&#8208;porphyrin hybrids (TBTAPs). The materials are novel in their own right, but more importantly, the syntheses offer control and variation over structural and substituent modifications, a goal not yet achieved even within the extensively investigated chemistry of the parent phthalocyanines.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines and porphyrins are often the scaffolds of choice for use in widespread applications. Synthetic advances allow bespoke derivatives to be made, tailoring their properties. The selective synthesis of unsymmetrical systems, particularly phthalocyanines, has remained a significant unmet challenge. Porphyrin&#8208;phthalocyanine hybrids offer the potential to combine the favorable features of both parent structures, but again synthetic strategies are poorly developed. Here we demonstrate strategies that give straightforward, controlled access to differentially substituted meso&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrabenzotriazaporphyrins by reaction between an aryl&#8208;aminoisoindolene (A) initiator and a complementary phthalonitrile (B). The choice of precursors and reaction conditions allows selective preparation of 1:3 Ar&#8208;ABBB and, uniquely, 2:2 Ar&#8208;ABBA functionalized hybrids.

         <title>Dimeric Cycloparaphenylenes with a Rigid Aromatic Linker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7649-7653, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three cycloparaphenylene (CPP) dimers with rigid aromatic linker were synthesized from an efficient cyclocondensation reaction. The structures of those giant molecules are in rapid interconversion between cis and trans conformations. In solution, they emit brightly beyond 600&#8197;nm with quantum yield up to 80&#8201;%. Having two CPP rings within one molecule, the first 1:2 complex with C60 is constructed.







Abstract
Dimeric cycloparaphenylene (CPP) architectures with well&#8208;defined flipping motion are constructed taking advantage of an efficient cyclocondensation reaction. Variable&#8208;temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (VT&#8208;NMR) analyses and theoretical calculations indicate rapid interconversion of cis and trans conformers at room temperature, while energetically favorable trans conformer exists at low temperature with the metastable cis conformer hidden. The trihexylsilylethynyl&#8208;substituted dimer exhibits bright emission in solution at 616&#8197;nm with quantum yield up to 80&#8201;%, representing the brightest CPP&#8208;based emitter beyond 600&#8197;nm. A 1:2 host&#8211;guest complex of the dimer and C60 is established with negative cooperativity, demonstrating the first example of 1:2 complex from CPP derivatives.

         <title>Electrochemical Splitting of Methane in Molten Salts To Produce Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7664-7668, March 29, 2021. </description>

The electrochemical splitting of methane in molten salts at 500&#8201;&#176;C has been demonstrated as an energy&#8208;saving, coke&#8208;free, CO2&#8208;free, and water&#8208;free preparation of H2.







Abstract
Industrial hydrogen production based on methane steam reforming (MSR) remains challenges in intensive carbon emissions, retarded hydrogen generation owing to coke deposition over catalysts and huge consumption of water. We herein report an electrochemical splitting of methane (ESM) in molten salts at 500&#8201;&#176;C to produce hydrogen in an energy saving, emission&#8208;free and water&#8208;free manner. Following the most energy&#8208;saving route on methane&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion, methane is electrochemically oxidized at anode to generate carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The generated anodic carbon dioxide is in situ captured by the melts and reduced to solid carbon at cathode, enabling a spatial separation of anodic hydrogen generation from cathodic carbon deposition. Life&#8208;cycle assessment on hydrogen&#8208;generation technologies shows that the ESM experiences an equivalent carbon emission much lower than MSR, and a lower equivalent energy input than alkaline water electrolysis.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controllable Catalysis and Chiral Monosaccharide Recognition Induced by Cyclodextrin Derivatives</title>

Supramolecular assemblies composed of polycationic &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin and gold nanoparticles realize photo&#8208;controlled catalytic processes via host&#8211;guest interactions between &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin and azobenzene&#8208;modified diphenylalanine. The polycationic &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin cavity is able to recognize chiral monosaccharides, thereby achieving unprecedented selective oxidative catalytic performance.







Abstract
A supramolecular catalytic system was constructed from polycationic &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (6&#8208;Iz&#8208;&#945;&#8208;CD) and gold nanoparticles (AuNP) using a supramolecular assembly strategy. The cavity of cyclodextrin is the channel by which the substrate molecules come into contact with the catalytic center. Introduction of the azobenzene&#8208;modified diphenylalanine (Azo&#8208;FF) guest molecule allowed for precise photo&#8208;control of the catalytic activity owing to its sensitive response to irradiation. Importantly, as a unique glucose oxidase the AuNP@6&#8208;Iz&#8208;&#945;&#8208;CD realizes unprecedented chiral recognition catalysis for chiral monosaccharides. In combination with a 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) color reaction, AuNP@6&#8208;Iz&#8208;&#945;&#8208;CD is able to recognize the chirality of various monosaccharides.

&lt;p&gt;A supramolecular catalytic system was constructed from polycationic &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&lt;b&gt;6&#8208;Iz&#8208;&#945;&#8208;CD&lt;/b&gt;) and gold nanoparticles (&lt;b&gt;AuNP&lt;/b&gt;) using a supramolecular assembly strategy. The cavity of cyclodextrin is the channel by which the substrate molecules come into contact with the catalytic center. Introduction of the azobenzene&#8208;modified diphenylalanine (&lt;b&gt;Azo&#8208;FF&lt;/b&gt;) guest molecule allowed for precise photo&#8208;control of the catalytic activity owing to its sensitive response to irradiation. Importantly, as a unique glucose oxidase the &lt;b&gt;AuNP@6&#8208;Iz&#8208;&#945;&#8208;CD&lt;/b&gt; realizes unprecedented chiral recognition catalysis for chiral monosaccharides. In combination with a 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) color reaction, &lt;b&gt;AuNP@6&#8208;Iz&#8208;&#945;&#8208;CD&lt;/b&gt; is able to recognize the chirality of various monosaccharides.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Minimization of Back&#8208;Electron Transfer Enables the Elusive sp3 C&#8722;H Functionalization of Secondary Anilines</title>

         <dc:description>
Divergent radical sp3 C&#8722;H functionalization of N&#8208;alkyl anilines has been achieved using a photoredox strategy. This approach enables to overcome back&#8208;electron transfer and therefore allows direct access to previously elusive &#945;&#8208;anilinoalkyl radicals.







Abstract
Anilines are some of the most used class of substrates for application in photoinduced electron transfer. N,N&#8208;Dialkyl&#8208;derivatives enable radical generation &#945; to the N&#8208;atom by oxidation followed by deprotonation. This approach is however elusive to monosubstituted anilines owing to fast back&#8208;electron transfer (BET). Here we demonstrate that BET can be minimised by using photoredox catalysis in the presence of an exogenous alkylamine. This approach synergistically aids aniline SET oxidation and then accelerates the following deprotonation. In this way, the generation of &#945;&#8208;anilinoalkyl radicals is now possible and these species can be used in a general sense to achieve divergent sp3 C&#8722;H functionalization.

         <title>A Palette of Minimally Tagged Sucrose Analogues for Real&#8208;Time Raman Imaging of Intracellular Plant Metabolism</title>

We describe a chemical strategy to prepare sucrose derivatives with vibrational tags and the characterisation of the first optical analogue of sucrose able to image real&#8208;time trafficking of sucrose in live plant cells.







Abstract
Sucrose is the main saccharide used for long&#8208;distance transport in plants and plays an essential role in energy metabolism; however, there are no analogues for real&#8208;time imaging in live cells. We have optimised a synthetic approach to prepare sucrose analogues including very small (&#8776;50&#8197;Da or less) Raman tags in the fructose moiety. Spectroscopic analysis identified the alkyne&#8208;tagged compound 6 as a sucrose analogue recognised by endogenous transporters in live cells and with higher Raman intensity than other sucrose derivatives. Herein, we demonstrate the application of compound 6 as the first optical probe to visualise real&#8208;time uptake and intracellular localisation of sucrose in live plant cells using Raman microscopy.

         <title>Electrochemically Triggered Chain Reactions for the Conversion of Furan Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7534-7539, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method is developed to enable electrochemically triggered chain reactions for the conversion of biomass derivatives to fuel additives. Only 2&#8201;% equivalent charges are consumed, yielding an apparent Faradaic efficiency of 4700&#8201;% in terms of hydrocarbon products, whereas the only byproduct is H2 at the cathode. The reaction shows no sensitivity to oxygen from ambient air; trace amounts of water facilitate the reaction by stabilizing a key intermediate.







Abstract
We report an electrochemical method for coupling biomass&#8208;derived C5/C6 compounds to value&#8208;added fuel precursors. Using only 2&#8201;% of equivalent charges, 2&#8208;methylfuran (2&#8208;MF) was oxidized to yield a cation radical, which readily reacted with 3&#8208;hexene&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione, a derivate of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran, to produce 3&#8208;(5&#8208;methylfuran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)hexane&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione. The product was converted to 4&#8208;ethylnonane (a component of biodiesel/jet fuel) in a single step in excellent yield. Importantly, the reaction was not sensitive to oxygen, and a trace amount of water was found to promote the reaction. Detailed mechanistic studies confirmed the proposed reaction pathways. Key to the mechanism is the radical generation that is enabled by electrochemistry. The radical is regenerated at the end of a reaction cycle to ensure chain propagation for an average of ca. 47 times, resulting in an apparent Faradaic efficiency of 4700&#8201;%.

An aromatic&#8208;peptide&#8208;conjugated cyclometalated iridium(III) complex has been synthesized that emits light via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking oriented self&#8208;assembly at extremely low concentration. Through endocytic trafficking, self&#8208;assemblies are transformed from nanoparticles into sturdy packed networks that are stabilized in lysosomal acidic environment as super stable lysosomal probes, enabling super long&#8208;term live cell imaging.







Abstract
Live cell imaging of lysosome positioning and motility is critical to studying lysosome status and function for pharmacological interventions. To create a super stable lysosomal probe for long&#8208;term live cell imaging, we have designed and synthesized an aromatic&#8208;peptide&#8208;conjugated cyclometalated iridium(III) complex that emits light via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking oriented self&#8208;assembly in water at extremely low concentration. Through endocytic trafficking, self&#8208;assemblies are transformed from nanoparticles into sturdily packed networks that are stabilized in lysosomal acidic environment. Upon short time/low dose treatment of the iridium complex at passage 0, live cell lysosomal tracking is applicable beyond the 14th passage of cells with high labelling rate and a mild decline in luminescence intensity. The illuminated lysosomes are trackable using super&#8208;resolution imaging to study their response to cellular processes.

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Loss in Photobleaching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7686-7690, March 29, 2021. </description>

Light versus light! The impact of photobleaching on the electrochemiluminescence was investigated at the level of single cells. Specific regions of the labeled membranes were photobleached confocally and then visualized by multimodal imaging. This study demonstrates the crucial role of the photobleaching process on the electrochemiluminescence signal.







Abstract
The effects of photobleaching on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) was investigated for the first time. The plasma membrane of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells was labeled with a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ derivative. Selected regions of the fixed cells were photobleached using the confocal mode with sequential stepwise illumination or cumulatively and they were imaged by both ECL and photoluminescence (PL). ECL was generated with a model sacrificial coreactant, tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine. ECL microscopy of the photobleached regions shows lower ECL emission. We demonstrate a linear correlation between the ECL decrease and the PL loss due to the photobleaching of the labels immobilized on the CHO membranes. The presented strategy provides valuable information on the fundamentals of the ECL excited state and opens new opportunities for exploring cellular membranes by combining ECL microscopy with photobleaching techniques such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) or fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) methods.

Selected regions of the fixed cells were photobleached using the confocal mode with sequential stepwise illumination or cumulatively and they were imaged by both ECL and photoluminescence (PL). ECL was generated with a model sacrificial coreactant, tri&#8208;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;propylamine. ECL microscopy of the photobleached regions shows lower ECL emission. We demonstrate a linear correlation between the ECL decrease and the PL loss due to the photobleaching of the labels immobilized on the CHO membranes. The presented strategy provides valuable information on the fundamentals of the ECL excited state and opens new opportunities for exploring cellular membranes by combining ECL microscopy with photobleaching techniques such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) or fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) methods.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Assembly of Dynamic Supramolecular Polymers on a DNA Origami Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7612-7616, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami platforms were used to assemble synthetic supramolecular polymers, retaining their dynamic nature with control over monomer composition and loading and dynamic exchange of molecular cargo. The DNA origami&#8208;templated self&#8208;assembly allows for novel strategies for controlled multicomponent self&#8208;assembly and characterization of synthetic supramolecular systems.







Abstract
Biological processes rely on transient interactions that govern assembly of biomolecules into higher order, multi&#8208;component systems. A synthetic platform for the dynamic assembly of multicomponent complexes would provide novel entries to study and modulate the assembly of artificial systems into higher order topologies. Here, we establish a hybrid DNA origami&#8208;based approach as an assembly platform that enables dynamic templating of supramolecular architectures. It entails the site&#8208;selective recruitment of supramolecular polymers to the platform with preservation of the intrinsic dynamics and reversibility of the assembly process. The composition of the supramolecular assembly on the platform can be tuned dynamically, allowing for monomer rearrangement and inclusion of molecular cargo. This work should aid the study of supramolecular structures in their native environment in real&#8208;time and incites new strategies for controlled multicomponent self&#8208;assembly of synthetic building blocks.

         <title>BiPO4&#8208;Derived 2D Nanosheets for Efficient Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Liquid Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7681-7685, March 29, 2021. </description>

The bismuth phosphate derived 2D nanosheet&#8208;like catalyst exhibits a high formate cathodic energy efficiency of 73&#8201;% at a current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The excellent catalytic performance is attributed to the 2D structure and abundant oxygen&#8208;modified Bi active sites on the surface.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to high&#8208;value liquid fuel with high selectivity is appealing for energy conversion and storage. Here we report a bismuth phosphate (BiPO4) derived 2D nanosheet&#8208;like electrocatalyst that efficiently converts CO2 into liquid&#8208;phase formate. The catalyst presents a formate Faradaic efficiency of over 90&#8201;% and a cathodic energy efficiency of 73&#8201;% at an industrially relevant current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the flow cell. The in situ generation of the Bi&#8208;O active species on the catalyst surface was determined via operando Raman measurement. Morphological and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses reveal the origin of the high activity for the electrosynthesis of formate from CO2 and water: the 2D structure together with the abundant insertion of oxygen atoms in the surface of the BiPO4&#8208;derived nanosheets.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Iron Porphyrins for Improved Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions</title>

An enzyme&#8208;inspired Fe porphyrin with a tethered imidazole is synthesized and beats its imidazole&#8208;free analogue for electrocatalytic ORR and OER. By presenting state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art molecular catalytic features, Zn&#8208;air batteries with this Fe porphyrin show equal performance to batteries with Pt/C&#8208;Ir/C. This work underlines unique benefits and promising applications of molecular electrocatalysis in new energy conversion technologies.







Abstract
Nature uses Fe porphyrin sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Synthetic Fe porphyrins have been extensively studied as ORR catalysts, but activity improvement is required. On the other hand, Fe porphyrins have been rarely shown to be efficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We herein report an enzyme&#8208;inspired Fe porphyrin 1 as an efficient catalyst for both ORR and OER. Complex 1, which bears a tethered imidazole for Fe binding, beats imidazole&#8208;free analogue 2, with an anodic shift of ORR half&#8208;wave potential by 160&#8197;mV and a decrease of OER overpotential by 150&#8197;mV to get the benchmark current density at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Theoretical studies suggested that hydroxide attack to a formal FeV=O form the O&#8722;O bond. The axial imidazole can prevent the formation of trans HO&#8208;FeV=O, which is less effective to form O&#8722;O bond with hydroxide. As a practical demonstration, we assembled rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery with 1, which shows equal performance to that with Pt/Ir&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Strong Self&#8208;Trapped Exciton Emissions in Two&#8208;Dimensional Na&#8208;In Halide Perovskites Triggered by Antimony Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7587-7592, March 29, 2021. </description>

Two layered double perovskites of (PEA)4NaInCl8 and (PEA)2CsNaInCl7, with the highest efficiency under ambient temperature and pressure, were successfully prepared. This study clearly presents the origin of self&#8208;trapped exciton emission and provides a feasible strategy to explore new layered perovskite emitters.







Abstract
Soft lattice and strong exciton&#8211;phonon coupling have been demonstrated in layered double perovskites (LDPs) recently; therefore, LDPs represents a promising class of compounds as excellent self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emitters for applications in solid&#8208;state lighting. However, few LDPs with outstanding STE emissions have been discovered, and their optoelectronic properties are still unclear. Based on the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Cs2NaInCl6, we synthesized two 2D derivatives (PEA)4NaInCl8:Sb (PEA=phenethylamine) and (PEA)2CsNaInCl7:Sb with monolayer and bilayer inorganic sheets by a combination of dimensional reduction and Sb&#8208;doping. Bright broadband emissions were obtained for the first time under ambient temperature and pressure, with photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 48.7&#8201;% (monolayer) and 29.3&#8201;% (bilayer), superior to current known LDPs. Spectroscopic characterizations and first&#8208;principles calculations of excited state indicate the broadband emissions originate from STEs trapped at the introduced [SbCl6]3&#8722; octahedron.

Octahedral CuNi@Pt&#8208;Cu core@shell nanocatalysts were prepared via a seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach using CuNi octahedral cores as the template. The activity of methanol oxidation reaction is promoted by Pt&#8208;Cu {111} facets originated from such nano&#8208;architectures.







Abstract
Fabrication of 3d metal&#8208;based core@shell nanocatalysts with engineered Pt&#8208;surfaces provides an effective approach for improving the catalytic performance. The challenges in such preparation include shape control of the 3d metallic cores and thickness control of the Pt&#8208;based shells. Herein, we report a colloidal seed&#8208;mediated method to prepare octahedral CuNi@Pt&#8208;Cu core@shell nanocrystals using CuNi octahedral cores as the template. By precisely controlling the synthesis conditions including the deposition rate and diffusion rate of the shell&#8208;formation through tuning the capping ligand, reaction temperature, and heating rate, uniform Pt&#8208;based shells can be achieved with a thickness of &lt;1&#8197;nm. The resultant carbon&#8208;supported CuNi@Pt&#8208;Cu core@shell nano&#8208;octahedra showed superior activity in electrochemical methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) compared with the commercial Pt/C catalysts and carbon&#8208;supported CuNi@Pt&#8208;Cu nano&#8208;polyhedron counterparts.

         <title>Rational Fabrication of Low&#8208;Coordinate Single&#8208;Atom Ni Electrocatalysts by MOFs for Highly Selective CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7607-7611, March 29, 2021. </description>

A post&#8208;synthetic metal substitution (PSMS) strategy has been developed to construct single&#8208;atom Ni catalysts with different N coordination numbers (denoted as Ni&#8208;Nx&#8208;C) on defective carbon supports derived from metal&#8208;organic frameworks. When served as an electrocatalyst, the Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C catalyst, with lower N coordination number around Ni atoms, achieves superior catalytic performance for CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted tremendous interests due to their ultrahigh activity and selectivity. However, the rational control over coordination microenvironment of SACs remains a grand challenge. Herein, a post&#8208;synthetic metal substitution (PSMS) strategy has been developed to fabricate single&#8208;atom Ni catalysts with different N coordination numbers (denoted Ni&#8208;Nx&#8208;C) on pre&#8208;designed N&#8208;doped carbon derived from metal&#8208;organic frameworks. When served for CO2 electroreduction, the obtained Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C catalyst achieves CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 95.6&#8201;%, much superior to that of Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;C. Theoretical calculations reveal that the lower Ni coordination number in Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C can significantly enhance COOH* formation, thereby accelerating CO2 reduction. In addition, Ni&#8208;N3&#8208;C shows excellent performance in Zn&#8211;CO2 battery with ultrahigh CO FE and excellent stability. This work opens up a new and general avenue to coordination microenvironment modulation (MEM) of SACs for CO2 utilization.

         <title>A New Type of Supramolecular Fluid Based on H2O&#8211;Alkylammonium/Phosphonium Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7540-7546, March 29, 2021. </description>

A unique, highly incompressible fluid formed by a tight association of water molecules around ammonium and phosphonium salts is described in this paper. Applications of this new family of supramolecular fluids in different electrochemical processes are demonstrated in this work.







Abstract
Here we show that by adjusting the concentration of tetrabutyl ammonium and phosphonium salts in water (&#8776;1.5&#8211;2.0&#8197;m), hydrophobic solvation triggers the formation of a unique, highly incompressible supramolecular liquid, with a dynamic structure similar to clathrates, involving essentially all H2O molecules of the solvent. Despite the increasing local order, the thermal diffusivity, and compressibility of these supramolecular liquids is strongly decreased with respect to bulk water due to slower relaxation dynamics. The results presented in this paper open an avenue to design a new family of supramolecular fluids, stable under atmospheric conditions, which can find important technological applications in energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Imaging and Analysis of Isomeric Unsaturated Lipids through Online Photochemical Derivatization of Carbon&#8211;Carbon Double Bonds**

         <dc:description>
Rapid derivatization of lipids using a photoinitiated reaction with singlet oxygen provides insights into the C=C bond location in the precursor lipid through diagnostic CID fragments. This method is compatible with lipidomics workflows and can be adapted for the analysis of tissue extracts and for imaging of isomeric lipids in tissue sections.







Abstract
Unraveling the complexity of the lipidome requires the development of novel approaches for the structural characterization of lipid species with isomer&#8208;level discrimination. Herein, we introduce an online photochemical approach for lipid isomer identification through selective derivatization of double bonds by reaction with singlet oxygen. Lipid hydroperoxide products are generated promptly after laser irradiation. Fragmentation of these species in a mass spectrometer produces diagnostic fragments revealing the C=C locations in the unreacted lipids. This approach uses an inexpensive light source and photosensitizer making it easy to incorporate into any lipidomics workflow. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for the shotgun profiling of C=C locations in different lipid classes present in tissue extracts using electrospray ionization (ESI) and ambient imaging of lipid species differing only by the location of C=C bonds using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano&#8208;DESI).

         <title>An Unprecedented Pillar&#8208;Cage Fluorinated Hybrid Porous Framework with Highly Efficient Acetylene Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7547-7552, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;stable fluorinated hybrid porous material with ith&#8208;d topology possesses a unique pillar&#8208;cage structure, which results in a high C2H2 uptake as well as an excellent C2H2/CO2 separation performance simultaneously.







Abstract
Despite much intense investigation on the C2H2/CO2 separation, the trade&#8208;off between the adsorption capacity and separation selectivity is still tricky. To overcome the dilemma, we have rationally synthesized an ultra&#8208;stable fluorinated hybrid porous material SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA with the ith&#8208;d topology. Completely differing from the famous pillar&#8208;layer fluorinated materials, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA possesses a unique pillar&#8208;cage structure, in which the SiF62&#8722; anions cross&#8208;link two adjacent metal nodes as pillars to stabilize the three&#8208;dimensional framework constructed by icosahedral and tetrahedral cages. As anticipated, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA has high BET surface area (1330&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) as well as high C2H2 uptake (185&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar). At the same time, due to the obvious difference in the adsorption performance of CO2 and C2H2 especially in the low pressure area, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA also exhibits an excellent C2H2/CO2 separation performance (breakthrough time up to 68&#8197;min&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar).

As anticipated, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA has high BET surface area (1330&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) as well as high C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake (185&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar). At the same time, due to the obvious difference in the adsorption performance of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; especially in the low pressure area, SIFSIX&#8208;Cu&#8208;TPA also exhibits an excellent C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance (breakthrough time up to 68&#8197;min&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar).&lt;/p&gt;

A new non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated group, (NH2SO3)&#8722;, was discovered by the first&#8208;principles calculation. By combining alkaline&#8208;earth metals with (NH2SO3)&#8722; group, two deep&#8208;UV transparent NLO sulfamates, M(NH2SO3)2 (M=Sr, Ba) with excellent optical properties have been successfully synthesized and grown. BNSO shows the largest powder SHG efficiency among the known DUV NLO sulfates and sulfamates.







Abstract
Over the last few decades, the development of each new nonlinear optical (NLO)&#8208;active functional unit has led to the discoveries of a series of excellent NLO materials. In the present work, based on first&#8208;principles studies, we identified a novel deep&#8208;UV (DUV) NLO&#8208;active functional unit, a non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated group viz. (NH2SO3)&#8722;. By combining alkaline&#8208;earth metals with (NH2SO3)&#8722; group, two DUV transparent NLO sulfamates, M(NH2SO3)2 (M=Sr, Ba) with superior optical properties including strong SHG responses (1.2 and 2.7 &#215; KH2PO4 (KDP)), short UV cut&#8208;off edge (&lt;190&#8197;nm) and moderate birefringence (0.056@589.3&#8197;nm for Sr(NH2SO3)2) were successfully synthesized. Our work has provided not only two promising DUV transparent NLO crystals, but also an innovative non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated unit for developing more DUV transparent NLO materials.

         <title>Template&#8208;Mediated Control over Polymorphism in the Vapor&#8208;Assisted Formation of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Powders and Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7553-7558, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template&#8208;mediated MOF&#8208;CVD (metal&#8212;organic framework&#8208;chemical vapor deposition) method was developed for the syntheses of MOFs in both powder and thin&#8208;film forms. The time&#8208;resolved in situ synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that introducing template vapor into the MOF&#8208;CVD process precludes transformation into a dense phase, thus resulting in the porous structure.







Abstract
The landscape of possible polymorphs for some metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can pose a challenge for controlling the outcome of their syntheses. Demonstrated here is the use of a template to control in the vapor&#8208;assisted formation of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) powders and thin films. Introducing a small amount of either ethanol or dimethylformamide vapor during the reaction between ZnO and 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole vapor results in the formation of the porous ZIF&#8208;71 phase, whereas other conditions lead to the formation of the dense ZIF&#8208;72 phase or amorphous materials. Time&#8208;resolved in situ small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that the porous phase is metastable and can be transformed into its dense polymorph. This transformation is avoided through the introduction of template vapor. The porosity of the resulting ZIF powders and films was studied by N2 and Kr physisorption, as well as positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. The templating principle was demonstrated for other members of the ZIF family as well, including the ZIF&#8208;7 series, ZIF&#8208;8_Cl, and ZIF&#8208;8_Br.

         <title>Boric Acid&#8208;Fueled ATP Synthesis by FoF1 ATP Synthase Reconstituted in a Supramolecular Architecture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7617-7620, March 29, 2021. </description>

Boric acid is explored as a fuel for tuneable ATP synthesis in a biomimetic supramolecular architecture. A proton is released from boric acid by a polyol, establishing a cross&#8208;membrane proton gradient to achieve highly efficient ATP production. The assembled system integrates artificial and natural processes, holding promise in applications that require ATP.







Abstract
Significant strides toward producing biochemical fuels have been achieved by mimicking natural oxidative and photosynthetic phosphorylation. Here, different from these strategies, we explore boric acid as a fuel for tuneable synthesis of energy&#8208;storing molecules in a cell&#8208;like supramolecular architecture. Specifically, a proton locked in boric acid is released in a modulated fashion by the choice of polyols. As a consequence, controlled proton gradients across the lipid membrane are established to drive ATP synthase embedded in the biomimetic architecture, which facilitates tuneable ATP production. This strategy paves a unique route to achieve highly efficient bioenergy conversion, holding broad applications in synthesis and devices that require biochemical fuels.

         <title>Melanin&#8208;Inspired Chromophoric Microparticles Composed of Polymeric Peptide Pigments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7564-7569, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by melanin diversity and biosynthesis, a method to produce melanin&#8208;like microparticles as a reactive scaffold for subsequent oxidative incorporation of amino acids was developed. The spontaneous formation of distinct new chromophores with optical properties that are far beyond the range of those found in biological melanins, in terms of color, UV absorbance and fluorescent emission is demonstrated.







Abstract
Melanin and related polyphenolic pigments are versatile functional polymers that serve diverse aesthetic and protective roles across the living world. These polymeric pigments continue to inspire the development of adhesive, photonic, electronic and radiation&#8208;protective materials and coatings. The properties of these structures are dictated by covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions in ways that, despite progress, are not fully understood. It remains a major challenge to direct oxidative polymerization of their precursors (amino acids, (poly&#8208;)phenols, thiols) toward specific structures. By taking advantage of supramolecular pre&#8208;organization of tyrosine&#8208;tripeptides and reactive sequestering of selected amino acids during enzymatic oxidation, we demonstrate the spontaneous formation of distinct new chromophores with optical properties that are far beyond the range of those found in biological melanins, in terms of color, UV absorbance and fluorescent emission.

         <title>Characterization and Mechanistic Study of the Radical SAM Enzyme ArsS Involved in Arsenosugar Biosynthesis</title>

We report characterization of ArsS as a DDMAA synthase, which catalyzes a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM)&#8208;mediated alkylation (adenosylation) of dimethylarsenite (DMAsIII) to produce DDMAA. This radical&#8208;mediated reaction is redox neutral, and multiple turnover can be achieved without external reductant. This study reveals a key step in arsenosugar biosynthesis and also a new paradigm in radical SAM chemistry.







Abstract
Arsenosugars are a group of arsenic&#8208;containing ribosides that are found predominantly in marine algae but also in terrestrial organisms. It has been proposed that arsenosugar biosynthesis involves a key intermediate 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;dimethylarsinoyl&#8208;adenosine (DDMAA), but how DDMAA is produced remains elusive. Now, we report characterization of ArsS as a DDMAA synthase, which catalyzes a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM)&#8208;mediated alkylation (adenosylation) of dimethylarsenite (DMAsIII) to produce DDMAA. This radical&#8208;mediated reaction is redox neutral, and multiple turnover can be achieved without external reductant. Phylogenomic and biochemical analyses revealed that DDMAA synthases are widespread in distinct bacterial phyla with similar catalytic efficiencies; these enzymes likely originated from cyanobacteria. This study reveals a key step in arsenosugar biosynthesis and also a new paradigm in radical SAM chemistry, highlighting the catalytic diversity of this superfamily of enzymes.

         <title>Inversely Tuning the CO2 Electroreduction and Hydrogen Evolution Activity on Metal Oxide via Heteroatom Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7602-7606, March 29, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing Zn sites by heteroatoms with different outer electrons (Mo and Cu) creates various new near the Fermi level electronic states in ZnO. The different electronic states significantly tune both CO2RR and HER activity with an inverse trend. This work provides a possibility for engineering efficient metal&#8208;compound based CO2RR eletrocatalysts through tunable composition and electronic structures.







Abstract
Tuning the electronic states near the Fermi level can effectively facilitate the reaction kinetics. However, elucidating the role of a specific electronic state of metal oxide in simultaneously regulating the CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) and competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still rare, making it difficult to accurately predict the practical CO2RR performance. Herein, replacing the Zn site by heteroatoms with different outer electrons (Mo and Cu) is found to tune both occupied and unoccupied orbitals near the Fermi level of ZnO. Moreover, the different electronic states significantly modulate both CO2RR and HER activity with a totally inverse trend, thus dramatically tuning the practical CO2RR performance. In parallel, the correlation between electronic states, reaction free energies and practical activity is demonstrated. This work provides a possibility for engineering efficient CO2RR eletrocatalysts through tunable composition and electronic structures.

         <title>Untangling the Complexity of Mixed Lithium/Magnesium Alkyl/Alkoxy Combinations Utilised in Bromine/Magnesium Exchange Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 14, Page 7626-7631, March 29, 2021. </description>

Combining reactivity, NMR spectroscopy and structural studies has cleared the mist surrounding the complex constitutions of mixed Li&#8211;Mg, mixed alkyl&#8211;alkoxo complexes used in metal&#8211;bromine exchange reactions.







Abstract
While it is known that the addition of Group 1 alkoxides to s&#8208;block organometallics can have an activating effect on reactivity, the exact nature of this effect is not that well understood. Here we describe the activation of sBu2Mg towards substituted bromoarenes by adding one equivalent of LiOR (R=2&#8208;ethylhexyl), where unusually both sBu groups can undergo efficient Br/Mg exchange. Depending on the substitution pattern on the bromoarene two different types of organometallic intermediates have been isolated, either a mixed aryl/alkoxide [{LiMg(2&#8208;FG&#8208;C6H4)2(OR)}2] (FG=OMe; NMe2) or a homoaryl [(THF)4Li2Mg(4&#8208;FG&#8208;C6H4)4] (FG=OMe, F). Detailed NMR spectroscopic studies have revealed that these exchange reactions and the formation of their intermediates are controlled by a new type of bimetallic Schlenk&#8208;type equilibrium between heteroleptic [LiMgsBu2(OR)], alkyl rich [Li2MgsBu4] and Mg(OR)2, with [Li2MgsBu4] being the active species performing the Br/Mg exchange process.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Asymmetric Aminoazidation and Diazidation of Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric aminoazidation and diazidation of alkenes are straightforward strategies to build value&#8208;added chiral nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds from feedstock chemicals. They provide direct access to chiral organoazides and complement enantioselective diamination. Notwithstanding the advances in non&#8208;asymmetric reactions, asymmetric aminoazidation or diazidation based on acyclic systems have not been previously reported. Here we describe the iron&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular asymmetric aminoazidation and diazidation of styrenes. The method is practically useful and requires relatively low loading of catalyst and chiral ligand. With mild reaction conditions, the reaction can be completed on a 20 mmol scale. Studies of the mechanism suggest that the reaction proceeds  via  a radical pathway and involves stereocontrol of an acyclic free radical which probably takes place through a group transfer mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses and Physical Properties of Cationic BN&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cationic BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (   BN&#8208;PAH  +  s)  were synthesized from  a nitrogen&#8208;containing macrocycle via pyridine&#8208;directed tandem C&#8211;H borylation  . Incorporating BN into PAH  +  resulted in a remarkable hypsochromic shift due to an increase in the LUMO energy and the symmetry changes of the HOMO and LUMO.

         <title>Uncovering Functional Motif of Nonlinear Optical Material by In Situ Electron Density and Wavefunction Studies Under Laser Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring nonlinear optical (NLO) functional motifs (FM, the structural origin of NLO efficiency) is vital for the rational design of NLO materials. Normal spectrum techniques applied in studying photon exciting materials are invalid for NLO materials, in which electrons are not excited substantially but only distorted under laser. A general strategy of determining NLO FM is proposed by comparative studies of experimental electron density (ED) without and under the laser. The  in situ  experimental ED and wavefunction of typical NLO material LiB  3  O  5  (LBO) under dark and 360 and 1064 nm lasers are investigated. Compared with the initial state under dark, the ED of [B  3  O  5  ]  &#8208;  unit at functional states under laser irradiation exhibits remarkable changes of topological atomic and bond properties, confirming the NLO FM being [B  3  O  5  ]  &#8208;  . The work extracts for the first time the FM of a NLO material experimentally and highlights the crucial role of  in situ  ED analysis in studying NLO mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Analysis of an Antigen Chemically&#8208;Coupled on Virus&#8208;Like Particles in Vaccine Formulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structure determination of adjuvant&#8208;coupled antigens is essential for rational vaccine development but has so far been hampered by the relatively low antigen content in vaccine formulations and by their heterogeneous composition. Here we show that magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state NMR can be used to assess the structure of the influenza virus hemagglutinin stalk long alpha helix antigen, both in its free, unformulated form and once chemically coupled to the surface of large virus&#8208;like particles (VLPs). The sensitivity boost provided by high&#8208;field dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) and proton&#8208;detection at fast MAS rates allows to overcome the penalty associated to the antigen dilution. Comparison of the MAS NMR fingerprints between the free and VLP&#8208;coupled forms of the antigen provides structural evidence of the conservation of its native fold upon bio&#8208;conjugation. This work demonstrates that high&#8208;sensitivity MAS NMR is ripe to play a major role in vaccine design, formulation studies and manufacturing process development.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond the Classical Coordination Chemistry: The First Case of a Triply Bridging Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of a triply bridging (&#956;3&#8208;P) phosphine ligand has been discovered in the crown&#8208;shaped [Cu3(&#181;2&#8208;Hal)3L] (Hal = Cl, Br, or I) complexes supported by tris[2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)ethyl]phosphine (L). Theoretical analysis completely confirms the observed &#956;3&#8208;P&#8208;bridging pattern, revealing the interaction of the same lone pair of phosphorus with three valence 4s&#8208;orbitals of Cu atoms. The presented complexes exhibit outstanding blue phosphorescence (&#955;em  = 442&#8211;465 nm) with the quantum efficiency reaching 100%. The complex [Cu3(&#181;2&#8208;I)3L] also exhibits remarkable thermo&#8208; and mechanochromic luminescence resulting in a sharp change in the emission colour upon external stimuli. These findings essentially contribute to coordination chemistry of the pnictine ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Dicyclopentaannelated Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes with a Singlet Biradical Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two dicyclopentaannelated hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (PHBC) regioisomers have been synthesized from nonplanar oligoaryl precursors with fluorenyl groups: mPHBC 8 with two pentagons in the &#8220;meta&#8221;&#8208;configuration was obtained as a stable molecule, while its structural isomer with the &#8220;para&#8221;&#8208;configuration, pPHBC 16, could be prepared and characterized only in situ due to its high chemical reactivity. Both PHBCs exhibit low energy gaps, as reflected by UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR absorption and electrochemical measurements. They also show open&#8208;shell singlet ground states according to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The use of fully benzenoid HBC as a bridging moiety leads to significant singlet biradical characters (y0) of 0.72 and 0.96 for mPHBC 8 and pPHBC 16, respectively, due to the strong rearomatization tendency of the HBC p&#8208;system; these values are among the highest for planar carbon&#8208;centered biradical molecules. The incorporation of fully unsaturated pentagons strongly strongly perturbs the aromaticity of the parent HBC and makes the constituted benzene rings less aromatic or antiaromatic. These results illustrate the high impact of cyclopentaannelation on the electronic structures of fully benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and open up a new avenue towards open&#8208;shell PAHs with prominent singlet biradical characters.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemo&#8208;enzymatic modification of the 5&#8242; cap maintains translation and increases immunogenic properties of mRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eukaryotic mRNAs are emerging modalities for protein replacement therapy and vaccination. Their 5&#8242; cap is important for mRNA translation and immune response and can be naturally methylated at different positions by S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (AdoMet)&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTases). We report on the cosubstrate scope of the MTase CAPAM responsible for methylation at the N6 position of adenosine start nucleotides using synthetic AdoMet analogs. The chemo&#8208;enzymatic propargylation enabled production of site&#8208;specifically modified reporter&#8208;mRNAs. These cap&#8208;propargylated mRNAs were efficiently translated and showed ~3&#8208;fold increased immune response in human cells. The same effects were observed when the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 &#8211; a currently tested epitope for mRNA vaccination &#8211; was used. Site&#8208;specific chemo&#8208;enzymatic modification of eukaryotic mRNA may thus be a suitable strategy to modulate translation and immune response of mRNAs for future therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical evolution of antivirals against enterovirus D68 through protein&#8208;templated Knoevenagel reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The generation of bioactive molecules from inactive precursors is a crucial step in the chemical evolution of life, however, mechanistic insights into this aspect of abiogenesis are scarce. Here, we investigate the protein&#8208;catalyzed formation of antivirals by the 3C&#8208;protease of enterovirus D68. The enzyme induces aldol condensations yielding inhibitors with antiviral activity in cells. Kinetic and thermodynamic analyses reveal that the bioactivity emerges from a dynamic reaction system including inhibitor formation, alkylation of the protein target by the inhibitors, and competitive addition of non&#8208;protein nucleophiles to the inhibitors. The most active antivirals are slowly reversible inhibitors with elongated target residence times. The study reveals first examples for the chemical evolution of bio&#8208;actives through protein&#8208;catalyzed, non&#8208;enzymatic CC&#8208;couplings. The discovered mechanism works under physiological conditions and might constitute a native process of drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Grafting &#8220;Band&#8208;Aid&#8221; for &#8220;Everyone&#8221;: Filter Paper&#8208;Assisted Surface&#8208;Initiated Polymerization in the Presence of Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a facile and generalized approach to the modification of solid surfaces with polymer brushes under ambient conditions: filter paper&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;initiated Cu(0)&#8208;mediated controlled radical polymerization (PSI&#8208;CuCRP). The polymerization solution wetted filter paper with the copper plate allows creation of a surface&#8208;initiated polymerization (SIP) &#8220;band&#8208;aid&#8221; that anyone can perform the surface grafting selectively with good control over the quality of the polymer brushes employing low concentration and microliter amounts of monomer solution. The versatility of this method is demonstrated by grafting different homo&#8208;, block&#8208; and multicomponent polymer brushes by using the same activation system and reaction conditions, the polymerization process can be precisely controlled to yield uniform polymers and show high chain&#8208;end functionality which is exempli&#64257;ed by  in situ  tetra&#8208;copolymerization. The combination of photolithography and paper cutting enables to prepare arbitrary three&#8208;dimensional patterned polymer brushes on the surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Absolute Configuration Determination from Low ee Compounds by the Crystalline Sponge Method. Unusual Conglomerate Formation in a Pre&#8208;Determined Crystalline Lattice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When chiral compounds with low enantiomeric excess (ee, R:S = m:n) were absorbed into the void of the crystalline sponge (CS), enantiomerically pure [(R)  m  (S)  n  ] chiral composites were formed, changing the centrosymmetric space group into non&#8208;centrosymmetric one. The absolute configuration of the analyte compounds was elucidated with a reasonable Flack (Parsons) parameter value. This phenomenon is characteristic to the &#8220;post&#8208;crystallization" in the pre&#8208;determined CS crystalline lattice, seldom found in common crystallization where the crystalline lattice is defined by an analyte itself. The results highlight the potential of the CS method for absolute configuration determination of low ee samples, an often encountered situation in asymmetric synthesis studies.</dc:description>
