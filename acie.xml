         <title>Unraveling the Structure Transition and Peroxidase Mimic Activity of Copper Sites Over Atomically Dispersed Copper&#8208;Doped Carbonized Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lack of systematic structural resolution makes it difficult to build specific transition metal atoms&#8208;doped carbonized polymer dots&#160;(TMAs&#8208;doped&#8208;CPDs). Herein, the structure&#8208;activity relationship between Cu atoms and CPDs was evaluated by studying the peroxidase&#8208;like properties of Glu&#8208;Cu&#8208;CPDs prepared by using copper glutamate (Glu) with Cu&#8208;N2O2 initial structure. The results showed that the Cu atoms bound to Glu&#8208;Cu&#8208;CPDs in the form of Cu&#8208;N2C2, indicating that Cu&#8208;O bonds changed into Cu&#8208;C bonds under hydrothermal conditions. This phenomenon was also observed in other Cu&#8208;doped&#8208;CPDs. Moreover, the carboxyl and amino groups content decreased after Cu&#8208;atom doping. Theoretical calculations revealed a dual&#8208;site catalytic mechanism for catalyzing H2O2. Eventually, the detection of intracellular H2O2 suggested their application prospects. Our work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding on the formation and catalysis mechanism of TMAs&#8208;doped&#8208;CPDs, allowing for building specific TMAs&#8208;doped&#8208;CPDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering p&#8208;Band Center of Oxygen Boosting H+ Intercalation in&#160;&#948;&#8208;MnO2 for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), the H+&#160;intercalation&#160;possesses superior electrochemical kinetics with excellent rate capability, however, precisely modulating H+&#160;intercalation has been still challenging. Herein, a critical modification of pre&#8208;intercalating metal ions in the MnO2&#160;interlayer (M&#8208;MnO2)&#160;with controllable p&#8208;band center (&#949;p) of O is reported to modulate the H+&#160;intercalation. The modulation of metal&#8208;O bond type and covalency degree on the average charge of O atom results in&#160;optimized &#949;p&#160;and H+&#160;adsorption energy for M&#8208;MnO2, thus promoting the balance between H+&#160;adsorption and desorption, which plays a determinant role on H+&#160;intercalation. The optimized Cu&#8208;MnO2&#160;delivers superior rate capability with the capacity of 153 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;at a high rate of 3 A g&#8208;1&#160;after 1000 cycles. This work demonstrates that &#949;p&#160;could be a significant descriptor for H+&#160;intercalation, and tuning &#949;p&#160;effectively increases&#160;H+&#160;intercalation contribution&#160;with excellent rate capability in ZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Substituted&#8208;Rhodamine&#8208;Based Reversible Fluorescent Probe for In Vivo Quantification of Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantifying glutathione (GSH) in cells and organisms is of great significance for understanding the mechanism of oxidative stress in various physiological and pathological processes. However, the quantification by fluorescence bioimaging in living tissues has much stricter requirements than the &#8216;Petri dish&#8217;&#8208;cultured cells in flat plates. Based on the evaluation of the electronic structure and steric hindrance&#8208;tuned reactivity of phospha&#8208;substituted rhodamine with GSH, a reversible F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe ZpSiP with a distinct performance (Kd = 4.9 mM, t1/2 = 0.57 s, k = 81 M&#8208;1 s&#8208;1) is developed for real time quantifying GSH in living cells. Furthermore, the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) probe succeeded in sensitively tracking the dynamics of GSH in the real organisms bearing tumors, chronic renal failure, and liver fibrosis for unveiling the related pathological processes. We believe that the advance in chemistry with quantitative analysis methods will initiate more promising progress and broad applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Hydrogenation of Phenol with Earth&#8208;abundant Ni&#8208;MoO2 Heterostructured Catalysts: Effect of Oxygen Vacancy on Product Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report highly efficient carbon supported Ni&#8208;MoO2 heterostructured catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogenation (ECH) of phenol in 0.10 M aqueous sulfuric acid (pH = 0.7) at 60 &#176;C. Highest yields for cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone of 95% and 86% with faradaic efficiencies of ~50% are obtained with catalysts bearing high and low densities of oxygen vacancy (Ov) sites, respectively. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that the enhanced phenol adsorption strength is responsible for the superior catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, 1&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1ol is an important intermediate. Its hydrogenation route and hence the final product are affected by the Ov density. This work opens a promising avenue to the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts for the upgrading of phenolic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Incorporated Sn Catalysts for Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemically reducing CO  2  to valuable fuels or feedstocks is recognized as a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the crises of fossil fuel shortage and carbon emission. Sn&#8208;based catalysts have been widely studied for electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) to make formic acid/formate, which unfortunately still suffer from low activity, selectivity and stability. In this work, halogen (F, Cl, Br or I) was introduced into Sn catalyst by a facile hydrolysis method. The presence of halogen was confirmed by a collection of  ex&#8208;situ  and  in&#8208;situ  characterizations, which rendered more positive valence state of Sn in halogen&#8208;incorporated Sn catalyst as compared to unmodified Sn under cathodic potentials in CO  2  RR and therefore tuned the adsorption strength of the key intermediate (*OCHO) toward formate formation. As a result, the halogen&#8208;incorporated Sn catalyst exhibited greatly enhanced catalytic performance in electrochemical CO  2  RR to produce formate.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing 2D Sandwich&#8208;like MOF/MXene Heterostructures for Durable and Fast Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D MOFs) can be used as the cathodes for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;ion battery due to their large one&#8208;dimensional channels. However, the conventionally poor electrical conductivity and low structural stability hinder their advances. Herein, we report an alternately stacked MOF/MX heterostructure, exhibiting the 2D sandwich&#8208;like structure with abundant active sites, improved electrical conductivity and exceptional structural stability. Ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal a reversible intercalation mechanism of zinc ions and high electrical conductivity in the 2D heterostructure. Electrochemical tests confirm excellent Zn2+ migration kinetics and ideal pseudocapacitive behaviors. As a consequence, Cu&#8208;HHTP/MX shows a superior rate performance (260.1 mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and 173.1 mA h g&#8722;1 at 4 A g&#8722;1) andlong&#8208;term cycling stability of 92.5% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 4 A g&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C1,N&#8208;Dipolar (3 + 2) Cycloadditions of 2&#8208;Aminoallyl Cations with Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2&#8208;Aminoallyl cations are versatile 1,3&#8208;dipoles that could potentially be used for diversified (3 + n) cycloaddition reactions. Despite some preliminary studies, the asymmetric catalytic transformation of these species is still underdeveloped. We herein report a binuclear copper&#8208;catalyzed generation of 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations from ethynyl methylene cyclic carbamates and its enantioselective (3 + 2) cycloaddition reaction with indoles to construct chiral pyrroloindolines. This transformation features a novel C1,N&#8208;dipolar reactivity for 2&#8208;aminoallyl cations.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualization of the Intermittent Gating of Na+/H+ Antiporters in Single Native Bioluminescent Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While the intermittent gating of ion channels has been well studied for decades, dynamics of the action of secondary transporters, another major pathway for ion transmembrane transports, remains largely unexplored in living cells. Herein, intermittent blinking of the spontaneous bioluminescence (BL) from single native bacteria, P. phosphoreum, was reported, investigated and attributed to the intermittent gating of sodium/proton antiporters (NhaA) between the active and inactive conformations. Each gating event caused the rapid depolarization and recovery of membrane potential within several seconds, accompanying with the apparent BL blinking due to the transient inhibitions on the activity of the respiratory chain. Temperature&#8208;dependent measurements further obtained an activation energy barrier of the conformational change of 20.3 kJ/mol.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorogenic Granzyme A Substrates Enable Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Adaptive Immune Cell Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytotoxic immune cells, including T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, are essential components of the host response against tumors. CTLs and NK cells secrete granzyme A (GzmA) upon recognition of cancer cells; however, there are very few tools that can detect physiological levels of active GzmA with high spatiotemporal resolution. Herein, we report the rational design of the near&#8208;infrared fluorogenic substrates for human GzmA and mouse GzmA. These activity&#8208;based probes display very high catalytic efficiency and selectivity over other granzymes, as shown in tissue lysates from wild&#8208;type and GzmA knock&#8208;out mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the probes can image how adaptive immune cells respond to antigen&#8208;driven recognition of cancer cells in real time.</dc:description>

         <title>Pure Isotropic Proton NMR Spectra in Solids using Deep Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The resolution of proton solid&#8208;state NMR spectra is usually limited by broadening arising from dipolar interactions between spins. Magic&#8208;angle spinning alleviates this broadening by inducing coherent averaging. However, even the highest spinning rates experimentally accessible today are not able to completely remove dipolar interactions. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach to determine pure isotropic proton spectra from a two&#8208;dimensional set of magic&#8208;angle spinning spectra acquired at different spinning rates. Applying the model to 8 organic solids yields high&#8208;resolution 1H solid&#8208;state NMR spectra with isotropic linewidths in the 50&#8208;400 Hz range.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity and Recyclability of Ligand&#8208;Protected Metal Cluster Catalysts for CO2 Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains a significant challenge to construct an integrated catalyst that combines advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis with clarified mechanism and high performance. Here we show atomically precise CuAg cluster catalysts for CO2 capture and utilization, where two functional units are combined into the clusters: metal and ligand. Due to atomic resolution on total and local structures of such catalysts to be achieved, which disentangles heterogeneous imprecise systems and permits tracing the reaction processes via experiments coupled with theory, site&#8208;specific catalysis induced by metal&#8208;ligand synergy can be accurately elucidated. The CuAg cluster catalysts exhibit excellent reactivity and recyclability to forge the C&#8208;N bonding from CO2 formylation with secondary amines that can make the cluster catalysts more unique compared with typically homogeneous complexes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;cell protein therapeutics is expected to promote our in&#8208;depth understanding of how does a specific protein with therapeutic dosing treat the cell without population averaging. However, it has not yet been tackled by current single&#8208;cell nanotools. We address this challenge by utilization of a double&#8208;barrel nanopipette, in which one lumen was used for electroosmotic cytosolic protein delivery and the other was customized for ionic evaluation of the consequence. Upon injection of protein DJ&#8208;1 via delivery lumen, upregulation of the antioxidant protein could protect neural PC&#8208;12 cells against oxidative stress from phorbol myristate acetate exposure, which could be transduced by targeting the cytosolic hydrogen peroxide by the detecting lumen. This work has devised a nanotool for single&#8208;cell protein therapeutics and provided a perspective for futuristic single&#8208;cell therapeutics involving different therapeutic modalities e.g. peptides, enzymes and nucleic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>An All&#8208;Natural Wood&#8208;Inspired Aerogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interesting surface nanocrystallization method was developed to make the surface&#8208;inert and weakly interacting wood particles better assemble to construct the aerogel. This bottom&#8208;up method allows the preparation of large&#8208;size composite aerogels. The wood&#8208;inspired oriented channel structure endows the obtained aerogel with superior thermal insulation properties to natural wood and most existing commercial sponges.







Abstract
The oriented pore structure of wood endows it with a variety of outstanding properties, among which the low thermal conductivity has attracted researchers to develop wood&#8208;like aerogels as excellent thermal insulation materials. However, the increasing demands of environmental protection have put forward new and strict requirements for the sustainability of aerogels. Here, we report an all&#8208;natural wood&#8208;inspired aerogel consisting of all&#8208;natural ingredients and develop a method to activate the surface&#8208;inert wood particles to construct the aerogel. The obtained wood&#8208;inspired aerogel has channel structure similar to that of natural wood, endowing it with superior thermal insulation properties to most existing commercial sponges. In addition, remarkable fire retardancy and complete biodegradability are integrated. With the above outstanding performances, this sustainable wood&#8208;inspired aerogel will be an ideal substitute for the existing commercial thermal insulation materials.

This bottom-up method allows the preparation of large-size composite aerogels. The wood-inspired oriented channel structure endows the obtained aerogel with superior thermal insulation properties to natural wood and most existing commercial sponges.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oriented pore structure of wood endows it with a variety of outstanding properties, among which the low thermal conductivity has attracted researchers to develop wood-like aerogels as excellent thermal insulation materials. However, the increasing demands of environmental protection have put forward new and strict requirements for the sustainability of aerogels. Here, we report an all-natural wood-inspired aerogel consisting of all-natural ingredients and develop a method to activate the surface-inert wood particles to construct the aerogel. The obtained wood-inspired aerogel has channel structure similar to that of natural wood, endowing it with superior thermal insulation properties to most existing commercial sponges. In addition, remarkable fire retardancy and complete biodegradability are integrated. With the above outstanding performances, this sustainable wood-inspired aerogel will be an ideal substitute for the existing commercial thermal insulation materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single mRNA Imaging with Fluorogenic RNA Aptamers and Small&#8208;molecule Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview covers the recent advances in the development of small&#8208;molecule fluorophores and fluorogenic RNA aptamers for single mRNA imaging. We summarized the pros and cons, and photochemical properties of five different RNA aptamers: small&#8208;molecule fluorophores systems and how they can be applied to single&#8208;molecule mRNA imaging.







Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) is the fundamental information transfer system in the cell. Tracking single mRNA from transcription to degradation with fluorescent probes provides spatiotemporal information in cells about how the genetic information is transferred from DNA to proteins. The traditional single mRNA imaging approach utilizes RNA hairpins (e.g. MS2) and tethered fluorescent protein as probes. As an exciting alternative, RNA aptamers: small&#8208;molecule fluorophores (SFs) systems have emerged as novel single mRNA imaging probes since 2019, exhibiting several advantages including fluorogenic ability and minimal perturbation. This review summarizes all five reported RNA aptamers: SFs systems for single mRNA imaging in living cells so far. It also discusses the challenges and provides prospects for single mRNA imaging applications. This review is expected to inspire researchers to develop RNA aptamers: SFs systems for studying gene expression at single&#8208;molecule resolution in cells.

         <title>Mapping the Complete Photocycle that Powers a Large Stokes Shift Red Fluorescent Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the working mechanisms of red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) in aqueous solution is essential for bioimaging. We implemented a synergistic toolset (steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved electronic and vibrational spectroscopies) and elucidated the complete photocycle that powers a large&#8208;Stokes&#8208;shift RFP, tracking the ultrafast excited&#8208;state proton transfer and chromophore twists in action and also providing protein rational design principles.







Abstract
Large Stokes shift (LSS) red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) are highly desirable for bioimaging advances. The RFP mKeima, with coexisting cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomers, holds significance as an archetypal system for LSS emission due to excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT), yet the mechanisms remain elusive. We implemented femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) and various time&#8208;resolved electronic spectroscopies, aided by quantum calculations, to dissect the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;mKeima photocycle from ESPT, isomerization, to ground&#8208;state proton transfer in solution. This work manifests the power of FSRS with global analysis to resolve Raman fingerprints of intermediate states. Importantly, the deprotonated trans&#8208;isomer governs LSS emission at 620&#8197;nm, while the deprotonated cis&#8208;isomer's 520&#8197;nm emission is weak due to an ultrafast cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization. Complementary spectroscopic techniques as a table&#8208;top toolset are thus essential to study photochemistry in physiological environments.

         <title>Catalytic DNA&#8208;Assisted Mass Production of Arbitrary Single&#8208;Stranded DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on two newly identified classes of DNAzymes, we developed paired&#8208;end cutting assisted by DNAzymes (PECAN) for mass production of scar&#8208;free single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA). We demonstrated the feasibility of using PECAN ssDNA for in situ RNA detection, homology&#8208;directed genome editing, and DNA&#8208;based data storage, and highlighted the advantages of using high&#8208;quality PECAN ssDNA in cutting&#8208;edge biotechnology.







Abstract
Synthetic single&#8208;stranded (ss) DNA is a cornerstone for life and materials science, yet the purity, quantity, length, and customizability of synthetic DNA are still limiting in various applications. Here, we present PECAN, paired&#8208;end cutting assisted by DNAzymes (DNA enzymes or deoxyribozymes), which enables mass production of ssDNA of arbitrary sequence (up to 7000 nucleotides, or nt) with single&#8208;base precision. At the core of PECAN technique are two newly identified classes of DNAzymes, each robustly self&#8208;hydrolyzing with minimal sequence requirement up&#8208; or down&#8208;stream of its cleavage site. Flanking the target ssDNA with a pair of such DNAzymes generates a precursor ssDNA amplifiable by pseudogene&#8208;recombinant bacteriophage, which subsequently releases the target ssDNA in large quantities after efficient auto&#8208;processing. PECAN produces ssDNA of virtually any terminal bases and compositions with &gt;98.5&#8201;% purity at the milligram&#8208;to&#8208;gram scale. We demonstrate the feasibility of using PECAN ssDNA for RNA in situ detection, homology&#8208;directed genome editing, and DNA&#8208;based data storage.

         <title>A Conformational Restriction Strategy for the Control of CRISPR/Cas Gene Editing with Photoactivatable Guide RNAs
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the discovery and development of conformationally restricted guide RNA, a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclized molecule that can be easily prepared with only two or three modification sites. This is a superior approach for the spatiotemporal control of CRISPR/Cas editing, which has enabled the precise cleavage of exogenous genes at a predefined cutting region without notable editing leakages in live cells and in embryos.







Abstract
The CRISPR/Cas system is one of the most powerful tools for gene editing. However, approaches for precise control of genome editing and regulatory events are still desirable. Here, we report the spatiotemporal and efficient control of CRISPR/Cas9&#8208; and Cas12a&#8208;mediated editing with conformationally restricted guide RNAs (gRNAs). This approach relied on only two or three pre&#8208;installed photo&#8208;labile substituents followed by an intramolecular cyclization, representing a robust synthetic method in comparison to the heavily modified linear gRNAs that often require extensive screening and time&#8208;consuming optimization. This tactic could direct the precise cleavage of the genes encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) protein within a predefined cutting region without notable editing leakage in live cells. We also achieved light&#8208;mediated myostatin (MSTN) gene editing in embryos, wherein a new bow&#8208;knot&#8208;type gRNA was constructed with excellent OFF/ON switch efficiency. Overall, our work provides a significant new strategy in CRISPR/Cas editing with modified circular gRNAs to precisely manipulate where and when genes are edited.

         <title>Cytochrome&#8197;P450 Catalyzes Benzene Ring Formation in the Biosynthesis of Trialkyl&#8208;Substituted Aromatic Polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small group of P450 enzymes were identified to form a benzene ring from an acyclic polyene substrate in the biosynthesis of lorneic acid and other trialkyl&#8208;substituted aromatic polyketides. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the mechanism of this unique P450&#8208;catalyzed benzene ring formation.







Abstract
Lorneic acid and related natural products are characterized by a trialkyl&#8208;substituted benzene ring. The formation of the aromatic core in the middle of the polyketide chain is unusual. We characterized a cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme that can catalyze the hallmark benzene ring formation from an acyclic polyene substrate through genetic and biochemical analysis. Using this P450 as a beacon for genome mining, we obtained 12 homologous type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters, among which two gene clusters are activated and able to produce trialkyl&#8208;substituted aromatic polyketides. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the plausible mechanism for P450&#8208;catalyzed benzene ring formation. Our work expands our knowledge of the catalytic diversity of cytochrome&#8197;P450.

&lt;p&gt;A small group of P450 enzymes were identified to form a benzene ring from an acyclic polyene substrate in the biosynthesis of lorneic acid and other trialkyl-substituted aromatic polyketides. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the mechanism of this unique P450-catalyzed benzene ring formation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorneic acid and related natural products are characterized by a trialkyl-substituted benzene ring. The formation of the aromatic core in the middle of the polyketide chain is unusual. We characterized a cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme that can catalyze the hallmark benzene ring formation from an acyclic polyene substrate through genetic and biochemical analysis. Using this P450 as a beacon for genome mining, we obtained 12 homologous type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters, among which two gene clusters are activated and able to produce trialkyl-substituted aromatic polyketides. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the plausible mechanism for P450-catalyzed benzene ring formation. Our work expands our knowledge of the catalytic diversity of cytochrome&#8197;P450.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Petrochemical&#8208;Free Route to Superelastic Hierarchical Cellulose Aerogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of cellulose aerogels with anisotropic and hierarchical porous architecture are developed via a petrochemical&#8208;free method. The aerogels display temperature&#8208;invariant elasticity (&#8764;5&#8201;% plastic deformation after 105 compressive cycles at 50&#8201;% strain), large&#8208;strain recoverability (folding and twisting), angular recovery speed high up to 1475.4&#176;&#8201;s&#8722;1, and exceptional fatigue resistance.







Abstract
Cellulose aerogels are plagued by intermolecular hydrogen bond&#8208;induced structural plasticity, otherwise rely on chemicals modification to extend service life. Here, we demonstrate a petrochemical&#8208;free strategy to fabricate superelastic cellulose aerogels by designing hierarchical structures at multi scales. Oriented channels consolidate the whole architecture. Porous walls of dehydrated cellulose derived from thermal etching not only exhibit decreased rigidity and stickiness, but also guide the microscopic deformation and mitigate localized large strain, preventing structural collapse. The aerogels show exceptional stability, including temperature&#8208;invariant elasticity, fatigue resistance (&#8764;5&#8201;% plastic deformation after 105&#8197;cycles), high angular recovery speed (1475.4&#176;&#8201;s&#8722;1), outperforming most cellulose&#8208;based aerogels. This benign strategy retains the biosafety of biomass and provides an alternative filter material for health&#8208;related applications, such as face masks and air purification.

         <title>The Effect of Molecular Conformations and Simulated &#8220;Self&#8208;Doping&#8221; in Phenothiazine Derivatives on Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twenty&#8208;four phenothiazine derivatives with two distinct molecular conformations were designed and their RTP behaviors in different states were systematically studied. Based on it, the stimulated self&#8208;doping system was constructed with ax&#8208;conformer as host and eq&#8208;one as guest, in which much promoted RTP performance was achieved.







Abstract
The research of purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials has drawn great attention for their wide potential applications. Besides single&#8208;component and host&#8211;guest doping systems, the self&#8208;doping with same molecule but different conformations in one state is also a possible way to construct RTP materials, regardless of its rare investigation. In this work, twenty&#8208;four phenothiazine derivatives with two distinct molecular conformations were designed and their RTP behaviors in different states were systematically studied, with the aim to deeply understand the self&#8208;doping effect on the corresponding RTP property. While the phenothiazine derivatives with quasi&#8208;axial (ax) conformation presented better RTP performance in aggregated state, the quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) ones were better in isolated state. Accordingly, the much promoted RTP performance was achieved in the stimulated self&#8208;doping state with ax&#8208;conformer as host and eq&#8208;one as guest, demonstrating the significant influence of self&#8208;doping on RTP effect.

         <title>Furan&#8208;Extended Helical Rylenes with Fjord Edge Topology and Tunable Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise synthetic strategy is reported for preparing lateral furan&#8208;extended rylenes bearing multifold O&#8208;doping and fjord edge topology. The resultant rylenes display fjord edge length dependent electronic structures and properties. The higher congener witnesses an open&#8208;shell structure and remarkable optoelectronic characteristics such as red&#8208;shifting and NIR&#8208;absorbing capacities, as well as pronounced mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism of chiral diradicaloids.







Abstract
Lateral furan&#8208;expansion of polycyclic aromatics, which enables multiple O&#8208;doping and peripheral edge evolution of rylenes, is developed for the first time. Tetrafuranylperylene TPF&#8208;4CN and octafuranylquaterrylene OFQ&#8208;8CN were prepared as model compounds bearing unique fjord edge topology and helical conformations. Compared to TPF&#8208;4CN, the higher congener OFQ&#8208;8CN displays a largely red&#8208;shifted (&#8776;333&#8197;nm) and intensified absorption band (&#955;max=829&#8197;nm) as well as a narrowed electrochemical band gap (&#8776;1.08&#8197;eV) due to its pronounced &#960;&#8208;delocalization and emerging of open&#8208;shell diradicaloid upon the increase of fjord edge length. Moreover, strong circular dichroism signals in a broad range until 900&#8197;nm are observed for open&#8208;shell chiral OFQ&#8208;8CN, owing to the excellent conformational stability of its central bis(tetraoxa[5]helicene) fragments. Our studies provide insights into the relationships between edge topologies and (chir)optoelectronic properties for this novel type of O&#8208;doped PAHs.

         <title>Intramolecular Interception of the Remote Position of Vinylcarbene Silver Complex Intermediates by C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vinylogous position of a donor&#8208;donor silver vinyl carbene is trapped with an aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond for the first time to afford 1&#8208;benzoazepine scaffolds. The overall transformation entails a carbene alkyne metathesis of a donor&#8208;acceptor silver carbene to furnish the key donor&#8208;donor silver vinyl carbene whose vinylogous position is selectively intercepted in a stepwise C&#8722;H bond insertion.







Abstract
The trapping of the elusive vinylogous position of a vinyl carbene with an aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been achieved for the first time during a silver&#8208;catalyzed carbene/alkyne metathesis (CAM) process. A Tpx&#8208;containing silver complex first promotes the generation of a donor&#8208;acceptor silver carbene which triggers CAM, generating a subsequent donor&#8208;donor vinyl silver carbene species, which then undergoes a selective vinylogous C(sp3)&#8722;H bond insertion, leading to the synthesis of a new family of benzoazepines. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil the reaction mechanism, which allows proposing that the C&#8722;H bond insertion reaction takes place in a stepwise manner, with the hydrogen shift being the rate determining step.

         <title>Continuous Electroformation of Gold Nanoparticles in Nanoliter Droplet Reactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplets encapsulating a gold precursor are generated on a microfluidic device. The droplets are then guided through a pair of parallel electrodes, where they are exposed to an electrical current, and gold nanoparticles are created.







Abstract
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are employed in numerous applications, including optics, biosensing and catalysis. Here, we demonstrate the stabilizer&#8208;free electrochemical synthesis of AuNPs inside nanoliter&#8208;sized reactors. Droplets encapsulating a gold precursor are formed on a microfluidic device and exposed to an electrical current by guiding them through a pair of electrodes. We exploit the naturally occurring recirculation flows inside confined droplets (moving in rectangular microchannels) to prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles after nucleation. Therefore, AuNPs with sizes in the range of 30 to 100&#8197;nm were produced without the need of additional capping agents. The average particle size is defined by the precursor concentration and droplet velocity, while the charge dose given by the electric field strength has a minor effect. This method opens the way to fine&#8208;tune the electrochemical production of gold nanoparticles, and we believe it is a versatile method for the formation of other metal nanoparticles.

     alt="Continuous Electroformation of Gold Nanoparticles in Nanoliter Droplet Reactors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Droplets encapsulating a gold precursor are generated on a microfluidic device. The droplets are then guided through a pair of parallel electrodes, where they are exposed to an electrical current, and gold nanoparticles are created.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are employed in numerous applications, including optics, biosensing and catalysis. Here, we demonstrate the stabilizer-free electrochemical synthesis of AuNPs inside nanoliter-sized reactors. Droplets encapsulating a gold precursor are formed on a microfluidic device and exposed to an electrical current by guiding them through a pair of electrodes. We exploit the naturally occurring recirculation flows inside confined droplets (moving in rectangular microchannels) to prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles after nucleation. Therefore, AuNPs with sizes in the range of 30 to 100&#8197;nm were produced without the need of additional capping agents. The average particle size is defined by the precursor concentration and droplet velocity, while the charge dose given by the electric field strength has a minor effect. This method opens the way to fine-tune the electrochemical production of gold nanoparticles, and we believe it is a versatile method for the formation of other metal nanoparticles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Azaarenes: 13 Rings in a Row by Cyclopentannulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large, stable cyclopentannulated azaarenes, consisting of up to 13 six&#8208;membered rings in a row, were prepared. Cyclopentannulation complements benzannulation strategies for the preparation of the higher (aza)arenes.







Abstract
Cyclopentannulation was explored as a strategy to access large, stable azaarenes. Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling of previously reported di&#8208; and tetrabrominated cyclopentannulated N,N&#8242;&#8208;dihydrotetraazapentacenes furnished stable azaarenes with up to 13 six&#8208;membered rings in a row and a length of 3.1&#8197;nm. Their optoelectronic and semi&#8208;conducting properties as well as their aromaticity were investigated.

         <dc:description>
Carbene&#8208;stabilized diborynes of the form LBBL (L=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene or cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene) induce rapid, high yielding, intermolecular ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H borylation at N&#8208;heterocycles at room temperature. The reaction initially provides the simple hydroarylated diborene, but in some cases proceeds further, providing unusual 1,3,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinine and base&#8208;stabilized alkylidene products.







Abstract
Carbene&#8208;stabilized diborynes of the form LBBL (L=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) or cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)) induce rapid, high yielding, intermolecular ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H borylation at N&#8208;heterocycles at room temperature. A simple pyridyldiborene is formed when an NHC&#8208;stabilized diboryne is combined with pyridine, while a CAAC&#8208;stabilized diboryne leads to activation of two pyridine molecules to give a tricyclic alkylideneborane, which can be forced to undergo a further H&#8208;shift resulting in a zwitterionic, doubly benzo&#8208;fused 1,3,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinine by heating. Use of the extended N&#8208;heteroaromatic quinoline leads to a borylmethyleneborane under mild conditions via an unprecedented boron&#8208;carbon exchange process.

         <title>Tunable Latency of Hydrosilylation Catalyst by Ligand Density on Nanoparticle Supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The density of norbornene ligands on silica nanoparticles alters the activity of a Pt hydrosilylation catalyst. Latency of hydrosilylation at high ligand density occurs despite the non&#8208;inhibitory behavior of the free ligand and establishes the non&#8208;innocent role of functionalized inorganic supports.







Abstract
Functionalizing inorganic particles with organic ligands is a common technique for heterogenizing organometallic catalysts. We describe how coordinating molecular platinum to silica nanoparticles functionalized with a high density of norbornene ligands causes unexpected latency of the catalytic activity in hydrosilylation reactions when compared to an identical reaction in which the norbornene is not tethered (2&#8201;% vs 97&#8201;% conversion in 1&#8197;h). Performing the hydrosilylation at elevated temperature (70&#8201;&#176;C) suppresses this activity delay, suggesting the usefulness of this technique towards temperature&#8208;triggered catalysis. We demonstrate that this latency is related to ligand density on the particle surface, chemical structure of the norbornene, and silica nanoparticle topology. We also establish the benefit of this latency for triggered curing of silicone elastomers. Overall, our work establishes the non&#8208;innocent role of inorganic supports when functionalized with organometallic complexes.

         <title>Electrostatic Shielding Boosts Electrochemical Performance of Alloy&#8208;Type Anode Materials of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

K+ ions are introduced as an electrolyte additive to achieve electrostatic shielding on &#956;&#8208;Sn, thereby achieving uniform sodiation and enhanced electrode stability.







Abstract
The applications of alloy&#8208;type anode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries are always obstructed by enormous volume variation upon cycles. Here, K+ ions are introduced as an electrolyte additive to improve the electrochemical performance via electrostatic shielding, using Sn microparticles (&#956;&#8208;Sn) as a model. Theoretical calculations and experimental results indicate that K+ ions are not incorporated in the electrode, but accumulate on some sites. This accumulation slows down the local sodiation at the &#8220;hot spots&#8221;, promotes the uniform sodiation and enhances the electrode stability. Therefore, the electrode maintains a high specific capacity of 565&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, much better than the case without K+. The electrode also remains an areal capacity of &#8776;3.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 100 cycles. This method does not involve time&#8208;consuming preparation, sophisticated instruments and expensive reagents, exhibiting the promising potential for other anode materials.

         <title>Unsymmetrically Chlorinated Non&#8208;Fused Electron Acceptor Leads to High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) have been developed. The halogen substituents on the aromatic side chains, as the new structure design tools, not only facilitate the construction of 3D stacks in solid, but also optimize the optoelectronic properties of the NFREAs, leading to organic solar cells with 16.2&#8201;% efficiency and excellent operational stability.







Abstract
Searching the cost&#8208;effective organic semiconductors is strongly needed in order to facilitate the practice of organic solar cells (OSCs), yet to be fulfilled. Herein, we have succeeded in developing two non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs), leading to the highest efficiency of 16.2&#8201;% for the NFREA derived OSCs. These OSCs exhibit the superior operational stabilities under one sun equivalent illumination without ultraviolet (UV) filtration. It is revealed that the modulation of halogen substituents on aromatic side chains, as the new structural tool to tune the intermolecular interaction and optoelectronic properties of acceptors, not only promotes the interlocked tic&#8208;tac&#8208;toe frame of three&#8208;dimensional stacks in solid, but also improves charge dynamics of acceptors to enable high&#8208;performance and stable OSCs.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Borylation of Alkynes and Vinylboronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regioselective remote borylation of internal alkynes and sterically hindered tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted vinylboronates enabled by rhodium catalysis is reported. The 1,n&#8208;diboronate products can be converted to a variety of useful building blocks, biologically active molecules, and drugs via the selective manipulation of the two boryl groups in products including the regioselective cross coupling, oxidation, and amination.







Abstract
Remote functionalization involving a fascinating chain&#8208;walking process has emerged as a powerful strategy for the rapid access to value&#8208;added functional molecules from readily available feedstocks. However, the scope of current methods is predominantly limited to mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted alkenes. The remote functionalization of multi&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkenes is challenging, and the use of alkynes in the chain walking is unexplored. We herein report a rhodium catalyzed remote borylation of internal alkynes, offering an unprecedented reaction mode of alkynes for the preparation of synthetically valuable 1,n&#8208;diboronates. The regioselective distal migratory hydroboration of sterically hindered tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted vinylboronates is also demonstrated to furnish various multi&#8208;boronic esters. Synthetic utilities are highlighted through the selective manipulation of the two boryl groups in products such as the regioselective cross coupling, oxidation, and amination.

         <title>Crystalline Anions Based on Classical N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;electron reduction of the C2&#8208;biphenylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolinium cation (2&#8201;a+) affords the radical 3&#8201;a, which undergoes further 1e&#8208;reduction to yield the anion 4&#8201;a&#8722;. In the solid&#8208;state, 3&#8201;a is monomeric while 4&#8201;a&#8208;K has a hexameric tubular structure. In addition to 3&#8201;a and 4&#8201;a&#8208;K, synthesis, structures, and reactivity of stable radicals and anions based on unsaturated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene frameworks have been presented.







Abstract
Herein, the first stable anions K[SIPrBp] (4&#8201;a&#8208;K) and K[IPrBp] (4&#8201;b&#8208;K) (SIPrBp=BpC{N(Dipp)CH2}2, IPrBp=BpC{N(Dipp)CH}2; Bp=4&#8208;PhC6H4; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) derived from classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) (i.e. SIPr and IPr) have been isolated as violet crystalline solids. 4&#8201;a&#8208;K and 4&#8201;b&#8208;K are prepared by KC8 reduction of the neutral radicals [SIPrBp] (3&#8201;a) and [IPrBp] (3&#8201;b), respectively. The radicals 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b as well as [Me&#8208;IPrBp] 3&#8201;c (Me&#8208;IPrBp=BpC{N(Dipp)CMe}2) are accessible as crystalline solids on treatment of the respective 1,3&#8208;imidazoli(ni)um bromides (SIPrBp)Br (2&#8201;a), (IPrBp)Br (2&#8201;b), and (Me&#8722;IPrBp)Br (2&#8201;c) with KC8. The cyclic voltammograms of 2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;c exhibit two one&#8208;electron reversible redox processes in &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;2.5&#8197;V region that correspond to the radicals 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c and the anions (4&#8201;a&#8211;4&#8201;c)&#8722;. Computational calculations suggest a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state for (4&#8201;a&#8211;4&#8201;c)&#8722; with the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of 17&#8211;24&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Co&#8208;Intercalation of Dual Charge Carriers in Metal&#8208;Ion&#8208;Confining Layered Vanadium Oxide Nanobelts for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a series of metal confined nanomaterials by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method. The metal ions confined nanobelts can stabilize the layered structure, effectively control the interlayer spacing, and provide a more significant diffusion channel for the intercalation and deintercalation of Zn2+ without changing the oxide morphology.







Abstract
Vanadium&#8208;based oxides with high theoretical specific capacities and open crystal structures are promising cathodes for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). In this work, the confined synthesis can insert metal ions into the interlayer spacing of layered vanadium oxide nanobelts without changing the original morphology. Furthermore, we obtain a series of nanomaterials based on metal&#8208;confined nanobelts, and describe the effect of interlayer spacing on the electrochemical performance. The electrochemical properties of the obtained Al2.65V6O13&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.07H2O as cathodes for AZIBs are remarkably improved with a high initial capacity of 571.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Even at a high current density of 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the initial capacity can still reach 205.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a high capacity retention of 89.2&#8201;% after 2000&#8197;cycles. This study demonstrates that nanobelts confined with metal ions can significantly improve energy storage applications, revealing new avenues for enhancing the electrochemical performance of AZIBs.

         <title>Iron Nanoparticles Protected by Chainmail&#8208;structured Graphene for Durable Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Nitrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin graphene nanosheet layers were created as chainmail&#8208;protected iron nanoparticles (Fe@Gnc) using a simple hydrothermal method and in situ thermal reduction strategy, which can achieve nitrate reduction to nitrogen. The designed graphene nanochainmail protects the internal iron active sites and has excellent stability and durability over 40 cycles.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is an appealing technology for regulating the nitrogen cycle. Metallic iron is one of the well&#8208;known electrocatalysts for NO3RR, but it suffers from poor durability due to leaching and oxidation of iron during the electrocatalytic process. In this work, a graphene&#8208;nanochainmail&#8208;protected iron nanoparticle (Fe@Gnc) electrocatalyst is reported. It displays superior nitrate removal efficiency and high nitrogen selectivity. Notably, the catalyst delivers exceptional stability and durability, with the nitrate removal rate and nitrogen selectivity remained &#8776;96&#8201;% of that of the first time after up to 40 cycles (24&#8197;h for one cycle). As expected, the conductive graphene nanochainmail provides robust protection for the internal iron active sites, allowing Fe@Gnc to maintain its long&#8208;lasting electrochemical nitrate catalytic activity. This research proposes a workable solution for the scientific challenge of poor lasting ability of iron&#8208;based electrocatalysts in large&#8208;scale industrialization.

         <title>Cu/SaBox&#8208;Catalyzed Photoinduced Coupling of Acylsilanes with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling of alkynes with the Fischer&#8208;type copper carbene species has been achieved, by harnessing &#945;&#8208;siloxyl carbene intermediates that were in situ generated from acylsilanes. Mechanistic studies suggested that the side&#8208;arm modified bisoxazoline (SaBox) ligands are crucial for this coupling reaction.







Abstract
The transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction with Fischer metal carbene intermediates bearing an electron&#8208;rich alkoxyl or siloxyl group remains a big challenge due to the lack of readily available corresponding carbene precursors. Herein, we report the coupling of alkynes with the Fischer&#8208;type copper carbene species bearing a &#945;&#8208;siloxyl group, which could be in situ generated from acylsilanes catalytically under photoirradiation and redox&#8208;neutral conditions. The side&#8208;arm modified bisoxazoline (SaBox) ligands prove to be crucial for this coupling reaction, which provides the corresponding alkynyl alcohol in high yields with remarkable heterocycle tolerance and broad substrate scope.

         <title>Emerging Lithiated Organic Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview systematically summarizes the recent progress on emerging lithiated organic cathode materials, including their synthesis, stability, and half&#8208; and full&#8208;battery applications. The biggest advantage of lithiated organic cathode materials is that they can act as a Li reservoir to couple with Li&#8208;free anodes for lithium&#8208;ion full batteries.







Abstract
Organic electrode materials have application potential in lithium batteries owing to their high capacity, abundant resources, and structural designability. However, most reported organic cathodes are at oxidized states (namely unlithiated compounds) and thus need to couple with Li&#8208;rich anodes. In contrast, lithiated organic cathode materials could act as a Li reservoir and match with Li&#8208;free anodes such as graphite, showing great promise for practical full&#8208;battery applications. Here we summarize the synthesis, stability, and battery applications of lithiated organic cathode materials, including synthetic methods, stability against O2 and H2O in air, and strategies to improve comprehensive electrochemical performance. Future research should be focused on new redox chemistries and the construction of full batteries with lithiated organic cathodes and commercial anodes under practical conditions. This Minireview will encourage more efforts on lithiated organic cathode materials and finally promote their commercialization.

         <title>Isomeric Oligo(Phenylenevinylene)&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Different Orientation of Imine Bonds and Distinct Photocatalytic Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isomeric imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different orientations of their imine bonds were prepared by the introduction of oligo(phenylenevinylene) moieties through a Schiff&#8208;base condensation reaction. The effects of the different orientation of imine bonds on the photoelectric properties of the COFs were evaluated through photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions.







Abstract
Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively studied in photocatalysis because of their easy synthesis and excellent crystallinity. The effect of imine&#8208;bond orientation on the photocatalytic properties of COFs, however, is still rarely studied. Herein, we report two novel COFs with different orientations of imine bonds using oligo(phenylenevinylene) moieties. The COFs showed similar structures but great differences in their photoelectric properties. COF&#8208;932 demonstrated a superior hydrogen evolution performance compared to COF&#8208;923 when triethanolamine was used as the sacrificial agent. Interestingly, the use of ascorbic acid led to the protonation of the COFs, further altering the direction of electron transfer. The photocatalytic performances were increased to 23.4 and 0.73&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for protonated COF&#8208;923 and COF&#8208;932, respectively. This study provides a clear strategy for the design of imine&#8208;linked COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and advances the development of COFs.

We propose the pseudobrookite Fe2TiO5 nanofiber with abundant oxygen vacancies as a new electrocatalyst to ambiently reduce nitrate to ammonia. Such catalyst achieves a large NH3 yield of 0.73&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and a high Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of 87.6&#8201;% in phosphate buffer saline solution with 0.1&#8197;M NaNO3, which is lifted to 1.36&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and 96.06&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE for nitrite conversion to ammonia in 0.1&#8197;M NaNO2. It also shows excellent electrochemical durability and structural stability. Theoretical calculation reveals the enhanced conductivity of this catalyst and an extremely low free energy of &#8722;0.28&#8197;eV for nitrate adsorption at the presence of vacant oxygen.

         <title>Zincophilic Electrode Interphase with Appended Proton Reservoir Ability Stabilizes Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile protective coating is constructed on the Zn anodes (ZP@Zn), where the anionic group with excellent zincophilic and amphoteric characteristics achieves the reversible proton storage and accelerates the desolvation kinetics on the anode surface, thereby mitigating the parasitic side reactions derived from water, and facilitating homogeneous Zn nucleation and growth concomitantly.







Abstract
The rampant dendrites and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) resulting from the turbulent interfacial evolution at the anode/electrolyte are the main culprits of short lifespan and low Coulombic efficiency of Zn metal batteries. In this work, a versatile protective coating with excellent zincophilic and amphoteric features is constructed on the surface of Zn metal (ZP@Zn) as dendrite&#8208;free anodes. This kind of protective coating possesses the advantages of reversible proton storage and rapid desolvation kinetics, thereby mitigating the HER and facilitating homogeneous nucleation concomitantly. Furthermore, the space charge polarization effect promotes charge redistribution to achieve uniform Zn deposition. Accordingly, the ZP@Zn symmetric cell manifests excellent reversibility at an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity of 4700&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling at 80&#8201;% depth of discharge (DOD). The ZP@Zn//V6O13 pouch cell also reveals superior cycling stability with a high capacity of 326.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Selective Synthesis of Oligosaccharides by Mechanochemical Hydrolysis of Chitin over a Carbon&#8208;Based Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical approaches enable the efficient synthesis of a variety of chemicals. Hirokazu Kobayashi, Atsushi Fukuoka et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202214229) report that an activated carbon having weak acid sites convert chitin, an abundant but highly recalcitrant biomass, to chitin&#8208;oligosaccharides selectively under ball&#8208;milling conditions. Large chitin molecules are hydrolyzed more rapidly than small oligomers, thus achieving a high selectivity. The produced oligosaccharides enhance plant immune systems so that crops can withstand pathogens with low agrochemical use.

         <title>Multifunctional Helicene&#8208;Based Ytterbium Coordination Polymer Displaying Circularly Polarized Luminescence, Slow Magnetic Relaxation and Room Temperature Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiopure 1D YbIII coordination polymers involving helicene&#8208;based ligands were designed. Their physical investigations revealed an unprecedented combination of field&#8208;induced Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet behavior, Near&#8208;Infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence and room temperature Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism (MChD). The magnetic anisotropy was determined as the preponderant criterion for the observation of a strong MChD.







Abstract
The combination of physical properties sensitive to molecular chirality in a single system allows the observation of fascinating phenomena such as magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism (MChD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) having potential applications for optical data readout and display technology. Homochiral monodimensional coordination polymers of YbIII were designed from a 2,15&#8208;bis&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;hexahelicenic scaffold decorated with two terminal 4&#8208;pyridyl units. Thanks to the coordination of the chiral organic chromophore to Yb(hfac)3 units (hfac&#8722;=1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoroacetylaconate), efficient NIR&#8208;CPL activity is observed. Moreover, the specific crystal field around the YbIII induces a strong magnetic anisotropy which leads to a single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) behaviour and a remarkable room temperature MChD. The MChD&#8208;structural correlation is supported by computational investigations.

         <title>Grain Boundary Electronic Insulation for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grain boundary electronic insulation strategy is proposed to tolerate the electronic conductivity of sulfide electrodes at the grain boundaries, which realizes dendrite&#8208; and self&#8208;discharge&#8208;free and humidity&#8208;stable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Sulfide electrolytes with high ionic conductivities are one of the most highly sought for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, the non&#8208;negligible electronic conductivities of sulfide electrolytes (&#8776;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) lead to electron smooth transport through the sulfide electrolyte pellets, resulting in Li dendrite directly depositing at the grain boundaries (GBs) and serious self&#8208;discharge. Here, a grain&#8208;boundary electronic insulation (GBEI) strategy is proposed to block electron transport across the GBs, enabling Li&#8722;Li symmetric cells with 30&#8197;times longer cycling life and Li&#8722;LiCoO2 full cells with three times lower self&#8208;discharging rate than pristine sulfide electrolytes. The Li&#8722;LiCoO2 ASSLBs deliver high capacity retention of 80&#8201;% at 650&#8197;cycles and stable cycling performance for over 2600&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The innovation of the GBEI strategy provides a new direction to pursue high&#8208;performance ASSLBs via tailoring the electronic conductivity.

In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202214397), Kazuo Tanaka et&#8197;al. report unique solid&#8208;state emission from three types of acridine&#8208;tethered boron clusters, o&#8208;carboranes, with variable degrees of methylation. They found that monomer emission, excimer emission from the &#960;&#8208;stacked intra&#8208;dimer unit, and excimer emission from the &#960;&#8208;stacked inter&#8208;dimer unit can be simultaneously obtained. Consequently, not only drastic luminescent color changes but also thermochromic luminescent properties were observed.

         <dc:description>
Systematic reaction path exploration revealed the entire mechanism of Knowles's&#160;light&#8208;promoted catalytic intramolecular hydroamination via radical processes. In their&#160;Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202211936), Yu Harabuchi, Satoshi Maeda, and co&#8208;workers investigated the energetically favorable reaction path by constructing reaction&#160;path networks and searching for the seam of crossing geometries. Calculations&#160;showed that the reduction and proton shuttle process proceeded concertedly.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Peptidyl Aggregates for the Fluorogenic Recognition of Mitochondrial DNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled peptidyl fluorogenic probe (CV2) able to selectively light&#8208;up parallel G4 DNA over antiparallel topologies is presented by Jeehyeon Bae, Youngmi Kim et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202215049). CV2 allows for the selective staining of G4&#8197;s in mitochondria over the nucleus in living cells and is further employed for tracking the folding and unfolding of G4&#8197;s in living cells, and for monitoring mitochondrial DNA damage.

         <dc:description>
The circular ssDNA genome originating from the bacterial phage phiX174 is efficiently packaged into an icosahedral DNA nanoframe to form a virus mimetic particle, which can passively infect the host E. coli bacteria through cell uptake. The structure rigidity, integrity, permeability and programmability of the nanoframe are key features in the genome packaging and E. coli infection process, as reported by Yang Yang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202214731).

         <title>Caught in Action: Visualizing Dynamic Nanostructures Within Supramolecular Systems Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As supramolecular chemistry begins to develop dynamic nanostructures that change over time, it becomes imperative to visualize self&#8208;assembly processes in solution in real&#8208;time. Our Review demonstrates how solution&#8208;based visualization techniques, namely optical super&#8208;resolution microscopy, atomic force and electron microscopy in liquid, and molecular dynamics simulations, have enriched our understanding of nanomaterials to obtain novel functions.







Abstract
Supramolecular systems chemistry has been an area of active research to develop nanomaterials with life&#8208;like functions. Progress in systems chemistry relies on our ability to probe the nanostructure formation in solution. Often visualizing the dynamics of nanostructures which transform over time is a formidable challenge. This necessitates a paradigm shift from dry sample imaging towards solution&#8208;based techniques. We review the application of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques for real&#8208;time, in situ visualization of dynamic self&#8208;assembly processes. We present how solution&#8208;based techniques namely optical super&#8208;resolution microscopy, solution&#8208;state atomic force microscopy, liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy, molecular dynamics simulations and other emerging techniques are revolutionizing our understanding of active and adaptive nanomaterials with life&#8208;like functions. This Review provides the visualization toolbox and futuristic vision to tap the potential of dynamic nanomaterials.

         <title>Ceria&#8208;Supported Cobalt Catalyst for Low&#8208;Temperature Methanation at Low Partial Pressures of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co/CeO2 is an efficient low&#8208;temperature methanation catalyst at CO2 partial pressures down to atmospheric concentrations. Advanced spectroscopic investigations unveiled that the combination of a higher concentration and higher intrinsic activity of active intermediates (formates and carbonyls) explains the high activity, emphasizing the role of the metal&#8208;ceria interface.







Abstract
The direct catalytic conversion of atmospheric CO2 to valuable chemicals is a promising solution to avert negative consequences of rising CO2 concentration. However, heterogeneous catalysts efficient at low partial pressures of CO2 still need to be developed. Here, we explore Co/CeO2 as a catalyst for the methanation of diluted CO2 streams. This material displays an excellent performance at reaction temperatures as low as 175&#8201;&#176;C and CO2 partial pressures as low as 0.4&#8197;mbar (the atmospheric CO2 concentration). To gain mechanistic understanding of this unusual activity, we employed in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and operando infrared spectroscopy. The higher surface concentration and reactivity of formates and carbonyls&#8212;key reaction intermediates&#8212;explain the superior activity of Co/CeO2 as compared to a conventional Co/SiO2 catalyst. This work emphasizes the catalytic role of the cobalt&#8208;ceria interface and will aid in developing more efficient CO2 hydrogenation catalysts.

         <title>Preparative&#8208;Scale Biocatalytic Oxygenation of N&#8208;Heterocycles with a Lyophilized Peroxygenase Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lyophilized preparation of an unspecific peroxygenase variant from Agrocybe aegerita (rAaeUPO&#8208;PaDa&#8208;I&#8208;H) is a highly effective catalyst for the oxygenation of a diverse range of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds. Scalable, high yielding and enantioselective biocatalytic oxygenations have been developed, including 27 preparative examples (ca. 100&#8197;mg scale) across a wide range of substrates, including alkyl pyridines, bicyclic N&#8208;heterocycles and indoles.

Scalable biocatalytic oxygenations (27 preparative examples, ca. 100&#8197;mg scale) have been developed across a wide range of substrates, including alkyl pyridines, bicyclic N&#8208;heterocycles and indoles. H2O2 is the only stoichiometric oxidant needed, without auxiliary electron transport proteins, which is key to the practicality of the method. Reaction outcomes can be altered depending on whether hydrogen peroxide was delivered by syringe pump or through in situ generation using an alcohol oxidase from Pichia pastoris (PpAOX) and methanol as a co&#8208;substrate. Good synthetic yields (up to 84&#8201;%), regioselectivity and enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) were observed in some cases, highlighting the promise of UPOs as practical, versatile and scalable oxygenation biocatalysts.

         <title>Coordination of Polyketide Release and Multiple Detoxification Pathways for Tolerable Production of Fungal Mycotoxins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of aurovertins involves a coordinated strategy for the tolerable production of fungal mycotoxins. A cyclase promotes the release of the polyketide backbone, while enzymatic acetylation functions as the major detoxification pathway, and non&#8208;enzymatic shunt pathways function as salvage routes to avoid excessive accumulation of the toxic metabolites.







Abstract
Efficient biosynthesis of microbial bioactive natural products (NPs) is beneficial for the survival of producers, while self&#8208;protection is necessary to avoid self&#8208;harm resulting from over&#8208;accumulation of NPs. The underlying mechanisms for the effective but tolerable production of bioactive NPs are not well understood. Herein, in the biosynthesis of two fungal polyketide mycotoxins aurovertin&#8197;E (1) and asteltoxin, we show that the cyclases in the gene clusters promote the release of the polyketide backbone, and reveal that a signal peptide is crucial for their subcellular localization and full activity. Meanwhile, the fungus adopts enzymatic acetylation as the major detoxification pathway of 1. If intermediates are over&#8208;produced, the non&#8208;enzymatic shunt pathways work as salvage pathways to avoid excessive accumulation of the toxic metabolites for self&#8208;protection. These findings provided new insight into the interplay of efficient backbone release and multiple detoxification strategies for the production of fungal bioactive NPs.

Meanwhile, the fungus adopts enzymatic acetylation as the major detoxification pathway of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. If intermediates are over-produced, the non-enzymatic shunt pathways work as salvage pathways to avoid excessive accumulation of the toxic metabolites for self-protection. These findings provided new insight into the interplay of efficient backbone release and multiple detoxification strategies for the production of fungal bioactive NPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilizing Cobalt&#8208;free Li&#8208;rich Layered Oxide Cathodes through Oxygen Lattice Regulation by Two&#8208;phase Ru Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work comprehensively studies the mechanistic behaviour of cobalt&#8208;free Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 and demonstrates the positive impact of two&#8208;phase Ru doping on voltage decay using the combination of in operando and post&#8208;mortem synchrotron analyses. A mechanistic transition from a C2/c phase to a R
m phase is reported for the first time. The best voltage retention for Co&#8208;free LNMO to date (decay rate &lt;0.45&#8197;mV per cycle) has been achieved.







Abstract
The application of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides is hindered by their dramatic capacity and voltage decay on cycling. This work comprehensively studies the mechanistic behaviour of cobalt&#8208;free Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 and demonstrates the positive impact of two&#8208;phase Ru doping. A mechanistic transition from the monoclinic to the hexagonal behaviour is found for the structural evolution of Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, and the improvement mechanism of Ru doping is understood using the combination of in operando and post&#8208;mortem synchrotron analyses. The two&#8208;phase Ru doping improves the structural reversibility in the first cycle and restrains structural degradation during cycling by stabilizing oxygen (O2&#8722;) redox and reducing Mn reduction, thus enabling high structural stability, an extraordinarily stable voltage (decay rate &lt;0.45&#8197;mV per cycle), and a high capacity&#8208;retention rate during long&#8208;term cycling. The understanding of the structure&#8208;function relationship of Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 sheds light on the selective doping strategy and rational materials design for better&#8208;performance Li&#8208;rich layered oxides.

         <title>Autonomous Non&#8208;Equilibrium Self&#8208;Assembly and Molecular Movements Powered by Electrical Energy
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By controlling the potential of two electrodes simultaneously, a strategy has been implemented that uses electrical energy to drive self&#8208;assembling systems away from equilibrium. The proposed approach has been demonstrated by modulating the self&#8208;assembly of a calix[6]arene host with a viologen guest, using a scanning electrochemical microscope setup. High thermodynamic efficiencies are obtained.







Abstract
The ability to exploit energy autonomously is one of the hallmarks of life. Mastering such processes in artificial nanosystems can open technological opportunities. In the last decades, light&#8208; and chemically driven autonomous systems have been developed in relation to conformational motion and self&#8208;assembly, mostly in relation to molecular motors. In contrast, despite electrical energy being an attractive energy source to power nanosystems, its autonomous harnessing has received little attention. Herein we consider an operation mode that allows the autonomous exploitation of electrical energy by a self&#8208;assembling system. Threading and dethreading motions of a pseudorotaxane take place autonomously in solution, powered by the current flowing between the electrodes of a scanning electrochemical microscope. The underlying autonomous energy ratchet mechanism drives the self&#8208;assembly steps away from equilibrium with a higher energy efficiency compared to other autonomous systems. The strategy is general and might be extended to other redox&#8208;driven systems.

         <title>Unprecedented Relaxivity Gap in pH&#8208;Responsive Fe(III)&#8208;Based MRI Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two mononuclear ferric complexes are reported that respond to a pH change with a 27&#8208; and 71&#8208;fold jump, respectively, in their capacity to accelerate the longitudinal relaxation rate of water&#8208;hydrogen nuclei, and this starting from a negligible base value of only 0.06. This unprecedented performance bodes well for tackling the sensitivity issues hampering the development of Molecular MRI. The two chelates also excel in the fully reversible and fatigue&#8208;less nature of this phenomenon. The structural reasons for this performance reside in the macrocyclic nature of the hexa&#8208;dentate ligand, as well as the presence of a single pendant arm displaying a five&#8208;membered lactam or carbamate which show (perturbed) pKa values of 3.5 in the context of this N6&#10234;N5O1 coordination motif.</dc:description>

         <title>Disruption of Zinc Homeostasis by A Novel Platinum(IV)&#8208;Terthiophene Complex for Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc homeostatic medicine is of great potential for cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy, however, there are few reports on anti&#8208;tumor compounds that can trigger Zn2+&#8208;mediated immune responses. In this work, we developed a novel cyclometalated Pt(IV)&#8208;terthiophene complex Pt3, not only inducing DNA damage and cellular metabolism dysregulation, but also disrupting zinc homeostasis as indicated by the abnormal transcriptional level of zinc regulatory proteins, excess accumulation of Zn2+ in cytoplasm, and down&#8208;regulation of metallothioneins (MTs), which further caused redox imbalance. The simultaneous disruption of zinc and redox homeostasis in response to Pt3 treatment activated gasdermin&#8208;D mediated pyroptosis accompanied with cytoskeleton remodeling, thus releasing pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines to promote dendritic cells (DCs) maturation and T cells tumor&#8208;infiltration, eventually eliminating both primary and distant tumors in vivo. As far as we know, this is the first metal complex that can regulate zinc homeostasis to activate anti&#8208;tumor immunity.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Catalysis of Polysulfides in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries through Adsorption Competition by Tuning Cationic Geometric Configuration of Dual&#8208;active Sites in Spinel Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fundamentally understanding the structure&#8208;property relationship is critical to design advanced electrocatalysts for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, which remains a formidable challenge. Herein, by manipulating the regulable cations in spinel oxides, their geometrical&#8208;site&#8208;dependent catalytic activity for sulfur redox is investigated. Experimental and theoretical analyses validate that the modulation essence of cooperative catalysis of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is dominated by LiPSs adsorption competition between Co3+ tetrahedral (Td) and Mn3+ octahedral (Oh) sites on Mn3+Oh&#8208;O&#8208;Co3+Td backbones. Specifically, high&#8208;spin Co3+Td with stronger Co&#8208;S covalency anchors LiPSs persistently, while electron delocalized Mn3+Oh with adsorptive orbital (dz2) functions better in catalyzing specialized LiPSs conversion. This work inaugurates a universal strategy for sculpting geometrical configuration to achieve charge, spin, and orbital topological regulation in electrocatalysts for Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

Herein, by manipulating the regulable cations in spinel oxides, their geometrical-site-dependent catalytic activity for sulfur redox is investigated. Experimental and theoretical analyses validate that the modulation essence of cooperative catalysis of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is dominated by LiPSs adsorption competition between Co3+ tetrahedral (Td) and Mn3+ octahedral (Oh) sites on Mn3+Oh-O-Co3+Td backbones. Specifically, high-spin Co3+Td with stronger Co-S covalency anchors LiPSs persistently, while electron delocalized Mn3+Oh with adsorptive orbital (dz2) functions better in catalyzing specialized LiPSs conversion. This work inaugurates a universal strategy for sculpting geometrical configuration to achieve charge, spin, and orbital topological regulation in electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Cationic Disordering Induces two Distinct Degradation Pathways in Co&#8208;Free Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are one of the most attractive cathode materials in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries, their degradation mechanisms are still not completely elucidated. Herein, we report a strong dependence of degradation pathways on the long&#8208;range cationic disordering of Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich Li1&#8208;m(Ni0.94Al0.06)1+mO2 (NA). Interestingly, a disordered layered phase with lattice mismatch can be easily formed in the near&#8208;surface region of NA particles with very low cation disorder (NA&#8208;LCD, m &#8804; 0.06) over electrochemical cycling, while the layered structure is basically maintained in the core of particles forming a &#8220;core&#8208;shell&#8221; structure. Such surface reconstruction triggers a rapid capacity decay during the first 100 cycles between 2.7 and 4.3 V at 1 C or 3 C. On the contrary, the local lattice distortions are gradually accumulated throughout the whole NA particles with higher degrees of cation disorder (NA&#8208;HCD, 0.06 &#8804; m &#8804; 0.15) that lead to a slow capacity decay upon cycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenoxazine Polymer&#8208;based p&#8208;type Positive Electrode for Aluminum&#8208;ion Batteries with Ultra&#8208;long Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) are a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the abundant reserves, low cost, good safety, and high theoretical capacity of Al. However, AIBs with inorganic positive electrodes still suffer from sluggish kinetics and structural collapse upon cycling. Herein, we propose a novel p&#8208;type poly(vinylbenzyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenoxazine) (PVBPX) positive electrode for AIBs. The dual active sites enable PVBPX to deliver a high capacity of 133 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1. More impressively, the expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated construction, insolubility, and anionic redox chemistry without bond rearrangement of PVBPX for AIBs contribute to an amazing ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 50000 cycles. The charge storage mechanism is that the AlCl4&#8722; ions can reversibly coordinate/dissociate with the N and O sites in PVBPX sequentially, which is evidenced by both experimental and theoretical results. These findings establish a foundation to advance organic AIBs for large&#8208;scale energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insight&#160;into Peptidyl&#8208;Cysteine Oxidation by the Copper&#8208;Dependent Formylglycine&#8208;Generating Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper&#8208;dependent formylglycine&#8208;generating enzyme (FGE) catalyzes the oxygen&#8208;dependent oxidation of specific peptidyl&#8208;cysteine residues to formylglycine. Our QM/MM calculations provide a very likely mechanism for this transformation. The reaction starts with dioxygen binding to the tris&#8208;thiolate Cu(I) center to form a triplet Cu(II)&#8208;superoxide complex. The rate&#8208;determining hydrogen atom abstraction involves a triplet&#8208;singlet crossing to form a Cu(II)&#8208;OOH species that couples with the substrate radical, leading to a Cu(I)&#8208;alkylperoxo intermediate. This is accompanied by proton transfer from the hydroperoxide to the S atom of the substrate via a nearby water molecule. The subsequent O&#8208;O bond cleavage is coupled with the C&#8208;S bond breaking that generates the formylglycine and a Cu(II)&#8208;oxyl complex. Moreover, our results suggest that the aldehyde oxygen of the final product originates from O2, which will be useful for future experimental work.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzotrithiophene&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalysts with Controlled&#160;Conjugation of Building Blocks for Charge Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks have recently shown high potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, their structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship has not been sufficiently explored to identify a research direction for structural design. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of four benzotrithiophene (BTT)based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different conjugations of building units, and their photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. All four BTT&#8208;COFs had slipped parallel stacking patterns with high crystallinity and specific surface areas. The change in the degree of conjugation was found to rationally tune the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Based on the experimental and calculation results, the tunable photocatalytic performance could be mainly attributed to the electron affinity and charge trapping of the electron accepting units. This study provides important insights for designing covalent organic frameworks for efficient photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Twisted Conformation Thiopyrylium Photosensitizers for in vivo Near Infrared&#8208;II Imaging and Rapid Inactivation of Coronavirus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite significant effort, a majority of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers have short excitation wavelengths, thereby hampering their biomedical applications. Here, we present a facile approach for developing efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers. Based on a series of thiopyrylium&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II (1000&#8208;1700 nm) dyads, we found that the star dyad HD with a sterically bulky and electron&#8208;rich moiety exhibited configuration torsion and significantly enhanced intersystem crossing (ISC) compared to the parent dyad. The electron excitation characteristics of HD changed from local excitation (LE) to charge transfer (CT)&#8208;domain, contributing to a ~ 6&#8208;fold reduction in energy gap (&#916;EST), a ~ 10&#8208;fold accelerated ISC process, and a ~ 31.49&#8208;fold elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) quantum yield. The optimized SP@HD&#8208;PEG2K&#160;lung&#8208;targeting dots enabled real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II lung imaging, which precisely guided rapid pulmonary coronavirus inactivation.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Difunctionalization of Sulfur Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient protocols for accessing iodo&#8208;implanted diaryl and aryl(vinyl) sulfides have been developed using iodonium salts as reactive electrophilic arylation and vinylation reagents. The reactions take place under transition metal&#8208;free conditions, employing odorless and convenient sulfur reagents. A wide variety of functional groups are tolerated in the S&#8208;diarylation, leading to the regioselective late&#8208;stage application of several heterocycles and drug molecules under mild reaction conditions. A novel S&#8208;difunctionalization pathway was discovered using vinyliodonium salts, which proceeds under additive&#8208;free reaction conditions and grants excellent stereoselectivity in the synthesis of (aryl)vinyl sulfides. A one&#8208;pot strategy combining transition metal&#8208;free diarylation and subsequent reduction provided facile access to electron&#8208;rich thioanilines and a direct synthesis of a potential drug candidate derivative. The retained iodo group allows a wide array of further synthetic transformations. Mechanistic insights were elucidated by isolating the key intermediate, and the relevant energy profile was substantiated by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Tunability of Charge Transport in 2D Inorganic Molecular Crystals by Pressure Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant tunability of charge transport in two&#8208;dimensional inorganic molecular crystals, from an insulator to a semiconductor, is revealed for the first time through in situ high&#8208;pressure experimental characterizations.







Abstract
The unique intermolecular van der Waals force in emerging two&#8208;dimensional inorganic molecular crystals (2DIMCs) endows them with highly tunable structures and properties upon applying external stimuli. Using high pressure to modulate the intermolecular bonding, here we reveal the highly tunable charge transport behavior in 2DIMCs for the first time, from an insulator to a semiconductor. As pressure increases, 2D &#945;&#8208;Sb2O3 molecular crystal undergoes three isostructural transitions, and the intermolecular bonding enhances gradually, which results in a considerably decreased band gap by 25&#8201;% and a greatly enhanced charge transport. Impressively, the in situ resistivity measurement of the &#945;&#8208;Sb2O3 flake shows a sharp drop by 5 orders of magnitude in 0&#8211;3.2&#8197;GPa. This work sheds new light on the manipulation of charge transport in 2DIMCs and is of great significance for promoting the fundamental understanding and potential applications of 2DIMCs in advanced modern technologies.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Preussomerins: Control of Spiroacetal Stereogenicity by Photochemical Reaction of a Naphthoquinone through 1,6&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical reactions of naphthoquinones triggered by 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer have been developed. This reaction proceeds in stereospecific manner without loss of the stereochemical information of the substrate, enabling the enantioselective total synthesis of preussomerin EGs. The constructed spiroacetal center is the sole stereogenic center in the product, which had been previously impossible to set by exploiting conventional methods.







Abstract
We report the enantioselective total syntheses of preussomerins EG1, EG2, and EG3. The key transformation is a stereospecific photochemical reaction involving 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer to achieve retentive replacement of a C&#8722;H with a C&#8722;O bond, enabling otherwise&#8208;difficult control of the spiroacetal stereogenic center.

         <title>Halide Chemistry in Tin Perovskite Optoelectronics: Bottlenecks and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efforts to boost tin halide perovskite optoelectronics have focused heavily on the instability of SnII, while other inconspicuous chemical processes have remained unexplored. This Minireview highlights the key role of native halide chemistry in the stability, device performance, ecological impact and prospects for visible light emission in this class of materials. Halide management routes towards viable optoelectronics are also proposed.







Abstract
Tin halide perovskites (Sn HaPs) are the top lead&#8208;free choice for perovskite optoelectronics, but the oxidation of perovskite Sn2+ to Sn4+ remains a key challenge. However, the role of inconspicuous chemical processes remains underexplored. Specifically, the halide component in Sn HaPs (typically iodide) has been shown to play a key role in dictating device performance and stability due to its high reactivity. Here we describe the impact of native halide chemistry on Sn HaPs. Specifically, molecular halogen formation in Sn HaPs and its influence on degradation is reviewed, emphasising the benefits of iodide substitution for improving stability. Next, the ecological impact of halide products of Sn HaP degradation and its mitigation are considered. The development of visible Sn HaP emitters via halide tuning is also summarised. Lastly, halide defect management and interfacial engineering for Sn HaP devices are discussed. These insights will inspire efficient and robust Sn HaP optoelectronics.

         <title>A Configurationally Confined Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Two&#8208;Coordinate Cu(I) Complex for Efficient Blue Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from linear two&#8208;coordinate coinage metal complexes is sensitive to the geometric arrangement of the ligands. Herein we realize the tuning of configuration from coplanar to orthogonal gradually by variation of substituents. In a complex with confined twist configuration, its blue emission peaking at 458 nm presents a high &#934;PL of 0.74 and a short &#964;TADF of 1.9 &#956;s, which indicates a fast enough kr,TADF of 3.9&#215;105 s&#8208;1 and a depressed knr of 1.4&#215;105 s&#8208;1. Such outstanding luminescent properties are attributed to the proper overlap of HOMO and LUMO on Cu(I) d orbitals that guarantees not only small &#916;EST but also sufficient transition oscillator strength for fast  [[EQUATION]] . Vacuum&#8208;deposited blue OLEDs with either doped or host&#8208;free emissive layer present external quantum efficiencies over 20% and 10%, respectively, demonstrating the practicality of the configurationally confined strategy for efficient linear Cu(I) TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Ranking Peptide Binders by Affinity with AlphaFold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>AlphaFold has revolutionized structural biology by predicting highly accurate structures of proteins and their complexes with peptides and other proteins. However, for protein&#8211;peptide systems, we are also interested in identifying the highest affinity binder among a set of candidate peptides.&#160; We present a novel competitive binding assay using AlphaFold to predict structures of the receptor in the presence of two peptides. For systems in which the individual structures of the peptides are well predicted, the assay captures the higher affinity binder in the bound state, and the other peptide in the unbound form with statistical significance. We test the application on six protein receptors for which we have experimental binding affinities to several peptides. We find that the assay is best suited for identifying medium to strong peptide binders that adopt stable secondary structures upon binding.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical activation of CuInS2/MoS x  for photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2 production was revealed for the first time through in operando Raman spectroscopy. During the activation process, the initial metallic MoS x  phase was transformed to semiconducting MoS x , which facilitates charge carrier transfer between CuInS2 and MoS x . Ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy suggest the existence of MoO3 after the activation process. However, apart from contradicting these results, in operando Raman spectroscopy revealed some of the intermediate steps of the activation process.</dc:description>

Ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy suggest the existence of MoO3 after the activation process. However, apart from contradicting these results, in operando Raman spectroscopy revealed some of the intermediate steps of the activation process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Applications of Trifluoromethanesulfonic Anhydride in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride has been widely used in synthetic organic chemistry, not only for the conversion of various oxygen&#8208;containing compounds to the triflates, but also for the electrophilic activation and further conversion of amides, sulfoxides, andphosphorus oxides. In recent years, the utilization of Tf2O as an activator for nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, nitriles and nitro groups has become a promising tool for the development of new valuable methods with considerable success. In addition, Tf2O has been used as an efficient radical trifluoromethylation and trifluoromethylthiolation reagent due to the contained SO2CF3 fragment, and significant progress has been made in this area. This minireview summarizes the recent progress in the applications of Tf2O in the above two aspects, and aims to illustrate the role and potential application of this reagent in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Na2Ba[Na2Sn2S7]: Structural Tolerance  Factor&#8208;guided NLO Performance Improvement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The strong mutual coupling of and even the opposite change in the key parameters, such as the band gap (Eg) and second&#8208;order harmonic generation (SHG), leads to the extreme scarcity in high&#8208;performance IR nonlinear optical (NLO) chalcogenides. Herein, we report 8 new sulfides, Na2Ba[(AgxNa1&#8208;x)2Sn2S7] (1, x = 0; 1 series, x = 0.1&#8211;0.6; Na2Ba[(Li0.58Na0.42)2Sn2S7], 1&#8208;0.6Li); Na2Sr[Cu2Sn2S7] (2); and Na2Ba[Cu2Sn2S7] (3). We use the structural tolerance factor ( [[EQUATION]] ) to connect the chemical composition, crystal structure, and NLO properties. Guided by these correlations, a better balance between Eg and SHG is realized in 1, which exhibits a large Eg of 3.42 eV and excellent NLO properties (SHG: 1.5 &#215; AGS; laser&#8208;induced damage threshold: 12 &#215; AGS), representing the best performance among the known Hg&#8208; or As&#8208;free sulfides to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic Properties of a Biologically Relevant [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)2] Diamond Core Motif with a Short Iron&#8208;Iron distance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diiron cofactors in enzymes perform diverse challenging transformations. The structures of high valent intermediates (Q in methane monooxygenase and X in ribonucleotide reductase) are debated since Fe&#8208;Fe distances of 2.5&#8208;3.4 &#197; were attributed to &#8220;open&#8221; or &#8220;closed&#8221; cores with bridging or terminal oxo groups. We report the crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization of a FeIII2(&#181;&#8208;O)2 complex (2) with tetrahedral (4C) centres and short Fe&#8208;Fe distance (2.52 &#197;), persisting in organic solutions. 2 shows a large Fe K&#8208;pre&#8208;edge intensity, which is caused by the pronounced asymmetry at the TD Fe(III) centres due to the short Fe&#8208;&#181;&#8208;O bonds. A ~2.5 &#197; Fe&#8208;Fe distance is unlikely for six&#8208;coordinate sites in Q or X, but for a Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)2 core containing four&#8208;coordinate (or by possible extension five&#8208;coordinate) iron centres there may be enough flexibility to accommodate a particularly short Fe&#8208;Fe separation with intense pre&#8208;edge transition. This finding may broaden the scope of models considered for the structure of high&#8208;valent diiron intermediates formed upon O2 activation in biology.</dc:description>

         <title>The highly controlled and efficient polymerization of ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The highly controlled and efficient polymerization of ethylene is a very attractive but challenging target. Herein we report on a Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization catalyst, which combines a high degree of control and very high activity in ethylene oligo&#8208; or polymerization with extremely high chain transfer agent (triethylaluminum) to catalyst ratios (catalyst economy). Our Zr catalyst is long living and temperature stable. The chain length of the polyethylene products increases over time under constant ethylene feed or until a certain volume of ethylene is completely consumed to reach the expected molecular weight. Very high activities are observed if the catalyst elongates 60.000 or more alkyl chains and the polydispersity of the strictly linear polyethylene materials obtained are very low. The key for the combination of high control and efficiency seems to be a catalyst stabilized by only one strongly bound monoanionic N&#8208;ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanded Conformations of Monomeric Tau Initiate Its Amyloidogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding early amyloidogenesis is key to rationally develop therapeutic strategies. Tau protein forms well&#8208;characterized pathological deposits but its aggregation mechanism is still poorly understood. Using single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy based on &#160;a mechanical protection strategy, we studied the conformational landscape of the monomeric tau repeat domain (tau&#8208;RD244&#8208;368). We found two sets of conformational states, whose frequency is influenced by mutations and the chemical context. While pathological mutations &#8710;280K and P301L and a pro&#8208;amyloidogenic milieu favored expanded conformations and destabilized local structures, an anti&#8208;amyloidogenic environment promoted a compact ensemble, including a conformer whose topology might mask two amyloidogenic segments. Our results reveal that to initiate aggregation, monomeric tau&#8208;RD244&#8208;368 decreases its polymorphism adopting expanded conformations. This could account for the distinct structures found in vitro and across tauopathies.</dc:description>

         <title>Unimer Exchange is not Necessary for Morphological Transitions in Polymerization Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) has established itself as a powerful and straightforward method to produce polymeric nano&#8208;objects of various morphologies in (aqueous) solution. Generally, spheres are formed in the early stages of polymerization that may evolve to higher order morphologies (worms or vesicles), as the solvophobic block grows during polymerization.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) has established itself as a powerful and straightforward method to produce polymeric nano-objects of various morphologies in (aqueous) solution. Generally, spheres are formed in the early stages of polymerization that may evolve to higher order morphologies (worms or vesicles), as the solvophobic block grows during polymerization. Hitherto, the mechanisms involved in these morphological transitions during PISA are still not well understood. Combining a systematic study of a representative PISA system with rheological measurements, we demonstrate that - unexpectedly - unimer exchange is not necessary to form higher order morphologies during radical RAFT-mediated PISA.&#160; Instead, in the investigated aqueous PISA, the monomer present in the polymerization medium is responsible for the morphological transitions, even though it slows down unimer exchange.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impact of Mineralizing Agents on Aluminum Distribution and Acidity of ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intensive research on improving the catalytic properties of zeolites is focused on modulating their acidity and the distribution of associated Al sites. Herein, by studying a series of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites over a broad range of Al content, we demonstrate how the nature of the mineralizing agent (F&#8208; or OH&#8208;) used in hydrothermal syntheses directly impacts Al sites distribution. The proportions of Al sites, probed by 27Al NMR, depend on the Si/Al ratio for F&#8208;, but remain identical for OH&#8208; (from Si/Al=30 to 760). This leads to contrasting variations in weak and strong acidities. Such opposite effect of mineralizers is explained by the spatial location of negative charges and the resulting balance between short&#8208; and long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions. This understanding paves the way for additional and simple opportunities to control zeolites&#8217; acidity.</dc:description>

         <title>An Anomalous&#160;Electron Configuration Among 3d Transition Metal Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Physical properties of materials are mainly determined by valence electron configurations, where different valence shells would induce divergent phenomena. In compounds containing Sc2+, 3d electron occupancy is expected, the same as other transition metal atoms like Ti3+. But this situation still awaits experimental verification. Here, we selected ScS to measure the valence electron density and orbital population of Sc2+ through delicate quantitative convergent&#8208;beam electron diffraction. With the absence of 3d orbital features around Sc&#8208;atom sites and the nearly bare population of t2g orbital, the unintuitive occupation of 4s orbital in Sc2+ is concluded. It should be the first time to report such a special electron configuration in a transition metal compound, in which 4s rather than 3d orbital is preferred. Our findings reveal the distinct behavior of Sc and probable ways to modulate material properties by controlling electron orbitals.</dc:description>

         <title>The First Synthesis of Subporphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Because of the rich coordination chemistry and unique optical and electrochemical properties, porphyrin analogues have been intensively investigated. Among them, subporphyrin has been a long&#8208;awaited molecule, but only the boron complex is known to date because the central boron atom plays a crucial role as a template in the synthesis. The challenge related to the synthesis of a genuine subporphyrin (boron&#8208;free) has finally been met and reported in a recent article from Kim, Osuka, and Song. A key strategy of their synthesis lies in the introduction of an exocyclic double bond at the meso&#8208;position and subsequent reduction to form macrocyclic conjugation. Considering the fact that the flourishing of porphyrin chemistry is ultimately linked to the availability of free base porphyrins, this seminal work will facilitate studies on coordination chemistry and applications in materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Translation of Different mRNAs in Cells via Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Photouncaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coumarin&#8208;based photo&#8208;cleavable 5&#8242; cap analog (CouCap) was synthesized and incorporated into mRNA. In combination with a nitropiperonyl&#8208;protected 5&#8242; cap analog, translation of multiple mRNAs can now be activated by light of different wavelengths. No mRNA sequence nor chemical modifications remain after photo&#8208;cleavage.







Abstract
The 5&#8242; cap is a hallmark of eukaryotic mRNA involved in the initiation of translation. Its modification with a single photo&#8208;cleavable group can bring translation of mRNA under the control of light. However, UV irradiation causes cell stress and downregulation of translation. Furthermore, complex processes often involve timed expression of more than one gene. The approach would thus greatly benefit from the ability to photo&#8208;cleave by blue light and to control more than one mRNA at a time. We report the synthesis of a 5&#8242; cap modified with a 7&#8208;(diethylamino)coumarin (CouCap) and adapted conditions for in vitro transcription. Translation of the resulting CouCap&#8208;mRNA is muted in vitro and in mammalian cells, and can be initiated by irradiation with 450&#8197;nm. The native cap is restored and no non&#8208;natural residues nor sequence alterations remain in the mRNA. Multiplexing for two different mRNAs was achieved by combining cap analogs with coumarin&#8208; and ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;based photo&#8208;cleavable groups.

         <title>(BO)2&#8208;Doped Tetrathia[7]helicene: A Configurationally Stable Blue Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BO&#8208;doped thiahelicene has been synthesized by a four&#8208;step procedure and its optoelectronic and chiroptical properties investigated. The incorporation of two B&#8722;O bonds into the tetrathia[7]helicene framework has resulted in a configurationally stable (&#916;Genant&#8800;=27.4&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) blue emitter (&#934;PL=6&#8201;%).&#8220;







Abstract
Helicenes combine two central themes in chemistry: extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and chirality. Hetero&#8208;atom doping preserves both characteristics and allows modulation of the electronic structure of a helicene. Herein, we report the (BO)2&#8208;doped tetrathia[7]helicene 1, which was prepared from 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene in four steps. 1 is formally derived by substituting two (Mes)B&#8722;O moieties in place of (H)C=C(H) fragments in two benzene rings of the parent tetrathia[7]helicene. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a dihedral angle of 50.26(9)&#176; between the two terminal thiophene rings. The (P)&#8208;/(M)&#8208;1 enantiomers were separated by chiral HPLC and are configurationally stable at room temperature. The experimentally determined enantiomerization barrier of 27.4&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 is lower than that of tetrathia[7]helicene (39.4&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The circular dichroism spectra of (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;1 show a perfect mirror&#8208;image relationship. 1 is a blue emitter (&#955;em=411&#8197;nm) with a photoluminescence quantum efficiency of &#934;PL=6&#8201;% (cf. tetrathia[7]helicene: &#955;em&#8776;405&#8197;nm, &#934;PL=5&#8201;%).

         <title>Helical Bilayer Nonbenzenoid Nanographene Bearing a [10]Helicene with Two Embedded Heptagons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helical bilayer nonbenzenoid nanographene has been synthesized with a novel [10]helicene backbone bearing two heptagons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed its highly twisted bilayer geometry with a small interlayer distance of 3.2&#8197;&#197;, in which the intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation between the two layers is determined. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of the P/M enantiomers of this helical nanographene have also been evaluated.







Abstract
The precision synthesis of helical bilayer nanographenes (NGs) with new topology is of substantial interest because of their exotic physicochemical properties. However, helical bilayer NGs bearing non&#8208;hexagonal rings remain synthetically challenging. Here we present the efficient synthesis of the first helical bilayer nonbenzenoid nanographene (HBNG1) from a tailor&#8208;made azulene&#8208;embedded precursor, which contains a novel [10]helicene backbone with two embedded heptagons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis reveals its highly twisted bilayer geometry with a record small interlayer distance of 3.2&#8197;&#197; among the reported helical bilayer NGs. Notably, the close interlayer distance between the two layers offers intramolecular through&#8208;space conjugation as revealed by in situ spectroelectrochemistry studies together with DFT simulations. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of the P/M enantiomers of HBNG1 are also evaluated by circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Reshaping the 2&#8208;Pyrone Synthase Active Site for Chemoselective Biosynthesis of Polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implementation of novel synthetic pathways into metabolic network is challenging. Empowered by protein engineering and synthetic biology, a whole&#8208;cell transformation process is reported to utilize engineered 2&#8208;pyrone synthase with novel reactivity in metabolic networks to convert carboxylic acids and intracellular malonyl&#8208;CoA directly into the pyrone products with high yields, catalytic efficiency and good selectivity.







Abstract
Engineering enzymes with novel reactivity and applying them in metabolic pathways to produce valuable products are quite challenging due to the intrinsic complexity of metabolic networks and the need for high in vivo catalytic efficiency. Triacetic acid lactone (TAL), naturally generated by 2&#8208;pyrone synthase (2PS), is a platform molecule that can be produced via microbial fermentation and further converted into value&#8208;added products. However, these conversions require extra synthetic steps under harsh conditions. We herein report a biocatalytic system for direct generation of TAL derivatives under mild conditions with controlled chemoselectivity by rationally engineering the 2PS active site and then rewiring the biocatalytic pathway in the metabolic network of E.&#8197;coli to produce high&#8208;value products, such as kavalactone precursors, with yields up to 17&#8197;mg/L culture. Computer modeling indicates sterics and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions play key roles in tuning the selectivity, efficiency and yield.

         <title>Synergistic Porosity and Charge Effects in a Supramolecular Porphyrin Cage Promote Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a supramolecular strategy to enhance photochemical reduction of CO2 to CO leveraging synergy between multiple second&#8208;sphere interactions. Post&#8208;synthetic click chemistry enables modular synthesis of porous porphyrin organic cages bearing 24 cationic groups. The coordinated use of both porosity and charge to augment CO2 reduction activity beyond additive effects results in fast and selective catalysis under low CO2 concentrations.







Abstract
We present a supramolecular approach to catalyzing photochemical CO2 reduction through second&#8208;sphere porosity and charge effects. An iron porphyrin box (PB) bearing 24 cationic groups, FePB&#8208;2(P), was made via post&#8208;synthetic modification of an alkyne&#8208;functionalized supramolecular synthon. FePB&#8208;2(P) promotes the photochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with 97&#8201;% selectivity for CO product, achieving turnover numbers (TON) exceeding 7000 and initial turnover frequencies (TOFmax) reaching 1400&#8197;min&#8722;1. The cooperativity between porosity and charge results in a 41&#8208;fold increase in activity relative to the parent Fe tetraphenylporphyrin (FeTPP) catalyst, which is far greater than analogs that augment catalysis through porosity (FePB&#8208;3(N), 4&#8208;fold increase) or charge (Fe p&#8208;tetramethylanilinium porphyrin (Fe&#8208;p&#8208;TMA), 6&#8208;fold increase) alone. This work establishes that synergistic pendants in the secondary coordination sphere can be leveraged as a design element to augment catalysis at primary active sites within confined spaces.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Transfer Hydroiodination of Terminal Alkynes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a shuttle approach for the Rh&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroiodination of terminal alkynes to vinyl iodides. For aliphatic alkynes, a ligand&#8208; and substrate&#8208;dependent stereodivergence is observable. The vinyl iodides are engaged in a variety of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bond&#8208;forming reactions. The method is used to shorten a synthetic sequence to a cis&#8208;fatty acid. Deuterium&#8208;labeling and stoichiometric experiments give insights into the mechanism.







Abstract
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroiodination of aromatic and aliphatic terminal alkynes is reported. Depending on the choice of ligand and substrate, either (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;configured alkenyl iodides are obtained in high to exclusive isomeric purity. The reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance, employing easily accessible or commercially available aliphatic iodides as HI surrogates through a shuttle process. The synthesized vinyl iodides were applied in several C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions with full retention of the stereoselectivity. The developed method could be used to significantly shorten the total synthesis of a marine cis&#8208;fatty acid. Additionally, initial deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments and stoichiometric reactions shed some light on the potential reaction mechanism.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonding Heteroditopic [2]Catenanes for Recognition of Alkali Metal/Halide Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of halogen bonding heteroditopic [2]catenanes exhibit positive cooperative ion&#8208;pair recognition behaviour, which has been exploited for the extraction of solid sodium or potassium halide salts into organic media. Changing the size of the component macrocycles dramatically influences the ion&#8208;binding affinity, stoichiometry, and ion&#8208;pair complexation mode of the [2]catenanes.







Abstract
The first examples of halogen bonding (XB) heteroditopic homo[2]catenanes were prepared by discrete Na+ template&#8208;directed assembly of oligo(ethylene glycol) units derived from XB donor&#8208;containing macrocycles and acyclic bis&#8208;azide precursors, followed by a CuI&#8208;mediated azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition macrocyclisation reaction.

     alt="Halogen-Bonding Heteroditopic [2]Catenanes for Recognition of Alkali Metal/Halide Ion Pairs"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of halogen bonding heteroditopic [2]catenanes exhibit positive cooperative ion-pair recognition behaviour, which has been exploited for the extraction of solid sodium or potassium halide salts into organic media. Changing the size of the component macrocycles dramatically influences the ion-binding affinity, stoichiometry, and ion-pair complexation mode of the [2]catenanes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first examples of halogen bonding (XB) heteroditopic homo[2]catenanes were prepared by discrete Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; template-directed assembly of oligo(ethylene glycol) units derived from XB donor-containing macrocycles and acyclic bis-azide precursors, followed by a Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated azide-alkyne cycloaddition macrocyclisation reaction. Extensive &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic studies show the [2]catenane hosts exhibit positive cooperative ion-pair recognition behaviour, wherein XB-mediated halide recognition is enhanced by alkali metal cation pre-complexation. Notably, subtle changes in the catenanes&#8217; oligo(ethylene glycol) chain length dramatically alters their ion-binding affinity, stoichiometry, complexation mode, and conformational dynamics. Solution-phase and single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies provide evidence for competing host-separated and direct-contact ion-pair binding modes. We further demonstrate the [2]catenanes are capable of extracting solid alkali-metal halide salts into organic media.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Eschenmoser's Salt as a Formylation Agent for the Synthesis of Indolizinecarbaldehydes and Their Use for Colorimetric Nitrite Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the unprecedented use of the Eschemoser's salt&#8212;a well&#8208;known and commercial reagent for (dimethylamino)methylation reactions&#8212;as a formylation agent of indolizines. The method is simple and mild, whereas the classical formylation methods failed. Moreover, some indolizinecarbaldehydes have been transformed into highly conjugated push&#8208;pull dyes and have proven to be selective and sensitive colorimetric anion sensors for nitrite detection.







Abstract
C&#8722;H bond formylation is the most immediate way to incorporate the versatile formyl group into (hetero)aromatics. However, the type of reagents and severe conditions involved in the classical formylation methods often curtail their application, especially in the presence of other functional groups. Herein, we present the Eschenmoser's salt, a commercially available (dimethylamino)methylating chemical, as a useful reagent for the C&#8722;H formylation of indolizines and other compounds. The method is straightforward and mild, furnishing indolizinecarbaldehydes in modest&#8208;to&#8208;good yields with exclusive and remote regioselectivity. Furthermore, these compounds can be easily transformed into push&#8208;pull dyes and are highly selective in the colorimetric detection of nitrite, a substance extensively employed as preservative in the food industry, the concentration of which is crucial to control to prevent harmful effects in living organisms. The assay is simple, allowing the naked&#8208;eye detection of nitrite in solution or on a cotton swab for a wide range of concentrations.

         <title>Benchmark Dynamics of Dipolar Molecular Rotors in Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al&#8208;MOF, constructed with a wheelshaped ligand containing geminal rotating fluorine atoms shows a fluid configuration landscape in crystals, even at 2&#8197;K. The multiple configurational interchanges that arise from a correlated cascade mechanism propagating through the structure, as shown by Molecular Dynamics, phonon calculations and NMR relaxation, occur even at temperatures that usually prohibit any dipole rotation.







Abstract
Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs), comprising a wheel&#8208;shaped ligand with geminal rotating fluorine atoms, produced benchmark mobility of correlated dipolar rotors at 2&#8197;K, with practically null activation energy (Ea=17&#8197;cal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). 1H T1 NMR revealed multiple relaxation phenomena due to the exchange among correlated dipole&#8208;rotor configurations. Synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction at 4&#8197;K, Density Functional Theory, Molecular Dynamics and phonon calculations showed the fluid landscape and pointed out a cascade mechanism converting dipole configurations into each other. Gas accessibility, shown by hyperpolarized&#8208;Xe NMR, allowed for chemical stimuli intervention: CO2 triggered dipole reorientation, reducing their collective dynamics and stimulating a dipole configuration change in the crystal. Dynamic materials under limited thermal noise and high responsiveness enable the fabrication of molecular machines with low energy dissipation and controllable dynamics.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Luminescent Chiral Nanographene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perylene&#8208;based chiral nanographene has been synthesized through helical &#960;&#8208;extension of highly emissive chromophores whilst maintaining the frontier molecular orbital distributions. This nanographene exhibits excellent luminescence properties, with a record high &#934;F of 93&#8201;% among chiral nanographenes and a remarkable CPL brightness of 32&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Chiral nanographenes with both high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) and large dissymmetry factors (glum) are essential to the development of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. However, most studies have been focused on the improvement of glum, whereas how to design highly emissive chiral nanographenes is still unclear. In this work, we propose a new design strategy to achieve chiral nanographenes with high &#934;F by helical &#960;&#8208;extension of strongly luminescent chromophores while maintaining the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) distribution pattern. Chiral nanographene with perylene as the core and two dibenzo[6]helicene fragments as the wings has been synthesized, which exhibits a record high &#934;F of 93&#8201;% among the reported chiral nanographenes and excellent CPL brightness (BCPL) of 32&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1.

         <title>Nanoporous Films with Oriented Arrays of Molecular Motors for Photoswitching the Guest Adsorption and Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regular array of oriented molecular motors is presented by incorporating overcrowded alkene molecules as linker in metal&#8211;organic framework thin films. By switching between the stable and metastable states, the adsorption and diffusion properties of the guest molecules are controlled.







Abstract
Molecular motors are fascinating nanomachines. However, constructing smart materials from such functional molecules presents a severe challenge in material science. Here, we present a bottom&#8208;up layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of oriented overcrowded&#8208;alkene molecular motors forming a crystalline metal&#8211;organic framework thin film. While all stator parts of the overcrowded&#8208;alkene motors are oriented perpendicular to the substrate, the rotors point into the pores, which are large enough allowing for the light&#8208;induced molecular rotation. Taking advantage of the thin film's transparency, the motor rotation and its activation energy are determined by UV/Vis spectroscopy. As shown by gravimetric uptake experiments, molecular motors in crystalline porous materials are used, for the first time, to control the adsorption and diffusion properties of guest molecules in the pores, here, by switching with light between the (meta&#8208;)stable states. The work demonstrates the potential of designed materials with molecular motors and indicates a path for the future development of smart materials.

         <title>Aqueous Photoelectrochemical CO2 Reduction to CO and Methanol over a Silicon Photocathode Functionalized with a Cobalt Phthalocyanine Molecular Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoelectrode assembly based on planar p&#8208;typle silicon and a cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalyst is developed for photoelectrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and methanol under solar irradiation and in aqueous media.







Abstract
We report a precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free molecular catalyst&#8208;based photocathode that is active for aqueous CO2 reduction to CO and methanol. The photoelectrode is composed of cobalt phthalocyanine molecules anchored on graphene oxide which is integrated via a (3&#8208;aminopropyl)triethoxysilane linker to p&#8208;type silicon protected by a thin film of titanium dioxide. The photocathode reduces CO2 to CO with high selectivity at potentials as mild as 0&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE).

     alt="Aqueous Photoelectrochemical CO2 Reduction to CO and Methanol over a Silicon Photocathode Functionalized with a Cobalt Phthalocyanine Molecular Catalyst"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photoelectrode assembly based on planar p-typle silicon and a cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalyst is developed for photoelectrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and methanol under solar irradiation and in aqueous media.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a precious-metal-free molecular catalyst-based photocathode that is active for aqueous CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to CO and methanol. The photoelectrode is composed of cobalt phthalocyanine molecules anchored on graphene oxide which is integrated via a (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane linker to p-type silicon protected by a thin film of titanium dioxide. The photocathode reduces CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO with high selectivity at potentials as mild as 0&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE). Methanol production is observed at an onset potential of &#8722;0.36&#8197;V vs RHE, and reaches a peak turnover frequency of 0.18&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. To date, this is the only molecular catalyst-based photoelectrode that is active for the six-electron reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to methanol. This work puts forth a strategy for interfacing molecular catalysts to p-type semiconductors and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for photoelectrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to CO and methanol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;Bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C(13)/C(13&#8242;) bis&#8208;desmethyl analogue of the natural product disorazole&#8197;Z has been prepared by cyclodimerization through double Stille cross&#8208;coupling as the key enabling step. C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;Bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z binds to tubulin in a very similar mode as the natural product and inhibits cancer cell proliferation in vitro with low nanomolar potency, thus retaining the potent growth inhibitory capacity of disorazole&#8197;Z.







Abstract
We describe the total synthesis of the macrodiolide C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z through double inter&#8208;/intramolecular Stille cross&#8208;coupling of a monomeric vinyl stannane/vinyl iodide precursor to form the macrocycle. The key step in the synthesis of this precursor was a stereoselective aldol reaction of a formal Evans acetate aldol product with crotonaldehyde. As demonstrated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the binding mode of C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z to tubulin is virtually identical with that of the natural product disorazole&#8197;Z. Likewise, C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z inhibits tubulin assembly with at least the same potency as disorazole&#8197;Z and it appears to be a more potent cell growth inhibitor.

         <title>Boraalkenes Made by a Hydroboration Route: Cycloaddition and B=C Bond Cleavage Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkene hydroboration by the in situ generated IMes(X)BH+ cations followed by deprotonation gave the neutral boraalkenes. They underwent [2+2] cycloaddition with a variety of heterocumulenes among them carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide. A two&#8208;step reaction sequence led to the formal CS2 insertion product with complete rupture of the B=C double bond. A boraalkene/CO2 cycloaddition product opened its core B&#8722;C bond upon treatment with HB(C6F5)2.







Abstract
Hydroboration of styrene or vinylcyclohexane with the IMes(C6F5)BH+ cation followed by deprotonation provided a convenient synthetic entry to the [B]=CHCH2R boraalkenes 9&#8201;a and 9&#8201;b. The in situ generated IMes(SCN)BH+ system reacted similarly with 1,1&#8208;diphenylethene followed by deprotonation to give the isothiocyanato substituted boraalkene 9&#8201;c. The boraalkenes underwent [2+2] cycloaddition reactions with a small series of heterocumulenes to give the respective four&#8208;membered heterocycles. The [B]=CHCH2R+CO2 cycloadducts 13&#8201;a and 13&#8201;b added the borane HB(C6F5)2 with cleavage of the central B&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond. CS2 underwent an unusual reaction with the boraalkenes, namely insertion into the B=C bond with formation of the borylated dithioketene acetal under complete rupture of the strong B=C double bond. The intermediate dithiobora&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactone type intermediate was isolated in the case of the isothiocyanato&#8208;boraalkene reaction and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Tough and Conductive Nacre&#8208;inspired MXene/Epoxy Layered Bulk Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural nacre provides an inspiration for fabricating tough and conductive MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites through strong interfacial interactions between MXene and epoxy resin. The resultant conductive nacre&#8208;like layered bulk nanocomposites show self&#8208;monitoring of the structural integrity and outstanding electromagnetic interference shielding.







Abstract
A long&#8208;standing quest in materials science has been the development of tough epoxy resin nanocomposites for use in numerous applications. Inspired by nacre, here we report tough and conductive MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites. The orientation of MXene lamellar scaffolds is enhanced by annealing treatment. The improved interfacial interactions between MXene lamellar scaffold and epoxy through surface chemical modification resulted in a synergistic effect. Tailoring the interlayer spacing of MXene nanosheets to a critical distance resulted in a fracture toughness about eight times higher than that of pure epoxy, surpassing other epoxy nanocomposites. Our nacre&#8208;inspired MXene/epoxy layered bulk nanocomposites also show high electrical conductivity that provides self&#8208;monitoring capability for structural integrity and exhibits an excellent electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency. Our proposed strategy provides an avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance epoxy nanocomposites.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on Covalent Triazine Frameworks: at the Crossroad between Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review highlights single&#8208;atom catalysis on covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), thus focusing on the available insights on factors influencing nuclearity and coordination environment of metal species on CTFs and the effect on catalytic performance.







Abstract
Heterogeneous single&#8208;site and single&#8208;atom catalysts potentially enable combining the high catalytic activity and selectivity of molecular catalysts with the easy continuous operation and recycling of solid catalysts. In recent years, covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) found increasing attention as support materials for particulate and isolated metal species. Bearing a high fraction of nitrogen sites, they allow coordinating molecular metal species and stabilizing particulate metal species, respectively. Dependent on synthesis method and pretreatment of CTFs, materials resembling well&#8208;defined highly crosslinked polymers or materials comparable to structurally ill&#8208;defined nitrogen&#8208;containing carbons result. Accordingly, CTFs serve as model systems elucidating the interaction of single&#8208;site, single&#8208;atom and particulate metal species with such supports. Factors influencing the transition between molecular and particulate systems are discussed to allow deriving tailored catalyst systems.

         <title>Giant Water Uptake Enabled Ultrahigh Proton Conductivity of Graphdiyne Oxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) featuring a sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;co&#8208;hybridized carbon matrix is found to show ultrahigh proton conductivity. The unique carbon hybridization enables the significant water uptake of GDYO. The giant water uptake of GDYO is beneficial for the formation of multiple proton conduction pathways and the dissociation of a huge numbers of protons, thus leading to ultrahigh proton conductivity.







Abstract
Proton conductors have attracted great attention in various fields, especially in energy production. Here, we find that graphdiyne oxide (GDYO), derived from graphdiyne (GDY), features the highest proton conductivity of 0.54&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (100&#8201;% RH, 348&#8197;K) among the oxidized carbon allotropes reported so far. The sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;co&#8208;hybridized carbon skeleton of GDY enables GDYO with the giant water uptake, which is 2.4 times larger than that of graphene oxide (GO), resulting in ultrahigh proton conductivity by increasing the proton concentration and proton conduction pathways. This ultrahigh proton conductivity of GDYO is further proved in a methanol fuel cell by using GDYO membrane as proton exchange membrane. The GDYO membrane enables the cell with higher open circuit voltage, larger power density and lower methanol permeability, compared with commercial Nafion 117. Moreover, the GDYO membrane bears high ion exchange capacity, good acidic stability and low swelling ratio.

&lt;p&gt;Graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) featuring a sp- and sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-co-hybridized carbon matrix is found to show ultrahigh proton conductivity. The unique carbon hybridization enables the significant water uptake of GDYO. The giant water uptake of GDYO is beneficial for the formation of multiple proton conduction pathways and the dissociation of a huge numbers of protons, thus leading to ultrahigh proton conductivity.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Porous Materials for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water pollution is a growing threat to humanity due to the pervasiveness of contaminants in water bodies. Significant efforts have been made to separate these hazardous components to purify polluted water through various methods. However, conventional remediation methods suffer from limitations such as low uptake capacity or selectivity and can&#8217;t meet current water quality standards. Recently, advanced porous materials (APMs) have shown promise of improved segregation of contaminants over traditional porous materials in uptake capacity and selectivity. These materials feature merits of high surface area and versatile functionality, rendering them ideal platforms for the design of novel adsorbents. This review summarizes the development and employment of APMs in a variety of water treatments accompanied by assessments of task&#8208;specific adsorption performance. Finally, our perspectives on future opportunities for APMs in water purification have been discussed, as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Computer&#8208;Driven Development of Ylide Functionalized Phosphines for Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hiyama Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed couplings of silicon enolates with aryl electrophiles are of great synthetic utility, but often limited to expensive bromide substrates. A comparative experimental study confirmed that none of the established ligand systems allows to couple inexpensive aryl chlorides with &#945;&#8208;trimethylsilyl alkylnitriles. In contrast, ylide functionalized phosphines (YPhos) led to encouraging results. A statistical model was developed that correlates the reaction yields with ligand features. It was employed to predict catalyst structures with superior performance. With this cheminformatics approach, YPhos ligands were tailored specifically to the demands of Hiyama couplings. The newly synthesized ligands displayed record&#8208;setting activities, enabling the elusive coupling of aryl chlorides with &#945;&#8208;trimethylsilyl alkyl nitriles. The preparative utility of the catalyst system was demonstrated by the synthesis of pharmaceutically meaningful &#945;&#8208;aryl alkylnitriles, &#945;&#8208;arylcarbonyls and biaryls.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Generation of Hydrogen Radical (H&#8226;) with GSH for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a reactive hydrogen species, hydrogen radical (H&#8226;) scarcely sees applications in tumor biological therapy due to very limited resources of bio&#8208;friendly H&#8226; generator. In this work, we report that TAF can act as an organic photosensitizer as well as an efficient photocatalytic H&#8226; generator with reduced glutathione (GSH) as a fuel. The intracellular H&#8226;&#8208;participating photocatalysis leads to cell death by triple amplification of oxidative stress via a hybrid ferroptosis&#8208;apoptosis pathway under normoxia or apoptosis through biological reductions under hypoxia. TAF presents ultrahigh photocytotoxicity and excellent biosafety with photocytotoxicity index at an order of magnitude of 102&#8722;103 on both normoxic and hypoxic cells. The in vitro data suggest that H&#8226; therapy is promising to overcome the challenge of tumor hypoxia at low doses of both photocatalyst and light. And the capability of near infrared two&#8208;photon excitation would benefit broad biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;state Fluorescence from Carbon Dots Widely Tunable from Blue to Deep Red through Surface Ligand Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) find widespread attention due to their remarkable fluorescent and electronic properties. However, aggregation&#8208;caused quenching currently limits the application of CDs in colored displays. The construction of CDs with color&#8208;tunable solid&#8208;state fluorescence (SSF) is rarely reported, since the preparation of SSF CDs is technically challenging. Herein, through surface ligand modulation, SSF CDs with an emission&#8208;color span of almost 300 nm (from blue to deep red) were obtained. In&#8208;depth structure&#8208;property studies reveal that intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding inside SSF CDs provokes the emission properties in the aggregated state. Photodynamic characterizations demonstrate emission wavelengths can be switched smoothly by deliberately altering conjugation ability between substituent ligands and CDs core. Three&#8208;dimensional printing patterning is used to create a range of emissive objects, demonstrating the commercial potential for use in optical lamps.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Color&#8208;tunable dual&#8208;mode organic afterglow excited by ultraviolet (UV)&#160;and white light was achieved from classical aggregation&#8208;caused quenching compounds for the first time. Specifically, two luminescent systems, which could produce significant organic afterglow composed of persistent thermally activated delayed fluorescence and ultralong organic phosphorescence at ambient conditions, were constructed by doping fluorescein sodium and calcein sodium into aluminum sulfate. Their lifetimes surpassed 600 ms, and the dopant concentrations were as low as 5[[EQUATION]]10&#8208;6wt%. Moreover, the persistent luminescence colors of the materials could be tuned from blue to green and then to yellow by simply varying the concentrations of guest compounds or the temperature in the range of 260~340 K. Inspired by these exciting results, the afterglow materials were used for UV&#8208; and white&#8208;light&#8208;manipulated anti&#8208;counterfeiting and preparation of elastomers with different colors of persistent luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Altering oxygen binding by redox&#8208;inactive metal substitution to control catalytic activity: oxygen reduction on manganese oxide nanoparticles as a model system</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Establishing generic catalyst design principles by identifying structural features of materials that influence their performance will advance the rational engineering of new catalytic materials. In this study, by investigating metal&#8208;substituted manganese oxide (spinel) nanoparticles, Mn3O4:M (M = Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu), we rationalize the dependence of the activity of Mn3O4:M for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the enthalpy of formation of the binary MO oxide, &#916;fH&#176;(MO), and the Lewis acidity of the M2+ substituent. Incorporation of elements M with low &#916;fH&#176;(MO) enhances the oxygen binding strength in Mn3O4:M, which affects its activity in ORR due to the established correlation between ORR activity and the binding energy of *O/*OH/*OOH species. Our work provides a perspective on the design of new compositions for oxygen electrocatalysis relying on the rational substitution/doping by redox&#8208;inactive elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Comprehensive H2O Molecules Regulation via Deep Eutectic Solvents&#160;for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The corrosion, parasitic reactions, and aggravated dendrite growth severely restrict development of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we report a novel strategy to break the hydrogen bond network between water molecules and construct the sulfolane&#8722;H2O deep eutectic solvents. This strategy cuts off the transfer of protons/hydroxides and inhibits the activity of H2O, as reflected in a much lower freezing point (&lt; &#8722;80 &#176;C), a significantly larger electrochemical stable window (&gt; 3 V), and suppressed evaporative water from electrolytes. Stable Zn plating/stripping for over 9600 h was obtained. Based on experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations, it has been proved that sulfolane can effectively regulate solvation shell and simultaneously build the multifunctional Zn&#8722;electrolyte interface. Moreover, the multi&#8208;layer homemade modular cell and 1.32 Ah pouch cell further confirm its prospect for practical application.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Approach to Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers via Catalytic Atroposelective Transfer Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diaryl ethers are widespread in biologically active compounds, ligands and catalysts. It is known that the diaryl ether skeleton may exhibit atropisomerism when both aryl rings are unsymmetrically substituted by steric hindered groups. Despite recent advances, only a very few catalytic asymmetric methods have been developed to construct such kind of axially chiral compounds. We described herein a dynamic kinetic resolution approach to axially chiral diaryl ethers via Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed atroposelective transfer hydrogenation (ATH) reaction of dicarbaldehydes with anilines. The desired diaryl ethers could be obtained in moderate to good chemical yields (up to 79%) and high enantioselectivities (up to 95% ee) under standard reaction conditions. Such structural motifs are interesting precursors for further transformations and may have potential applications in synthesis of chiral ligands or catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Activity of Enzyme Immobilized on Hydrophobic ZIF&#8208;8 Modified by Ni2+ Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient enzyme immobilization to promote their recyclability and activity is highly desirable. Zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) has been proved to be effective platforms for enzyme immobilization due to its easy preparation and biocompatibility. However, the intrinsic hydrophobic characteristic hinders its further development in this filed. Herein, a facile synthesis approach was developed to immobilize pepsin (PEP) on the ZIF&#8208;8 carrier by using Ni2+ ions as anchor (ZIF&#8208;8@PEP&#8208;Ni). By contrast, the direct coating of PEP on the surface of ZIF&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8@PEP) engendered significant conformational changes. Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was employed to study the catalytic activity of immobilized PEP. The ZIF&#8208;8@PEP&#8208;Ni composite attains remarkable OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of only 127 mV at 10 mA&#8226;cm&#8208;2, which is much lower than the 690 and 919 mV&#8226;cm&#8208;2 overpotential values of ZIF&#8208;8@PEP and PEP, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>The Asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig Amination Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past few decades, the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig reaction has emerged as a powerful tool for forging C&#8211;N bonds, and has been vital to the pharmaceuticals, materials, and catalysis fields. However, asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination for constructing point chirality, planar chirality, and axial chirality remain in their infancy owing to limited substrate scope and laggard ligand design. The recent surge in interest in the synthesis of C&#8211;N/N&#8211;N atropisomers, has witnessed a renaissance in asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination chemistry as the first practical protocol for the preparation of C&#8211;N atropisomers. This review highlights reported asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination protocols and provides a brief overview of their chemical practicality.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Strategy for Screening Custom&#8208;Designed Warhead&#8208;Armed Cyclic Peptide Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Demand for peptide&#8208;based pharmaceuticals has been steadily increasing, but only limited success has been achieved to date. To expedite peptide&#8208;based drug discovery, we developed a general scheme for cell&#8208;based screening of cyclic peptide inhibitors armed with a user&#8208;designed warhead. We combined unnatural amino acid incorporation and split intein&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization techniques and integrated a yeast&#8208;based colorimetric screening assay to generate a new scheme that we call the custom&#8208;designed warhead&#8208;armed cyclic peptide screening platform (CWCPS). This strategy successfully discovered a potent inhibitor, CY5&#8208;6Q, that targets human histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) with a KD value of 15 nM. This approach can be a versatile and general platform for discovering cyclic peptide inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Tension PAINT Imaging with a Molecular Beacon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;PAINT enabled super&#8208;resolution imaging through the transient binding of fluorescently&#8208;labelled single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) imagers to target ssDNA. However, its performance is constrained by imager background fluorescence, resulting in relatively long image acquisition and potential artifacts. We designed a molecular beacon (MB) as the PAINT imager. Unbound MB in solution reduces the background fluorescence due to its natively quenched state. They are fluorogenic upon binding to target DNA to create individual fluorescence events. We demonstrate that MB&#8208;PAINT provides localization precision similar to traditional linear imager DNA&#8208;PAINT. We also show that MB&#8208;PAINT is ideally suited for fast super&#8208;resolution imaging of molecular tension probes in living cells, eliminating the potential of artifacts from free&#8208;diffusing imagers in traditional DNA&#8208;PAINT at the cell&#8208;substrate interface.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Networks Locking on Inorganic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs), single&#8208;layer networks of covalently linked monomers, show perspectives as membranes and in electronics. However, 2D polymerization of monomers in orthogonal directions limited the formation of 2DPs on nanoparticles (NPs) with high surface curvatures. Here we propose a high&#8208;curvature 2D polymerization to form a single&#8208;layer 2DP network as a non&#8208;contacting ligand on the surface of NPs for their stabilization and functionalization. The high&#8208;curvature 2D polymerization of amphiphilic Gemini monomers was conducted in&#8208;situ on surfaces of NPs with various sizes, shapes, and materials, forming highly cross&#8208;linked 2DPs. Selective etching of core&#8208;shell NPs led to 2DPs as a non&#8208;contact ligand of yolk&#8208;shell structures with excellent shape retention and high NP&#8208;surface accessibility. In addition, by copolymerization, the 2DP ligands can covalently link to other functional molecules. This work promotes the development of 2DPs on NPs for their functional modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloroacetamide&#8208;Modified Nucleotide and RNA for Bioconjugations and Cross&#8208;Linking with RNA&#8208;Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive RNA probes are useful for studying and identifying RNA&#8208;binding proteins. To that end, we designed and synthesized chloroacetamide&#8208;linked 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;ATP which was a good substrate for T7 RNA polymerase in in vitro transcription assay to synthesize reactive RNA probes bearing one or several reactive modifications. Modified RNA probes reacted with thiol&#8208;containing molecules as well as with cysteine&#8208; or histidine&#8208;containing peptides to form stable covalent products. They also reacted selectively with RNA&#8208;binding proteins to form cross&#8208;linked conjugates in high conversions thanks to proximity effect. Our modified nucleotide and RNA probes are promising tools for applications in RNA (bio)conjugations or RNA proteomics.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical cell&#8208;free biosensors for antibody&#160;detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here the development of an electrochemical cell&#8208;free biosensor for antibody detection directly in complex sample matrices with high sensitivity and specificity that is particularly suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications. The approach is based on the use of programmable antigen&#8208;conjugated gene circuits that, upon recognition of a specific target antibody, trigger the cell&#8208;free transcription of an RNA sequence that can be consequently detected using a redox&#8208;modified probe strand immobilized to a disposable electrode. The platform couples the features of high sensitivity and specificity of cell&#8208;free systems and the strength of cost&#8208;effectiveness and possible miniaturization provided by the electrochemical detection. We demonstrate the sensitive, specific, selective, and multiplexed detection of three different antibodies, including the clinically&#8208;relevant Anti&#8208;HA antibody.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Kinetic Effects convolute Activity and Tafel Analysis for the Alkaline Oxygen Evolution Reaction on NiFeOOH Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A large variety of nickel&#8208;based catalysts has been investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. However, their reported activity, as well as Tafel slope values, vary greatly. To understand this variation, we studied electrodeposited Ni80Fe&#173;20OOH catalysts with different loadings at varying rotation rates, hydroxide concentrations; with or without sonication. We show that, at low current density (&lt; 5 mA/cm2), the Tafel slope value is ~30 mV/dec for Ni80Fe20OOH in 0.1M KOH. At higher polarization, the Tafel slope continuously increases and is dependent on rotation rate, loading, hydroxide concentration and sonication. These Tafel slope values are convoluted by non&#8208;kinetic effects, such as bubbles, potential&#8208;dependent changes in ohmic resistance and (internal) OH&#8208; gradients. As best practise, we suggest that Tafel slopes should be plotted vs. current or potential. In such a plot, it can be appreciated if there is a kinetic Tafel slope or if the observed Tafel slope is influenced by non&#8208;kinetic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Processes of Superbase Generation in Xanthone Carboxylic Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photobase generators are species that allow the photocatalysis of various reactions, such as thiol&#8208;Michael, thiol&#8208;isocyanate, and ring&#8208;opening polymerization reactions. However, existing compounds have complex syntheses and low quantum yields. To overcome these problems, photobase generators based on the photodecarboxylation reaction were developed. We synthesized and studied the photochemistry and photophysics of two xanthone photobase, their carboxylic acid precursors, and their photoproducts to understand the photobase generation mechanism. We determined accurate quantum yields of triplet states and photobase generation. We demonstrated the effect of the intermediate radical preceding the base release. We characterized the photophysics of the photobase by femtosecond spectroscopy and showed that the photodecarboxylation process occurred from the second excited triplet state with a rate constant of 2.2 &#215; 109 s&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Programming Photodegradability into Vinylic Polymers via Radical Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of photolabile moieties into polymer backbone holds promise to remotely&#8208;control polymer degradation. However, suitable synthetic avenues are limited, especially for radical polymerizations. Here we report a strategy to program photodegradability into vinylic polymers by exploiting the wavelength selectivity of photocycloadditions for radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (rROP). Irradiation of coumarin terminated allylic sulfides with UVA light initiated intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition producing cyclic macromonomers. Subsequent RAFT&#8208;mediated rROP with methyl acrylate yielded copolymers that inherited the photoreactivity of the cyclic parent monomer. Irradiation with UVB initiated efficient photocycloreversion of the coumarin dimers, causing polymer degradation within minutes under UVB light or days under sunlight exposure. Our synthetic strategy may pave the way to insert photolabile linkages into vinylic polymers, tuning degradation for specific wavelengths.</dc:description>

         <title>A Widely Distributed Biosynthetic Cassette Is Responsible for Diverse Plant Side Chain Cross&#8208;Linked Cyclopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopeptide alkaloids are an abundant class of plant cyclopeptides with over 200 analogs described and bioactivities ranging from analgesic to antiviral. While these natural products have been known for decades, their biosynthetic basis remains unclear. Using a transcriptome&#8208;mining approach, we link the cyclopeptide alkaloids from Ceanothus americanus to dedicated RiPP precursor peptides and identify new, widely distributed split BURP peptide cyclase containing gene clusters. Guided by our bioinformatic analysis, we identify and isolate new cyclopeptides from Coffea arabica, which we named arabipeptins. Reconstitution of the enzyme activity for the BURP found in the biosynthesis of arabipeptin A validates the activity of the newly discovered split BURP peptide cyclases. These results expand our understanding of the biosynthetic pathways responsible for diverse cyclic plant peptides and suggest that these side chain cross&#8208;link modifications are widely distributed in eudicots.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>High&#8208;capacity small organic materials are plagued by their high solubility. Here we proposed constructing hydrogen bond networks (HBN) via intermolecular hydrogen bonds to suppress the solubility of active material. The illustrated 2, 7&#8208; diamino&#8208;4, 5, 9, 10&#8208;tetraone (PTO&#8208;NH2) molecule with intermolecular hydrogen (H) bond between O in &#8208;C=O and H in &#8208;NH2, which make PTO&#8208;NH2 presents transverse two&#8208;dimensional extension and longitudinal &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking structure. In&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) has tracked the reversible evolution of H&#8208;bonds, further confirming the existence of HBN structure can stabilize the intermediate 2&#8208;electron reaction state. Therefore, PTO&#8208;NH2 with HBN structure has higher active site utilization (95%), better cycle stability and rate performance. This study uncovers the H&#8208;bond effect and evolution during the electrochemical process and provides a strategy for materials design.</dc:description>

         <title>Turn&#8208;on Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Indium Chlorides by 5s2 Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing chirality into the metal&#8208;halide hybrids has enabled many emerging properties including chiroptical activity, spin&#8208;dependent transport, and ferroelectricity. However, most of the chiral metal&#8208;halide hybrids to date are non&#8208;emissive, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show a new strategy to turn on the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chiral metal&#8208;halide hybrids. We demonstrate that alloying Sb3+ into chiral indium&#8208;chloride hybrids dramatically increases the photoluminescence quantum yield in two new series of chiral indium&#8208;antimony chlorides. These materials exhibit strong CPL signals with tunable energy and a high dissymmetry factor up to 1.5&#215;10&#8208;2. Mechanistic studies reveal that the emission originates from the self&#8208;trapped excitons centered in 5s2 Sb3+. Moreover, near&#8208;ultraviolet pumped white light is demonstrated with a polarization up to 6.0%. Our work demonstrates new strategies towards highly luminescent chiral metal&#8208;halide hybrids.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have received increasing attention as an emergent battery technology for grid&#8208;scale renewable energy storage. However, physicochemical properties of redox&#8208;active organic electrolytes remain fine refinement to maximize their performance in RFBs. Herein, we report a carboxylate functionalized viologen derivative, N, N&#8217;&#8208;dibutyrate&#8208;4,4'&#8208;bipyridinium,&#160;(CBu)2V, as a highly stable, high capacity anolyte material under near pH neutral conditions.&#160;(CBu)2V&#160;can achieve more than 2.1 M solubility and display a reversible, kinetically fast reduction at &#8208;0.43 V vs NHE at pH 9.&#160;DFT studies revealed that the high solubility of&#160;(CBu)2V&#160;is attributed to its high molecular polarity while its negative reduction potential is benefitted from electron&#8208;donating carboxylate groups. A 0.89 V (CBu)2V/(NH)4Fe(CN)6&#160;AORFB demonstrated exceptional energy storage performance, specifically, 100% capacity retention with a utilized energy density of 9.5 Wh/L for 1000 cycles, power densities of up to 85 mW/cm2, and an energy efficiency of 70% at 60 mA/cm2.&#160;(CBu)2V&#160;not only represents the most capacity dense viologen with pendant ionic groups and also exhibits the longest (1200 hours or 50 days), most stable flow battery performance to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Conversion of Microplastics to Methane with Ultrahigh Selectivity by a Biotic&#8211;Abiotic Hybrid Photocatalytic System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methanogen&#8208;semiconductor biohybrids drive sustainable conversion of microplastics to CH4 under illumination. This addresses a long&#8208;standing challenge of photocatalysis by fully utilizing photogenerated electrons and holes without the need of using expensive and unsustainable chemical sacrificial quenchers.







Abstract
Efficient conversion of microplastics into fuels provides a promising strategy to alleviate environmental pollution and the energy crisis. However, the conventional processes are challenged by low product selectivity and potential secondary pollution. Herein, a biotic&#8208;abiotic photocatalytic system is designed by assembling Methanosarcina barkeri (M.&#8197;b) and carbon dot&#8208;functionalized polymeric carbon nitrides (CDPCN), by which biodegradable microplastics&#8212;poly(lactic acid) after heat pretreatment can be converted into CH4 for five successive 24&#8208;day cycles with nearly 100&#8201;% CH4 selectivity by the assistance of additional CO2. Mechanistic analyses showed that both photooxidation and photoreduction methanogenesis worked simultaneously via the fully utilizing photogenerated holes and electrons without chemical sacrificial quenchers. Further research validated the real&#8208;world applicability of M.&#8197;b&#8208;CDPCN for non&#8208;biodegradable microplastic&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion, offering a new avenue for engineering the plastic reuse.

         <title>Diboron(4)&#8208;Catalyzed Remote [3+2] Cycloaddition of Cyclopropanes via Dearomative/Rearomative Radical Transmission through Pyridine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previously challenging pyridinyl cyclopentanes, cyclopentenes and bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes with multiple substituents now can be efficiently prepared via a remote [3+2] cycloaddition reaction. The reaction features a simple diboron(4) catalyst, modular disconnection mode, broad scope, high atom economy and a unique dearomative/rearomative mechanistic process.







Abstract
Ring structures such as pyridine, cyclopentane or their combinations are important motifs in bioactive molecules. In contrast to previous cycloaddition reactions that necessitated a directly bonded initiating functional group, this work demonstrated a novel through&#8208;(hetero)arene radical transmission concept for selective activation of a remote bond. An efficient, metal&#8208;free and atom&#8208;economical [3+2] cycloaddition between 4&#8208;pyridinyl cyclopropanes and alkenes or alkynes has been developed for modular synthesis of pyridine&#8208;substituted cyclopentanes, cyclopentenes and bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes that are difficult to access using known methods. This complexity&#8208;building reaction was catalyzed by a very simple and inexpensive diboron(4) compound and took place via dearomative/rearomative processes. The substrate scope was broad and more than 100 new compounds were prepared in generally high yields. Mechanistic experiments and density function theory (DFT) investigation supported a radical relay catalytic cycle involving alkylidene dihydropyridine radical intermediates and boronyl radical transfer.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Triaryl &#945;&#8208;Pyranones with 1,2&#8208;Diaxes by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;step atroposelective construction of triaryl &#945;&#8208;pyranones with stereogenic 1,2&#8208;diaxes was accomplished by NHC organocatalysis. The structure of the substrates and the catalytic system play a critical role in the success of this protocol. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the origin of the high stereoselectivity.







Abstract
Atropisomers bearing multiple stereogenic axes are of increasing importance to the field of material science, pharmaceuticals, and catalysis. However, the atroposelective construction of multi&#8208;axis atropisomers remains rare and challenging, due to the intrinsical difficulties in the stereo&#8208;control of the multiple stereogenic axes. Herein, we demonstrate a single&#8208;step construction of a new class of 1,2&#8208;diaxially chiral triaryl &#945;&#8208;pyranones by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene organocatalytic asymmetric [3+3] annulation of well&#8208;designed alkynyl acylazolium precursors and enolizable sterically hindered 2&#8208;aryl ketones. The protocol features broad substrate scope (&gt;50 examples), excellent stereo&#8208;control (most cases &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, up to 99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er), and potentially useful synthetic applications. The success of this reaction relies on the rational design of structurally matched reaction partners and the careful selection of the asymmetric catalytic system.

     alt="Atroposelective Synthesis of Triaryl &#945;-Pyranones with 1,2-Diaxes by N-Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single-step atroposelective construction of triaryl &#945;-pyranones with stereogenic 1,2-diaxes was accomplished by NHC organocatalysis. The structure of the substrates and the catalytic system play a critical role in the success of this protocol. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the origin of the high stereoselectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atropisomers bearing multiple stereogenic axes are of increasing importance to the field of material science, pharmaceuticals, and catalysis. However, the atroposelective construction of multi-axis atropisomers remains rare and challenging, due to the intrinsical difficulties in the stereo-control of the multiple stereogenic axes. Herein, we demonstrate a single-step construction of a new class of 1,2-diaxially chiral triaryl &#945;-pyranones by an N-heterocyclic carbene organocatalytic asymmetric [3+3] annulation of well-designed alkynyl acylazolium precursors and enolizable sterically hindered 2-aryl ketones. The protocol features broad substrate scope (&amp;gt;50 examples), excellent stereo-control (most cases &amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr, up to 99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er), and potentially useful synthetic applications. The success of this reaction relies on the rational design of structurally matched reaction partners and the careful selection of the asymmetric catalytic system. DFT calculations have also been performed to discover and rationalize the origin of the high stereoselectivity of this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Biosensors Operating under Quasi&#8208;Equilibrium Conditions for Mitigating the Changes in Substrate Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a catalytic quasi&#8208;equilibrium biosensor concept in which an O2&#8208;insensitive enzyme is wired with a redox polymer to the electrode. This allows the enzymatic conversion to be switched off by applying a low potential, the redox polymer can be charged with a short positive potential pulse, and the glucose concentration can be determined potentiometrically with minimal disturbance of the concentration equilibrium. This concept is opening the door for mitigating any impact of the foreign&#8208;body reaction in implantable biosensors.







Abstract
Despite the success of continuous glucose measuring systems operating through the skin for about 14&#8197;days, long&#8208;term implantable biosensors are facing challenges caused by the foreign&#8208;body reaction. We present a conceptually new strategy using catalytic enzyme&#8208;based biosensors based on a measuring sequence leading to minimum disturbance of the substrate equilibrium concentration by controlling the sensor between &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; state combined with short potentiometric data acquisition. It is required that the enzyme activity can be completely switched off and no parasitic side reactions allow substrate turnover. This is achieved by using an O2&#8208;independent FAD&#8208;dependent glucose dehydrogenase embedded within a crosslinked redox polymer. A short measuring interval allows the glucose concentration equilibrium to be restored quickly which enables the biosensor to operate under quasi&#8208;equilibrium conditions.

         <title>Highly Efficient Green and Red Narrowband Emissive Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Employing Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters

Through careful selection of donor substituents about the DiKTa core, record&#8208;high efficiency green&#8208;emitting OLEDs were fabricated, with EQEmax of 30.8&#8201;%, and the reddest MR&#8208;TADF OLEDs have been reported based on ketone&#8208;containing multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters.







Abstract
Herein, we demonstrate how judicious selection of the donor decorating a central multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) core based on DiKTa can lead to very high&#8208;performance OLEDs. By decorating the DiKTa core with triphenylamine (TPA) and diphenylamine (DPA), 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa and 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa exhibit bright, narrowband green and red emission in doped films, respectively. The OLEDs based on these emitters showed record&#8208;high performance for this family of emitters with maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax) of 30.8&#8201;% for 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa at &#955;EL of 551&#8197;nm and 16.7&#8201;% for 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa at &#955;EL=613&#8197;nm. The efficiency roll&#8208;off in the OLEDs was improved significantly by using 4CzIPN as an assistant dopant in hyperfluorescence (HF) devices. The outstanding device performance has been attributed to preferential horizontal orientation of the transition dipole moments of 3TPA&#8208;DiKTa and 3DPA&#8208;DiKTa.

         <title>Catalytically Stable Potassium Single&#8208;Atom Solid Superbases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of solid superbase derived from potassium single atoms anchored on graphene is developed by a tandem redox strategy. The source of the basicity is the single K atoms, thus differing from conventional basicity which originates from oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The high dispersion and anchoring of superbasic sites endows the catalyst with excellent activity and stability in transesterification reactions.







Abstract
Solid superbases can catalyze diverse reactions under mild conditions, while they suffer from aggregation of basic sites and poor stability during recycling. Here we report a new generation of solid superbases derived from K single atoms (SAs) prepared by a tandem redox strategy. The initial redox reaction takes place between base precursor KNO3 and graphene support, producing K2O at 400&#8201;&#176;C. Further increasing the temperature to 800&#8201;&#176;C, the graphene reduces K2O to K anchored by its vacancies, leading to the generation of K SAs (denoted as K1/G). The source of basicity in the K1/G is K SAs, and neighboring single atoms (NSAs) possess superbasicity, which is different from conventional basicity originated from oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Due to the superbasicity as well as high dispersion and anchoring of basic sites, the K1/G shows excellent catalytic activity and stability in transesterification reaction, which is much superior to the reported catalysts.

         <title>Durable Lithium Metal Anodes Enabled by Interfacial Layers Based on Mechanically Interlocked Networks Capable of Energy Dissipation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically interlocked network (MIN) with robustness and unique energy dissipation capability was used as the interfacial layer which survived and suppressed repeated Li protrusion in long&#8208;term and high&#8208;capacity cycling to afford durable lithium metal anodes. This work highlights the importance of the energy dissipation feature in stabling Li metal anodes, promising MIN's future success in other battery&#8208;related fields suffering from repeated volume variations.







Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has received considerable attention due to its vital role in stabilizing Li anode. However, native and many artificial SEIs often suffer from cracking and fragmentation under dendrite impact or long&#8208;term repeated volume variation, causing capacity decay. Herein, a mechanically interlocked network (MIN) was innovatively designed as interfacial layer to protect Li anode by incorporating the unique energy dissipation capability, which helps Li anode survive repeated volume variation during long&#8208;term cycling. As a result, symmetric cell with MIN&#8208;coated Li anode (MIN@Li) exhibited prolonged cycling life of 1500&#8197;hours at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The full cell using LFP cathode (13.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) cycled stably for 500 cycles with capacity retention over 88&#8201;% (1&#8197;C). Our results highlight a creative application of MIN in Li anode, and its unique energy dissipation capability promises future success in other battery fields suffering from repeated volume variations.

         <title>Suprasomes Based on Host&#8211;Guest Molecular Recognition: An Excellent Alternative to Liposomes in Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suprasomes, considered the third generation of vesicular drug delivery systems, are constructed based on host&#8211;guest recognition. Cisplatin&#8208;loaded suprasomes are promising for photothermal therapy (PTT) and laser&#8208;triggered spatiotemporally controllable drug release. Compared to liposomal nanomedicines, CDDP@Suprasomes realize complete tumor ablation without metastasis as a result of the synergy between PTT and chemotherapy, showing great potential in cancer theranostics.







Abstract
Liposomes and polymersomes, typical vesicular drug delivery systems (DDSs), have faced some limitations in cancer theranostics. Suprasomes, supramolecular vesicles assembled from amphiphiles linked by noncovalent interactions, show potential as new generation of vesicular DDSs. We construct suprasomes based on host&#8211;guest recognition, by which the desired functions can be integrated into carriers without tedious synthesis. Photothermally active host&#8211;guest complex is formed between a functional guest and pillar[5]arene, which further self&#8208;assembles into hollow suprasomes. A supramolecular nanomedicine is developed by encapsulating cisplatin in the suprasomes. The obtained cisplatin@Suprasomes achieve excellent anticancer efficacy and anti&#8208;metastasis combining chemotherapy and photothermal therapy, which ablate the tumors without relapse and metastasis. This work demonstrates the facile functionalization of suprasomes, holding promise as alternatives to liposomes and polymersomes.

         <title>A Crosslinked Ionic Organic Framework for Efficient Iodine and Iodide Remediation in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic porous organic framework (HCOF&#8208;7) has been developed to remove iodine residues (I2 and I&#8722;) after water disinfection, demonstrating high breakthrough volumes and wide working temperatures.







Abstract
Iodine is widely used as an antimicrobial reagent for water disinfection in the wilderness and outer space, but residual iodine and iodide need to be removed for health reasons. Currently, it is challenging to remove low concentrations of iodine and iodide in water (&#8776;5&#8197;ppm). Furthermore, the remediation of iodine and iodide across a broad temperature range (up to 90&#8201;&#176;C) has not previously been investigated. In this work, we report a nitrate dimer&#8208;directed synthesis of a single&#8208;crystalline ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework (HCOF&#8208;7). HCOF&#8208;7 removes iodine and iodide species in water efficiently through halogen bonding and anion exchange, reducing the total iodine concentration to 0.22&#8197;ppm at room temperature. Packed HCOF&#8208;7 columns were employed for iodine/iodide breakthrough experiments between 23 and 90&#8201;&#176;C, and large breakthrough volumes were recorded (&#8805;18.3&#8197;L&#8201;g&#8722;1). The high iodine/iodide removal benchmarks recorded under practical conditions make HCOF&#8208;7 a promising adsorbent for water treatment.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase and Simultaneous Regulating Solvation Structures for Advanced Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional electrolyte additive, N&#8208;Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), is developed to improve the electrochemical performance of Zn anodes. NMP not only alters the solvation structure of Zn2+, but also in situ produces a dense nitrogen&#8208;rich layer on Zn. This layer protects Zn from corrosive electrolytes and benefits the uniform plating/stripping of Zn.







Abstract
Zn metal as one of promising anode materials for aqueous batteries suffers from notorious dendrite growth, serious Zn corrosion and hydrogen evolution. Here, a bifunctional electrolyte additive, N&#8208;methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), is developed to improve the electrochemical performance of Zn anode. NMP not only alters the solvation structure of Zn2+, but also in situ produces a dense N&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase layer on Zn foils. This layer protects Zn foils from corrosive electrolytes and benefits the uniform plating/stripping of Zn. Hence, the asymmetrical cells with NMP in the electrolyte retain a high coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% over 1000&#8197;cycles. The symmetric cells survive &#8776;200&#8197;h for 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a high Zn utilization of 85.6&#8201;%. The full cells of Zn||MnO2 show an impressive cumulative capacity even with lean electrolyte (E/C ratio=10&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mAh&#8722;1), limited Zn supply (N/P ratio=2.3) and high areal capacity (5.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>The Anionic Chemistry in Regulating the Reductive Stability of Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>

The participation of anions in the solvation sheath of lithium ions promotes the reductive stability of solvents. Simultaneously, anions themselves tend to get reduced more easily and induce the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, which is beneficial to stabilizing lithium metal anodes.







Abstract
Advanced electrolyte design is essential for building high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium (Li) batteries, and introducing anions into the Li+ solvation sheaths has been widely demonstrated as a promising strategy. However, a fundamental understanding of the critical role of anions in such electrolytes is very lacking. Herein, the anionic chemistry in regulating the electrolyte structure and stability is probed by combining computational and experimental approaches. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, the solvents and anions in Li+ solvation sheaths exhibit enhanced and decreased reductive stability compared with free counterparts, respectively, which agrees with both calculated and experimental results of reduction potentials. Accordingly, new strategies are proposed to build stable electrolytes based on the established anionic chemistry. This work unveils the mysterious anionic chemistry in regulating the structure&#8211;function relationship of electrolytes and contributes to a rational design of advanced electrolytes for practical Li metal batteries.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Free Radical RAFT Polymerization of Methacrylates in Homogeneous Solution: Design of exo&#8208;Olefin Chain&#8208;Transfer Agents (R&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z)</title>

This work develops exo&#8208;olefin compounds (R&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z) as chain&#8208;transfer agents for the sulfur&#8208;free RAFT polymerization of methacrylates in homogeneous solution. A series of R&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z with the MMA&#8208;dimer structure as R and substituted &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene unit as &#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z (Z: Ph&#8722;Y) were synthesized. More electron&#8208;donating substituents (Y) work better. Colorless sulfur&#8208;free multiblock copolymers were prepared via sequential monomer additions.







Abstract
In this work, the development of exo&#8208;olefin compounds (R&#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z) as chain&#8208;transfer agents for the sulfur&#8208;free reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) radical polymerization of methacrylates in homogeneous solution is described. A series of exo&#8208;olefin compounds with a methyl methacrylate (MMA) dimer structure as the R group and a substituted &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene unit as the &#8722;CH2C(=CH2)Z (Z: Ph&#8722;Y) group were synthesized and used for the radical polymerization of MMA in toluene and PhC(CF3)2OH. These compounds underwent transfer of the CH2C(=CH2)Z group via addition&#8208;fragmentation of the propagating methacryloyl radical. More electron&#8208;donating (Y) substituents, such as methoxy and dimethylamino groups, produced polymers with narrower molecular weight distributions. A continuous monomer addition method further improved molecular weight control and enabled the synthesis of colorless, sulfur&#8208;free, multiblock copolymers of methacrylates in homogeneous solutions.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Computational Design of &#969;&#8208;Transaminase by Reprograming of High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Barrier Steps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism&#8208;guided computational enzyme design was used to reprogram the transition states and ground states of key steps in the asymmetric reductive amination of indanones. The common features of three high&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier steps responsible for low catalytic efficiency were revealed by quantum mechanics and guided subsequent enzyme design. The best mutant exhibited a significant improvement in catalytic efficiency towards various prochiral indanones.







Abstract
&#969;&#8208;Transaminases (&#969;&#8208;TAs) show considerable potential for the synthesis of chiral amines. However, their low catalytic efficiency towards bulky substrates limits their application, and complicated catalytic mechanisms prevent precise enzyme design. Herein, we address this challenge using a mechanism&#8208;guided computational enzyme design strategy by reprograming the transition and ground states in key reaction steps. The common features among the three high&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier steps responsible for the low catalytic efficiency were revealed using quantum mechanics (QM). Five key residues were simultaneously tailored to stabilize the rate&#8208;limiting transition state with the aid of the Rosetta design. The 14 top&#8208;ranked variants showed 16.9&#8211;143&#8208;fold improved catalytic activity. The catalytic efficiency of the best variant, M9 (Q25F/M60W/W64F/I266A), was significantly increased, with a 1660&#8208;fold increase in kcat/Km and a 1.5&#8211;26.8&#8208;fold increase in turnover number (TON) towards various indanone derivatives.

         <title>[3,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic Rearrangements of Naphthyl 1&#8208;Propargyl Ethers: para&#8208;Propargylation and Catalytic Asymmetric Dearomatization</title>

The formal thermal para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H propargylation of C4&#8208;unsubstituted naphthyl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers through para&#8208;Claisen rearrangement was described, and chirality transfer was observed. Moreover, the enantioselective dearomatization of C4&#8208;substituted substrates was realized by using a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/CoII complex catalyst. The DFT calculations and experimental results support the ortho&#8208;Claisen rearrangement/Cope rearrangement sequence process.







Abstract
The para&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of aryl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers involves two&#8208;step [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangements and dearomatization process, which has high activation barriers and is of challenge. Here we discovered thermal para&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of naphthyl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers, and it enabled the formation of formal para&#8208;C&#8722;H propargylation products upon rearomatization. Chirality transfer occurred if optically active propargyl ethers were employed, leading to the construction of aryl/propargyl&#8208;containing stereogenic centers. Moreover, catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of naphthyl 1&#8208;propargyl ethers with different substitution at para&#8208;position gave access to benzocyclohexenones bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. The reaction was accelerated by a chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/Co(OTf)2 complex catalyst to achieve high yields (up to 98&#8201;%) and high enantioselectivities (up to 93&#8201;% ee). The DFT calculations and experimental results provided important clues to clarify the para&#8208;Claisen rearrangement process as well as the chiral induction and remote delivery.

         <title>Dithiol&#8208;Activated Bioorthogonal Chemistry for Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeted Synergistic Chemophototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal chemistry is introduced for design of organic nitrite donors, on the basis of SNAr and cyclization reactions between dithiols and 5&#8208;nitrobenzo[c][2,1,3]thiadiazole derivatives. A combination of &#8220;click to release&#8221; strategy and photoactivation is achievable for cancer chemophototherapy.







Abstract
The controlled intracellular release of nitrite is still an unmet challenge due to the lack of bio&#8208;friendly donors, and the antitumor effect of nitrite is limited by its physiologically inert activity. Herein, we designed benzothiadiazole&#8208;based organic nitrite donors that are stable against bio&#8208;relevant species but selectively respond to dithiol species through SNAr/intramolecular cyclization tandem reactions in the aqueous media. The bioorthogonal system was established to target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of liver cancer HepG2 cells. The nitrite and nonivamide were coupled to induce elevation of intracellular levels of calcium ions as well as reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, which resulted in ER stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. We demonstrated that a combination of photoactivation and &#8220;click to release&#8221; strategy could enhance antitumor effect in cellular level and show good potential for cancer precision therapy.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Fluorinated Solvation Shell and Low Salt Concentration Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;concentration electrolyte was employed in high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries. The synergistic effects of fluorinated solvation shell and low salt concentration generated robust and LiF&#8208;rich SEI and fewer unfavorable decomposition products. The excellent performance implies that the optimization of low concentration electrolytes is a successful solution for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale electrolyte designs.







Abstract
Concentration of electrolyte has significant effects on performances of rechargeable batteries. Previous studies mainly focused on concentrated electrolytes. So far, only several recipes on low&#8208;concentration electrolytes were studied, performing enhanced performance in advanced rechargeable batteries. Here, based on common electrolyte components, a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte composed of 0.2&#8197;M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) solvated in fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) is employed for high&#8208;voltage Li metal battery. The synergistic working mechanisms of introducing fluorine&#8208;containing solvent in the solvated structure and low salt concentration effect are revealed, resulting in LiF&#8208;rich, uniform, and robust solid electrolyte interphase layer and fewer unfavorable decomposition products. As a result, this low&#8208;concentration electrolyte significantly enhances electrochemical performances of Li||Li symmetric cells and high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2||Li batteries.

         <title>Near&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetoelectric Coupling via Spin Crossover in an Iron(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetoelectric coupling is achieved near room temperature in a spin crossover FeII molecule&#8208;based compound. The coupling is realized through the interplay of structural, magnetic, and electrical changes that allows the spin crossover to be driven by a remarkably low magnetic field of 3&#8197;T.







Abstract
Magnetoelectric coupling is achieved near room temperature in a spin crossover FeII molecule&#8208;based compound, [Fe(1bpp)2](BF4)2. Large atomic displacements resulting from Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions induce a change in the molecule dipole moment when switching between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin states leading to a step&#8208;wise change in the electric polarization and dielectric constant. For temperatures in the region of bistability, the changes in magnetic and electrical properties are induced with a remarkably low magnetic field of 3&#8197;T. This result represents a successful expansion of magnetoelectric spin crossovers towards ambient conditions. Moreover, the observed 0.3&#8211;0.4&#8197;mC&#8201;m&#8722;2 changes in the H&#8208;induced electric polarization suggest that the high strength of the coupling obtained via this route is accessible not just at cryogenic temperatures but also near room temperature, a feature that is especially appealing in the light of practical applications.

         <title>Fabricating Industry&#8208;Compatible Olefin&#8208;Linked COF Resins for Oxoanion Pollutant Scavenging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral and ionic vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were constructed with inexpensive 2,4,6&#8208;collidine as the building unit by a melt polymerization method. The as&#8208;prepared, low&#8208;cost cationic COF foams showed high crystallinity, abundant porosity, superior stability, and high adsorption capacity for oxoanion pollutants. This study opens a pathway to large&#8208;scale industrial production of ionic COFs.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to meet the demands of industrial application remains formidably challenge. Here we report using 2,4,6&#8208;collidine as monomer to produce a series of highly crystalline olefin&#8208;linked COFs by a melt polymerization method. This method enables the kilogram&#8208;scale fabrication of self&#8208;shaped monolithic robust foams. The afforded COFs possess extremely low cost (&lt;50&#8197;USD/kg), superior to all the reported COFs. Furthermore, using one&#8208;pot or post&#8208;modification methods can conveniently transform neutral COFs to ionic COFs, which can be applied as highly efficient ion&#8208;exchange sorbents for scavenging oxoanion pollutants. Remarkably, the superior adsorption capacity of a model oxoanion (ReO4&#8722;) is the highest among crystalline porous materials reported so far. This work not only expands the scopes of olefin&#8208;linked COFs but also enlightens the route for the industrial production of crystalline ion exchange sorbents.

         <title>Precisely Tailoring Heterometallic Polyoxotitanium Clusters for the Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterometallic cocrystal Ti4Fe1 cluster is prepared by incorporating Fe species into a polyoxotitanium cluster. The cocrystal Ti4Fe1 cluster enables both C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation by photogenerated holes and further reactions by singlet oxygen. As a result Ti4Fe1 has higher activity and selectivity in the photocatalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons than the Fe&#8208;doped Ti3Fe1 cluster.







Abstract
Photocatalysis is a promising yet challenging approach for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons to valuable oxygenated chemicals with O2 under mild conditions. In this work, we report an atomically precise material model to address this challenge. The key to our solution is the rational incorporation of Fe species into polyoxotitanium cluster to form a heterometallic Ti4Fe1 cocrystal. This newly designed cocrystal cluster, which well governs the energy and charge transfer as evidenced by spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations, enables the synergistic process involving C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation by photogenerated holes and further reactions by singlet oxygen (1O2). Remarkably, the cocrystal Ti4Fe1 cluster achieves efficient and selective oxidation of hydrocarbons (C5 to C16) into aldehydes and ketones with a conversion rate up to 12&#8201;860&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, 5 times higher than that of Fe&#8208;doped Ti3Fe1 cluster. This work provides insights into photocatalyst design at atomic level enabling synergistic catalysis.

         <title>2D Hexagonal Assemblies of Amphiphilic Double&#8208;Helical Poly(phenylacetylene) Homopolymers with Enhanced Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique assembly strategy has been developed to generate free&#8208;standing two&#8208;dimensional chiral nanomaterials based on amphiphilic poly(phenylacetylene) homopolymers, which bear hydrophobic and hydrophilic dendritic side chains and adopt a DNA&#8208;like double&#8208;helical conformation. The aggregates form modulable 2D hexagonal nanosheets directly in solution, with enhanced CPL and chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) chiral materials have been attracting immense attentions owing to their unique properties. Herein, we successfully developed a unique assembly strategy of amphiphilic homopolymers to construct stable free&#8208;standing 2D chiral nanosheets in solution. The amphiphilic poly(phenylacetylene) (PPA) homopolymers bearing the hydrophobic and hydrophilic dendritic side chains adopt a DNA&#8208;like double&#8208;helical conformation. The regular hexagonal nanosheets were formed in THF/EtOH through nucleation and epitaxial growth. The sizes of the nanosheets can be modulated from nanometers to submillimeters upon varying the ratio of binary solvents, while the thickness is linearly correlated with the molecular weights. The 2D architecture can significantly enhance the CPL of polymers with a high dissymmetry factor &#8776;0.1.

&lt;p&gt;A unique assembly strategy has been developed to generate free-standing two-dimensional chiral nanomaterials based on amphiphilic poly(phenylacetylene) homopolymers, which bear hydrophobic and hydrophilic dendritic side chains and adopt a DNA-like double-helical conformation. The aggregates form modulable 2D hexagonal nanosheets directly in solution, with enhanced CPL and chiral self-sorting behavior.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) chiral materials have been attracting immense attentions owing to their unique properties. Herein, we successfully developed a unique assembly strategy of amphiphilic homopolymers to construct stable free-standing 2D chiral nanosheets in solution. The amphiphilic poly(phenylacetylene) (PPA) homopolymers bearing the hydrophobic and hydrophilic dendritic side chains adopt a DNA-like double-helical conformation. The regular hexagonal nanosheets were formed in THF/EtOH through nucleation and epitaxial growth. The sizes of the nanosheets can be modulated from nanometers to submillimeters upon varying the ratio of binary solvents, while the thickness is linearly correlated with the molecular weights. The 2D architecture can significantly enhance the CPL of polymers with a high dissymmetry factor &#8776;0.1. Driven by a discrimination of helical conformation, the PPAs can self-sort into homochiral 2D nanosheets, as directly visualized by using fluorescent microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Method to Edit Histone H3 Modifications on Chromatin Via Sortase&#8208;Mediated Metathesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sortase&#8208;based method of histone H3 tail editing on chromatin is reported. Histone H3 tail peptides with cell&#8208;penetrating sequence can be metathesized to histone H3 for multivalent modifications on chromatin and influence epigenetics. This described sortase mediated metathesis strategy could be broadly applied to edit endogenous proteins in live cells.







Abstract
The post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) on the tail of histone H3 control chromatin structure and influence epigenetics and gene expression. The current chemical methods including unnatural amino acid incorporation and protein splicing enable preparations of the histone with diverse PTMs in cellular contexts, but they are not applicable to edit native chromatin. The manipulation of histone&#8208;modifying enzymes alter the endogenous histone PTMs but the lack of specificity of most histone&#8208;modifying enzymes prevents precise control of specific H3 tail PTM patterns. Here we report a new method to edit the N&#8208;tail of histone H3 via sortase mediated metathesis (SMM). The sortase can install desired PTM patterns into histone H3 on nucleosomes in vitro and in cellulo. This study expands the application scope of sortase from ligation to metathesis in live cells using cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs). In addition, it offers a strategy to edit PTMs of cellular histone H3 with potential for the development of precise epigenome editing.

         <title>An RNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Structure within the ADAR 5&#8242;UTR Interacts with DHX36 Helicase to Regulate Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4) structure was identified in the 5&#8242;UTR of the ADAR1 mRNA using multi&#8208;disciplinary assays in vitro and cells. The binding and resolving effect of rG4&#8208;specific helicase DHX36 on this rG4 was monitored using G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;triggered fluorogenic hybridization (GTFH) probe. Functionally, ADAR1 5&#8242;UTR rG4 inhibits reporter gene and native transcript translation with DHX36 modulating its formation in cells.







Abstract
RNA G&#8208;quadruplex (rG4) structures in the 5&#8242; untranslated region (5&#8242;UTR) play crucial roles in fundamental cellular processes. ADAR is an important enzyme that binds to double&#8208;strand RNA and accounts for the conversion of Adenosine to Inosine in RNA editing. However, so far there is no report on the formation and regulatory role of rG4 on ADAR expression. Here, we identify and characterize a thermostable rG4 structure within the 5&#8242;UTR of the ADAR1 mRNA and demonstrate its formation and inhibitory role on translation in reporter gene and native gene constructs. We reveal rG4&#8208;specific helicase DHX36 interacts with this rG4 in vitro and in cells under knockdown and knockout conditions by GTFH (G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;triggered fluorogenic hybridization) probes and modulates translation in an rG4&#8208;dependent manner. Our results further substantiate the rG4 structure&#8208;DHX36 protein interaction in cells and highlight rG4 to be a key player in controlling ADAR1 translation.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Triggered Synthetic Nanopore for Controlling Molecular Transport Across Biological Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic light&#8208;gated nanopore controls transport of molecules across bilayer membranes. The pore self&#8208;assembles from seven DNA strands including one lid strand carrying light&#8208;switchable azobenzene chromophores. The gated pore may be used for research, biosensing, and targeted drug release.







Abstract
Controlling biological molecular processes with light is of interest in biological research and biomedicine, as light allows precise and selective activation in a non&#8208;invasive and non&#8208;toxic manner. A molecular process benefitting from light control is the transport of cargo across biological membranes, which is conventionally achieved by membrane&#8208;puncturing barrel&#8208;shaped nanopores. Yet, there is also considerable gain in constructing more complex gated pores. Here, we pioneer a synthetic light&#8208;gated nanostructure which regulates transport across membranes via a controllable lid. The light&#8208;triggered nanopore is self&#8208;assembled from six pore&#8208;forming DNA strands and a lid strand carrying light&#8208;switchable azobenzene molecules. Exposure to light opens the pore to allow small&#8208;molecule transport across membranes. Our light&#8208;triggered pore advances biomimetic chemistry and DNA nanotechnology and may be used in biotechnology, biosensing, targeted drug release, or synthetic cells.

         <title>Revealing the High Salt Concentration Manipulated Evolution Mechanism on the Lithium Anode in Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical processes at the Li anode/electrolyte interface are disclosed in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with high salt concentration via in&#8208;situ atomic force microscopy and optical microscopy. The 3D morphology, local mechanics, and ion conductivity of the on&#8208;site formed solid electrolyte interphase are in&#8208;situ measured and analyzed to reveal the regulation effect of high salt concentration on interfacial electrochemistry.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are promising candidates of energy storage devices. Both adjusting salt/solvent ratio and applying quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes are regarded as effective strategies to improve the lithium (Li) anode performance. However, reaction mechanisms and interfacial properties in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur (QSSLS) batteries with high salt concentration are not clear. Here we utilize in&#8208;situ characterizations and molecular dynamics simulations to unravel aforesaid mysteries, and construct relationships of electrolyte structure, interfacial behaviour and performance. The generation mechanism, formation process, and mechanical/chemical/electrochemical properties of the anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are deeply explored. Li deposition uniformity and dissolution reversibility are further tuned by the sustainable SEI. These straightforward evidences and deepgoing studies would guide the electrolyte design and interfacial engineering of QSSLS batteries.

         <title>Biocatalytic Thionation of Epoxides for Enantioselective Synthesis of Thiiranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalytic thionation method is presented for the enantioselective synthesis of thiiranes from epoxides by a halohydrin dehalogenase catalyzed kinetic resolution approach using thiocyanate as a sulfur donor. Various chiral thiiranes bearing aryl and alkyl substituents were synthesized in good yields and enantioselectivities by using recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing the engineered halohydrin dehalogenase HHDHapb variants.







Abstract
Expanding the enzymatic toolbox for the green synthesis of valuable molecules is still of high interest in synthetic chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry. Chiral thiiranes are valuable sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, but relevant methods for their enantioselective synthesis are limited. Herein, we report a biocatalytic thionation strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of thiiranes, which was developed based on the halohydrin dehalogenase (HHDH)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective ring&#8208;opening reaction of epoxides with thiocyanate and a subsequent nonenzymatic rearrangement process. A novel HHDH was identified and engineered for enantioselective biocatalytic thionation of various aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted epoxides on a preparative scale, affording the corresponding thiiranes in up to 43&#8201;% isolated yield and 98&#8201;% ee. Large&#8208;scale synthesis and useful transformations of chiral thiiranes were also performed to demonstrate the utility and scalability of the biocatalytic thionation strategy.

         <title>Thiamyxins: Structure and Biosynthesis of Myxobacterial RNA&#8208;Virus Inhibitors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical structure and absolute stereochemistry of an unprecedented natural product family, the thiamyxins, is presented. These thiazole&#8208; and thiazoline&#8208;containing cyclic depsipeptides are produced by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase&#8208;polyketide synthase hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster, whose structure is described herein. The thiamyxins were found to exhibit promising antiviral activity against three different RNA viruses.







Abstract
During our search for novel myxobacterial natural products, we discovered the thiamyxins: thiazole&#8208; and thiazoline&#8208;rich non&#8208;ribosomal peptide&#8208;polyketide hybrids with potent antiviral activity. We isolated four congeners of this unprecedented natural product family with the non&#8208;cyclized thiamyxin&#8197;D fused to a glycerol unit at the C&#8208;terminus. Alongside their structure elucidation, we present a concise biosynthesis model based on biosynthetic gene cluster analysis and isotopically labelled precursor feeding. We report incorporation of a 2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylpent&#8208;3&#8208;enoic acid moiety by a GCN5&#8208;related N&#8208;acetyltransferase&#8208;like decarboxylase domain featuring polyketide synthase. The thiamyxins show potent inhibition of RNA viruses in cell culture models of corona, zika and dengue virus infection. Their potency up to a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 560&#8197;nM combined with milder cytotoxic effects on human cell lines indicate the potential for further development of the thiamyxins.

         <title>An Atom&#8208;Pair Design Strategy for Optimizing the Synergistic Electron Effects of Catalytic Sites in NO Selective Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactant adsorption and surface reactions are two key steps in heterogeneous catalysis but the simultaneous optimization of these two variables remains challenging. These two key steps were optimized concomitantly in a model reaction&#8212;NO selective reduction&#8212;by designing a series of atom&#8208;pair active sites with a strong electronic synergy.







Abstract
Effective adsorption and speedy surface reactions are vital requirements for efficient active sites in catalysis, but it remains challenging to maximize these two functions simultaneously. We present a solution to this issue by designing a series of atom&#8208;pair catalytic sites with tunable electronic interactions. As a case study, NO selective reduction occurring on V1&#8722;W1/TiO2 is chosen. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the synergistic electron effect present between the paired atoms enriches high&#8208;energy spin charge around the Fermi level, simultaneously rendering reactant (NH3 or O2) adsorption more effective and subsequent surface reactions speedier as compared with single V or W atom alone, and hence higher reaction rates. This strategy enables us to rationally design a high&#8208;performance V1&#8722;Mo1/TiO2 catalyst with optimized vanadium(IV)&#8208;molybdenum(V) electronic interactions, which has exceptional activity significantly higher than the commercial or reported catalysts.

         <title>Enhanced Acidic Water Oxidation by Dynamic Migration of Oxygen Species at the Ir/Nb2O5&#8722;x Catalyst/Support Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic migration of oxygen species between oxide support and Ir catalyst during OER is uncovered. These migrations not only regulate the in situ Ir catalytic structure towards boosted activity, but also suppress Ir over&#8208;oxidation via oxygen species transference, thereby ensuring overall high performance in PEM water electrolyzer.







Abstract
Catalyst/support interaction plays a vital role in catalysis towards acidic oxygen evolution (OER), and the performance reinforcement is currently interpreted by either strain or electron donation effect. We herein report that these views are insufficient, where the dynamic evolution of the interface under potential bias must be considered. Taking Nb2O5&#8722;x supported iridium (Ir/Nb2O5&#8722;x) as a model catalyst, we uncovered the dynamic migration of oxygen species between IrOx and Nb2O5&#8722;x during OER. Direct spectroscopic evidence combined with theoretical computation suggests these migrations not only regulate the in situ Ir structure towards boosted activity, but also suppress its over&#8208;oxidation via spontaneously delivering excessive oxygen from IrOx to Nb2O5&#8722;x. The optimized Ir/Nb2O5&#8722;x thus demonstrated exceptional performance in scalable water electrolyzers, i.e., only need 1.839&#8197;V to attain 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (surpassing the DOE 2025 target), and no activity decay during a 2000&#8197;h test at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Deaminative Arylation and Alkenyaltion of Aliphatic Tertiary Amines with Aryl and Alkenylboronic Acids via Nitrogen Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and general deaminative arylation and alkenylation of tertiary amines with aryl and alkenylboronic acids is enabled by difluorocarbene under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. This protocol represents a novel reaction mode which succeeded in the construction of Csp3&#8722;Csp2 bonds via an in situ formed nitrogen ylide from tertiary amines (propargyl amines, allyl amines and 1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl methane amines) and difluorocarbene with aryl and alkenylboronic acids.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling has significantly advanced C&#8722;C bond formation and has been well recognized in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, materials science and other fields. In this rapid development, cross coupling without transition metal catalyst is a big challenge in this field, and using widely existing tertiary amines as electrophiles to directly couple with boronic acids has great hurdles yet significant application prospects. Herein, we report an efficient and general deaminative arylation and alkenylation of tertiary amines (propargyl amines, allyl amines and 1H&#8208;indol&#8208;3&#8208;yl methane amines) with ary and alkenylboronic acids enabled by difluorocarbene under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. Preliminary mechanism experiments suggest that in situ formed difluoromethyl quaternary amine salt, nitrogen ylide and tetracoordinate boron species are the key intermediates, the subsequent 1,2&#8208;metallate shift and protodeboronation complete the new coupling reaction.

&lt;/sup&gt; bonds via an in situ formed nitrogen ylide from tertiary amines (propargyl amines, allyl amines and 1H-indol-3-yl methane amines) and difluorocarbene with aryl and alkenylboronic acids.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition-metal-catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling has significantly advanced C&#8722;C bond formation and has been well recognized in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, materials science and other fields. In this rapid development, cross coupling without transition metal catalyst is a big challenge in this field, and using widely existing tertiary amines as electrophiles to directly couple with boronic acids has great hurdles yet significant application prospects. Herein, we report an efficient and general deaminative arylation and alkenylation of tertiary amines (propargyl amines, allyl amines and 1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-indol-3-yl methane amines) with ary and alkenylboronic acids enabled by difluorocarbene under transition-metal-free conditions. Preliminary mechanism experiments suggest that in situ formed difluoromethyl quaternary amine salt, nitrogen ylide and tetracoordinate boron species are the key intermediates, the subsequent 1,2-metallate shift and protodeboronation complete the new coupling reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organizing Enzymes on Self&#8208;Assembled Protein Cages for Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled protein cages were functionalized to achieve spatial organization of sequential enzymes in living cells, which confer cascade reactions with optimal local concentrations and microenvironment, thereby entailing enhanced biocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Cells use self&#8208;assembled biomaterials such as lipid membranes or proteinaceous shells to coordinate thousands of reactions that simultaneously take place within crowded spaces. However, mimicking such spatial organization for synthetic applications in engineered systems remains a challenge, resulting in inferior catalytic efficiency. In this work, we show that protein cages as an ideal scaffold to organize enzymes to enhance cascade reactions both in vitro and in living cells. We demonstrate that not only enzyme&#8208;enzyme distance but also the improved Km value contribute to the enhanced reaction rate of cascade reactions. Three sequential enzymes for lycopene biosynthesis have been co&#8208;localized on the exterior of the engineered protein cages in Escherichia coli, leading to an 8.5&#8208;fold increase of lycopene production by streamlining metabolic flux towards its biosynthesis. This versatile system offers a powerful tool to achieve enzyme spatial organization for broad applications in biocatalysis.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Selective Charge Transport in Lead&#8208;Free Chiral Perovskites: The Key towards High&#8208;Anisotropy in Circularly&#8208;Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of zero&#8208;dimensional bismuth&#8208;based chiral perovskites has been introduced for the detection of circularly polarized light. The lower dimensional perovskites exhibit high degree of chirality&#8208;induced spin&#8208;selectivity allowing the transport of one type of spin&#8208;half state while blocking the other type resulting in an anisotropic current response of the photodetectors that can be used to detect the polarization state of CPL photons.







Abstract
A pair of zero&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;free chiral perovskites is introduced towards the detection of circularly polarized light (CPL). Although spin&#8208;polarized carriers are generated in the perovskites under the CPL, the absorption anisotropy remained low leading to mostly similar density of photogenerated carriers under the two CPLs. Interestingly, due to the intrinsic chirality in the perovskites, they exhibited chirality&#8208;induced spin&#8208;selectivity (CISS) allowing the transport of only one type of spin&#8208;half states. A high anisotropy in photocurrent along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction has therefore appeared resulting in a spin&#8208;dependent photovoltaic effect in vertical heterojunction devices and making them suitable for CPL detection. While a self&#8208;powered CPL detector showed a limited (but one of the highest to date) anisotropy factor of 0.3 due to possible spin&#8208;flips during the transport process, the factor rose to 0.6 under bias prompting extension of the effective spin&#8208;diffusion length.

         <title>Gold(I) Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters for Highly Efficient Ultrapure&#8208;Green Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple gold(I) coordination strategy affords highly efficient narrowband green and blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence with emission quantum yields of ca. 0.9 and considerably shortened lifetimes down to 5.5&#8197;&#956;s. The resultant AuI emitters deliver ultrapure&#8208;green OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies of up to 30.3&#8201;%, alongside diminished roll&#8208;offs as low as 0.8&#8201;% and device lifetimes (LT60) of 1210&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Acceleration of singlet&#8208;triplet intersystem crossings (ISC) is instrumental in bolstering triplet exciton harvesting of multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. This work describes a simple gold(I) coordination strategy to enhance the spin&#8208;orbit coupling of green and blue BN(O)&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF emitters, which results in a notable increase in rate constants of the spectroscopically observed ISC process to 3&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1 with nearly unitary ISC quantum yields. Accordingly, the resultant thermally&#8208;stable AuI emitters attained large values of delayed fluorescence radiative rate constant up to 1.3&#215;105/1.7&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1 in THF/PMMA film while preserving narrowband emissions (FWHM=30&#8211;37&#8197;nm) and high emission quantum yields (ca. 0.9). The vapor&#8208;deposited ultrapure&#8208;green OLEDs fabricated with these AuI emitters delivered high luminance of up to 2.53&#215;105&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 as well as external quantum efficiencies of up to 30.3&#8201;% with roll&#8208;offs as low as 0.8&#8201;% and long device lifetimes (LT60) of 1210&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Multiprocessing Quantum Computing through Hyperfine Couplings in Endohedral Fullerene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical derivatives of endohedral nitrogen fullerenes with long coherence time were used to demonstrate the multiprocessing of quantum computing with different subgroups of energy transitions divided by hyperfine couplings. Cooperatively combining the parallelly calculated results enabled quantum error correction of a D&#8208;J algorithm and multi&#8208;task qubit manipulations of different types of quantum gates.







Abstract
Magnetic molecules have shown great potential in quantum information processing due to the chemical tunablity of their quantum behaviors. Chemical derivatives of endohedral nitrogen fullerenes with long coherence time and rich energy levels were synthesized and studied to demonstrate the ability of multiprocessing in quantum information using electron magnetic resonance. After initialization of the 12&#8208;levelled spin system, subgroups of spin energy levels coursed by the hyperfine couplings can be selectively manipulated. The cooperatively combining of the parallel calculations enabled quantum error correction, increasing the correct rate by up to 17.82&#8201;%. Also, different subgroups of transitions divided by hyperfine coupling can be treated as independent qubits, and multi&#8208;task quantum computing were realized by performing Z&#8208;gate and X&#8208;gate simultaneously, which accelerates the overall gating speed.

         <title>An Electrocatalytic Model of the Sulfur Reduction Reaction in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalytic model is proposed to probe the sulfur reduction reaction pathway in working lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries by considering the adsorption free energy of LiS&#8901;, LiS2&#8901;, and LiS3&#8901; radicals as descriptors. With an overall consideration of &#916;G(LiS3&#8901;*), &#916;G(LiS2&#8901;*), and &#916;G(LiS&#8901;*) descriptors, a regional diagram model is constructed to visualize the overpotential and rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is strongly considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems due to its high theoretical energy density and low cost. However, the sluggish reduction kinetics from Li2S4 to Li2S during discharge hinders the practical application of Li&#8211;S batteries. Although various electrocatalysts have been proposed to improve the reaction kinetics, the electrocatalytic mechanism is unclear due to the complexity of sulfur reduction reactions (SRR). It is crucial to understand the electrocatalytic mechanism thoroughly for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Herein an electrocatalytic model is constructed to reveal the chemical mechanism of the SRR in Li&#8211;S batteries based on systematical density functional theory calculations, taking heteroatoms&#8208;doped carbon materials as an example. The adsorption energy of LiSy&#8901; (y=1, 2, or 3) radicals is used as a key descriptor to predict the reaction pathway, rate&#8208;determining step, and overpotential. A diagram for designing advanced electrocatalysts is accordingly constructed. This work establishes a theoretical model, which is an intelligent integration for probing the complicated SRR mechanisms and designing advanced electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>The Electronic Origin of the Zeta Potential is Supported by the Redox Mechanism on an Aqueous Dispersion of Exfoliated Graphite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous graphite dispersion was prepared without passivating agents and a minimal amount of functional groups by treating graphite with ammonium hydroxide. This approach has raised the Fermi level above the original value. The negative zeta potential has been revisited and attributed to the electrons accumulated on the material.







Abstract
Herein we have proposed that a redox mechanism can produce surface charges and negative zeta potential on an aqueous graphite dispersion. Graphite was kept in contact with a concentrated ammonia aqueous solution, washed, and exfoliated in water, resulting in a dispersion with lyophobic nature. Ammonia treatment did not provide functional groups or nitrogen doping to graphite. Moreover, this material was washed twice before sonication to remove most hydroxide. Therefore, neither functional groups, nitrogen atoms, nor hydroxide excess is responsible for the zeta potential. Kelvin probe force microscopy has shown that the ammonia&#8208;treated and exfoliated graphite has higher Fermi level than the water&#8208;treated material, indicating that the contact between ammonia and graphite promotes redox reactions that provide electrons to graphite. These electrons raise the Fermi level of graphite and generate the negative zeta potential, consequently, they account for the colloidal stability.

         <title>Identification of Cysteine 270 as a Novel Site for Allosteric Modulators of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Papain&#8208;Like Protease
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two allosteric and covalent activators of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) were identified to elucidate a novel site, cysteine 270 (C270), which led to the discovery of an endogenous activator and an inhibitor of the protease. This study provides a paradigm for identifying covalent and allosteric sites and offers an opportunity for the development of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 PLpro inhibitors.







Abstract
The coronavirus papain&#8208;like protease (PLpro) plays an important role in the proteolytic processing of viral polyproteins and the dysregulation of the host immune response, providing a promising therapeutic target. However, the development of inhibitors against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) PLpro is challenging owing to the restricted S1/S2 sites in the substrate binding pocket. Here we report the discovery of two activators of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 PLpro and the identification of the unique residue, cysteine 270 (C270), as an allosteric and covalent regulatory site for the activators. This site is also specifically modified by glutathione, resulting in protease activation. Furthermore, a compound was found to allosterically inhibit the protease activity by covalent binding to C270. Together, these results elucidate an unrevealed molecular mechanism for allosteric modulation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 PLpro and provid a novel site for allosteric inhibitors design.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Selective Activation of Toll&#8208;Like Receptor 7/8 Agonist Nano&#8208;Immunomodulator Generates Safe Anti&#8208;Tumor Immune Responses upon Systemic Administration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the uncontrolled off&#8208;target systemic immune&#8208;related adverse effects (irAEs) of imidazoquinolines after systemic administration, we developed a nano&#8208;immunomodulator (cN@SS&#8208;IMQ) that is inactive until it is selectively metabolized to an active immunostimulant within tumor cells. cN@SS&#8208;IMQ promoted robust immune activation within tumors while limiting extra&#8208;tumoral stimulation, suggesting its promising potential for systemically targeting innate immune tumor stimulators.







Abstract
Agonists of innate pattern recognition receptors such as toll&#8208;like receptors (TLRs) prime adaptive anti&#8208;tumor immunity and hold promise for cancer immunotherapy. However, small&#8208;molecule TLR agonists cause immune&#8208;related adverse effects (irAEs) after systemic administration. Herein, we report a polymeric nano&#8208;immunomodulator (cN@SS&#8208;IMQ) that is inactive until it is selectively metabolized to an active immunostimulant within the tumor. cN@SS&#8208;IMQ was obtained via self&#8208;assembly of a cyclo(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;D&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys)&#8208;modified amphiphilic copolymeric prodrug. Upon systemic administration, cN@SS&#8208;IMQ preferentially accumulated at tumor sites and responded to high intracellular glutathione levels to release native imidazoquinolines for dendritic cell maturation, thereby enhancing the infiltration of T lymphocytes. Collectively, cN@SS&#8208;IMQ tends to activate the immune system without irAEs, thus suggesting its promising potential for safe systemic targeting delivery.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Acylation of Alkenes by a Single Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reaction for the difunctionalization of terminal alkenes with an acyl group and a fluoromethyl, alkyl, sulfonyl, or thioether group was developed with acylation at the internal position by using a single photocatalyst. Key to success was a kinetic difference in the reactivity of the radical precursors with the excited photocatalyst, whereby the terminal position was first occupied by the more kinetically favorable radical precursor.







Abstract
A direct strategy for the difunctionalization of alkenes, with acylation occurring at the more substituted alkene position, would be attractive for complex ketone synthesis. We report herein a reaction driven by a single photocatalyst that enables &#945;&#8208;acylation in this way with the introduction of a fluoromethyl, alkyl, sulfonyl or thioether group at the &#946;&#8208;position of the alkene with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity under extremely mild conditions. Crucial to the success of this method are rate differences in the kinetics of radical generation through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) between different radical precursors and the excited photocatalyst (PC*). Thus, the &#946;&#8208;position of the alkene is first occupied by the group derived from the radical precursor that can be generated most readily, and &#945;&#8208;keto acids could be used as an electrophilic reagent for the &#945;&#8208;acylation of alkenes.

We report herein a reaction driven by a single photocatalyst that enables &#945;-acylation in this way with the introduction of a fluoromethyl, alkyl, sulfonyl or thioether group at the &#946;-position of the alkene with high chemo- and regioselectivity under extremely mild conditions. Crucial to the success of this method are rate differences in the kinetics of radical generation through single-electron transfer (SET) between different radical precursors and the excited photocatalyst (PC*). Thus, the &#946;-position of the alkene is first occupied by the group derived from the radical precursor that can be generated most readily, and &#945;-keto acids could be used as an electrophilic reagent for the &#945;-acylation of alkenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Edge&#8208;to&#8208;Center Propagation of Photochemical Reaction during Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Photomechanical Transformation of 2,5&#8208;Distyrylpyrazine Crystals
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The edge&#8208;to&#8208;center propagation of a photochemical reaction during the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photomechanical transformation was newly found for a 2,5&#8208;distyrylpyrazine (DSP) single crystal. This is in contrast to the fact that the photochemical reaction generally proceeds homogeneously in molecular crystals.







Abstract
Photomechanical molecular crystals are promising materials for photon&#8208;powered artificial actuators. To interpret the photomechanical responses, the spatiotemporal distribution of photoproducts in crystals could be an important role in addition to molecular structures, molecular packings, illumination conditions, crystal morphology, crystal size, and so on. In this study, we have found that single crystals of 2,5&#8208;distyrylpyrazine show a smooth single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photomechanical expansion, and the photochemical reaction propagates from the edge to the center of the single crystal. We revealed that the surface effect (special reactivity at the crystal surface) in addition to the cooperative effect (the reaction is facilitated by neighboring molecules) is essential for the edge&#8208;to&#8208;center propagation of the photochemical reaction. Our results would provide a foundation for future studies of the photochemical reaction dynamics in photomechanical molecular crystals.

The photochemical reaction of 2,5&#8208;distyrylpyrazine single crystals was investigated by Daichi Kitagawa, Seiya Kobatake, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202212290). Under uniform illumination conditions, the photochemical reaction starts from the edge of the crystals and propagates to the center. Both surface and cooperative effects are shown to be essential for this edge&#8208;to&#8208;center propagation of the photochemical reaction.

Methanogen&#8211;semiconductor biohybrids drive the sustainable conversion of microplastics into CH4 under illumination, as reported by Shungui Zhou, Yujie Xiong, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202213244). The biotic&#8211;abiotic hybrid system not only addresses a long&#8208;standing challenge of photocatalysis by fully utilizing photogenerated electrons and holes without the need for unsustainable chemical sacrificial quenchers, but also provides clues for a better understanding of the global carbon cycle.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Catalytically Stable Potassium Single&#8208;Atom Solid Superbases (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 52/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of solid superbases derived from potassium single atoms is described by You Han, Lin&#8208;Bing Sun, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202215157). The source of basicity is different from conventional basicity originating from oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Because of the superbasicity as well as high dispersion and anchoring of the basic sites, the potassium single atoms on graphene exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability in transesterification reactions.

         <title>Photoexcited Enzymes for Asymmetric Csp3&#8722;Csp3 Cross&#8208;Electrophile Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of photochemistry with enzyme catalysis offers exciting opportunities to induce new reactivities and to create novel enzymes for reactions other than their native ones. Recently, Hyster and co&#8208;workers demonstrated this for a photoenzymatic asymmetric Csp3&#8722;Csp3 cross&#8208;electrophile coupling, a reactivity previously unknown to enzymes.







Abstract
Enzymes have several advantages over conventional catalysts for organic synthesis. Over the last two decades, much effort has been made to further extend the scope of biocatalytic reactions available to synthetic chemists, particularly by expanding the repertoire of enzymes for abiological transformations. In this regard, exciting new developments in the area of photobiocatalysis enable now the introduction of non&#8208;natural reactivity in enzymes to solve long&#8208;standing synthetic challenges. A recently described example from the Hyster group demonstrates in an unprecedented way how the combination of photochemistry with enzyme catalysis empowers the catalytic asymmetric construction of Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bonds with high chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in the Presence of Impurities: Influences and Mitigation Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Power plants release CO2 and gaseous impurities into the atmosphere. In recent years, the effect of gaseous impurities on CO2 electrolysis has emerged as an important research topic, with an emphasis placed on understanding the catalytic reaction and developing mitigation strategies to lessen the negative effects of gaseous impurities.







Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of waste CO2 into useful fuels and chemical products is a promising approach to reduce CO2 emissions; however, several challenges still remain to be addressed. Thus far, most CO2 reduction studies use pure CO2 as the gas reactant, but CO2 emissions typically contain a number of gas impurities, such as nitrogen oxides, oxygen gas, and sulfur oxides. Gas impurities in CO2 can pose a significant obstacle for efficient CO2 electrolysis because they can influence the reaction and catalyst. This Minireview highlights early examples of CO2 reduction studies using mixed&#8208;gas feeds, explores strategies to sustain CO2 reduction in the presence of gas impurities, and discusses their implications for future progress in this emerging field.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Interactions in Diatomic Catalysts Boosting Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diatomic catalysts have attracted much attention, especially in electrochemistry. However, there have been no comprehensive reviews on long&#8208;range interactions (LRIs) between metallic centres. This Minireview introduces the key aspects of LRIs and highlights opportunities for regulating electrocatalytic mechanisms, thus presenting guidelines for the targeted usage of LRIs.







Abstract
The simultaneous presence of two active metal centres in diatomic catalysts (DACs) leads to the occurrence of specific interactions between active sites. Such interactions, referred to as long&#8208;range interactions (LRIs), play an important role in determining the rate and selectivity of a reaction. The optimal combination of metal centres must be determined to achieve the targeted efficiency. To date, various types of DACs have been synthesised and applied in electrochemistry. However, LRIs have not been systematically summarised. Herein, the regulation, mechanism, and electrocatalytic applications of LRIs are comprehensively summarised and discussed. In addition to the basic information above, the challenges, opportunities, and future development of LRIs in DACs are proposed in order to present an overall view and reference for future research.

         <dc:description>
The use of polymeric systems for bioconversion is an efficient and recyclable technology for the future industry due to its zero&#8208;pollution features. This Review focuses on self&#8208;assembled polymeric nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;sized structures and their application as biocatalytic reactors for chemical synthesis, including polymersomes, reverse micelles, polymer emulsions, Pickering emulsions, and static emulsions.







Abstract
Biocatalysis is increasingly being explored for the sustainable development of green industry. Though enzymes show great industrial potential with their high efficiency, specificity, and selectivity, they suffer from poor usability and stability under abiological conditions. To solve these problems, researchers have fabricated nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;sized biocatalytic reactors based on the self&#8208;assembly of various polymers, leading to highly stable, functional, and reusable biocatalytic systems. This Review highlights recent progress in self&#8208;assembled polymeric nano&#8208; and microreactors for biocatalytic synthesis, including polymersomes, reverse micelles, polymer emulsions, Pickering emulsions, and static emulsions. We categorize these reactors into monophasic and biphasic systems and discuss their structural characteristics and latest successes with representative examples. We also consider the challenges and potential solutions associated with the future development of this field.

         <title>Organic Electrolyte Design for Rechargeable Batteries: From Lithium to Magnesium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental physical and electrochemical properties of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are scrutinized with particular attention paid to the similarity and difference between Mg&#8208;ion and the popular Li&#8208;ion based electrolytes. The Review was written with the intention of accelerating the development of sustainable and high&#8208;performance battery technologies.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have been considered as one of the most viable battery chemistries amongst the &#8220;post&#8221; lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) technologies owing to their high volumetric capacity and the natural abundance of their key elements. The fundamental properties of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are of essence to regulate the overall performance of RMBs. In this Review, the basic electrochemistry of Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes batteries is discussed and compared to that of the Li&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes, and a comprehensive overview of the development of different Mg&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes is provided. In addition, the remaining challenges and possible solutions for future research are intensively discussed. The present work is expected to give an impetus to inspire the discovery of key electrolytes and thereby improve the electrochemical performances of RMBs and other related emerging battery technologies.

     alt="Organic Electrolyte Design for Rechargeable Batteries: From Lithium to Magnesium"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental physical and electrochemical properties of Mg-ion conducting electrolytes are scrutinized with particular attention paid to the similarity and difference between Mg-ion and the popular Li-ion based electrolytes. The Review was written with the intention of accelerating the development of sustainable and high-performance battery technologies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have been considered as one of the most viable battery chemistries amongst the &#8220;post&#8221; lithium-ion battery (LIB) technologies owing to their high volumetric capacity and the natural abundance of their key elements. The fundamental properties of Mg-ion conducting electrolytes are of essence to regulate the overall performance of RMBs. In this Review, the basic electrochemistry of Mg-ion conducting electrolytes batteries is discussed and compared to that of the Li-ion conducting electrolytes, and a comprehensive overview of the development of different Mg-ion conducting electrolytes is provided. In addition, the remaining challenges and possible solutions for future research are intensively discussed. The present work is expected to give an impetus to inspire the discovery of key electrolytes and thereby improve the electrochemical performances of RMBs and other related emerging battery technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Native Amide&#8208;Directed C(sp3)&#8722;H Amidation Enabled by Electron&#8208;Deficient RhIII Catalyst and Electron&#8208;Deficient 2&#8208;Pyridone Ligand</title>

         <dc:description>
Direct C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization reactions of native amides can facilitate streamlined synthesis of valuable molecules, but their insufficient directing ability is one of the current severe challenges of the field. Here we report that the combination of an electron&#8208;deficient RhIII catalyst and an electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand shows high catalytic activity for C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation of various native amides.







Abstract
Trivalent group&#8208;9 metal catalysts with a cyclopentadienyl&#8208;type ligand (CpMIII; M=Co, Rh, Ir, Cp=cyclopentadienyl) have been widely used for directed C&#8722;H functionalizations, albeit that their application to challenging C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalizations suffers from the limitations of the available directing groups. In this report, we describe directed C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation reactions of simple amide substrates with a variety of substituents. The combination of an electron&#8208;deficient CpERh catalyst (CpE=1,3&#8208;bis(ethoxycarbonyl)&#8208;substituted Cp) and an electron&#8208;deficient 2&#8208;pyridone ligand is essential for high reactivity.

         <title>Stereochemistry Controls Dihydrogen Bonding Strengths in Chiral Amine Boranes Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
How the strength of the N&#8722;H&#948;+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#948;&#8722;H&#8722;B interaction and hence the DHB&#8208;driven self&#8208;aggregation of amine&#8208;borane adducts is governed by steric effects has been investigated by comparing the structures and binding enthalpies of various chiral derivatives. For a diastereomeric pair of amine&#8208;boranes prepared from a chiral secondary amine, it is shown that the stereochemistry at the nitrogen atom has a significant influence on the interaction enthalpy.







Abstract
The growing interest in exploiting novel concepts of non&#8208;covalent interactions in catalysts and supramolecular chemistry made us revisit a special kind of hydrogen bonding: the dihydrogen bond (DHB), formed between a classical hydrogen bond donor and a hydridic hydrogen as acceptor. Herein, we investigate how the strength of the N&#8722;H&#948;+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#948;&#8722;H&#8722;B interaction and hence the DHB&#8208;driven self&#8208;aggregation of amine&#8208;borane adducts is governed by steric effects by comparing the structures and binding enthalpies of various chiral derivatives. For a diastereomeric pair of amine&#8208;boranes prepared from a chiral secondary amine, we show that the stereochemistry at the nitrogen has significant influence on the interaction enthalpy. Based on this finding, N&#8208;chiral amine boranes can be envisioned to become interesting building blocks in supramolecular chemistry to fine&#8208;tune the formation dynamics of assemblies.

         <title>Selective Cross&#8208;Ketonization of Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsymmetrical ketones can be prepared through selective coupling of two structurally distinct carboxylic acids without the need for preactivation of either partner. This photoredox cross&#8208;ketonization strategy exploits differences in the rates of key one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron activation steps using the two reactants.







Abstract
Carboxylic acids are attractive building blocks for synthetic chemistry because they are chemically stable, abundant, and commercially available with substantial structural diversity. The process of combining two carboxylic acids to furnish a ketone is termed ketonization. This is a potentially valuable transformation that has been underutilized in organic synthesis due to the harsh reaction conditions generally required and the lack of selectivity obtained when coupling two distinct carboxylic acids. We report herein a metallaphotoredox strategy that selectively generates unsymmetrical ketones via cross&#8208;ketonization of two structurally dissimilar carboxylic acids. Cross&#8208;selectivity is achieved by exploiting divergent reactivity of differentially substituted acids towards critical one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron processes in the proposed coupling mechanism. This method is broadly applicable to a variety of functionalized carboxylic acids. It can also be applied to acids of similar steric profile by exploiting differences in their relative rates of decarboxylation.

         <title>Observation of an Alternate Charge&#8208;Polarization State in a One&#8208;Dimensional Pt&#8722;Pt&#8722;I Chain Compound with a Bulky Pendant Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and physical properties of a new one&#8208;dimensional (1D) halogen&#8208;bridged dinuclear&#8208;metal complex (MMX&#8208;chain) with a rigid and bulky pendant ligand are reported. The steric hindrance derived from the bulkiness induces a strain in its 1D chain, achieving the first pure electronic state coupled with lattice distortion at ambient condition. The strain effect also appears as a very large linear thermal expansion along the 1D chain.







Abstract
A one&#8208;dimensional&#8197;(1D) halogen&#8208;bridged dinuclear&#8208;metal complex (MMX&#8208;chain) exhibits various electronic states based on a mixed&#8208;valence metal&#8208;dimer system. This report deals with the synthesis and physical properties of a new MMX&#8208;chain with a bulky pendant ligand, Pt2(mcc&#8208;HexCS2)4I (mcc&#8208;HexCS2=trans&#8208;4&#8208;(methoxycarbonyl)cyclohexanedithiocarboxylate). The steric hindrance caused by the bulky substituent induces a strain in its 1D chain, achieving at ambient condition the first pure alternate charge&#8208;polarization (ACP) state (&#8722;Pt2+&#8722;Pt3+&#8722;I&#8722;&#8722;Pt3+&#8722;Pt2+&#8722;I&#8722;&#8722;), a kind of spin&#8208;Peierls state, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and its conducting and magnetic properties. The strain effect is also manifested as a very large linear thermal expansion along the chain direction, which is quite different from conventional MMX&#8208;chains without a bulky ligand. The design of low&#8208;dimensional materials with ligand variations is expected to lead to the emergence of new electron&#8211;lattice coupled electronic states.

Phosphorus atom transfer from [PCO]&#8722; to the NbIV precursor [(PNP)NbCl2(NtBuAr)] (PNP=N[2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl]2&#8722;; Ar=3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3) resulted in decarbonylation and coupling of the P&#8208;atom to give [(PNPP)NbCl(NtBuAr)]. Reduction by one electron afforded the first neutral and terminal phosphido ligand on Nb, and two electron oxidation reformed the P&#8722;P bond. Computational studies were conducted to understand the mechanism in this set of transformations.







Abstract
Decarbonylation along with P&#8208;atom transfer from the phosphaethynolate anion, PCO&#8722;, to the NbIV complex [(PNP)NbCl2(NtBuAr)] (1) (PNP=N[2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl]2&#8722;; Ar=3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3) results in its coupling with one of the phosphine arms of the pincer ligand to produce a phosphanylidene phosphorane complex [(PNPP)NbCl(NtBuAr)] (2). Reduction of 2 with CoCp*2 cleaves the P&#8722;P bond to form the first neutral and terminal phosphido complex of a group 5 transition metal, namely, [(PNP)Nb&#8801;P(NtBuAr)] (3). Theoretical studies have been used to understand both the coupling of the P&#8208;atom and the reductive cleavage of the P&#8722;P bond. Reaction of 3 with a two&#8208;electron oxidant such as ethylene sulfide results in a diamagnetic sulfido complex having a P&#8722;P coupled ligand, namely [(PNPP)Nb=S(NtBuAr)] (4).

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Alkali Metal Antimonide&#8212;A New Approach to Antimony Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthetic pathway for the formation and isolation of the antimonides MSbH2 (M=alkali metal) is described. Starting from these SbH2&#8722; transfer reagents, the first primary silylstibane (Me3Si)3SiSbH2 was obtained.







Abstract
Alkali metal dihydrogen&#8208;antimonides [M(L)xSbH2], short: alkali metal antimonides (M=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; 1: L=pmdta; 2: L=crown&#8208;ether), were prepared from stibine and n&#8208;Butyllithium, M(hmds) (hmds=hexamethyldisilazane) or MOtBu, respectively. We developed a generally applicable synthesis route for these compounds and the obtained compounds were examined on their stability depending on the alkali metal and stabilizing additives used, whereby the use of appropriate crown&#8208;ethers allowed their isolation and characterization at room temperature. Moreover, the 1,4&#8208;dioxane adduct [Na(dioxane)xSbH2] was the appropriate starting compound for the synthesis of the first primary silylstibane (Me3Si)3SiSbH2 (3) which was characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy. Reaction of 3 with (Dipp2NacNac)Ga (Dipp2NacNac=HC{C(Me)N(Dipp)}2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) resulted in the formation of (Dipp2NacNac)GaH(SbHSi(SiMe3)3) (4) which was furthermore characterized by single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Bifunctional Europium for Operando Catalyst Thermometry in an Exothermic Chemical Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature determines the reaction kinetics, thermodynamics and catalyst stability. However, very limited information is known about the local catalyst temperature. Here, operando thermometry over bifunctional Eu3+ is performed to study the interplay between reaction conditions and the catalyst temperature dynamics in the exothermic methane oxychlorination reaction.







Abstract
Often the reactor or the reaction medium temperature is reported in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, even though it could vary significantly from the reactive catalyst temperature. The influence of the catalyst temperature on the catalytic performance and vice versa is therefore not always accurately known. We here apply EuOCl as both solid catalyst and thermometer, allowing for operando temperature determination. The interplay between reaction conditions and the catalyst temperature dynamics is studied. A maximum temperature difference between the catalyst and oven of +16&#8201;&#176;C was observed due to the exothermicity of the methane oxychlorination reaction. Heat dissipation by radiation appears dominating compared to convection in this set&#8208;up, explaining the observed uniform catalyst bed temperature. Application of operando catalyst thermometry could provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of catalyst performances and allow for safer process operation in chemical industries.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Devices Enabled by a Polyfullerene Electron Transporting Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyfullerene material (PFBS&#8208;C12) is developed that can work efficiently as the electron transporting material of p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs). PFBS&#8208;C12 retains the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits of conventional fullerene molecules, and shows suppressed aggregation and more conformal coverage on perovskites compared to PCBM. As a result, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs based on PFBS&#8208;C12 realize a high efficiency of 23.2&#8201;% with good device stability.







Abstract
Electron transporting materials (ETMs) play vital roles in determining the efficiency and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells. The widely used PCBM is prone to undesirable aggregation and migration in a cell, thus impairing device stability. In this work, we develop a new type of ETMs by polymerizing C60 fullerene with an aromantic linker unit. The resultant polyfullerene (PFBS&#8208;C12) not only maintains the good optoelectronic properties of fullerenes, but also can address the aforementioned aggregation problem of PCBM. The polyfullerene&#8208;based blade&#8208;coated cells exhibit a high efficiency of 23.2&#8201;% and good device stability that maintain 96&#8201;% of initial efficiency after &gt;1300&#8208;hour light soaking. An aperture efficiency of 18.9&#8201;% is also achieved on a 53.6&#8208;cm2 perovskite mini&#8208;module. This work provides a new strategy for designing ETMs that retain the key figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits of conventional fullerene molecules and enable more stable perovskite solar devices simultaneously.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Controlled Radical Copolymerization toward Hybrid Functional Fluoropolymers Driven by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free controlled radical copolymerization of trifluorovinyl boronic ester and vinyl esters has been established, enabling the on&#8208;demand synthesis of main&#8208;chain hybrid functional polymers driven by light. This work furnishes a facile and versatile strategy to tailor F/B&#8208;incorporated polymers, which facilitates chain&#8208;extensions, post modifications to unprecedented polymers, and allows innovations of copolymer electrolytes.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;controlled polymerizations are attractive to tailor macromolecules of complex compositions with spatiotemporal regulation. In this work, with a convenient synthesis for trifluorovinyl boronic ester (TFVB), we report a light&#8208;driven organocatalyzed copolymerization of vinyl monomers and TFVB for the first time, which enabled the controlled synthesis of a variety of hybrid fluorine/boron polymers with low dispersities and good chain&#8208;end fidelity. The good behaviors of &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switch, chain&#8208;extension polymerizations and post&#8208;modifications further highlight the versatility and reliability of this copolymerization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the combination of fluorine and boron could furnish copolymer electrolytes of high lithium&#8208;ion transference number (up to 0.83), bringing new opportunities of engineering high&#8208;performance materials for energy storage purposes.

         <title>A Sulfoxide Reagent for One&#8208;Pot, Three&#8208;Component Syntheses of Sulfoxides and Sulfinamides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon Grignard reactions, a simple sulfoxide reagent allows the formation of sulfenate anions that are subsequently transformed into sulfoxides and sulfinamides. This one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component method does not require substrates with preinstalled sulfur functional groups.







Abstract
Sulfoxides and sulfinamides represent versatile sulfur functional groups found in ligands, chiral auxiliaries, and bioactive molecules. Canonical two&#8208;component syntheses, however, rely on substrates with a preinstalled C&#8722;S bond and impede efficient and modular access to these sulfur motifs. Herein is presented the application of an easily prepared, bench&#8208;stable sulfoxide reagent for one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component syntheses of sulfoxides and sulfinamides. The sulfoxide reagent donates the SO unit upon the reaction with a Grignard reagent (RMgX) as a sulfenate anion (RSO&#8722;). While subsequent trapping reactions of this key intermediate with carbon electrophiles provide sulfoxides, a range of tertiary, secondary, and primary sulfinamides can be prepared by substitution reactions with electrophilic amines. The syntheses of sulfinamide analogs of amide&#8208; and sulfonamide&#8208;containing drugs illustrate the utility of the method for the rapid preparation of medicinally relevant molecules.

         <title>Broadband Photoresponses from Ultraviolet to Near&#8208;Infrared (II) Region through Light&#8208;induced Pyroelectric Effects in a Hybrid Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We realize broadband photoresponses covering UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR&#8208;II (266&#8211;1950&#8197;nm) spectral region through light&#8208;induced pyroelectric effect in a hybrid perovskite, which breaks the limitation of intrinsic optical band gap and provides a feasible way toward assembling broadband high&#8208;performance devices.







Abstract
Broadband photodetection has shown a great promise for diverse applications, while the realization of plateau photoresponse from ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral region is very challenging. Herein, we exploit photoexcited pyroelectric effect in a chiral hybrid perovskite, (N, N&#8208;dimethylcyclohexylammonium)PbBr3 (1), serving as a new pathway to drive broadband photoactivities. It is a room&#8208;temperature pyroelectric with large polarization of &#8776;6.4&#8197;&#956;C cm&#8722;2 and high pyroelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits (FV=1.0&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2&#8201; &#956;C&#8722;1 and FD=7.1&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;Pa&#8722;1/2). Strikingly, light&#8208;induced pyroelectric effect arising from spontaneous polarization is observed in 1, which cover UV (266&#8197;nm) to NIR&#8208;II (1950&#8197;nm) full spectral region. The broadband photoresponses actualized by pyroelectricity break the limit of optical band gap. As the first demonstration of photo&#8208;pyroelectricity covering UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR spectral region in hybrid perovskites, this work paves a pathway to assemble high&#8208;performance smart devices.

         <title>Four&#8208;Component Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Functionalized Azetidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multicomponent [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement/strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven anion relay sequence and its application to the modular synthesis of substituted azetidines is described. Three electrophilic coupling partners, whose identities can be individually varied, were added sequentially to the highly strained fragment azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl&#8208;lithium to access a diverse compound library.







Abstract
Despite the favorable properties that azetidine rings can engender on drug&#8208;compounds, methods for the diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis of azetidine&#8208;based structures are significantly underdeveloped. Herein, we report the successful realization of a multicomponent [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement/strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven anion relay sequence and its application to the modular synthesis of substituted azetidines. The rapidity of the reaction, as confirmed by in situ infra&#8208;red spectroscopy, leverages the strain&#8208;release ring&#8208;opening of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane to drive the equilibrium of the Brook rearrangement. The three electrophilic coupling partners, added sequentially to azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl&#8208;lithium, could be individually varied to access a diverse compound library. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated in a 4&#8208;step synthesis of the EP2 receptor antagonist PF&#8208;04418948.

         <title>Superior Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Activation with Dimethyl Ether</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid dimethyl ether is shown to be a potent activating solvent for MOFs. The combination of low surface tension, high volatility, and coordinating ability allows efficient activation of even MOFs with coordinatively unsaturated sites. The broad applicability of the technique is demonstrated, and the level of activation achievable compares very favorably against existing activation protocols.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are demonstrated to be readily activated by treatment with the low surface tension, low boiling point solvent dimethyl ether (DME). The mildness of the method enables access to high surface areas by avoiding structural changes in the framework that often plague thermal activation methods. A distinction from previous methods is that DME activation succeeds for materials with coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) and non&#8208;CUS MOFs as well. DME displaces solvent molecules occupying the pores of the MOF as well as those coordinated to metal centers; reducing evacuation temperature by using a coordinating, yet highly volatile guest enables low temperature activation with structural retention as demonstrated surface area measurements that match or exceed existing activation protocols.

         <title>Access to N&#8722;CF3 Formamides by Reduction of N&#8722;CF3 Carbamoyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthetic access to N&#8208;trifluoromethylated formamides is reported. The method involves the reduction of bench&#8208;stable N&#8722;CF3 carbamoyl fluorides. In contrast to e.g. N&#8722;Me formamides, the newly made N&#8722;CF3 formamides do not show rotamers at room temperature. Moreover, they are highly robust and compatible with diverse chemical transformations.







Abstract
The departure into unknown chemical space is essential for the discovery of new properties and function. We herein report the first synthetic access to N&#8208;trifluoromethylated formamides. The method involves the reduction of bench&#8208;stable NCF3 carbamoyl fluorides and is characterized by operational simplicity and mildness, tolerating a broad range of functional groups as well as stereocenters. The newly made N&#8722;CF3 formamide motif proved to be highly robust and compatible with diverse chemical transformations, underscoring its potential as building block in complex functional molecules.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Ru(bda) Coordination Oligomers as Efficient Catalysts for Visible Light&#8208;Driven Water Oxidation in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble Ru(bda) coordination oligomers with varying lengths are investigated in visible light&#8208;driven water oxidation catalysis. The excellent performance and stability of longer oligomers in pure water is rationalized by the very high local concentrations of active sites in self&#8208;assembled superstructures.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble multinuclear complexes based on ruthenium 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate (bda) and ditopic bipyridine linker units are investigated in three&#8208;component visible light&#8208;driven water oxidation catalysis. Systematic studies revealed a strong enhancement of the catalytic efficiency in the absence of organic co&#8208;solvents and with increasing oligomer length. In&#8208;depth kinetic and morphological investigations suggest that the enhanced performance is induced by the self&#8208;assembly of linear Ru(bda) oligomers into aggregated superstructures. The obtained turnover frequencies (up to 14.9&#8197;s&#8722;1) and turnover numbers (more than 1000) per ruthenium center are the highest reported so far for Ru(bda)&#8208;based photocatalytic water oxidation systems.

         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of branched allylic phosphine compounds under mild conditions is reported. Products bearing various functional groups can be synthesized with excellent stereoselectivity (up to 99.9&#8201;% ee) and regioselectivity. The employment of phosphine sulfides with relatively low deactivation capacity against metal catalysts is crucial for the success of this reaction.

         <title>Conversion of a AuI Fluorido Complex into an N&#8208;Fluoroamido Derivative: N&#8722;F versus Au&#8722;N Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of a fluoroamido complex was achieved on reaction of [Au(F)(SPhos)] with NFSI. Reactivity studies revealed the insertion of CO into the N&#8722;F bond. The transfer of the fluoroamido group onto organic molecules was also accomplished.







Abstract
The AuI complex [Au{N(F)SO2Ph}(SPhos)] (SPhos=dicyclohexyl(2&#8242;,6&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxy[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphane) (2) bearing a fluoroamido ligand has been synthesized by reaction of the fluorido complex [Au(F)(SPhos)] (1) with NFSI (NFSI=N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide). A reaction with CO resulted in an unprecedented insertion into the N&#8722;F bond at 2. With the carbene precursor N2CH(CO2Et) N&#8722;F bond cleavage gave the Au&#8722;F bond insertion product [Au{CHF(CO2C2H5)}(SPhos)] (7). The presence of CNtBu led to Au&#8722;N cleavage at 2 and concomitant amide formation to give the cationic complex [Au(CNtBu)(SPhos)][N(F)SO2Ph)] (5), which reacted further to give FtBu as well as the cyanido complex [Au(CN)(SPhos)] (6). These results led to the development of a process for the amination of electrophilic organic substrates by transfer of the fluoroamido group NF(SO2Ph)&#8722;.

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Synthesis of B/N&#8208;Doped Calix[4]arene Exhibiting Narrowband Multiple Resonance Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped calix[4]arene named C&#8208;BN was successfully synthesized through one&#8208;shot double borylation. C&#8208;BN shows a highly centrosymmetric structure with two multiple resonance fragments bridged by tertiary amine groups at the 1,3 positions of the benzene ring. The optimized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes can exhibit high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 24.7&#8211;26.6&#8201;% and small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;max of 25&#8211;28&#8197;nm over a wide doping range of 1&#8211;12&#8197;wt&#8201;%.







Abstract
A novel macrocycle of B/N&#8208;doped calix[4]arene (C&#8208;BN) was synthesized by a one&#8208;shot double boronation. Owing to the structural tension and electron&#8208;donating properties of the nitrogen atoms in the macrocycle, reaction selectively proceeds between the adjacent benzene rings outside the macrocycle. C&#8208;BN shows a highly centrosymmetric structure with two multiple resonance (MR) fragments bridged by tertiary amine groups at the 1,3 positions of the benzene ring. Benefiting from the large intermolecular distance (&gt;4.6&#8197;&#197;) between adjacent MR&#8208;emitting cores, C&#8208;BN also exhibits excellent narrowband emitting features against aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and spectrum broadening. Optimized organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices based on C&#8208;BN exhibit high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 24.7&#8211;26.6&#8201;% and small full width at half maximums of 25&#8211;28&#8197;nm over a wide doping range of 1&#8211;12&#8197;wt&#8201;%.

Benefiting from the large intermolecular distance (&amp;gt;4.6&#8197;&#197;) between adjacent MR-emitting cores, C-BN also exhibits excellent narrowband emitting features against aggregation-induced quenching and spectrum broadening. Optimized organic light-emitting diode devices based on C-BN exhibit high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 24.7&#8211;26.6&#8201;% and small full width at half maximums of 25&#8211;28&#8197;nm over a wide doping range of 1&#8211;12&#8197;wt&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Oxidation&#8208;Resistant Electrolyte for 4.7&#8197;V Sodium Metal Batteries Enabled by Anion/Cation Solvation Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4.7&#8197;V oxidation&#8208;resistant electrolyte with self&#8208;purifying ability is successfully designed by anion/cation solvation strategy with NaClO4 and TPFS as dual additives. The Na||NVPF battery with such electrolyte could exhibit superior electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) are considered as promising battery system due to abundant Na sources. However, poor compatibility between electrolyte and cathode severely impedes its development. Herein, we proposed an anion/cation solvation strategy for realizing 4.7&#8197;V resistant SMBs electrolyte with NaClO4 and trimethoxy(pentafluorophenyl)silane (TPFS) as dual additives (DA). The ClO4&#8722; can rapidly transfer to the cathode surface and strongly coordinate with Na+ to form stable polymer&#8208;like chains with solvents. Meanwhile, TPFS can preferentially enter into the PF6&#8722; anion solvation sheath for reducing PF6&#8208;solvent interaction and effectively scavenge adverse electrolyte species for protecting electrode electrolyte interphases. Thus, such electrolyte elevates the oxidative stability of carbonate electrolytes from 3.77 to 4.75&#8197;V, and enables Na||Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPF) battery with a capacity retention of 93&#8201;% and an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles at 4.7&#8197;V.

         <title>Open&#8208;Cage Fullerene as Molecular Container for F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722; and I&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 52, December 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide anions have been successfully inserted into the cavity of a 19&#8208;membered open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative at 60&#8201;&#176;C for Cl&#8722; and 90&#8201;&#176;C for F&#8722;, Br&#8722; and I&#8722; under atmospheric pressure. The encapsulation ratio is quantitative as shown by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis data and spectroscopic data. The presence of halide ions improves the stability of the cage structure, which could be stored at r.t. for weeks without noticeable change.







Abstract
A 19&#8208;membered open&#8208;cage fullerene derivative was prepared from C60 in 7&#8197;steps and 5.5&#8201;% yield through the peroxide&#8208;mediate pathway. There are four carbonyl groups, an ether oxygen and a quinoxaline moiety on the rim of the orifice. A chloride anion could be inserted into its cavity by heating with hydrochloric acid at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 4&#8197;h. Encapsulation of fluoride, bromide and iodide anions was also achieved at slightly more forcing conditions, 90&#8201;&#176;C for 14&#8197;h. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of the sodium salt of the chloride and the bromide encapsulated derivatives were obtained, which showed the halide anion in the center of the cavity and two sodium cations connecting two cages through coordination to the oxygen atoms on the rim of the orifices. The halide encapsulation ratio is quantitative in the isolated products.
