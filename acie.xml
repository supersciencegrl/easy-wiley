         <title>Promoting the Furan Ring Opening Reaction to Access New Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts with Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are visible light&#8208;responsive photoswitches with a variety of emerging applications in photoresponsive materials. Their two&#8208;step modular synthesis centered on the nucleophilic ring opening of an activated furan makes DASAs readily accessible. However, the more recent introduction of less reactive donors or acceptors renders the process slow and low yielding, which has limited their development. We demonstrate here that 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) promotes the ring opening reaction and stabilizes the open isomer, allowing for greatly reduced reaction times and increased yields for known derivatives. In addition, it provides access to previously unattainable DASA based photoswitches and DASA&#8208;polymer conjugates. The role of HFIP and the photochromic properties of a set of new&#160;DASAs, presented here, is probed using a combination of  1  H&#8208;NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. By introducing sterically hindered, electron poor amines the dark equilibrium was decoupled from closed isomer half&#8208;lives&#160;for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Rechargeable K&#8211;CO2 Batteries with KSn Anode and Carboxyl&#8208;Containing Carbon Nanotube Cathode Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal K&#8211;CO2 batteries suffer from large polarization and safety hazards, which mainly result from the difficult decomposition of K2CO3 and dendrite growth. Moreover, the battery redox mechanism remains not fully understood. Here we report K&#8211;CO2 batteries with KSn alloy as anode and carboxyl&#8208;containing multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs&#8208;COOH) as cathode catalyst, proving the redox mechanism to be 4KSn + 3CO2 &#8596; 2K2CO3 + C + 4Sn. Compared with K metal, the less active and dendrite&#8208;free KSn anode effectively enhances the safety and stability of CO2 batteries. More importantly, the existence of &#8211;COOH induces strong ionic&#8208;bond interaction between MWCNTs&#8208;COOH and K2CO3, which weakens the C=O bond in K2CO3 and thus facilitates K2CO3 decomposition. As a result, the K&#8211;CO2 batteries show excellent cycling stability (an overpotential increase of 0.89 V after 400 cycles) and good rate performance (up to 2000 mA g&#8211;1). This work paves the way to develop highly stable and safe CO2&#8208;based batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning the Spring&#8208;Like Motion of an Anion&#8208;Based Triple Helicate by Tetraalkylammonium Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular springs are a class of molecular devices that may provide implications to the macroscopic spring behavior from the molecular level. Helical structures are suitable molecular springs because the specific twisting of the helical strands can cause spring&#8208;like (extension&#8210;contraction) movement along the axis upon external stimuli. Herein we report an anion&#8208;based triple&#8208;helicate spring, which can undergo reversible contraction&#8210;extension motion through introduction and removal of tetraalkylammonium cations, including TMA+ and analogous irregular tetrahedral cations bearing different alkyl chains, while the relative orientation of the two phosphate ions changes to facilitate guest inclusion. Notably, the degree of contraction (shortening of the helical pitch) can be fine&#8208;tuned by varying the shape and size of guest cation. However, with the larger cations (TEA+, TPA+ and TBA+), the meso&#8208;helicate configuration is obtained, which interconverts with the helicate by addition/removal of TMA+ ion.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;type Doping Induced Electron Localization for Non&#8208;oxidative Coupling of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodriven nonoxidative coupling of CH  4  (NOCM) is an attractive potential way to use abundant methane resources. Herein, a n&#8208;type doped photocatalyst for NOCM is created by doping single&#8208;atom Nb into hierarchical porous TiO  2  &#8208;SiO  2  (TS) microarray, which exhibits a high conversion rate of 3.57 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  with good recyclability. The Nb dopant replaces the 6&#8208;coordinated titanium on the (1 0 1) surface and forms shallow electron&#8208;trapped surface polarons along [0 1 0] direction as verified by the experimental analyses and the first&#8208;principle density functional theory calculation. The comparison of different models proves that the electron localization caused by the n&#8208;type doping is beneficial to both the methane activation and ethane desorption. The positive effect of n&#8208;type dopant on CH  4  conversion is further verified on Mo&#8208;, W&#8208; and Ta&#8208;doped composites. In contrast, the doping of p&#8208;type dopant (Ga, Cu, Fe) shows less active influence. This study provides an in&#8208;depth insight into the effect of dopant type and is expected to guide the smart photocatalyst design for CH  4  conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Heterointerfaces Achieve Delicate Reaction Kinetics towards Hydrogen Evolution and Hydrazine Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst toward hydrazine&#8208;assisted H2 production was designed by constructing the Ni3N&#8208;Co3N heterointerfaces on Ni foam (Ni3N&#8208;Co3N PNAs/NF). The catalyst can achieve energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production in an overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) unit, showing its potential for practical applications.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting for H2 production is limited by the sluggish anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thus using hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) to replace OER has received great attention. Here we report the hierarchical porous nanosheet arrays with abundant Ni3N&#8208;Co3N heterointerfaces on Ni foam with superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and HzOR activity, realizing working potentials of &#8722;43 and &#8722;88&#8197;mV for 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and achieving an industry&#8208;level 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 200&#8197;mV for HzOR. The two&#8208;electrode overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) electrolyzer requires the cell voltages of 0.071 and 0.76&#8197;V for 10 and 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The H2 production powered by a direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) and a commercial solar cell are investigated to inspire future practical applications. DFT calculations decipher that heterointerfaces simultaneously optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (&#916;GH*) and promote the hydrazine dehydrogenation kinetics. This work provides a rationale for advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts, and propels the practical energy&#8208;saving H2 generation techniques.

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Based Molecular Cluster&#8208;Aggregates: Optical Barcoding and White&#8208;Light Emission with Nanosized {Ln20} Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The control of the energy transfer and the emission colour is demonstrated for the first time in molecular cluster&#8208;aggregates. Moreover, through the targeted choice of the lanthanide composition, a novel pure white&#8208;light emitting cluster&#8208;aggregate was isolated. This approach can pave new avenues into the future of efficient optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies.







Abstract
Counterfeit goods represent a major problem to companies, governments, and customers, affecting the global economy. In order to protect the authenticity of products and documents, optical anti&#8208;counterfeit technologies have widely been employed via the use of discrete molecular species, extended metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and nanoparticles. Herein, for the first time we demonstrate the potential use of molecular cluster&#8208;aggregates (MCA) as optical barcodes via composition and energy transfer control. The tuneable optical properties for the [Ln20(chp)30(CO3)12(NO3)6(H2O)6], where chp&#8722;=deprotonated 6&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinol, allow the fine control of the emission colour output, resulting in high&#8208;security level optical labelling with a precise read&#8208;out. Moreover, a unique tri&#8208;doped composition of GdIII, TbIII, and EuIII led to MCAs with white&#8208;light emission. The presented methodology is a unique approach to probe the effect of composition control on the luminescent properties of nanosized molecular material.

&lt;p&gt;The control of the energy transfer and the emission colour is demonstrated for the first time in molecular cluster&#8208;aggregates. Moreover, through the targeted choice of the lanthanide composition, a novel pure white&#8208;light emitting cluster&#8208;aggregate was isolated. This approach can pave new avenues into the future of efficient optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies.

         <title>Identifying the Critical Anion&#8211;Cation Coordination to Regulate the Electric Double Layer for an Efficient Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electric double layer chemistry and structure are identified to play a predominate role in governing the competitive reactions during solid electrolyte interphase formation on lithium&#8208;metal anodes. This knowledge affords critical guidance on the targeted interface design to enable a stable working lithium anode.







Abstract
The persistent efforts to reveal the formation and evolution mechanisms of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are of fundamental significance for the rational regulation. In this work, through combined theoretical and experimental model investigations, we elucidate that the electric double layer (EDL) chemistry at the electrode/electrolyte interface beyond the thermodynamic stability of electrolyte components predominately controls the competitive reduction reactions during SEI construction on Li metal anode. Specifically, the negatively&#8208;charged surface of Li metal will prompt substantial cation enrichment and anion deficiency within the EDL. Necessarily, only the species participating in the solvation shell of cations could be electrostatically accumulated in proximity of Li metal surface and thereafter be preferentially reduced during sustained dynamic cycling. Incorporating multi&#8208;valent cation additives to more effectively drag the favorable anionic SEI enablers into EDL is validated as a promising strategy to upgrade the Li protection performance. The conclusions drawn herein afford deeper understandings to bridge the EDL principle, cation solvation, and SEI formation, shedding fresh light on the targeted regulation of reactive alkali metal interfaces.

         <title>The Characteristics of Disulfide&#8208;Centered Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rotational spectra of intermolecular clusters involving S&#8722;S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C/N/O interactions reveal the structural and energetic features of disulfide&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds, providing a deep insight into molecular behaviors of the disulfide bond towards a hydrogen donor at the molecular level.







Abstract
The disulfide&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds in the three different model systems of diethyl disulfide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2O/H2CO/HCONH2 clusters were characterized by high&#8208;resolution Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy and quantum chemical computations. The global minimum energy structures for each cluster are experimentally observed and are characterized by one of the three different S&#8722;S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C/N/O disulfide&#8208;centered hydrogen bonds and two O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds. Non&#8208;covalent interaction and natural bond orbital analyses further confirm the experimental observations. The symmetry&#8208;adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) analysis reveals that electrostatic is dominant in diethyl disulfide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2O/HCONH2 clusters being consistent with normal hydrogen bonds, whilst dispersion takes over in diethyl disulfide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H2CO cluster. Our study gives accurate structural parameters for the disulfide bond involved non&#8208;covalent clusters providing important benchmarking data for the theoretical evaluation of more complex systems.

         <title>Rational Fabrication of Crystalline Smart Materials for Rapid Detection and Efficient Removal of Ozone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated the first example to use imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for smart sensing and efficient removal of ozone, and showed that the COFs&#8217; performance could surpass traditional materials. The mechanism for the performance of imine&#8208;based COFs is unveiled.







Abstract
Traditional ozone sensing and removal materials still suffer from high energy consumption and low efficiency. Thus, seeking new ozone&#8208;responsive materials with high efficiency and broad working conditions is of great significance. Herein, we first developed covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for smart sensing and efficient removal of ozone. Notably, imine&#8208;based COFs possess dramatically fast optical responses (&lt;1&#8197;s) to ozone as low as 0.1&#8197;ppm under broad working conditions (e.g., in the presence or absence of moisture, room temperature). Moreover, we found that imine&#8208;based COFs can also be applied as excellent ozone removers that can efficiently reduce the ozone concentration below the recommended safety limit (&lt;0.1&#8197;ppm) for humans. The mechanism for the performance of imine&#8208;based COFs was unveiled in&#8208;depth by various characterization techniques and analyses. This study not only provides a new type of advanced materials for ozone sensing and removal but also broadens the application scope of COFs.

         <title>Activation of Aptamers with Gain of Function by Small&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Clipping of Intramolecular Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;molecule&#8208;mediated selection method was developed to obtain a &#8220;clipped aptamer&#8221; with activatable binding affinity toward its target. The aptamer's binding can be activated by &#8220;clipping&#8221; two intramolecular motifs via a synthetic DNA&#8208;mismatch&#8208;binding small molecule.







Abstract
Click reactions have the advantages of high reactivity, excellent orthogonality, and synthetic accessibility. Inspired by click reactions, we propose the concept of &#8220;clipped aptamers&#8221;, whose binding affinity is regulated by the &#8220;clip&#8221;&#8208;like specific interaction between a synthetic DNA&#8208;mismatch&#8208;binding small molecule (molecular glue, Z&#8208;NCTS) and the preset CGG/CGG sequences in nucleic acid sequences. In this study, we investigated a Z&#8208;NCTS&#8208;mediated de&#8197;novo selection of clipped aptamers against epithelial cell adhesion molecule. The generated clipped aptamers can achieve the efficient transition from a binding&#8208;inactive state to an active state by clipping of Z&#8208;NCTS with two CGG sites, which otherwise would not hybridize. The experimental and simulation results showed that the clipped aptamer had ideal binding thermodynamics and the ability to regulate cellular adhesion. Because of this superior activated mechanism and structural diversity, clipped aptamers hold great potential in biosensing, imaging, conditional gene&#8208; and cellular behavior&#8208;regulation, and drug delivery.

         <title>Analogous Mixed Matrix Membranes with Self&#8208;Assembled Interface Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of analogous mixed matrix membranes with self&#8208;assembled interface pathways were constructed via molecular&#8208;level hybridization by utilizing a reactive ionic liquid (RIL) as the continuous phase and graphene quantum dots (GQD) as nanofiller for sub&#8208;angstrom&#8208;scale ethylene/ethane (0.416&#8197;nm/0.443&#8197;nm) separation. Importantly, the interfacial pathway structure was visualized and the self&#8208;assembly mechanism was revealed.







Abstract
The implementation of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for sub&#8208;angstrom scale gas separations remains a grand challenge. Herein, a series of analogous mixed matrix membrane (AMMMs) were constructed via molecular&#8208;level hybridization by utilizing a reactive ionic liquid (RIL) as the continuous phase and graphene quantum dots (GQD) as nanofiller for sub&#8208;angstrom scale ethylene/ethane (0.416&#8197;nm/0.443&#8197;nm) separation. With a small number of GQDs (3.5&#8197;wt%) embedded in GQD/RIL AMMMs, ethylene permeability soared by 3.1&#8208;fold, and ethylene/ethane selectivity simultaneously boosted by nearly 60&#8201;% and reached up to 99.5, which outperformed most previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. Importantly, the interfacial pathway structure was visualized and their self&#8208;assembly mechanism was revealed, where the non&#8208;covalent interactions between RIL and GQDs induced the local arrangement of IL chains to self&#8208;assemble into plenty of compact and superfast interfacial pathways, contributing to the combination of superhigh permeability and selectivity.

         <title>Bis&#8208;Cyclooctatetraenyl Thulium(II): Highly Reducing Lanthanide Sandwich Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly reactive divalent sandwich (Cot)2Tm{K(18&#8208;c&#8208;6)}2 exhibits slow magnetic relaxation in absence of a DC field, an unprecedented report for f13 configuration. The variation of the counter&#8208;cation influences the magnetic relaxation in line with the overall stability of the organometallic sandwich complex.







Abstract
Divalent lanthanide organometallics are well&#8208;known highly reducing compounds usually used for single electron transfer reactivity and small molecule activation. Thus, their very reactive nature prevented for many years the study of their physical properties, such as magnetic studies on a reliable basis. Herein, the access to rare organometallic sandwich compounds of TmII with the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) ligand impacts on the use of divalent organolanthanide compounds as an additional strategy for the design of performing Single Molecule Magnets (SMM). The first divalent thulium sandwich complex with f13 configuration behaving as a single&#8208;molecule magnet in absence of DC field is highlighted.

         <title>Highly Potent MRI Contrast Agent Displaying Outstanding Sensitivity to Zinc Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly potent MRI contrast agent based on paramagnetic Gd3+ was developed to selectively recognize Zn2+ over other abundant endogenous metal ions. The interaction with Zn2+ modulates the hydration of the complex, leading to a significant increase in its longitudinal relaxivity. The new responsive platform is highly suitable for studying the Zn&#8208;related physiological processes at high magnetic fields.







Abstract
Zinc ions play an important role in numerous crucial biological processes in the human body. The ability to image the function of Zn2+ would be a significant asset to biomedical research for monitoring various physiopathologies dependent on its fate. To this end, we developed a novel Gd3+ chelate that can selectively recognize Zn2+ over other abundant endogenous metal ions and alter its paramagnetic properties. More specifically, this lanthanide chelate displayed an extraordinary increase in longitudinal relaxivity (r1) of over 400&#8201;% upon interaction with Zn2+ at 7&#8197;T and 25&#8201;&#176;C, which is the greatest r1 enhancement observed for any of the metal ion&#8208;responsive Gd&#8208;based complexes at high magnetic field. A &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; mechanism responsible for these massive changes was confirmed through NMR and luminescence lifetime studies on a 13C&#8208;labeled Eu3+ analogue. This molecular platform represents a new momentum in developing highly suitable magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents for functional molecular imaging studies of Zn2+.

         <title>Structural Characterization of Two CO Molecules Bound to the Nitrogenase Active Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Besides reducing dinitrogen, nitrogenases reduce CO to hydrocarbons, mediating C&#8722;C bond formation between multiple CO&#8208;derived ligands. To shed light on how multiple C&#8208;based ligands bind to the active site, we report a 1.33&#8197;&#197; resolution crystal structure of two CO ligands coordinated to the FeMo&#8208;cofactor of molybdenum nitrogenase (see picture). The second CO ligand is coordinated to Fe6 in a previously unreported ligand binding mode.







Abstract
As an approach towards unraveling the nitrogenase mechanism, we have studied the binding of CO to the active&#8208;site FeMo&#8208;cofactor. CO is not only an inhibitor of nitrogenase, but it is also a substrate, undergoing reduction to hydrocarbons (Fischer&#8211;Tropsch&#8208;type chemistry). The C&#8722;C bond forming capabilities of nitrogenase suggest that multiple CO or CO&#8208;derived ligands bind to the active site. Herein, we report a crystal structure with two CO ligands coordinated to the FeMo&#8208;cofactor of the molybdenum nitrogenase at 1.33&#8197;&#197; resolution. In addition to the previously observed bridging CO ligand between Fe2 and Fe6 of the FeMo&#8208;cofactor, a new ligand binding mode is revealed through a second CO ligand coordinated terminally to Fe6. While the relevance of this state to nitrogenase&#8208;catalyzed reactions remains to be established, it highlights the privileged roles for Fe2 and Fe6 in ligand binding, with multiple coordination modes available depending on the ligand and reaction conditions.

         <dc:description>Using small molecules to assemble well&#8208;controlled macro&#8208;sized helices is still a great challenge and highly desired for advanced materials. Here, we present the first example of the macro&#8208;scale helices co&#8208;assembled from temperature&#8208;responsive carbohydrate&#8208;based bolaamphiphiles (CHO&#8208;Bolas) and 1,4&#8208;benzenediboronic acid (BDBA). The CHO&#8208;Bolas contained hydrophilic glucose or mannose moieties and hydrophobic coumarin dimer. They showed temperature&#8208;responsive reversible micelle&#8208;to&#8208;vesicle transition (MVT) in aqueous solutions. After the binding of carbohydrate moieties with boronic acids of BDBA in their alkaline solutions, right&#8208;handed helices were formed via the temperature&#8208;driven chirality transfer of D&#8208;glucose or D&#8208;mannose from molecular to supramolecular level. The helices with the length of hundreds of microns had helical pitches of 5.4&#8208;6.3 &#956;m and lamellae thickness of 0.2&#8208;0.3 &#956;m. These helices were co&#8208;assembled by unreacted BDBA, boronate esters (B&#8208;O&#8208;C bonds) between CHO&#8208;Bolas and BDBA, as well as boroxine anhydrides (B&#8208;O&#8208;B bonds) of self&#8208;condensed BDBA. After heating treatment at 300 &#176;C in nitrogen gas, helices displayed excellent morphological stability. Moreover, they emitted bright blue luminescence caused by strong self&#8208;condensation of BDBA and decomposition of coumarin dimers.</dc:description>

In comparison with its isomeric counterparts named PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  m  with different conjugated coupling sites, PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  o  exhibits stronger and bathochromic absorption to achieve better photon harvesting. Meanwhile, PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  o  adopts more ordered inter&#8208;chain packing and suitable phase separation after blending with the donor polymer PM6, which resulted in suppressed charge recombination and efficient charge transport. Strikingly,  we observed a dramatic performance difference between the two isomeric polymer acceptors PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  o  and PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  m  . While devices based on PM6:PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  o  can yield power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.2%, devices based on PM6:PYF&#8208;T&#8208;  m  only show poor efficiencies of 1.4%. This work demonstrates the success of configuration&#8208;unique fluorinated end groups in designing high&#8208;performance regular polymer acceptors, which provides guidelines towards developing all&#8208;PSCs with better efficiencies.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Halide Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes via Molecular Passivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites are promising for applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), but still suffer from defects&#8208;mediated nonradiative losses, which represent a major efficiency&#8208;limiting factor in perovskite&#8208;based LEDs (PeLEDs). Reported here is a strategy to synthesize molecular passivators with different anchoring groups for defects passivation. The passivated perovskite thin films exhibit improved optoelectronic properties as well as reduced grain size and surface roughness, thus enable highly efficient PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency of 15.6% using an imidazolium terminated passivator. Further demonstrated is that the  in&#8208;situ  formation of low&#8208;dimensional perovskite phase on the surface of three&#8208;dimensional perovskite nanograins is responsible for surface defects passivation, which leads to significantly enhanced device performance. Our results provide new fundamental insights into the role of organic molecular passivators in boosting the performance of PeLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoscale Hybrid Amorphous/Graphitic Carbon as Key Towards Next&#8208;Generation Carbon&#8208;Based Oxidative Dehydrogenation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous/graphitic hybrid material is synthesized by growing nanoscale graphite crystallites in a non&#8208;nano polymer&#8208;derived carbon by catalytic graphitization. An active dehydrogenation catalyst is obtained by creating accessibility to these graphitic domains via selective oxidation. This carbon dehydrogenation catalyst offers a 10&#8208;fold increase in space&#8208;time&#8208;yield in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol compared to a carbon nanotube benchmark.







Abstract
A new strategy affords &#8220;non&#8208;nano&#8221; carbon materials as dehydrogenation catalysts that perform similarly to nanocarbons. Polymer&#8208;based carbon precursors that combine a soft&#8208;template approach with ion adsorption and catalytic graphitization are key to this synthesis strategy, thus offering control over macroscopic shape, texture, and crystallinity and resulting in a hybrid amorphous/graphitic carbon after pyrolysis. From this intermediate the active carbon catalyst is prepared by removing the amorphous parts of the hybrid carbon materials via selective oxidation. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethanol was chosen as test reaction, which shows that fine&#8208;tuning the synthesis of the new carbon catalysts allows to obtain a catalytic material with an attractive high selectivity (82&#8201;%) similar to a carbon nanotube reference, while achieving 10&#8197;times higher space&#8211;time yields at 330&#8201;&#176;C. This new class of carbon materials is accessible via a technically scalable, reproducible synthetic pathway and exhibits spherical particles with diameters around 100&#8197;&#956;m, allowing unproblematic handling similar to classic non&#8208;nano catalysts.

         <title>Synthetic DNA for Cell&#8208;Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods for using DNA to engineer cell surfaces on both a monovalent and polyvalent scale are introduced in this Minireview. The application of these methods for either the promotion or inhibition of cell&#8211;environment communication in different settings is also described.







Abstract
The cell membrane is not only a physical barrier, but also a functional organelle that regulates the communication between a cell and its environment. The ability to functionalize the cell membrane with synthetic molecules or nanostructures would advance cellular functions beyond what evolution has provided. The aim of this Minireview is to introduce recent progress in using synthetic DNA and DNA&#8208;based nanostructures for cell&#8208;surface engineering. We first introduce chemical conjugation and physical binding methods for monovalent and polyvalent surface engineering. We then introduce the application of these methods for either the promotion or inhibition of cell&#8211;environment communication in numerous applications, including the promotion of cell&#8211;cell recognition, regulation of intracellular pathways, protection of therapeutic cells, and sensing of the intracellular and extracellular microenvironments. Lastly, we summarize current challenges existing in this area and potential solutions to solve these challenges.

         <title>Alloying Nickel with Molybdenum Significantly Accelerates Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni4Mo alloy nanoparticles were prepared from the reduction of molybdate&#8208;intercalated Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. They exhibited the highest mass activity among all non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the hydrogen&#8208;oxidation reaction in our best knowledge as well as a superb hydrogen&#8208;evolution&#8208;reaction performance in alkaline solution.







Abstract
Bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysis (hydrogen&#8208;oxidation and hydrogen&#8208;evolution reactions) in alkaline solution is desirable but challenging. Among all available electrocatalysts, Ni&#8208;based materials are the only non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based candidates for alkaline hydrogen oxidation, but they generally suffer from low activity. Here, we demonstrate that properly alloying Ni with Mo could significantly promote its electrocatalytic performance. Ni4Mo alloy nanoparticles are prepared from the reduction of molybdate&#8208;intercalated Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. The final product exhibits an apparent hydrogen&#8208;oxidation activity exceeding that of the Pt benchmark and a record&#8208;high mass&#8208;specific kinetic current of 79&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 50&#8197;mV. A superior hydrogen&#8208;evolution performance is also measured in alkaline solution. These experimental data are rationalized by our theoretical simulations, which show that alloying Ni with Mo significantly weakens its hydrogen adsorption, improves the hydroxyl adsorption and decreases the reaction barrier for water formation.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Large&#8208;Scale Membrane Transformations Driven by MinDE Biochemical Reaction Cycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We are demonstrating a new model membrane system, flat vesicles on top of a supported lipid bilayer. By reconstituting a paradigmatic biological pattern&#8208;forming system, ATP&#8208;dissipating MinDE proteins, dynamic &#8220;breathing&#8221; deformations of the soft membrane vesicles and progressive membrane spreading are achieved, confirming that under this specific condition, MinDE reaction cycles can result in work performed on the biological membrane.







Abstract
The MinDE proteins from E.&#8197;coli have received great attention as a paradigmatic biological pattern&#8208;forming system. Recently, it has surfaced that these proteins do not only generate oscillating concentration gradients driven by ATP hydrolysis, but that they can reversibly deform giant vesicles. In order to explore the potential of Min proteins to actually perform mechanical work, we introduce a new model membrane system, flat vesicle stacks on top of a supported lipid bilayer. MinDE oscillations can repeatedly deform these flat vesicles into tubules and promote progressive membrane spreading through membrane adhesion. Dependent on membrane and buffer compositions, Min oscillations further induce robust bud formation. Altogether, we demonstrate that under specific conditions, MinDE self&#8208;organization can result in work performed on biomimetic systems and achieve a straightforward mechanochemical coupling between the MinDE biochemical reaction cycle and membrane transformation.

By reconstituting a paradigmatic biological pattern&#8208;forming system, ATP&#8208;dissipating MinDE proteins, dynamic &#8220;breathing&#8221; deformations of the soft membrane vesicles and progressive membrane spreading are achieved, confirming that under this specific condition, MinDE reaction cycles can result in work performed on the biological membrane.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MinDE proteins from &lt;i&gt;E.&#8197;coli&lt;/i&gt; have received great attention as a paradigmatic biological pattern&#8208;forming system. Recently, it has surfaced that these proteins do not only generate oscillating concentration gradients driven by ATP hydrolysis, but that they can reversibly deform giant vesicles. In order to explore the potential of Min proteins to actually perform mechanical work, we introduce a new model membrane system, flat vesicle stacks on top of a supported lipid bilayer. MinDE oscillations can repeatedly deform these flat vesicles into tubules and promote progressive membrane spreading through membrane adhesion. Dependent on membrane and buffer compositions, Min oscillations further induce robust bud formation. Altogether, we demonstrate that under specific conditions, MinDE self&#8208;organization can result in work performed on biomimetic systems and achieve a straightforward mechanochemical coupling between the MinDE biochemical reaction cycle and membrane transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Aluminosilicate Zeolite Containing Rings of Tetrahedral Atoms with All Odd Numbers from Five to Eleven</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PST&#8208;31, a novel aluminosilicate zeolite with all odd&#8208;membered rings from five to eleven, has been synthesized in hydroxide media. The proton form of PST&#8208;31 was found to be selective for the cracking of n&#8208;hexane to light olefins.







Abstract
Herein we report the synthesis, structure solution, and catalytic properties of PST&#8208;31, which has an unprecedented framework topology. This high&#8208;silica (Si/Al=16) zeolite was synthesized using a pyrazolium&#8208;based dication with a tetramethylene linker as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) in hydroxide media. The PST&#8208;31 structure is built from new building layers containing four&#8208;, five&#8208;, six&#8208;, and seven&#8208;membered rings, which are connected by single four&#8208;membered rings in the interlayer region to form a two&#8208;dimensional pore system. Its channels consist of [4.56.6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] cavities and are thus delimited by nine&#8208;, ten&#8208;, and eleven&#8208;membered rings. The OSDA cations in as&#8208;synthesized PST&#8208;31 were determined to reside without disorder in the large [42.514.64.72.94] cavities composed of smaller [4.56.6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] ones, leading to a symmetry coincidence between the OSDA and the surrounding zeolite cavity. The proton form of PST&#8208;31 was found to be selective for the cracking of n&#8208;hexane to light olefins.

         <title>Carboranealkynyl&#8208;Protected Gold Nanoclusters: Size Conversion and UV/Vis&#8211;NIR Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carboranealkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanocluster Au28 possessing an open&#8208;shell electronic structure with 13 valence electrons was isolated through a facile self&#8208;reduction method in which it undergoes a complete transformation in methanol into a smaller&#8208;sized cluster Au23 bearing 12 valence electrons and crystal&#8208;field&#8208;like split superatomic 1D orbitals. Au28 and Au23 both display optical absorption covering the UV/Vis&#8211;NIR range and NIR emission.







Abstract
Structure evolution has become an effective way to assemble novel monolayer&#8208;protected metal nanomolecules. However, evolution with alkynyl&#8208;stabilized metal clusters still remains rarely explored. Herein, we present a carboranealkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanocluster [Au28(C4B10H11)12(tht)8]3+ (Au28, tht=tetrahydrothiophene) possessing an open&#8208;shell electronic structure with 13 free electrons, which was isolated by a facile self&#8208;reduction method with 9&#8208;HC&#8801;C&#8208;closo&#8208;1,2&#8208;C2B10H11 as the two&#8208;in&#8208;one reducing and protecting agent. Notably, Au28 undergoes a complete transformation in methanol into a stable and smaller&#8208;sized nanocluster [Au23(C4B10H11)9(tht)6]2+ (Au23) bearing 12 valence electrons and crystal&#8208;field&#8208;like split superatomic 1D orbitals. The transformation process was systematically monitored with ESI&#8208;MS and UV/Vis absorption spectra. Au28 and Au23 both display optical absorption covering the UV/Vis&#8211;NIR range and NIR emission, which facilitates their potential application in the biomedical and photocatalytic fields.

         <title>Efficient Amination of Activated and Non&#8208;Activated C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds with a Simple Iron&#8211;Phenanthroline Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A readily available catalytic system composed of iron(II) chloride and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline is widely applicable for the ring&#8208;closing C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;benzoyloxyurea. High yields are provided both for activated and completely non&#8208;activated C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
A readily available catalyst consisting of iron dichloride in combination with 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline catalyzes the ring&#8208;closing C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;benzoyloxyurea to form imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ones in high yields. The C&#8722;H amination reaction is very general and applicable to benzylic, allylic, propargylic, and completely non&#8208;activated aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds, and it also works for C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds. The surprisingly simple method can be performed under open flask conditions.

         <title>At Long Last: The Me3Si Group as a Masked Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For a long time, the Me3Si group has been ostracized from the family of aryl&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;substituted congeners for the difficulties associated with its further chemoselective manipulation into another synthetically useful functional group. A hypervalent iodine reagent has now been shown to do exactly that by electrophilic demethylation. Coupled with the Tamao&#8211;Fleming oxidation, the Me3Si group becomes a placeholder for a hydroxy group.

         <title>Experimental and theoretical evidence for promotional effect of acid sites on the diffusion of alkenes through small&#8208;pore zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diffusion of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons is of fundamental importance for many zeolite&#8208;catalyzed processes. Transport of small alkenes in the confined pores of narrow pore zeolites can become hindered, resulting in a significant impact on the ultimate product selectivity and separation. Herein, intracrystalline light olefin/paraffin diffusion through the 8&#8208;ring windows of zeolite SAPO&#8208;34 is characterized by a complementary set of first&#8208;principle molecular dynamics simulations, PFG&#8208;NMR experiments and pulse&#8208;response Temporal Analysis of Products measurements, yielding information at different length and time scales. Our results clearly show a promotional effect of the presence of Br&#248;nsted acid sites on the diffusion rate of ethene and propene, whereas transport of alkanes is found to be insensitive to the presence of acid sites. The enhanced diffusivity of unsaturated hydrocarbons is ascribed to the formation of favorable &#960;&#8208;H interactions with acid protons, as confirmed by IR spectroscopy measurements. The acid site distribution is proven to be an important design parameter for optimizing product distributions and separations.</dc:description>

         <title>The atypical hysteresis of [Fe(C6F5Tp)2]: Interplay between spin&#8208;crossovers and symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [Fe  II  (C  6  F  5  Tp)  2  ] spin&#8208;crossover complex is an atypical molecular switch, which can be converted upon annealing between two archetypal spin&#8208;crossover behaviors: from an extremely gradual spin&#8208;crossover to a broad hysteretic spin&#8208;transition (of  ca  . 65 K). The hysteresis shows an uncommon &#8220;rounded shape&#8221; that is reproducible upon cycling temperature. In depth structural studies reveal a first crystal phase transition, which occurs upon melting and recrystallizing at high temperature. This first irreversible transition is associated to a radical change in the crystal packing. More importantly, the &#8220;rounded and broad&#8221; hysteretic transition is shown to occurs in a non&#8208;cooperative SCO system and is associated to the occurrence of a symmetry&#8208;breaking phase transition that appears when roughly  ca  . 50% of SCO are switched.</dc:description>

         <title>Delicate Control on the Shell Structure of Hollow Spheres Enables Tunable Mass Transport in Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the study on structure&#8208;property relationship for rational material design, hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) have attracted tremendous attention owing to the optimal balance between mass transfer and surface exposure. Considering the shells structure can significantly affect the properties of HoMSs, in this paper, we provide a novel one&#8208;step strategy to continually regulate the shell structures of HoMSs. Through a simple phosphorization process, we can effectively modify the shell from solid to bubble&#8208;like and even to duplicate the shells with a narrow spacing. Benefitting from the structure merits, the fabricated CoP HoMSs with close duplicated shells can promote the gas releasing owing to the unbalanced Laplace pressure, while accelerating liquid transfer for the enhanced capillary force. It can provide effectively channels for water and gas and thus exhibit the superior electrocatalytic performance in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Benzyl Trifluoroborate and Organic Halides**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;neutral electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling method is developed using bench&#8208;stable substrates and Ni catalysts. The Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical cross&#8208;coupling exhibits good reaction efficiency, has practical applications, and expands the synthetic toolbox to forge carbon&#8211;carbon bonds.







Abstract
Reported here is the redox neutral electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling reaction of bench&#8208;stable aryl halides or &#946;&#8208;bromostyrene (electrophiles) and benzylic trifluoroborates (nucleophiles) using nonprecious, bench&#8208;stable NiCl2&#8901;glyme/polypyridine catalysts in an undivided cell configuration under ambient conditions. The broad reaction scope and good yields of the Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical coupling reactions were confirmed by 50 examples of aryl/&#946;&#8208;styrenyl chloride/bromide and benzylic trifluoroborates. Potential applications were demonstrated by electrosynthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals and natural amino acid modification, and three reactions were run on gram&#8208;scale in a flow&#8208;cell electrolyzer. The electrochemical C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions proceed through an unconventional radical transmetalation mechanism. This method is highly productive and expected to find wide&#8208;spread applications in organic synthesis.

         <title>Phosphinylation of Non&#8208;activated Aryl Fluorides through Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution at the Boundary of Concerted and Stepwise Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both electron&#8208;neutral and electron&#8208;rich non&#8208;activated aryl fluorides reacted with potassium diorganophosphinites through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reaction. Even substantially stabilized anionic P&#8197;nucleophiles reacted to form the corresponding tertiary phosphine oxides. Quantum chemical calculations suggested a nucleophile&#8208;dependent mechanism involving both concerted and stepwise SNAr reaction pathways (see scheme).

         <title>NIR&#8208;II pH Sensor with a FRET Adjustable Transition Point for In Situ Dynamic Tumor Microenvironment Visualization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adjustable pH transition point sensor is reported. It functions by regulating the FRET donor&#8208;acceptor ratio for dynamic pH visualization of a tumor through NIR&#8208;II ratiometric fluorescence imaging.







Abstract
Monitoring the pH in tumor lesions provides abundant physiological information. However, currently developed pH sensors only achieve sensitive detection in the settled response region around the pH transition point (pHt). To realize tumor pH monitoring with high sensitivity within a wider response region, reported here are serial pHt adjustable sensors (pTAS) that simply regulate the component ratio of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission aza&#8208;BODIPY (NAB) donor and pH sensitive rhodamine&#8208;based pre&#8208;acceptor (NRh) in F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer system. Combining the pH response regions of pTAS, a twofold widened pH detection range (6.11&#8211;7.22) is obtained compared to the pHt settled sensor (6.38&#8211;6.94). With an adjustable pHt, in vivo tumor pH increase and decrease processes could be dynamically visualized through dual&#8208;channel ratiometric bioimaging within the NIR&#8208;II window, with a coefficient of variation under 1&#8201;% compared to the standard pH meter.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Organoboron Helically Chiral Compounds: Cutouts from Extended Helices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Configurationally stable and flexible organoboron helicenes consisting of either all&#8208;ortho&#8208;fused or a combination of angularly and linearly fused rings were synthesized by a modular approach from small achiral building blocks. A concept towards extended organoboron helices comprising both types of helically chiral compounds as primary substructures is presented.







Abstract
Two types of helically chiral compounds bearing one and two boron atoms were synthesized by a modular approach. Formation of the helical scaffolds was executed by the introduction of boron to flexible biaryl and triaryl derived from small achiral building blocks. All&#8208;ortho&#8208;fused azabora[7]helicenes feature exceptional configurational stability, blue or green fluorescence with quantum yields (&#934;fl) of 18&#8211;24&#8201;% in solution, green or yellow solid&#8208;state emission (&#934;fl up to 23&#8201;%), and strong chiroptical response with large dissymmetry factors of up to 1.12&#215;10&#8722;2. Azabora[9]helicenes consisting of angularly and linearly fused rings are blue emitters exhibiting &#934;fl of up to 47&#8201;% in CH2Cl2 and 25&#8201;% in the solid state. As revealed by the DFT calculations, their P&#8211;M interconversion pathway is more complex than that of H1. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis shows clear differences in the packing arrangement of methyl and phenyl derivatives. These molecules are proposed as primary structures of extended helices.

Formation of the helical scaffolds was executed by the introduction of boron to flexible biaryl and triaryl derived from small achiral building blocks. All&#8208;ortho&#8208;fused azabora[7]helicenes feature exceptional configurational stability, blue or green fluorescence with quantum yields (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;fl&lt;/sub&gt;) of 18&#8211;24&#8201;% in solution, green or yellow solid&#8208;state emission (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;fl&lt;/sub&gt; up to 23&#8201;%), and strong chiroptical response with large dissymmetry factors of up to 1.12&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Azabora[9]helicenes consisting of angularly and linearly fused rings are blue emitters exhibiting &lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;fl&lt;/sub&gt; of up to 47&#8201;% in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 25&#8201;% in the solid state. As revealed by the DFT calculations, their P&#8211;M interconversion pathway is more complex than that of &lt;b&gt;H1&lt;/b&gt;. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis shows clear differences in the packing arrangement of methyl and phenyl derivatives. These molecules are proposed as primary structures of extended helices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>[Mo3S13]2&#8722; as a Model System for Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis by MoSx: Probing Protonation Sites in the Gas Phase by Infrared Multiple Photon Dissociation Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cluster compound [Mo3S13]2&#8722; is an interesting model system for hydrogen evolution catalysis. Herein, we probe the protonation site of the cluster by coupling mass spectrometry with infrared action spectroscopy. One distinct band at 2450&#8197;cm&#8722;1 together with DFT calculations and IRMPD kinetics reveals the nature of this S&#8722;H stretching vibration.







Abstract
Materials based on molybdenum sulfide are known as efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. As the binding site for H atoms on molybdenum sulfides for the catalytic process is under debate, [HMo3S13]&#8722; is an interesting molecular model system to address this question. Herein, we probe the [HMo3S13]&#8722; cluster in the gas phase by coupling Fourier&#8208;transform ion&#8208;cyclotron&#8208;resonance mass spectrometry (FT&#8208;ICR MS) with infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy. Our investigations show one distinct S&#8722;H stretching vibration at 2450&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Thermochemical arguments based on DFT calculations strongly suggest a terminal disulfide unit as the H adsorption site.

         <title>Simultaneous Dual&#8208;Gene Diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Based on CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;Mediated Lateral Flow Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;line lateral flow assay was developed and combined with multiplex reverse transcription&#8208;recombinase polymerase amplification (RT&#8208;RPA) for simultaneous dual&#8208;gene diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. With this platform, the cell&#8208;cultured SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viral RNA standards, and nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples could be sensitively and specifically detected.







Abstract
Few methods for the detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 currently have the capability to simultaneously detect two genes in a single test, which is a key measure to improve detection accuracy, as adopted by the gold standard RT&#8208;qPCR method. Developed here is a CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;line lateral flow assay (TL&#8208;LFA) combined with multiplex reverse transcription&#8208;recombinase polymerase amplification (RT&#8208;RPA) for rapid and simultaneous dual&#8208;gene detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in a single strip test. This assay is characterized by the detection of envelope (E) and open reading frame 1ab (Orf1ab) genes from cell&#8208;cultured SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viral RNA standards, showing a sensitivity of 100 RNA copies per reaction (25&#8197;&#956;L). Furthermore, dual&#8208;gene analysis of 64 nasopharyngeal swab samples showed 100&#8201;% negative predictive agreement and 97.14&#8201;% positive predictive agreement. This platform will provide a more accurate and convenient pathway for diagnosis of COVID&#8208;19 or other infectious diseases in low&#8208;resource regions.

         <title>Docking of CuI and AgI in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Adsorption and Separation of Xenon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pairs of uncoordinated N&#8197;atoms on adjacent pyrazole dicarboxylate linkers distributed along the rod&#8208;shaped Al&#8211;O secondary building units of a MOF were used to chelate CuI and AgI with atomic precision (see picture). The resulting metalated MOFs showed pore sizes matching the size of Xe, thus enabling the binding of Xe from Xe/Kr mixtures with high capacity and selectivity.







Abstract
We present a metal docking strategy utilizing the precise spatial arrangement of organic struts as metal chelating sites in a MOF. Pairs of uncoordinated N&#8197;atoms on adjacent pyrazole dicarboxylate linkers distributed along the rod&#8208;shaped Al&#8211;O secondary building units in MOF&#8208;303 [Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2)] were used to chelate CuI and AgI with atomic precision and yield the metalated Cu&#8208; and Ag&#8208;MOF&#8208;303 compounds [(CuCl)0.50Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2) and (AgNO3)0.49Al(OH)(C5H2O4N2)]. The coordination geometries of CuI and AgI were examined using 3D electron diffraction and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy techniques. The resulting metalated MOFs showed pore sizes matching the size of Xe, thus allowing for binding of Xe from Xe/Kr mixtures with high capacity and selectivity. In particular, Ag&#8208;MOF&#8208;303 exhibited Xe uptake of 59&#8197;cm3&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 298&#8197;K and 0.2&#8197;bar with a selectivity of 10.4, placing it among the highest performing MOFs.

         <title>Novel Series of Mononuclear Aluminum Complexes for High&#8208;Performance Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 79&#8201;% with a short delayed fluorescence lifetime of approximately 4&#8197;&#956;s in the solid state is possible with a novel series of mononuclear aluminum complexes. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting devices based on these Al complexes achieve a high external quantum efficiency of 17.5&#8201;% at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Light metal complexes, such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), and aluminum (Al) complexes, are attractive candidates for the fabrication of thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials. Nevertheless, mononuclear Al complexes with delayed fluorescence have not been developed so far. In this study, we successfully developed a novel series of highly luminescent Al complexes with two phenylacridine&#8208;modified asymmetric acetylacetonate&#8208;type ligands. These complexes exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 79&#8201;% in the solid state with a short delayed fluorescence lifetime of approximately 4&#8197;&#956;s. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) using these Al complexes exhibit excellent performance with an external quantum efficiency of 17.5&#8201;% at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This is the best performance in light metal&#8208;based TADF OLEDs reported so far. The results are expected to guide the advancement of the next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lighting technology.

         <title>&#8220;Excess&#8221; electrons in LuGe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The germanium monogermanide is prepared by high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature synthesis. Chemical bonding in LuGe is described as covalently bonded zigzag chains of Ge atoms with the counterpart Lu4 polycations formed using excess electrons in sense of the Zintl count Lu3+(2b)Ge2&#8722;&#215;1&#8201;e&#8722;. The homonuclear bonding in polycation in Lu4Ge4, which makes use of the electrons not required in the polyanion, resembles the situation in Ga2Se2.







Abstract
The monogermanide LuGe is obtained via high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature synthesis (5&#8211;15&#8197;GPa, 1023&#8211;1423&#8197;K). The crystal structure is solved from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data (structure type FeB, space group Pnma, a=7.660(2)&#8197;&#197;, b=3.875(1)&#8197;&#197;, and c=5.715(2)&#8197;&#197;, RF=0.036 for 206 symmetry independent reflections). The analysis of chemical bonding applying quantum&#8208;chemical techniques in position space was performed. It revealed&#8212;beside the expected 2c&#8208;Ge&#8208;Ge bonds in the germanium polyanion&#8212;rather unexpected four&#8208;atomic bonds between lutetium atoms indicating the formation of a polycation by the excess electrons in the system Lu3+(2b)Ge2&#8722;&#215;1&#8201;e&#8722;. Despite the reduced VEC of 3.5, lutetium monogermanide is following the extended 8&#8208;N rule with the trend to form lutetium&#8208;lutetium bonds utilizing the electrons left after satisfying the bonding needs in the anionic Ge&#8208;Ge zigzag chain.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Based Macrocyclic Arenes: Synthesis, Crystal Structures, and Light&#8208;Controlled Molecular Encapsulation and Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of azobenzene&#8208;based macrocyclic arenes 1, 2 and 3 is synthesized. Light&#8208;controlled molecular encapsulation and release are realized based on macrocycle 1.







Abstract
Azobenzene (azo)&#8208;based macrocycles are highly fascinating in supramolecular chemistry because of their light&#8208;responsiveness. In this work, a series of azo&#8208;based macrocyclic arenes 1, 2, 3, and 4, distinguished by the substituted positions of azo groups, is rationally designed and synthesized via a fragment&#8208;cyclization method. From the crystal and computed structures of 1, 2, and 3, we observe that the cavity size of these azo&#8208;macrocycles decreases gradually upon E&#8594;Z photoisomerization. Moreover, light&#8208;controlled host&#8211;guest complexations between azo&#8208;macrocycle 1 and guest molecules (7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane, terephthalonitrile) are successfully achieved. This work provides a simple and effective method to prepare azo&#8208;macrocycles, and the light&#8208;responsive molecular&#8208;encapsulation systems in this work may further advance the design and applications of novel photo&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest systems.

         <title>Titanium Germylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel titanium germylene phosphine and isocyanide complexes, Cp2Ti(L)=Ge[Si3(SiMetBu2)4] (L=Me3P and XylNC), were synthesized and fully characterized. On the basis of their structural characteristics and calculated atomic charges, both complexes are classified as the Schrock&#8208;type titanium germylidenes, as the germanium versions of the widely known titanium alkylidenes.







Abstract
Two novel 18&#8208;electron titanium germylene complexes, Cp2Ti(L)=Ge[Si3(SiMetBu2)4] 3&#8201;b (L=Me3P) and 3&#8201;c (L=XylNC), were synthesized, isolated, and structurally characterized. The length of the titanium&#8208;germanium bonds of 2.5387(3)&#8197;&#197; and 2.5276(3)&#8197;&#197; (in 3&#8201;b and 3&#8201;c, respectively) well match those expected for the double bond, which was further supported by the DFT study. Based on their structural characteristics, as well as their atomic charges calculations which revealed Ti(&#948;+)=Ge(&#948;&#8722;) bond polarization, both 3&#8201;b and 3&#8201;c are classified as the Schrock&#8208;type titanium germylidenes, as the germanium analogues of the widely known titanium alkylidenes. By contrast, germylene complexes of the group 6 metals 8&#8201;a (M=Mo) and 8&#8201;b (M=W) are better described as Fischer&#8208;type germylene complexes.

         <title>Furin&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly of Olsalazine Nanoparticles for Targeted Raman Imaging of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a furin&#8208;mediated CBT&#8208;Cys click condensation reaction followed by intracellular nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly, we report the development of a new furin&#8208;specific Raman reporter Olsa&#8208;RVRR and demonstrate its in&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo utility in tumor detection.







Abstract
Olsalazine (Olsa) is a broad&#8208;spectrum anti&#8208;cancer agent acting as a DNA&#8208;methylation inhibitor. When conjugated to 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;6&#8208;aminobenzothiazole and a peptide substrate specific for the tumor&#8208;overexpressed enzyme furin, it can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles that can be detected by chemical&#8208;exchange saturation&#8208;transfer magnetic&#8208;resonance imaging (CEST MRI). We report here that these nano&#8208;assemblies can also be detected with high specificity in furin&#8208;overexpressing tumor cells by Raman spectroscopy with a distinct scattering signature and demonstrate the utility of this sensing mechanism in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Our findings suggest that Raman spectroscopy could be used for high&#8208;resolution image&#8208;guided surgery to precisely delineate tumor margins during and after resection in real&#8208;time as well as to determine microscopic tumor invasion and multifocal locoregional tumor spread, which are currently impossible to visualize with available imaging technologies, including CEST MRI.

         <title>Operando Investigation of Ag&#8208;decorated Cu2O Nanocube Catalysts with enhanced CO2 Electroreduction toward Liquid Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct conversion of carbon dioxide into multicarbon liquid fuels by the CO  2  electrochemical reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) can contribute to the decarbonization of the global economy. Here, well&#8208;defined Cu  2  O nanocubes (NCs, 35 nm) uniformly covered with Ag nanoparticles (5 nm) were synthesized. When compared to bare Cu  2  O NCs, the catalyst with 5 at% Ag on Cu  2  O NCs displayed a two&#8208;fold increase in the Faradaic efficiency for C  2+  liquid products (30% at &#8208;1.0 V  RHE  ), including ethanol, 1&#8208;propanol, and acetaldehyde, while formate and hydrogen were suppressed.  Operando  X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the partial reduction of Cu  2  O during CO  2  RR, accompanied by a reaction&#8208;driven redispersion of Ag on the CuO  x  NCs.  Operando  surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy data further uncovered significant variations in the CO binding to Cu, which were assigned to Ag&#8208;Cu sites formed during CO  2  RR that appear crucial for the C&#8208;C coupling and the enhanced yield of liquid products.</dc:description>

Operando  X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the partial reduction of Cu  2  O during CO  2  RR, accompanied by a reaction&#8208;driven redispersion of Ag on the CuO  x  NCs.  Operando  surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy data further uncovered significant variations in the CO binding to Cu, which were assigned to Ag&#8208;Cu sites formed during CO  2  RR that appear crucial for the C&#8208;C coupling and the enhanced yield of liquid products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing physical oxidation state via resonant X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy: Applications to iron model complexes and nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of resonant X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy (XES) to recover physical oxidation state information, which may often be ambiguous in conventional X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, is demonstrated. By combining K&#946; XES with resonant excitation in the XAS pre&#8208;edge region, resonant K&#946; XES (or 1s3p RXES) data are obtained, which probe the 3dn+1 final state configuration. Comparison of the non&#8208;resonant and resonant XES for a series of high&#8208;spin ferrous and ferric complexes shows that oxidation state assignments that were previously unclear are now easily made. The present study spans iron tetrachlorides, iron sulfur clusters, and the MoFe protein of nitrogenase. While 1s3p RXES studies have previously been reported, to our knowledge, 1s3p RXES has not been previously utilized to resolve questions of metal valency in highly covalent systems. As such, the approach presented here provides chemists with means to more rigorously and quantitatively address challenging electronic structure questions.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Stable Generation of Reactive Intermediates by Open Microfluidic Probe for Subcellular Free Radical Attack and Membrane Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Subcellular stimulation by free radicals is crucial for deeper insight of cell behaviors. However, it remains a tough challenge due to the high spatial precision requirement and short life of radicals. Herein, we report a versatile open microfluidic probe for stable generation of free radical and subcellular stimulation. By optimizing parameters, the chemical reaction can be confined in a microregion with a diameter of several &#956;m, and the real&#8208;time produced reactive radicals can attack the desired subcellular region of a single cell. In order to reveal the attacked region, fluorescent cyanine 3 labeled tyramide free radicals are synthesized, and the target microregion on a single cell is successfully stained by the covalent linking reaction between radicals and membrane proteins, which proves the feasibility of our method. We believe this method will open new avenues for short&#8208;lived reactive intermediates stimulation at the single&#8208;cell/sub&#8208;cell level and selective membrane labeling.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleation and Growth Mechanism of Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has been widely employed to describe the new phase formed between anode and electrolyte in working batteries. Significant advances have been achieved on the structure and composition of SEI as well as on the possible ion transport mechanism. However, the nucleation and growth mechanism of SEI catches little attention, which requires the establishment of isothermal electrochemical crystallization theory. Herein we explore the virgin territory of electrochemically crystallized SEI. By using potentiostatic method to regulate the decomposition of anions, an anion&#8208;derived SEI forms on graphite surface at atomic scale. After fitting the cur&#8208;rent&#8208;time transients with Laviron theory and Avrami formula, we conclude that the formation of anion&#8208;derived interface is surface reaction controlled and obeys the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) progressive nucleation and growth model. Atomic force microscope (AFM) images emphasize the conclusion, which reveals the mystery of isothermal electrochemical crystallization of SEI.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Indole Dearomatization for Asymmetric Furoindoline Synthesis by a Flavin&#8208;Dependent Monooxygenase Involved in the Biosynthesis of Bicyclic Thiopeptide Thiostrepton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interest in indole dearomatization, which serves as a useful tool in the total synthesis of related alkaloid natural products, has recently been renewed with the intention of developing new methods efficient in both yield and stereoselective control. Here, we report an enzymatic approach for the oxidative dearomatization of indoles in the asymmetric synthesis of a variety of furoindolines with a vicinal quaternary carbon stereogenic center. This approach depends on the activity of a flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase, TsrE, which is involved in the biosynthesis of bicyclic thiopeptide antibiotic thiostrepton. TsrE catalyzes 2,3&#8208;epoxidation and subsequent epoxide opening in a highly enantioselective manner during the conversion of&#160;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;indole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid or 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;tryptophol to furoindoline ,&#160;with up to &gt; 99% conversion and &gt; 99%  ee  under mild reaction conditions. Complementing current chemical methods for oxidative indole dearomatization, the TsrE activity&#8208;based approach enriches the toolbox in the asymmetric synthesis of products possessing a furoindoline skeleton.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A robust 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;derived biological hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework (HOF&#8208;25) has been realized depending on guanine&#8208;quadruplex with the assistance of &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, which reacts with Re(CO)  5  Cl to give a post&#8208;functionalized HOF&#8208;25&#8208;Re.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalysed Hydroarylation of Highly&#8208;Substituted Styrenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroarylation is an effective strategy to rapidly increase the complexity of organic structures by transforming flat alkene moieties into three&#8208;dimensional frameworks. Many strategies have already been developed to achieve the hydroarylation of styrenes, however most of these reports examine the hydroarylation of unpolar, &#946;&#8208;mono&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;unsubstituted styrenes, while exploring mainly electron&#8208;rich benzene nucleophiles. Herein we report a mild and general catalytic system for the selective hydroheteroarylation of multiply substituted styrenes and heteroaromatic styrenes. Mechanistic analysis of the reaction led to the discovery of commercially available 2,2&#8217;:5&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;terthiophene as a key reagent.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying the likelihood of structural models through a dynamically enhanced powder X&#8208;ray diffraction protocol</title>

         <dc:description>Structurally characterizing new materials is tremendously challenging, especially when single crystal structures are hardly available which is often the case for covalent organic frameworks. Yet, knowledge of the atomic structure is key to establish structure&#8208;function relations and enable functional material design. Herein a new protocol is proposed to unambiguously predict the structure of poorly crystalline materials through a likelihood ordering based on the X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. Key of the procedure is the broad set of structures generated from a limited number of building blocks and topologies, which is submitted to operando structural characterization. The dynamic averaging in the latter accounts for the operando conditions and inherent temporal character of experimental measurements, yielding unparalleled agreement with experimental powder XRD patterns. The proposed concept can hence unquestionably identify the structure of experimentally synthesized materials, a crucial step to design next generation functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced concanavalin A binding to preorganized mannose nanoarrays in glycodendrimersomes revealed multivalent interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of the two&#8208;dimensional glycan display on glycan&#8208;lectin recognition remains poorly understood despite the importance of these interactions in a plethora of cellular processes, in (patho)physiology, as well as its potential for advanced therapeutics. Faced with this challenge we utilized glycodendrimersomes, a type of synthetic vesicles whose membrane mimics the surface of a cell and offers a means to probe the carbohydrate biological activity. These single&#8208;component vesicles were formed by the self&#8208;assembly of sequence&#8208;defined mannose&#8208;Janus dendrimers, which serve as surrogates for glycolipids. Using atomic force microscopy and molecular modeling we demonstrated that even mannose, a monosaccharide, was capable of organizing the sugar moieties into periodic nanoarrays without the need of the formation of liquid&#8208;ordered phases as assumed necessary for rafts. Kinetics studies of Concanavalin A binding revealed that those nanoarrays resulted in a new effective ligand yielding a ten&#8208;fold increase in the kinetic and thermodynamic constant of association.</dc:description>

         <title>Dually&#8208;Passivated Perovskite Solar Cells with Reduced Voltage Loss and Increased Super Oxide Resistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has witnessed rapid progress. Nevertheless, the pervasive defects prone to non&#8208;radiative recombination and decomposition exist at the surface and the grain boundaries (GBs) of the polycrystalline perovskite films. Herein, we report a comprehensive dual&#8208;passivation (DP) strategy to effectively passivate the defects at both surface and GBs to enhance device performance and stability further. Firstly, a fluorinated perylene&#8208;tetracarboxylic diimide derivative is permeated in the perovskite metaphase during antisolvent treatment, and then a fluorinated bulky aromatic ammonium salt is introduced over the annealed perovskite. The reduction of defect density can be unambiguously proved by the superoxide species generation/quenching reaction. As a result, optimized planar PSCs demonstrate a decreased open&#8208;circuit voltages deficit from 0.47 to 0.39 V and the best efficiency of 23.80% from photocurrent scanning with a stabilized maximum power output efficiency of 22.99%. Without encapsulation, one typical device can maintain over 85% of the initial efficiency after heating on a hot plate at 100 &#176;C for 30 h under relative humidity (RH) of 70%. When the device is aged under 30 &#177; 5% RH, over 97% of its initial PCE is retained after 1700 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Unveiling Metal&#8208;Nitrogen Coordination during Thermal Activation to Design High&#8208;Efficient Atomically Dispersed CoN4 Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed CoN  4  site catalysts are more desirable than FeN  4  site catalysts to enhance catalyst stability and mitigate Fenton reactions during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the lack of an understanding of CoN  x  active site formation during the critical thermal activation makes the rational catalyst design impossible. Here, we elucidate the structural evolution of CoN  4  sites during thermal activation by developing a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)&#8208;8&#8208;derived carbon host as an ideal model for Co  2+  ion adsorption. Subsequent  in&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis can dynamically track inactive Co&#8208;OH and Co&#8208;O species' conversion into active CoN  4  sites. The critical transition occurs at ~700&#176;C and becomes optimal at 900&#176;C, generating the highest intrinsic activity and four&#8208;electron selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate that the ORR is kinetically favored by the thermal&#8208;induced compressive strain of Co&#8208;N bonds in CoN  4  active sites formed at 900 &#176;C. Inspired by the new understanding, we developed a two&#8208;step chemical pre&#8208;doping and adsorption approach to designing a Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst with increased CoN  4  site density and optimized porosity for mass transport, and demonstrated outstanding proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell performance and durability.</dc:description>

         <title>Li&#8208;Rich Li2[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries can maximize the energy density at the cell level. However, without the Li compensation from the anode side, it faces much more challenging to achieve a long cycling life with a competitive energy density than Li metal&#8208;based batteries. Here, we prolong the lifespan of an anode&#8208;free Li metal battery by introducing Li&#8208;rich Li  2  [Ni  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  ]O  2  into the cathode as a Li&#8208;ions extender. The Li  2  [Ni  0.8  Co  0.1  Mn  0.1  ]O  2  can release a large amount of Li&#8208;ions during the first charging process to supplement the Li loss in the anode, then convert into NCM811, thus extending the lifespan of the battery without the introduction of inactive elements. By the benefit of Li&#8208;rich cathode and high reversibility of Li metal on Cu foil, the anode&#8208;free pouch cells enable to achieve 447&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg  &#8722;1  &#160;energy density and 84% capacity retention after 100 cycles&#160;in the condition of limited electrolyte addition (E/C ratio of 2 g&#8201;Ah  &#8722;1  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Intracellular Dynamics of Nitric Oxide and Hydrogen Sulfide Using an Activatable NIR II Fluorescence Reporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the complex interplay among gasotransmitters is of great significance but remains technically challenging. In this study, we present the design and synthesis of a dually responsive BOD&#8208;NH&#8208;SC reporter for probing the dynamic and alternating existence of NO and H  2  S in living cells. This designed reporter can repeatedly cycle S&#8208;nitrosation and transnitrosation reactions when successively treated with NO and H  2  S, thus affording the interchange of NIR fluorescence at 645 nm (NO) and NIR II fluorescence at 936 nm (H  2  S). In light of this unique fluorescence alternation between two colors, we synthesized water&#8208;soluble BOD&#8208;NH&#8208;SC dots to visualize the intracellular dynamics of NO and H  2  S. These molecular probes thus provide a toolbox to elucidate the interplaying roles of NO and H  2  S in the complex interaction networks of various signal transduction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical conversion and locking of the imine linkage: enhancing the functionality of covalent organic frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a widely studied class of functional, crystalline, and porous nanostructures which combine a relatively facile crystallization with tuneable compositions and porosities. However, the imine linkage constitutes an intrinsic limitation due to its reduced stability in harsh chemical conditions and its unsuitability for in&#8208;plane&#160; p &#8208;conjugation in COFs. Urgent solutions are therefore required in order to exploit the full potential of these materials, thereby enabling their technological application in (opto)electronics, sensing and energy storage devices. In this context, the advent of a new generation of linkages derived from the chemical conversion and locking of the imine bond represents a cornerstone for the synthesis of new COFs. A marked increase in the framework robustness is in fact often combined with the incorporation of novel functionalities including, for some of these reactions, an extension of the in&#8208;plane&#160; p &#8208;conjugation. This Minireview describes the most enlightening examples of one&#8208;pot reactions and post&#8208;synthetic modifications towards the chemical locking of the imine bond in COFs.</dc:description>

This Minireview describes the most enlightening examples of one&#8208;pot reactions and post&#8208;synthetic modifications towards the chemical locking of the imine bond in COFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inhibition of Mitochondrial ATP Synthesis and Regulation of Oxidative Stress Based on {SbW8O30} By Single&#8208;Cell Proteomics Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 10&#8208;nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {SbW  8  O  30  } was successfully synthesized and exhibited inhibitory activity(IC  50  =0.29&#956;M). Based on proteomics analysis, Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  inhibited ATP production by affecting the expression of 16 related proteins, hindering metabolic functions in vivo and cell proliferation due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress. In particular, the low expression of FAD/FMN&#8208;binding redox enzymes(relative expression ratio of the experimental group to the control=0.43843) could be attributed to the redox mechanism of Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  , which was consistent with the effect of polyoxometalates (POMs) and FMN&#8208;binding proteins on ATP formation. An electrochemical study showed that Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  combined with FMN to form Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  &#8208;2FMN complex through the one&#8208;electron processe of the W atoms. Na  4  Ni  2  Sb  2  W  2  &#8208;SbW  8  acted as catalase and glutathione peroxidase to protect the cell from ROS stress, and the inhibition rates were 63.3% at 1.77 &#181;M of NADPH and 86.06% at 10.62 &#181;M of 2&#8208;hydroxy terephthalic acid. Overall, our results showed that POMs could be specific oxidative/antioxidant regulatory agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Amino functionalised hybrid ultramicroporous materials that enable single&#8208;step ethylene purification from a ternary mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrazine&#8208;linked hybrid ultramicroporous (pore size &lt;7 &#197;) materials (HUMs) offer benchmark performance for trace carbon capture thanks to strong selectivity for CO2 over small gas molecules, including light hydrocarbons. That the prototypal pyrazine&#8208;linked HUMs are amenable to crystal engineering has enabled second generation HUMs to supersede the performance of the parent HUM, SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn, mainly through substitution of the metal and/or the inorganic pillar. Herein, we report that two isostructural aminopyrazine&#8208;linked HUMs, MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni (17 = aminopyrazine; M = Si, Ti), which we had anticipated would offer even stronger affinity for CO2 than their pyrazine analogs, unexpectedly exhibit reduced CO2 affinity but enhanced C2H2 affinity. MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni are consequently the first physisorbents that enable single&#8208;step production of polymer&#8208;grade (&gt;99.95% for SIFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni) ethylene from a ternary equimolar mixture of ethylene, acetylene and CO2 thanks to coadsorption of the latter two gases. We attribute this performance to the very different binding sites in MFSIX&#8208;17&#8208;Ni&#160;versus&#160;SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn.</dc:description>

         <title>Multimodal Imaging of Autofluorescent Sites Reveals Varied Chemical Speciation in SSZ&#8208;13 Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multimodal imaging study of chabazite is used to analyse emissive deposits. A notable difference is seen in the morphology of agglomerated surface deposits and larger subsurface deposits. Comparison of the distribution of organic residue throughout the crystal volume and XRF mapping is demonstrating that a fluorescence&#8208;based technique can also be used to indirectly comment on the compositional chemistry of the inorganic framework.







Abstract
A multimodal imaging study of chabazite is used to show the distribution of and discriminate between different emissive deposits arising as a result of the detemplation process. Confocal imaging, 3D fluorescence lifetime imaging, 3D multispectral fluorescence imaging, and Raman mapping are used to show three different types of emissive behaviours each characterised by different spatial distributions, trends in lifetime, spectral signals, and Raman signatures. A notable difference is seen in the morphology of agglomerated surface deposits and larger subsurface deposits, which experience lifetime augmentation due to spatial confinement. The distribution of organic residue throughout the crystal volume is comparable to XRF mapping that shows Si enrichment on the outer edges and higher Al content through the centre, demonstrating that a fluorescence&#8208;based technique can also be used to indirectly comment on the compositional chemistry of the inorganic framework.

         <title>Unlocking the Water Trimer Loop: Isotopic Study of Benzophenone&#8208;(H2O)1&#8211;3 Clusters with Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The subtle discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical structures of the Ph2CO&#8208;(H2O)3 complex has been unveiled. An open&#8208;looped structure, instead of the cyclic structure, of the water trimer moiety above one of the &#960; clouds was determined by rotational spectroscopy.







Abstract
Examined here are the structures of complexes of benzophenone microsolvated with up to three water molecules by using broadband rotational spectroscopy and the cold conditions of a molecular jet. The analysis shows that the water molecules dock sideways on benzophenone for the water monomer and dimer moieties, and they move above one of the aromatic rings when the water cluster grows to the trimer. The rotational spectra shows that the water trimer moiety in the complex adopts an open&#8208;loop arrangement. Ab initio calculations face a dilemma of identifying the global minimum between the open loop and the closed loop, which is only solved when zero&#8208;point vibrational energy correction is applied. An OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; bond and a B&#252;rgi&#8208;Dunitz interaction between benzophenone and the water trimer are present in the cluster. This work shows the subtle balance between water&#8211;water and water&#8211;solute interactions when the solute molecule offers several different anchor sites for water molecules.

         <title>Carboxylic Acid Reductase Can Catalyze Ester Synthesis in Aqueous Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and green method is presented for the synthesis of esters using carboxylic acid reductase as a biocatalyst under mild aqueous conditions.







Abstract
Most of the well&#8208;known enzymes catalyzing esterification require the minimization of water or activated substrates for activity. This work reports a new reaction catalyzed by carboxylic acid reductase (CAR), an enzyme known to transform a broad spectrum of carboxylic acids into aldehydes, with the use of ATP, Mg2+, and NADPH as co&#8208;substrates. When NADPH was replaced by a nucleophilic alcohol, CAR from Mycobacterium marinum can catalyze esterification under aqueous conditions at room temperature. Addition of imidazole, especially at pH&#8197;10.0, significantly enhanced ester production. In comparison to other esterification enzymes such as acyltransferase and lipase, CAR gave higher esterification yields in direct esterification under aqueous conditions. The scalability of CAR catalyzed esterification was demonstrated for the synthesis of cinoxate, an active ingredient in sunscreen. The CAR esterification offers a new method for green esterification under high water content conditions.

[3,3]&#8208;Sigmatropic rearrangement of aryl sulfoxides with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles has been developed by merging the Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman reaction into the S(IV)&#8208;mediated [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement process. The method enables the remarkable Z&#8208;selective synthesis of a wide variety of valuable &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles that can be challenging to obtain by traditional synthetic methods.







Abstract
The Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8211;Hillman (MBH) reaction and [3, 3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement are two paradigms in organic synthesis. We have merged the two types of reactions to achieve [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement of aryl sulfoxides with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles. The reaction was achieved by sequentially treating both coupling partners with electrophilic activator (Tf2O) and base, offering an effective approach to prepare synthetically versatile &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles with Z&#8208;selectivity through direct &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H arylation of unmodified &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitriles. The control experiments and DFT calculations support a four&#8208;stage reaction sequence, including the assembly of Tf2O activated aryl sulfoxide with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated nitrile, MBH&#8208;like Lewis base addition, [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement, and E1cB&#8208;elimination. Among these stages, the Lewis base addition is diastereoselective and E1cB&#8208;elimination is cis&#8208;selective, which could account for the remarkable Z&#8208;selectivity of the reaction.

         <title>Engineered Coatings via the Assembly of Amino&#8208;Quinone Networks</title>

Coatings and thin films of amino&#8208;quinone networks are prepared on various materials by a co&#8208;assembly strategy using quinones and polyamines. Using different building blocks affords precise control over the structures and properties of the coatings, which can serve as multifunctional reaction platforms to synthesize nanoparticles on surfaces.







Abstract
Engineering coatings with precise physicochemical properties allows for control over the interface of a material and its interactions with the surrounding environment. However, assembling coatings with well&#8208;defined properties on different material classes remains a challenge. Herein, we report a co&#8208;assembly strategy to precisely control the structure and properties (e.g., thickness, adhesion, wettability, and zeta potential) of coatings on various materials (27&#8197;substrates examined) using quinone and polyamine building blocks. By increasing the length of the amine building blocks from small molecule diamines to branched amine polymers, we tune the properties of the films, including the thickness (from ca. 5 to ca. 50&#8197;nm), interfacial adhesion (0.05 to 5.54&#8197;nN), water contact angle (130 to 40&#176;), and zeta potential (&#8722;42 to 28&#8197;mV). The films can be post&#8208;functionalized through the in&#8197;situ formation of diverse nanostructures, including nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanocrystals. Our approach provides a platform for the rational design of engineered, substrate&#8208;independent coatings for various applications.

Strain engineering of Mxene/carbon nanotube microspheres as electrocatalyst for Li&#8208;S batteries is used to realize high&#8208;efficiency LiPS catalytic conversion.







Abstract
Tensile&#8208;strained Mxene/carbon nanotube (CNT) porous microspheres were developed as an electrocatalyst for the lithium polysulfide (LiPS) redox reaction. The internal stress on the surface results in lattice distortion with expanding Ti&#8722;Ti bonds, endowing the Mxene nanosheet with abundant active sites and regulating the d&#8208;band center of Ti atoms upshifted closer to the Fermi level, leading to strengthened LiPS adsorbability and accelerated catalytic conversion. The macroporous framework offers uniformed sulfur distribution, potent sulfur immobilization, and large surface area. The composite interwoven by CNT tentacle enhances conductivity and prevents the restacking of Mxene sheets. This combination of tensile strain effect and hierarchical architecture design results in smooth and favorable trapping&#8211;diffusion&#8211;conversion of LiPS on the interface. The Li&#8208;S battery exhibits an initial capacity of 1451&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C, rate capability up to 8&#8197;C, and prolonged cycle life.

A new PIII Lewis superacid with an ancillary molybdenum carbonyl fragment reacts with Et3SiH to give a P&#8208;H stabilized silylium ion that participates in catalytic hydrosilylation.







Abstract
The Mo=PR2 &#960;* orbital in a Mo phosphenium complex acts as acceptor in a new PIII&#8208;based Lewis superacid. This Lewis acid (LA) participates in electrophilic Si&#8208;H abstraction from E3SiH to give a Mo&#8208;bound secondary phosphine ligand, Mo&#8208;PR2H. The resulting Et3Si+ ion remains associated with the Mo complex, stabilized by &#951;1&#8208;P&#8208;H donation, yet undergoes rapid exchange with an &#951;1&#8208;Si&#8208;H adduct of free silane in solution. The equilibrium between these two adducts presents an opportunity to assess the role of this new LA in catalytic reactions of silanes: is the LA acting as a catalyst or as an initiator? Preliminary results suggest that a cycle including the Mo&#8208;bound phosphine&#8208;silylium adduct dominates in the catalytic hydrosilylation of acetophenone, relative to a putative cycle involving the silane&#8208;silylium adduct or &#8220;free&#8221; silylium.

         <title>Radical Carbonyl Propargylation by Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2464-2471, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the radical three&#8208;component carbonyl propargylation between 1,3&#8208;enynes, aldehydes, and suitable radical precursors through dual chromium/photoredox catalysis is reported for the first time. This redox&#8208;neutral reaction occurs under very mild conditions, shows high functional group tolerance and represents a complementary novel approach for preparing valuable synthetic architectures from simple chemicals.







Abstract
Carbonyl propargylation has been established as a valuable tool in the realm of carbon&#8211;carbon bond forming reactions. The 1,3&#8208;enyne moiety has been recognized as an alternative pronucleophile in the above transformation through an ionic mechanism. Herein, we report for the first time, the radical carbonyl propargylation through dual chromium/photoredox catalysis. A library of valuable homopropargylic alcohols bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers could be obtained by a catalytic radical three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;enynes, aldehydes and suitable radical precursors (41 examples). This redox&#8208;neutral multi&#8208;component reaction occurs under very mild conditions and shows high functional group tolerance. Remarkably, bench&#8208;stable, non&#8208;toxic, and inexpensive CrCl3 could be employed as a chromium source. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism, which offers a complementary and novel approach towards the preparation of valuable synthetic architectures from simple chemicals.

Remarkably, bench&#8208;stable, non&#8208;toxic, and inexpensive CrCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; could be employed as a chromium source. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest a radical&#8208;polar crossover mechanism, which offers a complementary and novel approach towards the preparation of valuable synthetic architectures from simple chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Breaking Platinum Nanoparticles to Single&#8208;Atomic Pt&#8208;C4 Co&#8208;catalysts for Enhanced Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
The single site of Pt&#8208;C4 in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Pt1&#8208;CN) is reported by a high&#8208;temperature calcination process. It features fast carrier migration with low resistance across the catalyst&#8211;solution interface. Benefiting from above merits and the tight contact between CuS semiconductor and Pt1&#8208;CN, the Pt1&#8208;CN@CuS gives a photocatalytic H2 generation rate of 25.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 with an AQY of 50.3&#8201;% under the illumination of LED&#8208;530.







Abstract
Effective transfer and utilization of the photogenerated electrons are a key factor for achieving highly efficient H2 generation by photocatalytic water splitting. Apart from the activity of the co&#8208;catalyst, the interface between the co&#8208;catalyst and semiconductor is of particular importance. Guided by DFT calculations, single&#8208;atom (SA) Pt doped carbon nitride (CN) is successfully synthesized for use as the co&#8208;catalyst to the semiconducting CuS. The catalyst system (Pt1&#8208;CN@CuS) exhibits an enhanced photocatalytic performance for water splitting with a H2 production rate of 25.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 50.3&#8201;% under the illumination of LED&#8208;530. Solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency is calculated to be 0.5&#8201;% under AM&#8197;1.5 illumination. This is the very first investigation of SA as the co&#8208;catalyst, which decreases the overpotential of CN during the water splitting and lowers interfacial resistance of the catalyst/co&#8208;catalyst and co&#8208;catalyst/electrolyte.

         <title>Activation of the G&#8208;Protein&#8208;Coupled Receptor Rhodopsin by Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2288-2295, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water molecules flood the protein core of visual rhodopsin to form a solvent&#8208;swollen active state upon light absorption. Binding of a peptide analogue of transducin is coupled to hydration changes in catalytic activation of the G&#8208;protein. The soft membrane matter comprises lipids and water, which interact with rhodopsin in the signaling mechanism to control visual function.







Abstract
Visual rhodopsin is an important archetype for G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors, which are membrane proteins implicated in cellular signal transduction. Herein, we show experimentally that approximately 80 water molecules flood rhodopsin upon light absorption to form a solvent&#8208;swollen active state. An influx of mobile water is necessary for activating the photoreceptor, and this finding is supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Combined force&#8208;based measurements involving osmotic and hydrostatic pressure indicate the expansion occurs by changes in cavity volumes, together with greater hydration in the active metarhodopsin&#8208;II state. Moreover, we discovered that binding and release of the C&#8208;terminal helix of transducin is coupled to hydration changes as may occur in visual signal amplification. Hydration&#8211;dehydration explains signaling by a dynamic allosteric mechanism, in which the soft membrane matter (lipids and water) has a pivotal role in the catalytic G&#8208;protein cycle.

         <title>Managing Locally Excited and Charge&#8208;Transfer Triplet States to Facilitate Up&#8208;Conversion in Red TADF Emitters That Are Available for Both Vacuum&#8208; and Solution&#8208;Processes</title>

By introducing phenyl or o&#8208;tolyl groups into different positions of the same acceptor backbone, the lowest triplet energy levels of red thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters can be tuned from locally excited triplet (3LEA) to charge transfer triplet (3CT) states, resulting in enhancement of the rates of reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), and boosting efficiencies in both vacuum&#8208; and solution&#8208;processed OLEDs.







Abstract
Developing red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters for high&#8208;performance OLEDs is still facing great challenge. Herein, three red TADF emitters, pDBBPZ&#8208;DPXZ, pDTBPZ&#8208;DPXZ, and oDTBPZ&#8208;DPXZ, are designed and synthesized with same donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) backbone with different peripheral groups attaching on the A moieties. Their lowest triplet states change from locally excited to charge transfer character leading to significantly enhance reverse intersystem crossing process. In particular, oDTBPZ&#8208;DPXZ exhibits efficient TADF feature and exciton utilization. It not only achieves an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 20.1&#8201;% in red vacuum&#8208;processed OLED, but also realize a high EQE of 18.5&#8201;% in a solution&#8208;processed OLED, which is among the best results in solution&#8208;processed red TADF OLEDs. This work provides an effective strategy for designing red TADF molecules by managing energy level alignments to facilitate the up&#8208;conversion process and thus enhance exciton harvesting.

A novel platinum complex, stacking onto guanine quadruplex faces with very high affinity, is described. With a strong tolerance for various quadruplex topologies and good selectivity for quadruplex vs. duplex structures, it provides a unique platform for further evolution, facilitated by the solved solid&#8208;state structure with telomeric DNA.







Abstract
Guanine quadruplex recognition has gained increasing attention, inspired by the growing awareness of the key roles played by these non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid architectures in cellular regulatory processes. We report here the solution and solid&#8208;state studies of a novel planar platinum(II) complex that is easily assembled from a simple ligand, and exhibits notable binding affinity for guanine quadruplex structures, while maintaining good selectivity for guanine quadruplex over duplex structures. A crystal structure of this ligand complexed with a telomeric quadruplex confirms double end&#8208;capping, with dimerization at the 5&#8242; interface.

         <title>Elucidation of Diverse Solid&#8208;State Packing in a Family of Electron&#8208;Deficient Expanded Helicenes via Microcrystal Electron Diffraction (MicroED)**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2493-2499, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of five diverse expanded helicenes was accessed through divergent functionalization and characterized using microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED), revealing previously inaccessible structural data.

Solid&#8208;state packing plays a defining role in the properties of a molecular organic material, but it is difficult to elucidate in the absence of single crystals that are suitable for X&#8208;ray diffraction. Herein, we demonstrate the coupling of divergent synthesis with microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) for rapid assessment of solid&#8208;state packing motifs, using a class of chiral nanocarbons&#8212;expanded helicenes&#8212;as a proof of concept. Two highly selective oxidative dearomatizations of a readily accessible helicene provided a divergent route to four electron&#8208;deficient analogues containing quinone or quinoxaline units. Crystallization efforts consistently yielded microcrystals that were unsuitable for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, but ideal for MicroED. This technique facilitated the elucidation of solid&#8208;state structures of all five compounds with &lt;1.1&#8197;&#197; resolution. The otherwise&#8208;inaccessible data revealed a range of notable packing behaviors, including four different space groups, homochirality in a crystal for a helicene with an extremely low enantiomerization barrier, and nanometer scale cavities.

&lt;p&gt;A set of five diverse expanded helicenes was accessed through divergent functionalization and characterized using microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED), revealing previously inaccessible structural data. Features such as long range &#960;&#8208;stacking, homochiral crystals, and emergent nanometer scale cavities were observed, spanning four different space groups.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Mode Color&#8208;Tunable Long Persistent Luminescence in Single&#8208;Component Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2526-2533, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By delicate design of coordination polymers incorporating different halogens, multi&#8208;mode color&#8208;tunable long persistent luminescence (LPL) from green to yellow or green to red was possible. The LPL emission colors can be tuned by time, excitation, and temperature, revealing the counter&#8208;balanced mechanisms from single&#8208;molecule and aggregate triplet excited states resulting from an external heavy&#8208;atom effect.







Abstract
Materials with tunable long persistent luminescence (LPL) properties have wide applications in security signs, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, data encrypting, and other fields. However, the majority of reported tunable LPL materials are pure organic molecules or polymers. Herein, a series of metal&#8208;organic coordination polymers displaying color&#8208;tunable LPL were synthesized by the self&#8208;assembly of HTzPTpy ligand with different cadmium halides (X=Cl, Br, and I). In the solid state, their LPL emission colors can be tuned by the time&#8208;evolution, as well as excitation and temperature variation, realizing multi&#8208;mode dynamic color tuning from green to yellow or green to red, and are the first such examples in single&#8208;component coordination polymer materials. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that the modification of LPL is due to the balanced action from single molecule and aggregate triplet excited states caused by an external heavy&#8208;atom effect. The results show that the rational introduction of different halide anions into coordination polymers can realize multi&#8208;color LPL.

Rationally designed metal&#8208;free chromophores capable of H&#8208;bonded directed supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and &#963;&#8208;conjugation allow building molecular crystals exhibiting outstanding long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence. Single crystal analysis reveals a columnar&#8208;like supramolecular structure stabilized by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding. From this, guidelines for obtaining efficient long&#8208;lived phosphorescent molecular crystals are established.







Abstract
Long&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence from organic molecular crystals attracts great attention. Persistent luminescence depends on the electronic properties of the molecular components, mainly &#960;&#8208;conjugated donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) chromophores, and their molecular packing. Here, a strategy is developed by designing two isomeric molecular phosphors incorporating and combining a bridge for &#963;&#8208;conjugation between the D and A units and a structure&#8208;directing unit for H&#8208;bond&#8208;directed supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. Calculations highlight the critical role played by the two degrees of freedom of the &#963;&#8208;conjugated bridge on the chromophore optical properties. The molecular crystals exhibit RTP quantum yields up to 20&#8201;% and lifetimes up to 520&#8197;ms. The crystal structures of the efficient phosphorescent materials establish the existence of an unprecedented well&#8208;organization of the emitters into 2D rectangular columnar&#8208;like supramolecular structure stabilized by intermolecular H&#8208;bonding.

         <title>CoNi Alloy Nanoparticles Embedded in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Derived Carbon for the Highly Efficient Separation of Xenon and Krypton via a Charge&#8208;Transfer Effect</title>

Highly efficient separation of Xe/Kr is achieved on CoNi alloy nanoparticles embedded MOF&#8208;derived carbon adsorbents via charge&#8208;transfer effect. It affords record&#8208;high IAST selectivity and Henty's selectivity of Xe/Kr mixture.







Abstract
Separation of Xe and Kr is one of the greatest challenges in the gas industries owing to their close molecular structure and similar properties. Energy&#8208;effective adsorption&#8208;based separation using chemically stable carbon adsorbents is a promising technology. We propose a strategy for Xe/Kr separation using MOF&#8208;derived metallic carbon adsorbents. M&#8208;Gallate (M=Ni, Co) were used as precursors to fabricate CoNi alloy nanoparticles embedded carbon adsorbents by one&#8208;step auto&#8208;reduction pyrolysis. The optimal NiCo@C&#8208;700 exhibits record&#8208;high IAST selectivity (24.1) and Henry's selectivity (20.1) of Xe/Kr among reported carbon adsorbents. DFT calculations, local density of states calculation, charge density difference, and Bader charge analysis reveal the great affinity with Xe benefits from the presence of Ni or CoNi nanoparticles as a result of more charge transfer from Xe than Kr to metal, thus providing higher binding energy. Breakthrough experiments further verify NiCo@C&#8208;700 a promising candidate for Xe/Kr separation.

         <title>Optimized Active Layer Morphologies via Ternary Copolymerization of Polymer Donors for 17.6&#8201;% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Enhanced Fill Factor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2322-2329, February 1, 2021. </description>

A terpolymer donor PM6&#8208;Tz20 was developed by incorporating the third 5,5&#8242;&#8208;dithienyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiazole (DTBTz) unit into the PM6 backbone. The introduction of DTBTz can tailor the molecular ordering, orientation, and aggregation properties, and then optimize the morphology and electrical properties of devices, ultimately improving fill factor (0.77) and thus device efficiency (17.6&#8201;%).







Abstract
Regulating molecular structure to optimize the active layer morphology is of considerable significance for improving the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we demonstrated a simple ternary copolymerization approach to develop a terpolymer donor PM6&#8208;Tz20 by incorporating the 5,5&#8242;&#8208;dithienyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiazole (DTBTz, 20 mol%) unit into the backbone of PM6 (PM6&#8208;Tz00). This method can effectively tailor the molecular orientation and aggregation of the polymer, and then optimize the active layer morphology and the corresponding physical processes of devices, ultimately boosting FF and then PCE. Hence, the PM6&#8208;Tz20: Y6&#8208;based OSCs achieved a PCE of up to 17.1% with a significantly enhanced FF of 0.77. Using Ag (220 nm) instead of Al (100 nm) as cathode, the champion PCE was further improved to 17.6%. This work provides a simple and effective molecular design strategy to optimize the active layer morphology of OSCs for improving photovoltaic performance.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Low&#8208;Cost Industrial Organic Pigment Coating</title>

         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost industrial organic pigment, quinacridone (QA), was applied as surface passivation agent for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by solution processing of a soluble QA derivative followed by thermal annealing to convert it into insoluble QA. Passivation with strong interactions between QA molecules and metal halides, together with the hydrophobicity of QA coating, enabled highly efficient PSCs with remarkable stability.







Abstract
Surface passivation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using a low&#8208;cost industrial organic pigment quinacridone (QA) is presented. The procedure involves solution processing a soluble derivative of QA, N,N&#8208;bis(tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl)&#8208;quinacridone (TBOC&#8208;QA), followed by thermal annealing to convert TBOC&#8208;QA into insoluble QA. With halide perovskite thin films coated by QA, PSCs based on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) showed significantly improved performance with remarkable stability. A PCE of 21.1&#8201;% was achieved, which is much higher than 18.9&#8201;% recorded for the unmodified devices. The QA coating with exceptional insolubility and hydrophobicity also led to greatly enhanced contact angle from 35.6&#176; for the pristine MAPbI3 thin films to 77.2&#176; for QA coated MAPbI3 thin films. The stability of QA passivated MAPbI3 perovskite thin films and PSCs were significantly enhanced, retaining about 90&#8201;% of the initial efficiencies after more than 1000&#8197;hours storage under ambient conditions.

         <title>Reductive Arylation of Amides via a Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;Coupling and Transfer&#8208;Hydrogenation Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2472-2477, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic intermolecular addition of two disparate nucleophiles to the amide&#8208;carbonyl carbon in a single operational step is reported. The method relies on nickel catalysis and enables the conversion of amides to chiral alcohols via a Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling/transfer&#8208;hydrogenation cascade process.







Abstract
We report a means to achieve the addition of two disparate nucleophiles to the amide carbonyl carbon in a single operational step. Our method takes advantage of non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal catalysis and allows for the facile conversion of amides to chiral alcohols via a one&#8208;pot Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling/transfer&#8208;hydrogenation process. This study is anticipated to promote the development of new transformations that allow for the conversion of carboxylic acid derivatives to functional groups bearing stereogenic centers via cascade processes.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Controlled Binding of Carbon Dioxide by an Iron Center: Insights from Ultrafast Mid&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2519-2525, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Snapshots from femtosecond mid&#8208;infrared laser spectroscopy reveal spin&#8208;dependent formation of different binding modes of carbon dioxide to a transition&#8208;metal center. The ultrafast excitation of an iron(III) oxalate precursor complex with ultraviolet pulses releases a neutral carbon dioxide molecule within 500&#8197;fs and generates a nascent iron&#8208;CO2&#8208;primary complex that isomerizes on a picosecond time scale.







Abstract
The influence of the spin on the mode of binding between carbon dioxide (CO2) and a transition&#8208;metal (TM) center is an entirely open question. Herein, we use an iron(III) oxalato complex with nearly vanishing doublet&#8211;sextet gap, and its ultrafast photolysis, to generate TM&#8208;CO2 bonding patterns and determine their structure in&#8197;situ by femtosecond mid&#8208;infrared spectroscopy. The formation of the nascent TM&#8208;CO2 species according to [L4FeIII(C2O4)]+ + h&#957; &#8594; [L4Fe(CO2)]+ + CO2, with L4=cyclam, is evidenced by the coincident appearance of the characteristic asymmetric stretching absorption of the CO2&#8208;ligand between 1600&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and 1800&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and that of the free CO2&#8208;co&#8208;fragment near 2337&#8197;cm&#8722;1. On the high&#8208;spin surface (S=5/2), the product complex features a bent carbon dioxide radical anion ligand that is O&#8208;&#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221;&#8208;bound to the metal. In contrast, on the intermediate&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin surfaces, the product exhibits a &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221;&#8208;bound, bent carbon dioxide ligand that has either a partial open&#8208;shell (for S=3/2) or fully closed&#8208;shell character (for S=1/2).

NifB is an essential radical SAM enzyme required for the assembly of an 8Fe core of the nitrogenase cofactor. Here we report the crystal structures of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum NifB without and with a full complement of three [Fe4S4] clusters, which provide important mechanistic insights into the radical SAM&#8208;dependent carbide insertion concomitant with the formation of a cofactor core.







Abstract
NifB is an essential radical SAM enzyme required for the assembly of an 8Fe core of the nitrogenase cofactor. Herein, we report the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum NifB without (apo MtNifB) and with (holo MtNifB) a full complement of three [Fe4S4] clusters. Both apo and holo MtNifB contain a partial TIM barrel core, but unlike apo MtNifB, holo MtNifB is fully assembled and competent in cofactor biosynthesis. The radical SAM (RS)&#8208;cluster is coordinated by three Cys, and the adjacent K1&#8208; and K2&#8208;clusters, representing the precursor to an 8Fe cofactor core, are each coordinated by one His and two Cys. Prediction of substrate channels, combined with in silico docking of SAM in holo MtNifB, suggests the binding of SAM between the RS&#8208; and K2&#8208;clusters and putative paths for entry of SAM and exit of products of SAM cleavage, thereby providing important mechanistic insights into the radical SAM&#8208;dependent carbide insertion concomitant with cofactor core formation.

Uniformly torpedo&#8208;shaped green&#8208;emitting Zn2GeO4: Mn2+, Pr3+ nanoparticles with good persistent luminescence performance were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. The pH&#8208;responsive persistent luminescence of ZGMP was found and explored for autofluorescence&#8208;free biosensing and high&#8208;level information encryption.







Abstract
Persistent luminescent nanoparticles (PLNPs) with intrinsic stimuli&#8208;responsive properties are desirable because of no autofluorescence background and natural responsive luminescence. However, the stimuli&#8208;responsive features of pure PLNPs have been unexplored. Here we show a facile one&#8208;pot hydrothermal synthesis of green&#8208;emitting Zn2GeO4:Mn2+,Pr3+ nanoparticles (ZGMP) with regular shape, uniform size and good afterglow luminescent performance. We also report the pH stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent behavior of ZGMP and its possible mechanism. Taking the intriguing feature of pH responsive persistent luminescence, we explore ZGMP as autofluorescence&#8208;free probes to achieve stimuli&#8208;activated signal switch for biosensing by integrating enzyme catalysis reaction mediated pH modulation. The pH&#8208;responsive persistent luminescence also makes ZGMP promising for high&#8208;level information encryption.

         <title>The Synthesis, Bonding, and Transformation of a Ligand&#8208;Protected Gold Nanohydride Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2424-2430, February 1, 2021. </description>

The hitherto largest gold nanohydride cluster, [Au22H4(dppo)6]2+, was synthesized and its structural, bonding, and chemical properties were elucidated. A wide range of hydrogen loss pathways were observed, providing critical information about hydrogen&#8208;related chemical transformations catalyzed by gold nanoparticles.







Abstract
Gold does not react with H2 to form bulk hydrides. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a gold nanohydride protected by diphosphine ligands, [Au22H4(dppo)6]2+ [dppo=1,8&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)octane]. The Au22 core consists of two Au11 units bonded by eight Au atoms not coordinated by the diphosphine ligands. The four H atoms are found to bridge the eight uncoordinated Au atoms at the interface. Each Au11 unit can be viewed as a tetravalent superatom forming four delocalized Au&#8208;H&#8208;Au bonds, similar to the quadruple bond first discovered in the [Re2Cl8]2&#8722; inorganic cluster. The [Au22H4(dppo)6]2+ nanohydride is found to lose H atoms over an extended time via H evolution (H2), proton (H+) and hydride (H&#8722;) releases. This complete repertoire of H&#8208;related transformations suggests that the [Au22H4(dppo)6]2+ nanohydride is a versatile model catalyst for understanding the mechanisms of chemical reactions involving hydrogen on the surface of gold nanoparticles.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of (Hetero)Aromatic Nitriles from C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds**

C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds have been converted to cyano derivatives under metal&#8208; and cyanide&#8208;free condition in the presence of visible light and an organic dye. Potential applications of this method in the late&#8208;stage transformation of complex drug molecules, steroid derivatives, and gram&#8208;scale reactions have been described.







Abstract
The metal&#8208;free activation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds to value&#8208;added products is of paramount importance in organic synthesis. We report the use of the commercially available organic dye 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (TPP) for the conversion of methylarenes to the corresponding aryl nitriles via a photocatalytic process. Applying this methodology, a variety of cyanobenzenes have been synthesized in good to excellent yield under metal&#8208; and cyanide&#8208;free conditions. We demonstrate the scope of the method with over 50 examples including late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules (celecoxib) and complex structures such as l&#8208;menthol, amino acids, and cholesterol derivatives. Furthermore, the presented synthetic protocol is applicable for gram&#8208;scale reactions. In addition to methylarenes, selected examples for the cyanation of aldehydes, alcohols and oximes are demonstrated as well. Detailed mechanistic investigations have been carried out using time&#8208;resolved luminescence quenching studies, control experiments, and NMR spectroscopy as well as kinetic studies, all supporting the proposed catalytic cycle.

         <title>Selective Transformation of Nickel&#8208;Bound Formate to CO or C&#8722;C Coupling Products Triggered by Deprotonation and Steered by Alkali&#8208;Metal Ions</title>

A deceptively simple proton abstraction from nickel&#8208;bound formate not only prepares the resulting CO22&#8722; unit for the release of CO in contact with electrophiles but opens up unique complex reaction schemes including reduction of nickel(II) to nickel(I) and coupling of CO2 units to give oxalate and mesoxalate. Mesoxalate formation from individual CO2 units is so far unprecedented.







Abstract
The complexes [LtBuNi(OCO&#8208;&#954;2O,C)]M3[N(SiMe3)2]2 (M=Li, Na, K), synthesized by deprotonation of a nickel formate complex [LtBuNiOOCH] with the corresponding amides M[N(SiMe3)2], feature a NiII&#8722;CO22&#8722; core surrounded by Lewis&#8208;acidic cations (M+) and the influence of the latter on the behavior and reactivity was studied. The results point to a decrease of CO2 activation within the series Li, Na, and K, which is also reflected in the reactivity with Me3SiOTf leading to the liberation of CO and formation of a Ni&#8722;OSiMe3 complex. Furthermore, in case of K+, the {[K3[N(SiMe3)2]2}+ shell around the Ni&#8722;CO22&#8722; entity was shown to have a large impact on its stabilization and behavior. If the number of K[N(SiMe3)2] equivalents used in the reaction with [LtBuNiOOCH] is decreased from 3 to 0.5, the deprotonated part of the precursor enters a complex reaction sequence with formation of [LtBuNiI(&#956;&#8208;OOCH)NiILtBu]K and [LtBuNi(C2O4)NiLtBu]. The same reaction at higher concentrations additionally led to the formation of a unique hexanuclear NiII complex containing both oxalate and mesoxalate ([O2C&#8208;CO2&#8208;CO2]4&#8722;) ligands.

         <title>Potential&#8208;Dependent Morphology of Copper Catalysts During CO2 Electroreduction Revealed by In&#8197;Situ Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2561-2568, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper catalyst for electrochemical CO2 conversion has been unraveled in situ down to the atomic scale using electrochemical atomic force microscopy under highly gas&#8208;evolving reaction conditions. Oxidized copper surfaces enter different morphological regimes in cathodic potential ranges down to &#8722;1.1&#8197;VRHE coupled with surface reconstructions and varying density of undercoordinated reaction sites.







Abstract
Electrochemical AFM is a powerful tool for the real&#8208;space characterization of catalysts under realistic electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) conditions. The evolution of structural features ranging from the micrometer to the atomic scale could be resolved during CO2RR. Using Cu(100) as model surface, distinct nanoscale surface morphologies and their potential&#8208;dependent transformations from granular to smoothly curved mound&#8208;pit surfaces or structures with rectangular terraces are revealed during CO2RR in 0.1&#8197;m KHCO3. The density of undercoordinated copper sites during CO2RR is shown to increase with decreasing potential. In&#8197;situ atomic&#8208;scale imaging reveals specific adsorption occurring at distinct cathodic potentials impacting the observed catalyst structure. These results show the complex interrelation of the morphology, structure, defect density, applied potential, and electrolyte in copper CO2RR catalysts.

         <title>Structural Basis for &#945;&#8208;Helix Mimicry and Inhibition of Protein&#8211;Protein Interactions with Oligourea Foldamers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2296-2303, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide to oligourea replacements have been employed to generate high&#8208;affinity foldamer ligands targeted to specific proteins. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of several peptide&#8211;oligourea hybrids bound to their respective protein targets confirms the high degree of &#945;&#8208;helix mimicry that can be achieved with oligoureas and reveals general principles enabling the design of more stable peptide&#8208;based inhibitors of protein&#8211;protein interactions.







Abstract
Efficient optimization of a peptide lead into a drug candidate frequently needs further transformation to augment properties such as bioavailability. Among the different options, foldamers, which are sequence&#8208;based oligomers with precise folded conformation, have emerged as a promising technology. We introduce oligourea foldamers to reduce the peptide character of inhibitors of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPI). However, the precise design of such mimics is currently limited by the lack of structural information on how these foldamers adapt to protein surfaces. We report a collection of X&#8208;ray structures of peptide&#8211;oligourea hybrids in complex with ubiquitin ligase MDM2 and vitamin&#8197;D receptor and show how such hybrid oligomers can be designed to bind with high affinity to protein targets. This work should enable the generation of more effective foldamer&#8208;based disruptors of PPIs in the context of peptide lead optimization.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Bistability in a Ni&#8211;Fe Chain: Electron Transfer Controlled by Temperature, Pressure, Light, and Humidity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2330-2338, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bistable [Ni(cyclam)]&#8208;[Fe(CN)6]&#8208;based chain exhibits unprecedented four&#8208;way switching of magnetic and optical properties at room temperature. The reversible electron&#8208;transfer phase transition between the NiII&#8208;FeIII and NiIII&#8208;FeII valence states can be triggered by temperature (T), pressure (P), or light (h&#957;), and reversibly turned off by dehydration.







Abstract
Bistable and stimuli&#8208;responsive molecule&#8208;based materials are promising candidates for the development of molecular switches and sensors for future technologies. The CN&#8208;bridged {NH4[Ni(cyclam)][Fe(CN)6]&#8901;5&#8201;H2O}n chain exists in two valence states: NiII&#8208;FeIII (1HT) and NiIII&#8208;FeII (1LT) and shows unique multiresponsivity under ambient conditions to various stimuli, including temperature, pressure, light, and humidity, which generate measurable response in the form of significant changes in magnetic susceptibility and color. The electron&#8208;transfer phase transition 1LT&#8596;1HT shows room&#8208;temperature thermal hysteresis, can be induced by irradiation, and shows high sensitivity to small applied pressure, which shifts it to higher temperatures. Additionally, it can be reversibly turned off by dehydration to the {NH4[NiII(cyclam)][FeIII(CN)6]}n (1&#8201;d) phase, which features the NiII&#8208;FeIII valence state over the whole temperature range, but responds to pressure by yielding NiIII&#8208;FeII above 1.06&#8197;GPa.

         <title>Breaking the Linear Scaling Relationship by Compositional and Structural Crafting of Ternary Cu&#8211;Au/Ag Nanoframes for Electrocatalytic Ethylene Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2508-2518, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8211;Ag/Au nanoframes were prepared to break the intrinsic scaling relationship of intermediate binding associated with carbon dioxide reduction reactions (CO2RR) and resulted in very high Faradic efficiencies for ethylene production in both an H&#8208;cell and a flow cell. Both the *CO&#8211;*CO coupling and *CO&#8594;*CHO hydrogenation steps were found to be rate&#8208;determining and to steer the reaction towards ethylene production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide into high&#8208;value multicarbon (C2+) chemical feedstocks offers a promising avenue to liberate the chemical industry from fossil&#8208;resource dependence and eventually close the anthropogenic carbon cycle but is severely impeded by the lack of high&#8208;performance catalysts. To break the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding and minimize the kinetic barrier of CO2 reduction reactions, ternary Cu&#8211;Au/Ag nanoframes were fabricated to decouple the functions of CO generation and C&#8722;C coupling, whereby the former is promoted by the alloyed Ag/Au substrate and the latter is facilitated by the highly strained and positively charged Cu domains. Thus, C2H4 production in an H&#8208;cell and a flow cell occurred with high Faradic efficiencies of 69&#177;5 and 77&#177;2&#8201;%, respectively, as well as good electrocatalytic stability and material durability. In situ IR and DFT calculations unveiled two competing pathways for C2H4 generation, of which direct CO dimerization is energetically favored.

         <title>An Imine&#8208;Linked Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Reactive Oxygen Species Generator</title>

Constituting imine linkages between trinuclear CuI&#8208;based complexes and diamine creates a metal&#8211;organic framework with honeycomb layers in eclipsed packing. Two kinds of structural vacancies are identified quantitatively by selective coordination dissociation. The structure could catalyze H2O2 decomposition and consequently excite O2 to reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
A new metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with both coordination linkages and covalent linkages is prepared by coordinating CuI with pyrazolate for an aldehyde&#8208;functionalized trinuclear complex, and subsequent imine condensation with p&#8208;phenylenediamine, a reaction typical for covalent organic framework (COF) synthesis. This MOF&#215;COF collaboration yields FDM&#8208;71 with honeycomb layers stacked in eclipsed fashion. After dissociating the CuI&#8208;pyrazolate coordination in FDM&#8208;71, the obtained organic components carry the information of structural defects, and thus vacancy identity (aldehyde&#8208;based unit vacancy and amine&#8208;based unit vacancy) and concentration are definitely resolved. Further to the redox catalytic activity inherited from the complex, FDM&#8208;71 features effective photosensitizing activity. The two functions integrated in one well&#8208;defined structure is demonstrated by its high efficiency in decomposing H2O2 and consequent excitation of O2 to reactive oxygen species.

         <title>15N NMR Hyperpolarization of Radiosensitizing Antibiotic Nimorazole by Reversible Parahydrogen Exchange in Microtesla Magnetic Fields</title>

Synthesis of 15N3&#8208;enriched antibiotic and hypoxic radiosensitizer nimorazole is reported. Spin&#8208;relayed signal amplification by reversible exchange in microtesla magnetic field yielded up to 3.2&#8201;% 15N nuclear spin polarization with relaxation time constant of 5.9&#177;0.2&#8197;min at 1.4 T. The isomer of nimorazole formed in the synthesis was also hyperpolarized indicating that this approach can be extended to a wide range of nitroimidazole&#8208;based drugs.







Abstract
Nimorazole belongs to the imidazole&#8208;based family of antibiotics to fight against anaerobic bacteria. Moreover, nimorazole is now in Phase 3 clinical trial in Europe for potential use as a hypoxia radiosensitizer for treatment of head and neck cancers. We envision the use of [15N3]nimorazole as a theragnostic hypoxia contrast agent that can be potentially deployed in the next&#8208;generation MRI&#8208;LINAC systems. Herein, we report the first steps to create long&#8208;lasting (for tens of minutes) hyperpolarized state on three 15N sites of [15N3]nimorazole with T1 of up to ca. 6&#8197;minutes. The nuclear spin polarization was boosted by ca. 67000&#8208;fold at 1.4 T (corresponding to P15N of 3.2&#8201;%) by 15N&#8722;15N spin&#8208;relayed SABRE&#8208;SHEATH hyperpolarization technique, relying on simultaneous exchange of [15N3]nimorazole and parahydrogen on polarization transfer Ir&#8208;IMes catalyst. The presented results pave the way to efficient spin&#8208;relayed SABRE&#8208;SHEATH hyperpolarization of a wide range of imidazole&#8208;based antibiotics and chemotherapeutics.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective (3+3) Cycloaddition of Nitrones with 2&#8208;Indolylmethanols Enabled by Cooperative Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2355-2363, February 1, 2021. </description>

The regio&#8208; and enantioselective (3+3) cycloaddition of nitrones with 2&#8208;indolylmethanols has been established under the cooperative catalysis of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA). This approach not only realized the first organocatalytic asymmetric (3+3) cycloaddition of nitrones and the first C3&#8208;nucleophilic asymmetric (3+3) cycloaddition of 2&#8208;indolylmethanols but also revealed a new mode of cooperative catalysis.







Abstract
The regio&#8208; and enantioselective (3+3) cycloaddition of nitrones with 2&#8208;indolylmethanols was accomplished by the cooperative catalysis of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA). Using this approach, a series of indole&#8208;fused six&#8208;membered heterocycles were synthesized in high yields (up to 98&#8201;%), with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 96&#8201;% ee) and exclusive regiospecificity. This approach enabled not only the first organocatalytic asymmetric (3+3) cycloaddition of nitrones but also the first C3&#8208;nucleophilic asymmetric (3+3) cycloaddition of 2&#8208;indolylmethanols. More importantly, theoretical calculations elucidated the role of the cocatalyst HFIP in helping CPA control the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the reaction, demonstrating a new mode of cooperative catalysis.

         <title>An Electroactive Pure Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Polymer Based on a Donor&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Acceptor Geometry</title>

A donor&#8208;oxygen&#8208;acceptor geometry has been demonstrated for the design of electroactive pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence polymers, whose PLEDs achieve a promising EQE of 9.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
An electroactive room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymer has been demonstrated based on a characteristic donor&#8208;oxygen&#8208;acceptor geometry. Compared with the donor&#8211;acceptor reference, the inserted oxygen atom between donor and acceptor can not only decrease hole&#8208;electron orbital overlap to suppress the charge transfer fluorescence, but also strengthen spin&#8208;orbital coupling effect to facilitate the intersystem crossing and subsequent phosphorescence channels. As a result, a significant RTP is observed in solid states under photo excitation. Most noticeably, the corresponding polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) reveal a dominant electrophosphorescence with a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 9.7&#8201;%. The performance goes well beyond the 5&#8201;% theoretical limit for typical fluors, opening a new door to the development of pure organic RTP polymers towards efficient PLEDs.

         <title>How Oxygen Binding Enhances Long&#8208;Range Electron Transfer: Lessons From Reduction of Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases by Cellobiose Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2385-2392, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interprotein electron&#8208;transfer (ET) mechanism between lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) and cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) was deciphered by multiscale simulations. Our simulations show that I)&#8197;the specific ET pathway involves water molecules; II)&#8197;the long&#8208;range ET is enhanced by exothermic oxygen binding; III)&#8197;enhanced ET is spin&#8208;regulated and favors the quartet state over the doublet state.







Abstract
Long&#8208;range electron transfer (ET) in metalloenzymes is a general and fundamental process governing O2 activation and reduction. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are key enzymes for the oxidative cleavage of insoluble polysaccharides, but their reduction mechanism by cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), one of the most commonly used enzymatic electron donors, via long&#8208;range ET is still an enigma. Using multiscale simulations, we reveal that interprotein ET between CDH and LPMO is mediated by the heme propionates of CDH and solvent waters. We also show that oxygen binding to the copper center of LPMO is coupled with the long&#8208;range interprotein ET. This process, which is spin&#8208;regulated and enhanced by the presence of O2, directly leads to LPMO&#8722;CuII&#8722;O2&#8722;, bypassing the formation of the generally assumed LPMO&#8722;CuI species.

     alt="How Oxygen Binding Enhances Long&#8208;Range Electron Transfer: Lessons From Reduction of Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenases by Cellobiose Dehydrogenase"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interprotein electron&#8208;transfer (ET) mechanism between lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) and cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) was deciphered by multiscale simulations. Our simulations show that I)&#8197;the specific ET pathway involves water molecules; II)&#8197;the long&#8208;range ET is enhanced by exothermic oxygen binding; III)&#8197;enhanced ET is spin&#8208;regulated and favors the quartet state over the doublet state.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long&#8208;range electron transfer (ET) in metalloenzymes is a general and fundamental process governing O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and reduction. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are key enzymes for the oxidative cleavage of insoluble polysaccharides, but their reduction mechanism by cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), one of the most commonly used enzymatic electron donors, via long&#8208;range ET is still an enigma. Using multiscale simulations, we reveal that interprotein ET between CDH and LPMO is mediated by the heme propionates of CDH and solvent waters. We also show that oxygen binding to the copper center of LPMO is coupled with the long&#8208;range interprotein ET. This process, which is spin&#8208;regulated and enhanced by the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, directly leads to LPMO&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, bypassing the formation of the generally assumed LPMO&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; species. The uncovered ET mechanism rationalizes experimental observations and might have far&#8208;reaching implications for LPMO catalysis as well as the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208; or CO&#8208;binding&#8208;enhanced long&#8208;range ET processes in other metalloenzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>In Situ Exploration of the Structural Transition during Morphology&#8208; and Efficiency&#8208;Conserving Halide Exchange on a Single Perovskite Nanocrystal</title>

In situ single&#8208;particle photoluminescence imaging revealed that sudden cooperative transition from green&#8208;emitting CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite nanocrystals to red&#8208;emitting CH3NH3PbBr3 while maintaining their morphology and emission efficiency during halide exchange. The transformation proceeds via intermediate dark states with &gt;100&#8197;s durations and originates from two distinct defect&#8208;mediated processes with different activation energies.







Abstract
Controlled fabrication of semiconductor nanostructures with unique physicochemical properties is vital for future technologies. In this study, transformation from red&#8208;emitting metal halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals (NCs) to green&#8208;emitting CH3NH3PbBr3 NCs was achieved without significant morphological changes and loss of photoluminescence (PL) efficiency via a controlled halide exchange reaction. In situ single&#8208;particle PL imaging along with detailed structural and elemental characterizations revealed that sudden cooperative transitions between two light&#8208;emitting states via intermediate dark states with &gt;100&#8197;s durations during halide exchange originate from two distinct defect&#8208;mediated reconstruction processes with different activation energies (0.072 and 0.40&#8197;eV), leading to an isokinetic temperature of ca. 314&#8197;K, across a solid&#8208;state miscibility gap between the I&#8208; and Br&#8208;rich phases inside a single NC.

         <title>Directing the Rate&#8208;Enhancement for Hydronium Ion Catalyzed Dehydration via Organization of Alkanols in Nanoscopic Confinements</title>

The van der Waals stabilization of transition states in smaller&#8208;pore MFI zeolites makes secondary alcohols, 3&#8208;heptanol, and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hexanol more reactive toward hydronium ion catalyzed elimination than in the sterically larger pore BEA zeolite. Whereas the stabilization of the C&#946;&#8208;H transition state provided by intraporous alcohol for 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;hexanol provides an additional stabilization in the sterically larger pore BEA zeolite, making hydronium ions in BEA more reactive than in MFI.







Abstract
Alkanol dehydration rates catalyzed by hydronium ions are enhanced by the dimensions of steric confinements of zeolite pores as well as by intraporous intermolecular interactions with other alkanols. The higher rates with zeolite MFI having pores smaller than those of zeolite BEA for dehydration of secondary alkanols, 3&#8208;heptanol and 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;hexanol, is caused by the lower activation enthalpy in the tighter confinements of MFI that offsets a less positive activation entropy. The higher activity in BEA than in MFI for dehydration of a tertiary alkanol, 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;hexanol, is primarily attributed to the reduction of the activation enthalpy by stabilizing intraporous interactions of the C&#946;&#8208;H transition state with surrounding alcohol molecules. Overall, we show that the positive impact of zeolite confinements results from the stabilization of transition state provided by the confinement and intermolecular interaction of alkanols with the transition state, which is impacted by both the size of confinements and the structure of alkanols in the E1 pathway of dehydration.

         <title>Light&#8208;Powered Autonomous Flagella&#8208;Like Motion of Molecular Crystal Microwires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2414-2423, February 1, 2021. </description>

When exposed to a combination of ultraviolet and visible light, crystalline microwires composed of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(3&#8208;(anthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)allylidene)malononitrile ((Z)&#8208;DVAM) undergo oscillating deformations that mimic the motion of biological flagella and move the crystals through water. This life&#8208;like mechanical motion is fueled by reversible E&#8594;Z photoisomerization reactions taking place inside the crystal.







Abstract
The ability to exhibit life&#8208;like oscillatory motion fueled by light represents a new capability for stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. Although this capability has been demonstrated in soft materials like polymers, it has never been observed in molecular crystals, which are not generally regarded as dynamic objects. In this work, it is shown that molecular crystalline microwires composed of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(3&#8208;(anthracen&#8208;9&#8208;yl)allylidene)malononitrile ((Z)&#8208;DVAM) can be continuously actuated when exposed to a combination of ultraviolet and visible light. The photo&#8208;induced motion mimics the oscillatory behavior of biological flagella and enables propagation of microwires across a surface and through liquids, with translational speeds up to 7&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;s&#8722;1. This is the first example of molecular crystals that show complex oscillatory behavior under continuous irradiation. A model that relates the rotation of the transition dipole moment between reversible E&#8594;Z photoisomerization to the microscopic torque can qualitatively reproduce how the rotational frequency depends on light intensity and polarization.

         <title>A General Strategy to Design Highly Fluorogenic Far&#8208;Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Tetrazine Bioorthogonal Probes</title>

A palette of highly fluorogenic Huaxi&#8208;Fluor probes are turned on by a tetrazine bioorthogonal reaction. The emission wavelengths are fine&#8208;tuned from the far&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared. These highly stable and biocompatible probes are suitable for visualizing organelles in live cells without a washing step and for imaging of tumors in live small animals to depths of 500&#8197;&#956;m by two&#8208;photon excitation.







Abstract
Highly fluorogenic tetrazine bioorthogonal probes emitting at near&#8208;infrared wavelengths are in strong demand for biomedical imaging applications. Herein, we have developed a strategy for forming a palette of novel Huaxi&#8208;Fluor probes in situ, whose fluorescence increases hundreds of times upon forming the bioorthogonal reaction product, pyridazine. The resulting probes show large Stokes shifts and high quantum yields. Manipulating the conjugate length and pull&#8211;push strength in the fluorophore skeleton allows the emission wavelength to be fine&#8208;tuned from 556 to 728&#8197;nm. The highly photo&#8208;stable and biocompatible probes are suitable for visualizing organelles in live cells without a washing step and for imaging of tumors in live small animals to depths of 500&#8197;&#956;m by two&#8208;photon excitation.

         <title>Stiffness Tomography of Ultra&#8208;Soft Nanogels by Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2280-2287, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extremely soft temperature&#8208;sensitive nanogels adsorbed to the solid/water interface were studied by atomic force microscopy. The ultra&#8208;soft nanogels disappeared in the classical 2D height image. By detailed analysis of Force Volume data the extraordinary disk&#8208;like and entirely homogeneous but extremely soft structure of the nanogels was resolved.







Abstract
The softness of nanohydrogels results in unique properties and recently attracted tremendous interest due to the multi&#8208;functionalization of interfaces. Herein, we study extremely soft temperature&#8208;sensitive ultra&#8208;low cross&#8208;linked (ULC) nanogels adsorbed to the solid/water interface by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The ultra&#8208;soft nanogels seem to disappear in classical imaging modes since a sharp tip fully penetrates these porous networks with very low forces in the range of steric interactions (ca.&#8197;100&#8197;pN). However, the detailed evaluation of Force Volume mode measurements allows us to resolve their overall shape and at the same time their internal structure in all three dimensions. The nanogels exhibit an extraordinary disk&#8208;like and entirely homogeneous but extremely soft structure&#8212;even softer than polymer brushes. Moreover, the temperature&#8208;sensitive nanogels can be switched on demand between the ultra&#8208;soft and a very stiff state.

         <title>Sub&#8208;3 nm Ultrafine Cu2O for Visible Light Driven Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2554-2560, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafine Cu2O, less than 3&#8197;nm in size, was synthesized by facile in situ reduction of layered double hydroxide (LDH). This ultrafine Cu2O exhibits superior performance for visible light driven N2 reduction to NH3, with a nearly 64&#8208;fold increase in NH3 production rate compared to bulk Cu2O, and it is superior to most of the reported benchmark photocatalysts. The remarkable activity can be attributed to the availability of surface sites and the generation of long&#8208;lived photoexcited electrons.







Abstract
Cu2O, a low&#8208;cost, visible light responsive semiconductor photocatalyst represents an ideal candidate for visible light driven photocatalytic reduction of N2 to NH3 from the viewpoint of thermodynamics, but it remains unexplored. Reported here is the successful synthesis of uniformly sized and ultrafine Cu2O platelets, with a lateral size of &lt;3&#8197;nm, by the in situ topotactic reduction of a CuII&#8208;containing layered double hydroxide with ascorbic acid. The supported ultrafine Cu2O offered excellent performance and stability for the visible light driven photocatalytic reduction of N2 to NH3 (the Cu2O&#8208;mass&#8208;normalized rate as high as 4.10&#8197;mmol&#8201;g
&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at &#955;&gt;400&#8197;nm), with the origin of the high activity being long&#8208;lived photoexcited electrons in trap states, an abundance of exposed active sites, and the underlying support structure. This work guides the future design of ultrafine catalysts for NH3 synthesis and other applications.

         <title>The Trojan Horse Goes Wild: The Effect of Drug Loading on the Behavior of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2202-2206, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drug delivery is often compared to a Trojan Horse, as the drugs are hidden inside nanoparticles (equivalent to the Trojan Horse) and they enter cells (e.g. cancer cells) in a stealth&#8208;like fashion. However, it seems that drug loading can influence the properties of the nanoparticles, which are detected by the cell. As a result, the cell can reject the nanoparticle; thus, loading large amounts of drugs can be damaging to drug delivery efforts.







Abstract
Drug delivery with nanoparticles is sometimes compared to an attack with a Trojan Horse. The drugs are hidden in nanoparticles and enter the unsuspecting cells in a stealth&#8208;like fashion. Here, I would like to share my thoughts that a comparison to the Trojan Horse does not always apply, and provide examples where an increased drug loading content was detrimental to the drug&#8208;delivery process. The purpose is to highlight the importance of understanding the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles, and the importance of having materials scientists in the line&#8208;up of researchers working together to create successful nanomedicine.

Organic crystal microwires that transform light into oscillatory motion are reported by Rabih&#8197;O. Al&#8208;Kaysi, Christopher&#8197;J. Bardeen, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;2414. A diolefinanthracene derivative undergoes E&#8211;Z photoisomerization to generate molecular&#8208;scale motion. When microwires composed of this molecule are exposed to UV and visible wavelengths, forward and reverse reactions drive continuous twisting and writhing. These motions can propel the wires at speeds controlled by the light intensity.

Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials are important for the construction of molecular switches or sensors. In their Research Article on page&#8197;2330, Mateusz Reczy&#324;ski, Shin&#8208;ichi Ohkoshi, Beata Nowicka, and co&#8208;workers present room&#8208;temperature bistability in a CN&#8208;bridged Ni&#8211;Fe coordination chain, which exhibits multiresponsive behavior with electron&#8208;transfer transitions induced by temperature, light, pressure, and humidity. The material responds to these stimuli with measurable changes in magnetic properties and color.

         <title>Smart Design of Nanomaterials for Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Nanotherapeutics</title>

Smart design of nanotherapeutics: Mitochondria play pivotal roles in regulating cell survival and death. They have become important targets in organelle&#8208;targeted therapy. This Review highlights a collection of the latest advances in the design strategies of multifunctional mitochondria&#8208;targeted nanotherapeutics.







Abstract
Mitochondria are the powerhouse of cells. They are vital organelles that maintain cellular function and metabolism. Dysfunction of mitochondria results in various diseases with a great diversity of clinical appearances. In the past, strategies have been developed for fabricating subcellular&#8208;targeting drug&#8208;delivery nanocarriers, enabling cellular internalization and subsequent organelle localization. Of late, innovative strategies have emerged for the smart design of multifunctional nanocarriers. Hierarchical targeting enables nanocarriers to evade and overcome various barriers encountered upon in vivo administration to reach the organelle with good bioavailability. Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers allow controlled release of therapeutics to occur at the desired target site. Synergistic therapy can be achieved using a combination of approaches such as chemotherapy, gene and phototherapy. In this Review, we survey the field for recent developments and strategies used in the smart design of nanocarriers for mitochondria&#8208;targeted therapeutics. Existing challenges and unexplored therapeutic opportunities are also highlighted and discussed to inspire the next generation of mitochondrial&#8208;targeting nanotherapeutics.

Clues from the recent literature have been used to unravel a series of mechanistic puzzles regarding the reactions of epoxides with titanium(III) reagents. Four examples are highlighted that will change the way in which titanium(III) chemistry is practiced.







Abstract
While writing a comprehensive review on the reactions of epoxides with titanium(III) reagents, we encountered a series of mechanistic puzzles. Using clues from the literature, many of which were not available at the time that the mysteries emerged, it was possible to demystify a number of these conundrums. We discuss four examples, which we believe will significantly change the way in which titanium(III) chemistry is practiced. Our experience underscores the importance of comprehensive and critical reviews in chemistry and the truism that the authors are prime beneficiaries of the review process.

Advantages of aptamers and SELEX in diverse research fields are summarized in this Minireview, along with some limitations and possible solutions to them. Furthermore described are future perspectives for aptamer modification with a near&#8208;infinite number of molecular&#8208;modulating elements that will result in more powerful tools in bioscience.







Abstract
The advent of SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) technology has shown the ability to evolve artificial ligands with affinity and specificity able to meet growing clinical demand for probes that can, for example, distinguish between the target leukemia cells and other cancer cells within the matrix of heterogeneity, which characterizes cancer cells. Though antibodies are the conventional and ideal choice as a molecular recognition tool for many applications, aptamers complement the use of antibodies due to many unique advantages, such as small size, low cost, and facile chemical modification. This Minireview will focus on the novel applications of aptamers and SELEX, as well as opportunities to develop molecular tools able to meet future clinical needs in biomedicine.

Furthermore described are future perspectives for aptamer modification with a near&#8208;infinite number of molecular&#8208;modulating elements that will result in more powerful tools in bioscience.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advent of SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) technology has shown the ability to evolve artificial ligands with affinity and specificity able to meet growing clinical demand for probes that can, for example, distinguish between the target leukemia cells and other cancer cells within the matrix of heterogeneity, which characterizes cancer cells. Though antibodies are the conventional and ideal choice as a molecular recognition tool for many applications, aptamers complement the use of antibodies due to many unique advantages, such as small size, low cost, and facile chemical modification. This Minireview will focus on the novel applications of aptamers and SELEX, as well as opportunities to develop molecular tools able to meet future clinical needs in biomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms of Layered Lithium&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2208-2220, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered lithium&#8208;rich materials are promising cathode materials for the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Understanding the principles of the performance degradation mechanisms is a prerequisite for progress in this area. In this Minireview, recent research on the material structure and reaction mechanisms of layered lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based cathode materials is discussed.







Abstract
Layered lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials have attracted extensive interest owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (320&#8211;350&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1). However, poor cycling stability and sluggish reaction kinetics inhibit their practical applications. After many years of quiescence, interest in layered lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials is expected to revive in answer to our increasing dependence on high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we review recent research progress and in&#8208;depth descriptions of the structure characterization and reaction mechanisms of layered lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based cathode materials. In particular, we comprehensively summarize the proposed reaction mechanisms of both the cationic redox reaction of transition&#8208;metal ions and the anionic redox reaction of oxygen species. Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges facing the future development of lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Unlocking Nature's Biosynthetic Power&#8212;Metabolic Engineering for the Fermentative Production of Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2258-2278, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances and future perspectives in microbial metabolic engineering are described in this Review, with a focus on selected commercially relevant examples. Existing biosynthetic pathways for natural products can now be easily discovered and optimized to enable competitive production processes. Moreover, nature's unlimited number of enzymes and metabolic pathways can now be rearranged to yield novel biosynthetic routes.







Abstract
Fermentation as a production method for chemicals is especially attractive, as it is based on cheap renewable raw materials and often exhibits advantages in terms of costs and sustainability. The tremendous development of technology in bioscience has resulted in an exponentially increasing knowledge about biological systems and has become the main driver for innovations in the field of metabolic engineering. Progress in recombinant DNA technology, genomics, and computational methods open new, cheaper, and faster ways to metabolically engineer microorganisms. Existing biosynthetic pathways for natural products, such as vitamins, organic acids, amino acids, or secondary metabolites, can be discovered and optimized efficiently, thereby enabling competitive commercial production processes. Novel biosynthetic routes can now be designed by the rearrangement of nature's unlimited number of enzymes and metabolic pathways in microbial strains. This expands the range of chemicals accessible by biotechnology and has yielded the first commercial products, while new fermentation technologies targeting novel active ingredients, commodity chemicals, and CO2&#8208;fixation methods are on the horizon.

Cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) precursor salt 2BF4 reacts with [M(PPh3)4] (M=Pd, Pt) to give cis/trans&#8208;[3]BF4 and cis&#8208;[4]BF4, in which the CAAC ligand bears an unusual N&#8208;alkyl substituent. trans&#8208;[5] has a unique anionic CAAC ligand with an unsubstituted ring&#8208;nitrogen atom which can be protonated to give trans&#8208;[6]BF4 bearing a protic CAAC (pCAAC) ligand.







Abstract
CAAC precursors 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethylindole 1 and 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethylindolium tetrafluoroborate 2BF4 have been prepared and oxidatively added to [M(PPh3)4] (M=Pd, Pt). Salt 2BF4 reacts with [Pd(PPh3)4] in toluene at 25&#8201;&#176;C over 4&#8197;days to yield complex cis&#8208;[3]BF4 featuring an N&#8208;ethyl substituted CAAC, two cis&#8208;arranged phosphines and a chloro ligand. Compound trans&#8208;[3]BF4 was obtained from the same reaction at 80&#8201;&#176;C over 1&#8197;day. Salt 2BF4 reacts with [Pt(PPh3)4] to give cis&#8208;[4]BF4. The neutral indole derivative 1 adds oxidatively to [Pt(PPh3)4] to give trans&#8208;[5] featuring a CAAC ligand with an unsubstituted ring&#8208;nitrogen atom. This nitrogen atom has been protonated with py&#8901;HBF4 to give trans&#8208;[6]BF4 bearing a protic CAAC ligand. The PdII complex trans&#8208;[7]BF4 bearing a protic CAAC ligand was obtained in a one&#8208;pot reaction from 1 and [Pd(PPh3)4] in the presence of py&#8901;HBF4.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydroalkylation of Cyclopropenes with Cobalt Homoenolates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2694-2698, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach for highly atom&#8208;economical, efficient, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of cyclopropenes promoted by an easily accessible Co complex was developed. This protocol is the first example of introduction of a wide range of Co homoenolates generated from ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropanols to the cyclopropanes.







Abstract
Catalylic diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydroalkylation of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropenes with Co&#8208;homoenolate generated in&#8197;situ from ring&#8208;opening of easily accessible cyclopropanols promoted by a chiral phosphine&#8211;cobalt complex is presented. Such a process represents the unprecedented and direct introduction of a wide range of functionalized alkyl groups without the need of pre&#8208;formation of stoichiometric amounts of organometallic reagents onto the cyclopropane motif, affording multi&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes in up to 99&#8201;% yield with &gt;95:5 dr and 98:2 er. Functionalization of the products delivered enantioenriched cyclopropanes that are otherwise difficult to access.

         <title>Large&#8208;Amplitude Conformational Changes in Self&#8208;Assembled Multi&#8208;Stranded Aromatic Sheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2574-2577, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpected conformational changes involving a global concerted rearrangement of the structure have been evidenced in large multistranded aromatic sheets. Increasing foldamer size thus gives access to new and defined conformational trajectories.







Abstract
The orchestration of ever larger conformational changes is made possible by the development of increasingly complex foldamers. Aromatic sheets, a rare motif in synthetic foldamer structures, have been designed so as to form discrete stacks of intercalated aromatic strands through the self&#8208;assembly of two identical subunits. Ion&#8208;mobility ESI&#8208;MS confirms the formation of compact dimers. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals the existence of two distinct conformational dimeric states that require large changes to interconvert. Molecular dynamics simulation validates the stability of the two conformations and the possibility of their interconversion.

         <title>Extended Multicomponent Reactions with Indole Aldehydes: Access to Unprecedented Polyheterocyclic Scaffolds, Ligands of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2603-2608, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engaging indole aldehydes in an isocyanide multicomponent reaction, the polarity inversion of the indole moiety along the transformation triggers an extension of the domino process, leading to a variety of unprecedented fused, linked, and bridged scaffolds. The processes can be run in parallel and the adducts display remarkable bioactivity as potent ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.







Abstract
The participation of reactants undergoing a polarity inversion along a multicomponent reaction allows the continuation of the transformation with productive domino processes. Thus, indole aldehydes in Groebke&#8211;Blackburn&#8211;Bienaym&#233; reactions lead to an initial adduct which spontaneously triggers a series of events leading to the discovery of novel reaction pathways together with direct access to a variety of linked, fused, and bridged polyheterocyclic scaffolds. Indole 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;carbaldehydes with suitable isocyanides and aminoazines afford fused adducts through oxidative Pictet&#8211;Spengler processes, whereas indole 2&#8208;carbaldehyde yields linked indolocarbazoles under mild conditions, and a bridged macrocycle at high temperature. These novel structures are potent activators of the human aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway.

         <title>A Diarylacetonitrile as a Molecular Probe for the Detection of Polymeric Mechanoradicals in the Bulk State through a Radical Chain&#8208;Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2680-2683, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent molecular probe that functions as a scavenger of polymeric mechanoradicals was developed (see picture), and its fluorescence intensity was found to increase with increasing generation of radicals in the bulk. This probe enables the optical visualization and quantitative evaluation of polymeric radicals generated by polymer&#8208;chain scission of polymers that do not contain mechanophores.







Abstract
Since the beginning of polymer science, understanding the influence of mechanical stress on polymer chains has been a fundamental and important research topic. The detection of mechanoradicals generated by homolytic cleavage of the polymer chains in solution has been studied in many cases. However, the detection of mechanoradicals in the bulk is still limited owing to their high reactivity. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy to detect mechanoradicals visually and quantitatively using a chain&#8208;transfer agent that generates relatively stable fluorescent radicals as a molecular probe. Mechanoradicals generated by ball milling of polystyrene samples were successfully detected by using a diarylacetonitrile compound as a fluorescent molecular probe through this radical chain&#8208;transfer mechanism. This probe enables the visualization and quantitative evaluation of mechanoradicals generated by polymer&#8208;chain scission.

         <title>Mild C&#8211;C Bond Formation via Lewis Acid Catalyzed Oxetane Ring Opening with Soft Carbon Nucleophiles</title>

Mild C&#8722;C bond formation processes via ring&#8208;opening of oxetanes by soft carbon nucleophiles are described. These allow access to useful 1,n&#8208;oxygenated molecules and heterocycles. 







Abstract
Mild oxetane opening by soft carbon nucleophiles has been developed for efficient C&#8722;C bond formation. In the presence of LiNTf2 or TBSNTf2 as catalyst, silyl ketene acetals were found to be effective nucleophiles to generate a wide range of highly oxygenated molecules, which are key substructure in natural products like polyketides. Furthermore, intramolecular oxetane opening by a styrene&#8208;based carbon nucleophile via a Prins&#8208;type process was also achieved with Sc(OTf)3 as catalyst, leading to efficient formation of the useful 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzo[b]oxepine skeleton.

         <title>Exploring the Organometallic Route to Molecular Spin Qubits: The&#8201;[CpTi(cot)] Case</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2588-2593, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin coherence of the sandwich complex [CpTi(cot)] survives for tens of &#956;s at low temperature despite the presence of hydrogen atoms. This stems from its electronic structure and spin&#8208;vibrational properties, investigated by ab initio calculations and terahertz spectroscopy. This evaporable molecule with d
 singly occupied orbital is a promising candidate for a coherent spin qubit and for single spin addressing.







Abstract
The coherence time of the 17&#8208;electron, mixed sandwich complex [CpTi(cot)], (&#951;8&#8208;cyclooctatetraene)(&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)titanium, reaches 34&#8197;&#956;s at 4.5&#8197;K in a frozen deuterated toluene solution. This is a remarkable coherence time for a highly protonated molecule. The intramolecular distances between the Ti and H atoms provide a good compromise between instantaneous and spin diffusion sources of decoherence. Ab initio calculations at the molecular and crystal packing levels reveal that the characteristic low&#8208;energy ring rotations of the sandwich framework do not yield a too detrimental spin&#8208;lattice relaxation because of their small spin&#8211;phonon coupling. The volatility of [CpTi(cot)] and the accessibility of the semi&#8208;occupied, non&#8208;bonding d
 orbital make this neutral compound an ideal candidate for single&#8208;qubit addressing on surface and quantum sensing in combination with scanning probe microscopy.

Two 4&#8208;C&#8208;silylated glycosyl donors have been synthesized starting from cellulose. This new class of donors showed remarkably similar selectivity to and modestly more reactivity than their 4&#8208;C&#8208;deoxy analogue, allowing for very mild glycosylation reaction conditions and short reaction times.







Abstract
A method for introducing dimethylphenylsilyl at the 4&#8208;position in carbohydrates has been developed. Two C&#8208;silylated glycosyl donors were prepared via levoglucosenone, starting from cellulose. The glycosylation properties were studied using three glucoside acceptors, a 3&#8208;OH, 4&#8208;OH, and 6&#8208;OH. Compared with the 4&#8208;deoxy variant, it was found that the anomeric selectivity was influenced more by the C&#8208;2 substituents orientation than the silyl in the 4&#8208;position. In general, the reactivity of these donors was higher than the corresponding 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;analogue, albeit a competition experiment showed that the introduction of a C&#8722;Si increases the relative reactivity by a modest factor of around two.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208;, and Enantioselective 1,2&#8208;Arylfluorination of Internal Enamides</title>

The palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular oxidative 1,2&#8208;arylfluorination of internal enamides is reported. The removable oxazolidinone group enabled the highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective formation of &#946;&#8208;fluoroamine derivatives containing vicinal stereocenters with broad substrate scope under mild conditions.







Abstract
We herein describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of internal enamides, arylboronic acids, and Selectfluor to access the chiral &#946;&#8208;fluoroaminated moiety with up to 99&#8201;% ee. The prefunctionalized oxazolidinone substituted alkene enables the expedient construction of two vicinal stereocenters with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. The synthetic application is exhibited by selective transformation of the product into various vicinal benzylic fluoride derivatives.

         <title>Boranyl&#8208;Functionalized [Ge9] Clusters: Providing the Idea of Intramolecular Ge/B Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2648-2653, February 1, 2021. </description>

Upon reaction of silylated [Ge9] clusters with 1,3,2&#8208;diazaborolidines boranyl&#8208;functionalization is achieved. The presented experiments aim for the generation of frustrated Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs as predicted from quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.







Abstract
The unique three&#8208;dimensional structure of spherical, homoatomic nine&#8208;atom germanium clusters opens various possibilities for the spatial arrangement of functional groups. Ligands comprising lone pairs have recently been introduced in the cluster sphere, and we now report the addition of a boranyl group to the cluster featuring a Ge&#8722;B exo&#8208;cluster bond. The reaction of the twofold&#8208;silylated cluster [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2]2&#8722; (TMS=trimethylsilyl) with 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;diazaborolidines DABR&#8208;Cl leads to the first boranyl&#8208;functionalized [Ge9] clusters [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2DABR]&#8722; (R=methyl (1&#8201;a), iso&#8208;propyl (2&#8201;a), ortho&#8208;tolyl (3&#8201;a)). The anions 2&#8201;a and 3&#8201;a were structurally characterized as [NHCDippCu]+ complexes (NHCDipp=1,3&#8208;di(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolylidine) through single crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations manifest the frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) character of the boranyl&#8208;functionalized cluster [Ge9{Si(TMS)3}2BCy2]&#8722; (4&#8201;a).

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer&#8208;Based Smart Prodrug Delivery System for Specific Targeting, Prolonged Retention, and Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Triggered Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2663-2667, February 1, 2021. </description>

A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) based smart prodrug delivery nanoplatform was demonstrated with the ability to specifically target tumor sites with prolonged retention time and gradual tumor microenvironmental pH&#8208;triggered release. The MIP&#8208;based prodrug delivery is liver&#8208;independent but tumor&#8208;dependent, which not only greatly enhances tumor specificity but also expands the scope of applicable prodrugs.







Abstract
Prodrug and drug delivery systems are two effective strategies for improving the selectivity of chemotherapeutics. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have emerged as promising carriers in targeted drug delivery for cancer treatment, but they have not yet been integrated with the prodrug strategy. Reported here is an MIP&#8208;based smart prodrug delivery system for specific targeting, prolonged retention time, and tumor microenvironment&#8208;triggered release. 5&#8242;&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;5&#8208;fluorocytidine (DFCR) and sialic acid (SA) were used as a prodrug and a marker for tumor targeting, respectively. Their co&#8208;imprinted nanoparticles were prepared as a smart carrier. Prodrug&#8208;loaded MIP specifically and sustainably accumulated at the tumor site and then gradually released. Unlike conventional prodrug designs, which often require in&#8208;liver bioconversion, this MIP&#8208;based prodrug delivery is liver&#8208;independent but tumor&#8208;dependent. Thus, this study opens new access to the development of smart prodrug delivery nanoplatforms.

         <title>Enantioselective, Visible Light Mediated Aza Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi Reactions of Quinoxalinones</title>

Azetidines can be enantioselectively prepared from the title compounds and various 1&#8208;arylethenes. An intramolecular variant of the reaction is also possible, and the lactam ring of the products 1 can be readily cleaved without loss of enantiopurity.







Abstract
3&#8208;Substituted quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and various aryl&#8208;substituted or tethered olefins underwent an enantioselective, inter&#8208; or intramolecular aza Patern&#242;&#8211;B&#252;chi reaction upon irradiation at &#955;=420&#8197;nm in the presence of a chiral sensitizer (10&#8197;mol&#8201;%). For the intermolecular reaction with 1&#8208;arylethenes as olefin components, the scope of the reaction was studied (14 examples, 50&#8211;99&#8201;% yield, 86&#8211;98&#8201;% ee). The absolute and relative configuration of the products were elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The reaction is suggested to occur by triplet energy transfer in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded 1:1 complex between the imine substrate and the catalyst. The intramolecular cycloaddition, consecutive reactions of the product azetidines, and an alternative reaction mode of quinoxalinones were investigated in preliminary experiments.

The reaction is suggested to occur by triplet energy transfer in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded 1:1 complex between the imine substrate and the catalyst. The intramolecular cycloaddition, consecutive reactions of the product azetidines, and an alternative reaction mode of quinoxalinones were investigated in preliminary experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Tubular DNA Nanodevice as a siRNA/Chemo&#8208;Drug Co&#8208;delivery Vehicle for Combined Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2594-2598, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autonomous tubular DNA nanodevice is constructed to deliver a chemotherapeutic drug and siRNAs. This nanodevice can realize on&#8208;demand targeting, respond to stimuli in the intracellular environment and release multiple molecular payloads for combined antitumor activity.







Abstract
Using the DNA origami technique, we constructed a DNA nanodevice functionalized with small interfering RNA (siRNA) within its inner cavity and the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX), intercalated in the DNA duplexes. The incorporation of disulfide bonds allows the triggered mechanical opening and release of siRNA in response to intracellular glutathione (GSH) in tumors to knockdown genes key to cancer progression. Combining RNA interference and chemotherapy, the nanodevice induced potent cytotoxicity and tumor growth inhibition, without observable systematic toxicity. Given its autonomous behavior, exceptional designability, potent antitumor activity and marked biocompatibility, this DNA nanodevice represents a promising strategy for precise drug design for cancer therapy.

         <title>Insights into the Topology and the Formation of a Genuine pp&#963; Bond: Experimental and Computed Electron Densities in Monoanionic Trichlorine [Cl3]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2569-2573, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the 3c&#8211;4e bond of a symmetric trichlorine anion [Cl]&#8722; was characterized by experimental charge density investigations and compared to two asymmetric cases. Quantum&#8208;chemical DFT calculations for both periodic crystals and isolated molecules/ions flank those studies. There appears to be a smooth transition from the asymmetric to the symmetric compound.







Abstract
So far, several publications have discussed the bonding concepts in polyhalides on a theoretical basis. In particular, the trichlorine monoanion is of great interest because its structure should be symmetrical and show two equidistant Cl&#8722;Cl bonds. However, apart from matrix&#8208;isolation studies, only asymmetric trichlorine anions have been reported so far. Herein, the trichlorine monoanions in 2&#8208;chloroethyltrimethylammonium trichloride [NMe3EtCl][Cl3], 1, tetramethylammonium trichloride [NMe4][Cl3], 2, and tetrapropylammonium trichloride [NnPr4][Cl3], 3, are analysed. High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray structures and experimental charge density analyses supported by periodic quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide insight into the influence of the crystalline environment on the structure of these [Cl3]&#8722; anions as well as into the progress of the bond formation between a dichlorine molecule and a Cl&#8722; anion.

         <title>Evidence of a Phenolic Pool as a Key Intermediate for Zeolite&#8208;Catalyzed Lignin Pyrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2643-2647, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first real&#8208;time experimental observation and speciation of a phenolic pool is reported. The phenolic pool, which features equidistant grouping&#8208;distribution patterns, originates from the repolymerization of monomeric units and acts as a key mechanistic step for both valuable aromatic products and undesired coke.







Abstract
The phenolic pool is considered to be an important intermediate during the catalytic conversion of biomass. However, no direct evidence has been reported on its full picture on a molecular level due to the huge challenges in probing the reactive and lowly volatile phenolic oligomers with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies. Herein, we report the online detection and structural identification of a phenolic pool by utilizing in&#8208;situ atmospheric&#8208;pressure photoionization mass spectrometry, demonstrating that the phenolic pool is formed through repolymerization of monomers with an equidistant group pattern and acts as a key mechanistic step for both valuable aromatic products and undesired coke. The exploration of the real reactive species is also of great importance for the rational design and synthesis of advanced catalysts with high activity.

         <title>A Coplanar &#960;&#8208;Extended Quinoxaline Based Hole&#8208;Transporting Material Enabling over 21&#8201;% Efficiency for Dopant&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Quinoxaline derivatives, featuring with rotatable and chemically fixed thienyl substitutes, are introduced as the core for constructing dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs). The coplanar &#960;&#8208;extended quinoxaline&#8208;based HTM TQ4 achieves the best photovoltaic performance (exceed 21&#8201;%) among planar n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured dopant&#8208;free perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Developing dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs) is of vital importance for addressing the notorious stability issue of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, efficient dopant&#8208;free HTMs are scarce. Herein, we improve the performance of dopant&#8208;free HTMs featuring with a quinoxaline core via rational &#960;&#8208;extension. Upon incorporating rotatable or chemically fixed thienyl substitutes on the pyrazine ring, the resulting molecular HTMs TQ3 and TQ4 show completely different molecular arrangement as well as charge transporting capabilities. Comparing with TQ3, the coplanar &#960;&#8208;extended quinoxaline based TQ4 endows enriched intermolecular interactions and stronger &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, thus achieving a higher hole mobility of 2.08&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. It also shows matched energy levels and high thermal stability for application in PSCs. Planar n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured PSCs employing dopant&#8208;free TQ4 as HTM exhibits power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 21&#8201;% with excellent long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Encapsulation of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Derivatives: A Storable Feedstock for Preparation of [1.1.1]Propellane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2578-2582, February 1, 2021. </description>

&#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) encapsulation of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives could provide a bench&#8208;top&#8208;storable format for BCP derivatives. Furthermore, simple protocols for deiodination reaction of 1,3&#8208;diiodo BCP were developed to afford [1.1.1]propellane. Together, these findings provided novel and simple methodology for on&#8208;demand preparation of [1.1.1]propellane in a wide range of solvents (protic/aprotic/polar/non&#8208;polar) under mild conditions.







Abstract

     alt="&#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Encapsulation of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Derivatives: A Storable Feedstock for Preparation of [1.1.1]Propellane"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) encapsulation of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives could provide a bench&#8208;top&#8208;storable format for BCP derivatives. Furthermore, simple protocols for deiodination reaction of 1,3&#8208;diiodo BCP were developed to afford [1.1.1]propellane. Together, these findings provided novel and simple methodology for on&#8208;demand preparation of [1.1.1]propellane in a wide range of solvents (protic/aprotic/polar/non&#8208;polar) under mild conditions.

         <title>A Stable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene with a 1,1&#8242;&#8208;Ferrocenediyl Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2624-2628, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable cyclic diaminosilylene featuring a ferrocene&#8208;based backbone is reported. The dicoordinate SiII atom is part of a six&#8208;membered FeC2N2Si ring and shows a comparatively large bond angle of ca. 107&#176;. This N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene can activate strong bonds (C=O, N=O, B&#8722;H, N&#8722;H, P&#8722;H, O&#8722;H) under ambient conditions.







Abstract
The N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene [{Fe(&#951;5&#8208;C5H4&#8208;NDipp)2}Si] (1DippSi, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) shows an excellent combination of pronounced thermal stability and high reactivity towards small molecules. It reacts readily with CO2 and N2O, respectively affording (1DippSiO2)2C and (1DippSiO)2 as follow&#8208;up products of the silanone 1DippSiO. Its reactions with H2O, NH3, and FcPH2 (Fc=ferrocenyl) furnish the respective oxidative addition products 1DippSi(H)X (X=OH, NH2, PHFc). Its reaction with H3BNH3 unexpectedly results in B&#8722;H, instead of N&#8722;H, bond activation, affording 1DippSi(H)(BH2NH3). DFT results suggest that dramatically different mechanisms are operative for these H&#8722;X insertions.

         <title>Dinuclear Triple&#8208;Stranded Helicates Composed of Tetradentate Ligands with Aluminum(III) Chromophores: Optical Resolution and Multi&#8208;color Circularly Polarized Luminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2614-2618, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a set of chiroptical chromophores, dinuclear triple&#8208;stranded helicates, based on tetradentate ligands and AlIII ions, the right&#8208;handed (P) and left&#8208;handed (M) helicates are so stable that they do not undergo racemization. They show multi&#8208;color emission with mirror&#8208;image circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in solution and the solid&#8208;state. A mixture of different helicates produces white&#8208;light emission with CPL character.







Abstract
New chiroptical chromophores, dinuclear triple&#8208;stranded helicates, composed of tetradentate ligands with aluminum(III) ions, are described. These are synthesized in two steps using inexpensive pyrrole derivatives, hydrazine, and aluminum chloride. These molecular architectures (ALPHY) show multi&#8208;color (cyan, yellow, and orange) photoluminescence in solution and in the solid&#8208;state, which depends on the substituents of the ligands. The photoluminescence quantum yields of helicates were up to 54&#8201;%. The right&#8208;handed (P) and left&#8208;handed (M) helicates are so stable that they do not undergo racemization in some solvents and are mirror images according to circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with an absolute luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of up to the 10&#8722;3 order. Mixing the different helicates produces white&#8208;light emission with CPL characters. This study offers a glimpse into the potential applications of chromophores with diverse photophysical properties.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Driven Extraction of Bioreceptors into Polymeric Membranes for Label&#8208;Free Potentiometric Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2609-2613, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magneto&#8208;controlled potentiometric sensing system was designed to achieve the direct potentiometric sensing of analytes based on hydrophilic bioreceptors. The magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;driven extraction of bioreceptors into polymeric membranes enables label&#8208;free and indicator&#8208;free potentiometric biosensing of a broad range of different target molecules.







Abstract
We report here the concept of a magnetically controlled extraction of hydrophilic bioreceptors into polymeric membranes for bioassays. The potentiometric assay relies on the intrinsic charges of an antimicrobial peptide and its unique recognition abilities, which can eliminate the probe labeling and indicator addition. The target binding event could effectively prevent the extraction of the peptide into the polymeric membrane doped with an ion exchanger, thus resulting in a potential change. The potentiometric response properties of the peptide assembled on magnetic beads can be dynamically controlled and modulated by applying a magnetic field. Staphylococcus aureus, as a model of food&#8208;borne pathogens, was measured at levels down to 10&#8197;CFU&#8201;mL&#8722;1. Based on this sensing strategy, a potentiometric array was developed for the pattern recognition of bacteria. The proposed general platform can be used for potentiometric biosensing using other hydrophilic bioreceptors.

         <title>Rapid Unperturbed&#8208;Tissue Analysis for Intraoperative Cancer Diagnosis Using an Enzyme&#8208;Activated NIR&#8208;II Nanoprobe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2637-2642, February 1, 2021. </description>

A matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)14&#8208;activated NIR&#8208;II nanoprobe (A&amp;MMP@Ag2S&#8208;AF7P) is presented for rapid unperturbed&#8208;tissue analysis for ex&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vivo neuroblastoma diagnosis. Instant illumination of the lesion and well&#8208;defined tumor margins make the nanoprobe a suitable rapid diagnostic reagent for cancer surgical or tissue biopsy procedures.







Abstract
Accurate intraoperative tissue identification is critical to tumor surgery. However, conventional methods are labor&#8208; and time&#8208;intensive, which greatly delay the intraoperative decision&#8208;making. Herein, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)14&#8208;activated NIR&#8208;II nanoprobe (A&amp;MMP@Ag2S&#8208;AF7P) is presented for rapid unperturbed&#8208;tissue analysis for ex&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vivo neuroblastoma diagnosis. A&amp;MMP@Ag2S&#8208;AF7P displays negligible fluorescence in normal tissues but is activated quickly by inhibiting the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between Ag2S QDs and A1094 mediated by MMP14 overexpressed in neuroblastoma; meanwhile, the exposure of the membrane penetrating peptide R9 (TAT&#8208;peptide) results in efficient internalization of nanoprobes in the cancer cells, providing superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) tissue ratio. Instant illumination of the lesion and well&#8208;defined tumor margins make the nanoprobes a suitable rapid diagnostic reagent for cancer surgical or tissue biopsy procedures.

Herein, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)14&#8208;activated NIR&#8208;II nanoprobe (A&amp;MMP@Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&#8208;AF7P) is presented for rapid unperturbed&#8208;tissue analysis for ex&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vivo neuroblastoma diagnosis. A&amp;MMP@Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&#8208;AF7P displays negligible fluorescence in normal tissues but is activated quickly by inhibiting the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S QDs and A1094 mediated by MMP14 overexpressed in neuroblastoma; meanwhile, the exposure of the membrane penetrating peptide R9 (TAT&#8208;peptide) results in efficient internalization of nanoprobes in the cancer cells, providing superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal (T/N) tissue ratio. Instant illumination of the lesion and well&#8208;defined tumor margins make the nanoprobes a suitable rapid diagnostic reagent for cancer surgical or tissue biopsy procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of a Sidewall Fragment of a (12,0) Carbon Nanotube</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2658-2662, February 1, 2021. </description>

A highly strained carbon nanobelt (CNB) containing an octabenzo[12]cyclacene unit was synthesized and isolated in a single crystal form. It shows local aromaticity and highly shielded chemical environment in the cavity. Benzo&#8208;annulation and phenyl substitution are crucial to the successful synthesis of this CNB.







Abstract
Synthesis of a carbon nanobelt (CNB) is a very challenging task in organic chemistry. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of an octabenzo[12]cyclacene based CNB (6), which can be regarded as a sidewall fragment of a (12,0) carbon nanotube. The key intermediate compound, a tetraepoxy nanobelt (5), was first synthesized by Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, and subsequent reductive aromatization gave the fully conjugated CNB 6. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis unambiguously confirmed the belt&#8208;shaped structure of 6. 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum and theoretical calculations (ACID, NICS, and 2D/3D ICSS) revealed localized aromaticity and stronger shielding chemical environment in the inner region of the belt. The optical properties (absorption and emission) of 6 were studied and correlated to its electronic structure. Strain analysis indicates that the phenyl substituents at the zigzag edges are crucial to the successful synthesis of 6. This report presents a new strategy towards highly strained CNBs.

         <title>An Open Microfluidic Chip for Continuous Sampling of Solute from a Turbulent Particle Suspension</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2654-2657, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open microfluidic chip for aqueous phase sampling from high&#8208;solids content turbulent slurries is demonstrated for mineral processing and pharmaceutical tablet dissolution slurries. The chip's 25&#8197;&#956;m slit dampens turbulence in the outside fluid and allows partial exchange of inner and outer fluids, without entraining microparticles (&gt;1&#8197;&#956;m). The microfluidic flow profile, not size&#8208;exclusion, enables the selective sampling of aqueous phase.







Abstract
High solids content complicates in&#8197;situ analysis of chemical processing, biological suspensions, and environmental streams. In most cases, analytical methods require at least one pre&#8208;treatment step of a small volume of sample before a particle&#8208;free fluid can be analyzed. We have developed a continuous in&#8197;situ sampler that can &#8220;sip&#8221; particle&#8208;free solution from a turbulent high solids content stream (a slurry). An open microfluidic chip with an extended slit opening shields the internal laminar flow from the turbulence outside. Unlike other open chips, our chip does not require close proximity to a solid surface and operates in turbulent environments for hours without maintenance. Two applications are demonstrated: monitoring FeIII in a stirred slurry of mixed ore particles at high solids loading (4&#8201;%wt) and paracetamol tablet dissolution profiles for two different formulations.

         <title>Chemoselective C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;Bond Activation of the Most Stable Ring in Biphenylene**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2619-2623, February 1, 2021. </description>

The chemoselective cleavage of an arene ring in biphenylene is reported using an aluminum(I) complex. The reaction proceeds with complete integrity of the central four&#8208;membered ring despite this ring containing the weakest C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond in the hydrocarbon scaffold.







Abstract
The chemoselective cleavage of a six&#8208;membered aromatic ring in biphenylene is reported using an aluminum(I) complex. This type of selectivity is unprecedented. In every example of transition metal mediated C&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;bond activation reported to date, the reaction occurs at the central four&#8208;membered ring of biphenylene. Insight into the origin of chemoselectivity was obtained through a detailed mechanistic analysis (isolation of an intermediate, DFT studies, activation strain analysis). In conclusion, the divergent reactivity can be attributed to differences in both the symmetry and radial extension of the frontier molecular orbitals of the aluminum(I) fragment compared to that of common transition metal fragments.

         <title>Overcoming the Anisotropic Growth Limitations of Free&#8208;Standing Single&#8208;Crystal Halide Perovskite Films</title>

It is challenging to grow single&#8208;crystal halide perovskite films with large lateral size and much thinner thickness. A surface energy modifying strategy was proposed that achieves anisotropic growth, freestanding single&#8208;crystal CsPbBr3 halide perovskite films with a thickness less than 100&#8197;nm and a lateral size close to one centimeter.







Abstract
It is extremely challenging to grow single&#8208;crystal halide perovskite films (SCHPFs) with not only desired transport properties but also large lateral size with much thinner thickness. Here, we report the growth of freestanding single crystal CsPbBr3 SCHPFs with thickness less than 100&#8197;nm and a lateral size close to centimeter for the first time. A new model for growth kinetics (&#936;=Aexp[&#8722;(EA&#8722;Es)/(kBT)]) is proposed to address the surface energy and temperature effect on the growth rate of ultrathin CsPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal film. The experimental results and DFT calculations both demonstrated that the surfactant plays a critical role in modifying the surface energy and achieving anisotropic growth. This work opens new opportunities for high&#8208;quality SCHPFs with large lateral size and controllable thickness that may find wide applications for optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Engineered Photoluminescence Tuning in Zero&#8208;Dimensional Lead Bromide Trimer Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 5, Page 2583-2587, February 1, 2021. </description>

The self&#8208;trapped exciton emission of zero&#8208;dimensional metal halide, (bmpy)9[ZnBr4]2[Pb3Br11] (bmpy: 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyrrolidinium), is delicately varied via a high pressure technique. Through the pressure&#8208;induced structural distortion, a clear change of emission color, intense white&#8208;light emission and the corresponding variation in structure&#8211;property relationships are achieved.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides are promising light emitters. However, it is still challenging to accurately design their structures with targeted photoluminescence properties. Herein, high pressure is used to change the self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission of 0D (bmpy)9[ZnBr4]2[Pb3Br11] (bmpy: 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyrrolidinium). Under initial compression, the simultaneous contraction and distortion of photoactive [Pb3Br11]5&#8722; vary the equilibrium of STE emissions between different excited states, tuning the emission color from yellow green to cyan. Notably, sufficient structural distortion under continuous compression leads to the formation of more and deeper STE states, exhibiting an unprecedented broadband white&#8208;light emission. This study reveals the structure&#8208;dependent optical properties of 0D hybrid metal halides, providing novel insights into the mechanism of STE emission.

Through the pressure&#8208;induced structural distortion, a clear change of emission color, intense white&#8208;light emission and the corresponding variation in structure&#8211;property relationships are achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides are promising light emitters. However, it is still challenging to accurately design their structures with targeted photoluminescence properties. Herein, high pressure is used to change the self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission of 0D (bmpy)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;[ZnBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;] (bmpy: 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyrrolidinium). Under initial compression, the simultaneous contraction and distortion of photoactive [Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;5&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; vary the equilibrium of STE emissions between different excited states, tuning the emission color from yellow green to cyan. Notably, sufficient structural distortion under continuous compression leads to the formation of more and deeper STE states, exhibiting an unprecedented broadband white&#8208;light emission. This study reveals the structure&#8208;dependent optical properties of 0D hybrid metal halides, providing novel insights into the mechanism of STE emission.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Palette of Minimally&#8208;Tagged Sucrose Analogues for Real&#8208;time Raman Imaging of Intracellular Plant Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sucrose is the main saccharide transported in plants and plays an essential role in energy metabolism; however, there are no analogues for real&#8208;time imaging in live cells. We have optimised a synthetic approach to prepare sucrose analogues including very small (~50 Da or less) Raman tags in the fructose moiety. Spectroscopic analysis identified the alkyne&#8208;tagged compound  6  as a sucrose analogue recognised by endogenous transporters in live cells and with higher Raman intensity than other sucrose derivatives. Herein we demonstrate the application of compound  6  as the first optical probe to visualise real&#8208;time uptake and intracellular localisation of sucrose in live plant cells using Raman microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>GlycoBODIPYs: Sugars Serving as Natural Stock for Water&#8208;soluble Fluorescent Probes of Complex Chiral Morphology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A range of unprocessed, reducing sugar substrates (mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisaccharides) is shown to enter a straightforward 4&#8208;step synthetic route to water&#8208;soluble, uncharged BODIPY derivatives with unimpaired chiral integrity and high fluorescence efficiency. A wide compatibility to several postfunctionalizations is demonstrated suggesting an universal utility of the multifunctional glycoconjugate, which we call GlycoBODIPY. Knoevenagel condensations are able to promote a red&#8208;shift, furnishing strongly fluorescent red and far&#8208;red glycoconjugates of high hydrophilicity. The synthetic outcome was studied by X&#8208;ray crystallography and by comprehensive photophysical investigations in several solvent systems. Furthermore, cell experiments underline an efficient cell uptake and demonstrate differential cell targeting as a function of the integrated chiral information.</dc:description>

         <title>A Molecular Reporter for Visualizing Interfacial Jamming Based on An Aggregation Induced Emission Platform</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the interfacial jamming of nanoparticles (NPs) a load&#8208;bearing network of NPs forms as the areal density of NPs increases, converting the assembly from a liquid&#8208;like to a solid&#8208;like assembly. Unlike vitrification, the lineal packing of the NPs in the network are denser, while the remaining NPs can remain in a liquid&#8208;like state. Being able to determine the point at which the assemblies jam, as opposed to vitrify, is a challenge, since both processes lead to a solid&#8208;like behavior of the assemblies. Here, we show a real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging method with a high fluorescence contrast to probe the evolution of the interfacial dynamics of NP&#8208;surfactants (NPSs) at the water/oil interface using aggregation induced emission (AIE) as a reporter for the transition of the assemblies into the jammed state. At densities where the AIEgens can move and rotate the AIEgens show typical fluorescence behavior. However, when aggregation of these fluorophores occurs, the intermolecular separation distance is sufficiently small to arrest rotation and a significant enhancement in the fluorescence intensity occurs. This fluorescence behavior provides a unique means to probe jamming behavior.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering electron&#8208;hole migration pathways using oxygen vacancies in tungsten oxides to enhance their photocatalytic oxygen evolution performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overall water splitting efficiency is mainly restricted by the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution. Therefore, it is essential to develop active oxygen evolution catalysts. In this regard, we designed and synthesized a tungsten oxide catalyst with oxygen vacancies for photocatalytic oxygen evolution, which exhibited a higher oxygen evolution rate of 683 &#181;mol&#183;h  &#8208;1  &#183;g  &#8208;1  than that of pure WO  3  (159 &#181;mol&#183;h  &#8208;1  &#183;g  &#8208;1  ). Subsequent study through transient absorption spectroscopy found that the oxygen vacancies can produce electron trapping states to inhibit the direct recombination of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, a Pt cocatalyst can promote electron trapped states to participate in the reaction to improve the photocatalytic performance further. This work uses femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to explain the photocatalytic oxygen evolution mechanism of inorganic materials and provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;efficiency water&#8208;splitting catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Blatter Radical&#8208;Grafted Mesoporous Silica as Prospective Nanoplatform for Spin Manipulation at Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum computing and quantum information processing (QC/QIP) crucially depend on the availability of suitable quantum bits (qubits) and methods of their manipulation. Most qubit candidates known to date face obstacles for implementation at ambient conditions. In this work we propose radical&#8208;grafted mesoporous silica as a versatile and prospective nanoplatform for spin&#8208;based QC/QIP. Extremely stable Blatter&#8208;type organic radicals are used, whose electron spin decoherence time is profoundly long even at room temperature (up to  T  m  ~2.3 &#181;s), thus allowing efficient spin manipulation by microwave pulses. Mesoporous structure of such composites is nuclear&#8208;spin free and provides additional opportunities of embedding guest molecules into the structure channels. Robustness and tunability of these materials promotes them as highly promising nanoplatforms for future QC/QIP developments.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Size Expansion and Turn&#8208;on Luminescence of Atomically Precise Silver Clusters by Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of high&#8208;nuclearity silver(I) clusters remains elusive and their potential applications are still underdeveloped. Herein, we firstly prepared a chain&#8208;like thiolated Ag(I) complex {[Ag18(StBu)10(NO3)8(CH3CN)2(H2O)2]&#183;[Ag18(StBu)10(NO3)8(CH3CN)6]}n  (abbreviated as  Ag18) in which two similar  Ag18  clusters are assembled by NO3&#8208;  anions. The solution containing  Ag18  reacted with hydrogen sulfide with controlled concentration, promptly producing another identifiable and bright red&#8208;emitting high&#8208;nuclearity silver(I) cluster, Ag62(S)13(StBu)32(NO3)4  (abbreviated as  Ag62). We tracked the transformation using time&#8208;dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), UV&#8208;Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra. Based on this cluster transformation, we further developed an ultra&#8208;sensitive turn&#8208;on sensor detecting H2S gas with an ultrafast response time (30 s) at a low detection limit (0.13 ppm). This work opens a new way of understanding the growth of metal clusters and developing their luminescent sensing applications.</dc:description>

Herein, we firstly prepared a chain&#8208;like thiolated Ag(I) complex {[Ag18(StBu)10(NO3)8(CH3CN)2(H2O)2]&#183;[Ag18(StBu)10(NO3)8(CH3CN)6]}n  (abbreviated as  Ag18) in which two similar  Ag18  clusters are assembled by NO3&#8208;  anions. The solution containing  Ag18  reacted with hydrogen sulfide with controlled concentration, promptly producing another identifiable and bright red&#8208;emitting high&#8208;nuclearity silver(I) cluster, Ag62(S)13(StBu)32(NO3)4  (abbreviated as  Ag62). We tracked the transformation using time&#8208;dependent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), UV&#8208;Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra. Based on this cluster transformation, we further developed an ultra&#8208;sensitive turn&#8208;on sensor detecting H2S gas with an ultrafast response time (30 s) at a low detection limit (0.13 ppm). This work opens a new way of understanding the growth of metal clusters and developing their luminescent sensing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>TM LDH Meets Birnessite: A 2D&#8208;2D Hybrid Catalyst with Long&#8208;term Stability for Water Oxidation at Industrial Operating Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient noble&#8208;metal free electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production via water splitting. Inspired by Nature&#8217;s oxygen evolution cluster in photosystem II and the highly efficient artificial OER catalyst of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH), we designed an electrostatic 2D&#8208;2D assembly route and successfully synthesized a 2D LDH(+)&#8208;Birnessite(&#8208;) hybrid. The as&#8208;constructed LDH(+)&#8208;Binessite(&#8208;) hybrid catalyst showed advanced catalytic activity and excellent stability towards OER under a close to industrial hydrogen production condition (85 &#186;C and 6 M KOH) for more than 20 h at the current densities larger than 100 mA/cm  2  . Experimentally, we found that besides the enlarged interlayer distance, the flexible interlayer NiFe LDH(+) also modulates the electronic structure of layered MnO  2  , and creates an electric field between NiFe LDH(+) and Birnessite(&#8208;), wherein OER occurs with a greatly decreased overpotential. DFT calculations confirmed the interlayer LDH modulations of the OER process, attributable to the distinct electronic distributions and environments. Upshifting the Fe&#8208;3d orbitals in LDH promotes electron transfer from the layered MnO  2  to LDH, significantly boosting up the OER performance. This work opens a new way to fabricating highly efficient OER catalyst for industrial water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Reductive Cyanation and Phosphonylation of Secondary Amides by Ir and Chiral Thiourea Sequential Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of transition metal catalysis and organocatalysis increasingly offers chemists opportunities to realize diverse unprecedented chemical transformations. By combining iridium with thiourea catalysis, direct enantioselective reductive cyanation and phosphonylation of secondary amides have been accomplished for the first time for the synthesis of enantioenriched chiral &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates. The protocol is highly efficient and enantioselective, providing a novel route to the synthesis of optically active &#945;&#8208;functionalized amines from the simple, readily available feedstocks.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabling Site&#8208;Isolation of Viologen&#8208;Derived Electron Transfer Mediators for Stable Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;transfer is the rate&#8208;limiting step in photocatalytic water splitting. Viologen and its derivatives are able to act as electron transfer mediators (ETMs) to facilitate the rapid electron transfer from photosensitizers to active sites. Nevertheless, the electron&#8208;transfer ability often suffers from the formation of stable dipole structure through the coupling between cationic&#8208;radical&#8208;containing viologen&#8208;derived ETMs, by which the electron&#8208;transfer process becomes restricted. Herein, cyclic diquats, a kind of viologen&#8208;derived ETM, are integrated into a 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) through a post&#8208;quaternization reaction. The content and distribution of embedded diquat&#8208;ETMs are elaborately controlled, leading to the favorable site&#8208;isolated arrangement. The resulting materials integrate the photosensitizing units and ETMs into one system, exhibiting the enhanced hydrogen evolution rate (34600 &#956;mol h  &#8208;1  g  &#8208;1  ) and sustained performances when compared to a single&#8208;module COF and a COF/ETM mixture. The integration strategy applied in a 2D COF platform promotes the consecutive electron&#8208;transfer in photochemical processes through the multi&#8208;component cooperation.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;Supported Molecular Electrocatalysis for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesizing molecule@support hybrids is appealing to improve molecular electrocatalysis. We report herein metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;supported Co porphyrins for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with improved activity and selectivity. Co porphyrins can be grafted on MOF surfaces through ligand exchange. A variety of porphyrin@MOF hybrids were made using this method. Grafted Co porphyrins showed boosted ORR activity with large (&gt; 70 mV) anodic shift of the half&#8208;wave potential compared to ungrafted porphyrins. By using active MOFs for peroxide reduction, the number of electrons transferred per O  2  &#160;increased from 2.65 to 3.70, showing significantly improved selectivity for the 4e ORR. We demonstrated that H  2  O  2  &#160;generated from O  2  &#160;reduction at Co porphyrins is further reduced at MOF surfaces, leading to improved 4e ORR. As a practical demonstration, these hybrids were used as air electrode catalysts in Zn&#8208;air batteries, which exhibited equal performance to that with Pt&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Keggin&#8208;type polyaluminum cations belong to a unique class of compound with their large positive charge, hydroxo bridges, and divergent isomerization/oligomerization. Previously reports indicate that oligomerization of this species can only occur through one isomer (&#948;), but herein we report the isolation of largest Keggin&#8208;type cluster that occurs through self&#8208;condensation of four &#949;&#8208;isomers &#949;&#8208;GeAl128+ to form [Ge4O16Al48(OH)108(H2O)24]20+ cluster (Ge4Al48). The cluster was crystallized and structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and the elemental composition was confirmed by ICP&#8208;MS and SEM&#8208;EDS.&#160; Additional dynamic light scattering experiments confirms the presence of the Ge4Al48 in thermally aged solutions. DFT calculations reveal that a single atom Ge substitution in tetrahedral site of &#949;&#8208;isomer is the key for the formation of Ge4Al48 because it activates deprotonation at key surface sites that control the self&#8208;condensation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Giant Optical Activity in 2D Hybrid Copper Halides: Novel Material for Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic metal halides have emerged as highly promising materials for a wide range of applications in optoelectronics. Incorporating chiral organic molecules into metal halides allows for the expansion of their unique optical and electronic properties to chiral optics. Herein, using chiral R&#8208; or S&#8208;methylbenzylamine (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA) as the organic component, we present the synthesis of chiral hybrid copper halides, (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)  2  CuCl  4  , and investigate their optical activity&#160;for the first time. Thin films of this material show a record anisotropic g&#8208;factor as high as ~0.06. Additionally, we discuss the origin of giant&#160;optical&#160;activity observed in (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)  2  CuCl  4  &#160;through theoretical modeling based on density functional theory (DFT) and&#160;demonstrate highly efficient second harmonic generation (SHG) in these samples.&#160;Our work provides insights into the design of chiral materials by structural engineering, building a new platform for chiral&#160;and nonlinear photonic device&#160;applications of the chiral hybrid copper halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Bubble&#8208;propelled Janus Gallium/Zinc Micromotors for Active Treatment of Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a bubble&#8208;propelled Janus gallium/zinc (Ga/Zn) micromotor with good biocompatibility and biodegradability for active target treatment for bacteria, as a robust antibacterial platform. The Janus Ga/Zn micromotors are fabricated by asymmetrically coating liquid metal Ga on Zn microparticles, and display self&#8208;propelling movement in the imitative gastroenteric acid (pH 0.5) at a speed of up to 383 &#956;m s  &#8208;1  under the propulsion of hydrogen bubbles generated by the zinc&#8208;acid reaction. This motion of Ga/Zn micromotors is enhanced by the Ga&#8208;Zn galvanic effect. The produced Ga(III) cations due to the degradation of Ga/Zn micromotors are served as a built&#8208;in antibiotic agent. The movement improves the diffusion of Ga(III) and results in a significant increase of the antibacterial efficiency against  H. pylori  , compared with passive Ga microparticle. Such Ga/Zn micromotors combine the self&#8208;propulsion, good biocompatibility and biodegradability, and Ga&#8208;based antibacterial properties, providing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the active treatment of bacterial infections.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasound Controlled Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Polarization of Platelet Decorated Microglia for Targeted Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize on&#8208;demand microglia polarization for controllable ischemic stroke therapy, a sono&#8208;sensitive hybrid microglia machine was prepared. Platelet membrane fused microglia have strong accumulation in cerebral vascular injury and can specifically polarize to anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotypes, upon external control by ultrasound irradiation, for angiogenesis and nerve regeneration, leading to survival and behavioral improvement of the stroke mice.







Abstract
Stroke is a lethal cerebral disease with severe sequelae and high mortality. Microglia, the main immune cell in the cerebrum, possess therapeutic potential for strokes as its specific anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype can reduce inflammation and promote neuron regeneration. However, the on&#8208;demand anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization of microglia at the stroke site is uncontrollable for therapeutic application. Here, we develop a platelet hybrid microglia platform which can specifically polarize to the anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype by ultrasound irradiation for targeted cerebrum repair after stroke. The engineered microglia have strong adherence to the injured cerebral vessels with platelet membrane fusion and realize on&#8208;demand anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization with ultrasound&#8208;responsive IL&#8208;4 liposome decoration. The intravenously injected microglia platform showed anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization at the stroke site with insonation, and accelerated the M2&#8208;type polarization of endogenous microglia for long&#8208;term stroke recovery. Satisfied prognoses were achieved with reduced apoptosis, promoted neurogenesis, and functional recovery, indicating the implications of the microglia platform for stroke therapy.

         <title>To Every Rule There is an Exception: A Rational Extension of Loewenstein's Rule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to Loewenstein's rule Al&#8722;O&#8722;Al motifs are energetically unstable in zeolites; here, using atomic scale simulations, the limitations of this rule are demonstrated and a rational extension is shown.







Abstract
Loewenstein's rule, which states that Al&#8722;O&#8722;Al motifs are energetically unstable, is fundamental to the understanding and design of zeolites. Here, using a combination of electronic structure calculations and lattice models, we show under which circumstances this rule becomes invalid and how it can be rationally extended using the chabasite framework for demonstration.

         <title>Triazenyl Alkynes as Versatile Building Blocks in Multicomponent Reactions: Diastereoselective Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Amino Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triazenyl alkynes serve as versatile building blocks in multicomponent reactions for diastereoselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino amides. The alkyne moiety acts as C2 fragment and the triazene group serves as directing group to modulate the transition state thus to achieve both chemical reactivity and diastereoselectivity. The triazene group also enables late&#8208;stage transformation. Diverse &#946;&#8208;amino amides were rapidly assembled in an operational simple and atom&#8208;economic process.







Abstract
Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) are powerful tool for the construction of polyfunctional molecules in an operationally simple and atom&#8208;economic manner, and the discovery of novel MCRs requests various building blocks. Herein, triazenyl alkynes were disclosed as versatile building blocks in a multicomponent reaction with carboxylic acids, aldehydes and anilines to furnish &#946;&#8208;amino amides with the achievement of high diastereoselectivity and structural diversity. In this process, triazenyl alkynes were bifunctional so that the alkyne moiety acts as C2 fragment and triazene serves as directing group to modulate the transition state thus achieving high diastereoselectivity, in consistence with DFT calculations. Furthermore, the triazenyl group also enables diverse late&#8208;stage transformation. This protocol opens a new vision for the discovery of building block and rational design of MCRs.

         <title>Formic Acid&#8208;Assisted Selective Hydrogenolysis of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Dimethylfuran over Bifunctional Pd Nanoparticles Supported on N&#8208;Doped Mesoporous Carbon</title>

         <dc:description>
Quantitative conversion of HMF to DMF was achieved in the presence of formic acid and H2 over the bifunctional Pd/NMC catalyst within 2&#8197;h. Experimental investigation and DFT calculation revealed that formic acid significantly enhances the reaction rate and shifts the dominant reaction pathway from the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group to the hydrogenolysis of the hydroxymethyl group via its protonation.







Abstract
Biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is regarded as one of the most promising platform chemicals to produce 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran (DMF) as a potential liquid transportation fuel. Pd nanoparticles supported on N&#8208;containing and N&#8208;free mesoporous carbon materials were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenolysis of HMF to DMF under mild reaction conditions. Quantitative conversion of HMF to DMF was achieved in the presence of formic acid (FA) and H2 over Pd/NMC within 2&#8197;h. The reaction mechanism, especially the multiple roles of FA, was explored through a detailed comparative study by varying hydrogen source, additive, and substrate as well as by applying in situ ATR&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The major role of FA is to shift the dominant reaction pathway from the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group to the hydrogenolysis of the hydroxymethyl group via the protonation by FA at the C&#8208;OH group, lowering the activation barrier of the C&#8722;O bond cleavage and thus significantly enhancing the reaction rate. XPS results and DFT calculations revealed that Pd2+ species interacting with pyridine&#8208;like N atoms significantly enhance the selective hydrogenolysis of the C&#8722;OH bond in the presence of FA due to their high ability for the activation of FA and the stabilization of H&#8722;.

         <title>Optochemical Control of DNA&#8208;Switching Circuits for Logic and Probabilistic Computation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report optochemically controlled DNA switching circuits for regulating computation functions, including multiple logic computation and probabilistic computation.







Abstract
Precise control of DNA&#8208;circuit functions facilitates the construction of complex DNA networks to perform sophisticated functions. Inspired by optochemical genetics with high precision for controlling and studying neural networks by photoregulation of membrane receptors, we herein report optochemically controlled DNA switching circuits for regulating computation functions. The DNA&#8208;switching circuits involve a CG&#8211;C+ triplex&#8208;based DNA switch that undergoes structural transition from triplex to duplex states after exposure to UV irradiation due to proton transfer, showing optochemical control. We demonstrate that the DNA&#8208;switching circuits enable the regulation of computation functions by optochemical control of the state of the DNA switch, including multiple logic computations and probabilistic computation. We hope this work will broaden DNA&#8208;circuit functions and facilitate the construction of complex DNA networks.

         <title>Evolution of the Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction Mechanism since the 1930s: Woodward, Houk with Woodward, and the Influence of Computational Chemistry on Understanding Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evolution of understanding of the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction mechanism is described, from R.&#8197;B. Woodward's boyhood visions, to Ken Houk's experiences as a graduate student in Woodward's laboratory, to today's dynamical view of Diels&#8211;Alder and higher&#8208;order cycloadditions. Roald Hoffmann's Coda gives his view of Woodward and the zig&#8208;zag processes of scientific discovery.







Abstract
This review article describes the evolution of Woodward's mechanistic thinking, beginning in the late 1930s and early 1940s with his proposal of a charge&#8208;transfer mechanism for the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, eventually leading to the Woodward&#8211;Katz two&#8208;stage concerted mechanism in 1959, and then to its mechanistic solution in terms of orbital symmetry control. Houk&#8242;s research in the Woodward labs, testing the predictions of this theory, is described. Subsequent modern calculations with quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations have shown that Woodward indeed had perfectly described not only the cyclopentadiene dimerization mechanism, but a new class of transition states now known as ambimodal or bis&#8208;pericyclic transition states. In recent years, the Houk group has found that ambimodal reactions are operative in the [6+4] cycloaddition. Molecular dynamics simulations of many Diels&#8211;Alder and ambimodal cycloadditions provide a time&#8208;resolved picture of how these reactions occur. Lastly, Roald Hoffmann provides a Coda in which he describes his joy in &#8220;being taken along the journey&#8221; of the cycloaddition story from Woodward's youth to today's trajectory simulations.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Amorphous Zn&#8208;Carbon Multichannel Fibers for Stable Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal has drawn wide attention as a competitive anode candidate for next&#8208;generation high energy density rechargeable batteries. However, the application of lithium metal anodes for practical batteries is still impeded by safety issues and low Coulombic efficiency caused mainly by the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites. Herein, two types of free&#8208;standing nitrogen&#8208;doped amorphous Zn&#8208;carbon multichannel fibers are synthesized as multifunctional hosts for lithium accommodation. The three&#8208;dimensional (3D) macroporous structures endow effectively reduced local current density, and the lithiophilic nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon and functional Zn nanoparticles served as preferred deposition sites with low nucleation barriers to guide uniform lithium deposition. As a result, the developed anodes exhibit remarkable electrochemical properties in terms of high Coulombic efficiency for more than 500 cycles at various current densities from 1 to 5 mA cm&#8208;2, and symmetric cells show long&#8208;term cycling duration over 2000 h. Moreover, full cells based on the developed anode and a LiFePO4 cathode also demonstrate superior rate capability and stable cycle life.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron in Prebiological Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research suggests that borate could have mediated the prebiotic synthesis of RNA precursors (ribose, ribonucleosides, and ribonucleotides) in reactions relevant for the origin of life. This minireview provides an overview of recent developments in prebiological chemistry related to boron species.







Abstract
Boron(III), as borate (or boric acid), mediates the synthesis of ribose, ribonucleosides, and ribonucleotides. These reactions are carried out under moderate temperatures (typically 70&#8211;95&#8201;&#176;C) with organic molecules (or their derivatives) detected in interstellar space and inorganic ions found in minerals on Earth (and could occur during early stages of prebiotic evolution). Research in this century suggests that borate was a relevant prebiological reagent, thus reinforcing the RNA world hypothesis as an explanation for the origin of life. Herein, these developments on prebiological chemistry related to boron species are reviewed.

         <title>One Polyketide Synthase, Two Distinct Products: Trans&#8208;Acting Enzyme&#8208;Controlled Product Divergence in Calbistrin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calbistrins are fungal polyketides consisting of the characteristic decalin and polyene moieties. Although the biosynthetic gene cluster of calbistrin A was recently identified, the pathway of calbistrin A biosynthesis has largely remained uninvestigated. Herein, we investigated the mechanism by which the backbone structures of calbistrins are formed, by heterologous and in vitro reconstitution of the biosynthesis and a structural biological study. Intriguingly, our analyses revealed that the decalin and polyene portions of calbistrins are synthesized by the single polyketide synthase (PKS) CalA, with the aid of the trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase CalK and the trans&#8208;acting methyltransferase CalH, respectively. We also determined that the esterification of the two polyketide parts is catalyzed by the acyltransferase CalD. Our study has uncovered a novel dual&#8208;functional PKS and thus broadened our understanding of how fungi synthesize diverse polyketide natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Organelle&#8208;Specific Photoactivation of DNA Nanosensors for Precise Profiling of Subcellular Enzymatic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of sensors with controllable localization for in situ imaging of subcellular levels of enzymatic activity is particularly challenging, despite the importance in understanding of their functions in diverse cellular processes. We introduce herein a spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled sensor technology that permits in situ localization and photoactivated imaging of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) within an intracellular organelle of choice (e.g., mitochondria and nucleus). The hybrid sensor platform is constructed by photoactivatable engineering of a DNA&#8208;based fluorescent probe and further combination with an upconversion nanoparticle and a specific organelle localization signal. Controlled localization and NIR light&#8208;mediated photoactivation of the sensor &#8220;on demand&#8221; effectively constrains the imaging signal to the organelle of interest, with improved subcellular resolution. We further demonstrate the application of the nanosensors for the imaging of subcellular APE1 translocation in response to oxygen stress in live cells. Moreover, the combination of organelle&#8208;specific targeting with the remotely&#8208;controlled photoactivation of the nanosensors allows the precise APE1 imaging in vivo. We envision that this site&#8208;specific sensor technology will become a valuable tool for in situ monitoring subcellular enzymatic activity that is difficult to access using traditional imaging probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Stacking Modes of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets through Host&#8208;Guest Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tuning of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanosheet stacking modes from molecular level was rarely explored although it significantly affected the&#160;properties and applications of nanosheets. Here, the different stacking modes of Zr&#8208;1, 3, 5&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)&#8208;benzene framework nanosheets were synthesized through the induction of different host&#8208;guest noncovalent interactions. The solvents of methyl benzene and ethyl acetate induced twisted stacking of nanosheets with the specific rotation angles of 12  o  , 18  o  , 24  o  and 6  o  , 18  o  , 24  o  , 30  o  , respectively, which was in agreement with theoretical calculations. Meanwhile, the alkanes were likely to vertically enter the pores of Zr&#8208;BTB nanosheets because of steric hindrance and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in the untwisted stacking of nanosheets. The untwisted ordered nanopores showed the excellent gas chromatographic separations of benzene derivative isomers, which was better than twisted nanosheets stacking and commercial columns. This work uncovers a rational strategy to control the stacking of two&#8208;dimensional MOF nanosheets.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The valence isoelectronic imido analogue H  2  S(N  t  Bu)  4  (  1  ) of sulfuric acid H  2  SO  4  was synthesized, isolated and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray charge density analysis.

         <title>Iron oxidation in Escherichia coli bacterioferritin ferroxidase centre, a site designed to react rapidly with H2O2 but slowly with O2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both O  2  and H  2  O  2  can oxidise iron at the ferroxidase centre (FC) of  Escherichia coli  bacterioferritin (EcBfr) but mechanistic details of the two reactions need clarification. UV&#8208;vis, EPR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopies have been used to follow the reactions when apo&#8208;EcBfr, pre&#8208;loaded anaerobically with Fe  2+  , was exposed to O  2  or H  2  O  2  . We show that O  2  binds di&#8208;Fe  2+  FC reversibly, two Fe  2+  ions are oxidised in concert and a H  2  O  2  molecule is formed and released to solution. This peroxide molecule further oxidises another di&#8208;Fe  2+  FC, at a rate ~1000 faster than O  2  , ensuring an overall 1:4 stoichiometry of iron oxidation by O  2  . Initially formed Fe  3+  can further react with H  2  O  2  (producing protein bound radicals) but relaxes within seconds to an H  2  O  2  &#8208;unreactive di&#8208;Fe  3+  form. The data obtained suggest that the primary role of EcBfr  in vivo  may be to detoxify H  2  O  2  rather than sequester iron.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient&#8208;Stable Two&#8208;Dimensional Titanium Carbide (MXene) Enabled by Iodine Etching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXene (e.g. Ti3C2) represents an important class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials owing to its unique metallic conductivity and tunable surface chemistry. However, the mainstream synthetic methods rely on the chemical etching of MAX powders (e.g. Ti3AlC2) using hazardous HF or alike, leading to MXene sheets with fluorine termination and poor ambient stability in colloidal dispersions. Here, we demonstrate a fluoride&#8208;free, iodine (I2) assisted etching route for preparing 2D MXene (Ti3C2Tx, T = O, OH) with oxygen&#8208;rich terminal groups and intact lattice structure. More than 71&#8201;% of sheets are thinner than 5 nm with an average size of 1.8 &#181;m. They present excellent thin&#8208;film conductivity of 1250 S cm&#8208;1 and great ambient stability in water for at least 2 weeks. 2D MXene sheets with abundant oxygen surface groups are excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors, delivering a high gravimetric capacitance of 293 F g&#8208;1 at a scan rate of 1 mV&#8201;s&#8722;1, superior to those made from fluoride&#8208;based etchants (&lt; 290 F g&#8208;1 at 1 mV&#8201;s&#8722;1). Our strategy provides a promising pathway for the facile and sustainable production of highly stable MXene materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Observation of Transition from Ferroelasticity to Ferroelectricity by Solvent Selective Effect in Anilinium Bromide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ferroelectrics are highly desirable for their lightweight, mechanical flexibility and biocompatibility. However, the rational design of organic ferroelectrics has always been faced with great challenges. Anilinium bromide (AB) has two structures reported in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, which might be an  mmm  F2/  m  type ferroelastic (AB&#8208;1). When we studied its ferroelasticity, we were surprised to discover that there was another crystal (AB&#8208;2) in H  2  O besides this one, and they were very difficult to separate. By changing the solvent, we found that AB&#8208;1 crystals could be formed in ethanol, where ferroelastic domains were visualized by polarized light microscopy, and AB&#8208;2 crystals could be obtained from various crystallisation solvents of methanol, isopropanol,  N  &#8208;butanol, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulphoxide, and  N  ,  N  &#8208;dimethylformamide, which undergo a ferroelectric phase transition with  mm  2F  m  , showing clear ferroelectricity in two phases. To our knowledge, the regulation of ferroelasticity to ferroelectricity by solvent selective effect is unprecedented in the field of ferroelectrics. This work offers an efficient exploratory path to enriching the family of organic ferroelectrics, and should inspire further exploration of the interplay between solvent effect and physical properties.</dc:description>

This work offers an efficient exploratory path to enriching the family of organic ferroelectrics, and should inspire further exploration of the interplay between solvent effect and physical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Perovskite Nanosheet Hydrogels with Mechanochromic Structural Color</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural color colloidal sols of perovskite nanosheets were synthesized and were immobilized in a polymer hydrogel film by in&#8208;situ photopolymerization, leading to a novel mechanochromic material. Visible absorption spectroscopy, polarized optical microscopy and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering revealed that the nanosheets are aligned parallel to the film surface with the periodic distance of up to ca. 300 nm, giving the structural color tunable over full color range. The present structural color gel showed reversible mechanochromic response that detects weak stress of 1 kPa with the quick response time less than 1 ms as well as high mechanical toughness (compressive breaking stress of up to 3 MPa). These excellent properties are suitable for applications for mechano&#8208;sensors and displays.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the Electrocatalysis of MXene by&#160;Plasmon&#8208;induced Thermalization and Hot&#8208;electron Injection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The MXenes attract great interest in catalytic and energy applications but suffer from inferior redox activity. An efficient strategy is presented to boost the intrinsic electrochemical activity of MXenes for electrocatalysis in varied chemical environments by utilizing their plasmonic response to electromagnetic waves. The plasmonic MXenes induce a significant thermoplasmonic effect to reduce the endothermic enthalpy and potential barrier of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the vis&#8208;near&#8208;infrared region. Simultaneous hot electron injection in a prolonged timescale of sub&#8208;femtosecond&#8208;picosecond also remarkably facilitates interfacial charge transfer and decreases the activation energy of the reaction. Both effects boost the HER activity of various types of MXenes for over 5 folds with improved kinetics and Faradaic efficiency in full pH range.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Modification of Black Phosphorus with Group 13 Lewis Acids for Ambient Protection and Electronic Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we introduce a facile, solution&#8208;phase protocol to modify the Lewis basic surface of few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (&lt;italic&gt;b&lt;/italic&gt;P) and demonstrate its effectiveness at providing ambient stability and tuning of electronic properties. Commercially available group 13 Lewis acids that range in electrophilicity, steric bulk, and Pearson hard/soft&#8208;ness are evaluated. The nature of the interaction between the Lewis acids and the &lt;italic&gt;b&lt;/italic&gt;P lattice is investigated using a range of microscopic (optical, atomic force, scanning electron) and spectroscopic (energy dispersive, X&#8208;ray photoelectron) methods. Al and Ga halides are most effective at preventing ambient degradation of &lt;italic&gt;b&lt;/italic&gt;P (&amp;gt;84 h for AlBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and the resulting field&#8208;effect transistors show excellent &lt;italic&gt;IV&lt;/italic&gt; characteristics, photocurrent, and current stability, and are significantly p&#8208;doped. This protocol, chemically matched to &lt;italic&gt;b&lt;/italic&gt;P and compatible with device fabrication, opens a path for deterministic and persistent tuning of the electronic properties in &lt;italic&gt;b&lt;/italic&gt;P.</dc:description>

         <title>Site Selective Chlorination of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds Suitable for Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C(  sp  3  )&#8722;Cl bonds are present in numerous biologically active small molecules and an ideal route for their preparation is by the chlorination of a C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H bond. However, most current methods for the chlorination of C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H bonds are insufficiently site&#8208;selective and tolerant of functional groups to be applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. We report a method for the highly selective chlorination of tertiary and benzylic C(  sp  3  )&#8722;H bonds to produce the corresponding chlorides, generally in high yields. The reaction occurs with a mixture of an azidoiodinane, which generates a selective H&#8208;atom abstractor under mild conditions, and a readily&#8208;accessible and inexpensive copper(II) chloride complex, which efficiently transfers a chlorine atom. The reaction&#8217;s exceptional functional group tolerance is demonstrated by the chlorination of &gt;30 diversely functionalized substrates and the late&#8208;stage chlorination of a dozen derivatives of natural products and active pharmaceutical ingredients.</dc:description>

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Enabled O3 Phase Stabilization for Manganese&#8208;rich Layered Sodium Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;rich layered oxide materials hold great potential as low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;capacity cathodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries. However, they usually form P2 phase and suffer from fast capacity fade. In this work, an O3 phase sodium cathode has been developed out of a Li and Mn&#8208;rich layered material by leveraging the creation of transition metal (TM) and oxygen vacancies and the electrochemical exchange of Na and Li. The Mn&#8208;rich layered cathode material remains primarily O3 phase during sodiation/desodiation and can have a full sodiation capacity of ~220 mAh/g. It delivers ~160 mAh/g specific capacity between 2&#8208;3.8V with &gt;86% retention over 250 cycles. Systematic characterizations and computational studies revealed that the TM and oxygen vacancies pre&#8208;formed in the sodiated material enables a &#8220;reversible&#8221; migration of TMs from the TM layer to the tetrahedral sites in the Na layer upon de&#8208;sodiation and sodiation. The migration creates metastable states, leading to increased kinetic barrier that prohibits a complete O3&#8208;P3 phase transition, hence stabilizing the structure and battery performance. This work provides a critical insight on the role of vacancies in TM migration and stabilization of phase transition, and sheds light on the future development of high performance and stable cathode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries and beyond.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: A method for the synthesis of ketones from aldehydes and boronic acids via a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8208;H functionalization reaction is reported. The method employs nitrosobenzene as a reagent to drive the simultaneous activation of the boronic acid as a boronate and the activation of the C&#8208;H bond of the aldehyde as an iminium species that triggers the key C&#8208;C bond&#8208;forming step via an intramolecular migration from boron to carbon. These findings constitute a practical, scalable, and operationally straightforward method for the synthesis of ketones.</dc:description>

         <title>Colloidal Metal Nanocrystals with Metastable Crystal Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In addition to the conventional knobs such as composition, size, shape, and defect structure, the crystal structure (or phase) of metal nanocrystals offers a new avenue for engineering their properties. Various strategies have recently been developed for the fabrication of colloidal metal nanocrystals in metastable phases different from their bulk counterparts. With a focus on noble metals, we begin with a brief introduction to their atomic packing, followed by a discussion about five major synthetic approaches to their colloidal nanocrystals in unconventional phases. We then highlight the success of synthesis in terms of mechanistic insights and experimental controls, as well as the enhanced catalytic properties. We end this review with perspectives on the remaining issues and future opportunities.</dc:description>

         <title>MgO&#8208;Template Synthesis of Extremely High Capacity Hard Carbon for Na&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mg&#8208;templated hard carbon as an extremely high capacity negative electrode material for Na&#8208;ion batteries is successfully synthesized by heating a freeze&#8208;dried mixture of magnesium gluconate and glucose. The hard carbon demonstrates an extraordinarily large reversible capacity of 478&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high Coulombic efficiency of 88&#8201;% at the first cycle. Owing to the low potential operation, estimated energy density of the full cell is very high.







Abstract
Extremely high capacity hard carbon for Na&#8208;ion battery, delivering 478&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, is successfully synthesized by heating a freeze&#8208;dried mixture of magnesium gluconate and glucose by a MgO&#8208;template technique. Influences of synthetic conditions and nano&#8208;structures on electrochemical Na storage properties in the hard carbon are systematically studied to maximize the reversible capacity. Nano&#8208;sized MgO particles are formed in a carbon matrix prepared by pre&#8208;treatment of the mixture at 600&#8201;&#176;C. Through acid leaching of MgO and carbonization at 1500&#8201;&#176;C, resultant hard carbon demonstrates an extraordinarily large reversible capacity of 478&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high Coulombic efficiency of 88&#8201;% at the first cycle.

         <title>Electrochemical and Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation for Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical and photoelectrochemical generation of H2O2 is a promising approach for the large&#8208;scale production of this important green fuel and oxidant. Recent developments in H2O2 production on the anode side, including property evaluation and material/catalyst selection, and strategies for increasing the selectivity, efficiency, and accumulation, are comprehensively discussed in this Minireview.







Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as a green fuel and oxidant, has drawn increasing attention in the energy and environmental research. Compared with the traditional anthraquinone process, the electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) syntheses of H2O2 are cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly. In order to construct membraneless EC/PEC devices for the full H2O2 synthesis, anodic H2O2 production by water oxidation, which is less developed than cathodic H2O2 generation, is highly desirable. Here, we review recent developments for the EC/PEC H2O2 production by water oxidation, including fundamental aspects, benchmarking activity evaluation, material/catalyst selection, and strategies for increasing selectivity, efficiency, and accumulation. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and outlook of water oxidation for H2O2 production, especially device&#8208;level development, accumulation and stability, and industrial applications. Our review is intended to stimulate studies further improving EC/PEC H2O2 production.

         <title>Engineered Enzymes Enable Selective N&#8208;Alkylation of Pyrazoles With Simple Haloalkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological alkylation is highly selective, yet it depends on complex leaving groups. Now, promiscuous and engineered enzymes achieve selective enzymatic alkylation using simple haloalkanes.







Abstract
Selective alkylation of pyrazoles could solve a challenge in chemistry and streamline synthesis of important molecules. Here we report catalyst&#8208;controlled pyrazole alkylation by a cyclic two&#8208;enzyme cascade. In this enzymatic system, a promiscuous enzyme uses haloalkanes as precursors to generate non&#8208;natural analogs of the common cosubstrate S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine. A second engineered enzyme transfers the alkyl group in highly selective C&#8722;N bond formations to the pyrazole substrate. The cosubstrate is recycled and only used in catalytic amounts. Key is a computational enzyme&#8208;library design tool that converted a promiscuous methyltransferase into a small enzyme family of pyrazole&#8208;alkylating enzymes in one round of mutagenesis and screening. With this enzymatic system, pyrazole alkylation (methylation, ethylation, propylation) was achieved with unprecedented regioselectivity (&gt;99&#8201;%), regiodivergence, and in a first example on preparative scale.

         <title>1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazole Bridges: A Strategy to Improve Energetics at the Molecular Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;bridged furazans was prepared. The thermal stability, friction sensitivity, impact sensitivity, detonation velocity, and detonation pressure were evaluated. The hydroxylammonium salt 8 shows great potential as a high&#8208;performance insensitive explosive. The synthetic method for introducing 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole and the systematic study of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;bridged compounds provide a theoretical basis for future energetics design.







Abstract
Many energetic materials synthesized to date have limited applications because of low thermal and/or mechanical stability. This limitation can be overcome by introducing structural modifications such as a bridging group. In this study, a series of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;bridged furazans was prepared. Their structures were confirmed by 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR, infrared, elemental, and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses. The thermal stability, friction sensitivity, impact sensitivity, detonation velocity, and detonation pressure were evaluated. The hydroxylammonium salt 8 has an excellent detonation performance (D=9101&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, P=37.9&#8197;GPa) and insensitive properties (IS=17.4&#8197;J, FS=330&#8197;N), which show its great potential as a high&#8208;performance insensitive explosive. Using quantum computation and crystal structure analysis, the effect of the introduction of the 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole moiety on molecular reactivity and the difference between the sensitivities and thermal stabilities of mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole bridges are considered. The synthetic method for introducing 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole and the systematic study of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;bridged compounds provide a theoretical basis for future energetics design.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Driven Supramolecular Wrapping of Self&#8208;Assembled Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the useful emitting features of two platinum complexes, we show how the media regulates the assembly pathways from self&#8208;sorting to an unprecedented reversible, dynamic molecular wrapping of a complex on another assembled structure.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly relies on the ability of smaller and discrete entities to spontaneously arrange into more organized systems by means of the structure&#8208;encoded information. Herein, we show that the design of the media can play a role even more important than the chemical design. The media not only determines the self&#8208;assembly pathway at a single&#8208;component level, but in a very narrow solvent composition, a supramolecular homo&#8208;aggregate can be non&#8208;covalently wrapped by a second component that possesses a different crystal lattice. Such a process has been followed in real time by confocal microscopy thanks to the different emission colors of the aggregates formed by two isolated PtII complexes. This coating is reversible and controlled by the media composition. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular simulations based on coarse&#8208;grained (CG) models allowed the understanding of the properties displayed by the different aggregates. Such findings could result in a new method to construct hierarchical supramolecular structures.

         <title>Masked Alkyne Equivalents for the Synthesis of Mechanically Interlocked Polyynes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active&#8208;metal&#8208;template synthesis has been used to prepare a [2]rotaxane in which the whole dumbbell component is a masked C16H2 polyyne. t&#8208;Butyl substituents make the photo&#8208;labile terminal groups bulky enough to act as stoppers and prevent unthreading of the macrocycle. Rotaxanes of this type are promising intermediates in the synthesis of mechanically interlocked carbon&#8208;rich architectures, such as cyclocarbon catenanes and carbyne polyrotaxanes.







Abstract
Polyyne polyrotaxanes, encapsulated cyclocarbon catenanes and other fascinating mechanically interlocked carbon&#8208;rich architectures should become accessible if masked alkyne equivalents (MAEs) can be developed that are large enough to prevent unthreading of a macrocycle, and that can be cleanly unmasked under mild conditions. Herein, we report the synthesis of a new bulky MAE based on t&#8208;butylbicyclo[4.3.1]decatriene. This MAE was used to synthesize a polyyne [2]rotaxane and a masked&#8208;polyyne [3]rotaxane by Cadiot&#8211;Chodkiewicz coupling. Glaser cyclo&#8208;oligomerization of the [2]rotaxane gave masked cyclocarbon catenanes. The unmasking behavior of the catenanes and rotaxanes was tested by photolysis at a range of UV wavelengths. Photochemical unmasking did not proceed cleanly enough to prepare extended encapsulated polyyne polyrotaxanes. We highlight the scope and challenges involved with this approach to interlocked carbon&#8208;rich architectures.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Hydroquinolines with &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Disubstitution through Organocatalyzed Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first kinetic resolution of hydroquinoline derivatives with &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstitution was realized through organocatalyzed asymmetric remote aminations with azodicarboxylates, which represents a powerful protocol for asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles with &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenters. Mechanistic studies elucidate the reaction mechanisms and highlighted the role of attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions between the substrate and catalyst.







Abstract
The first kinetic resolution of hydroquinoline derivatives with &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstitution has been achieved through asymmetric remote aminations with azodicarboxylates enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggest a monomeric catalyst pathway proceeding through rate&#8208; and enantio&#8208;determining electrophilic attack promoted by a network of attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions between the substrate and catalyst. Facile subsequent removal and transformations of the newly introduced hydrazine moiety enable these protocols to serve as powerful tools for asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycles with &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstitution.

         <title>Convergent Total Synthesis of Yaku'amide&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Yaku'amide&#8197;A, an anticancer peptide, was synthesized by a route featuring a one&#8208;pot anti dehydration&#8211;azide reduction&#8211;O&#8594;N acyl transfer process for stereospecific construction of the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;&#916;Ile residues. The &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amino acids were produced by aminohydroxylation catalyzed by OsO4.







Abstract
Total synthesis of the anticancer peptide natural product yaku'amide&#8197;A is reported. Its &#946;&#8208;tert&#8208;hydroxy amino acids were prepared by regioselective aminohydroxylation involving a chiral mesyloxycarbamate reagent. Stereospecific construction of the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;&#916;Ile residues was accomplished through a one&#8208;pot reaction featuring anti dehydration, azide reduction, and O&#8594;N acyl transfer. Alkene isomerization was negligible during this process. These methods enabled a highly convergent and efficient synthetic route to the natural product.

         <title>Mild and Robust Stille Reactions in Water using Parts Per Million Levels of a Triphenylphosphine&#8208;Based Palladacycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly valued Stille couplings can now be done not only in water under mild reaction conditions, but with only 500&#8211;1000&#8197;ppm of Pd ligated with triphenylphosphine, derived from a new and readily prepared palladacycle.







Abstract
An inexpensive and new triphenylphosphine&#8208;based palladacycle has been developed as a pre&#8208;catalyst, leading to highly effective Stille cross&#8208;coupling reactions in water under mild reaction conditions. Only 500&#8211;1000&#8197;ppm of Pd suffices for couplings involving a variety of aryl/heteroaryl halides with aryl/hetaryl stannanes. Several drug intermediates can be prepared using this catalyst in aqueous nanoreactors formed by 2&#8197;wt&#8201;% Brij&#8208;30 in water.

         <title>Fast Enantio&#8208; and Chemoselective Arylation of Ketones with Organoboronic Esters Enabled by Nickel/N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for general asymmetric addition of arylborons to simple ketones is reported, which is enabled by nickel/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis. Chiral tertiary alcohols are furnished with high efficiency and excellent levels of enantio&#8208; and chemocontrol, and the method offers a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
A general, efficient, highly enantio&#8208; and chemoselective N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)/Ni&#8208;catalyzed addition of readily available and stable arylboronic esters to ketones is reported. This protocol provides unexpectedly fast access (usually 10&#8197;min) to various chiral tertiary alcohols with exceptionally broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance (76 examples, up to 98&#8201;% ee). This process is orthogonal to other known Ni&#8208;mediated Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings, as it tolerates aryl chlorides, fluorides, ethers, esters, amides, nitriles, and alkyl chlorides. The reaction is applied to late&#8208;stage modifications of various densely functionalized medicinally relevant molecules. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that a rare enantioselective &#951;2&#8208;coordinating activation of ketone carbonyls is involved. This cross&#8208;coupling&#8208;like mechanism is expected to enable other challenging transformations of ketones.

         <title>Domino Effect: Gold Electrocatalyzing Lithium Reduction to Accelerate Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key step of Li&#8208;mediated non&#8208;aqueous NRR is electrocatalytic Li reduction. Gold greatly improved Li adsorption energy and thus highly accelerated the domino&#8208;like nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).







Abstract
Green production of NH3, especially the Li&#8208;mediated electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (NRR) in non&#8208;aqueous solutions, is attracting research interest. Controversies regarding the NRR mechanism greatly impede its optimization and wide applications. To understand the electrocatalytic process, we treated Au coated carbon fibrous paper (Au/CP) as the model catalyst. In&#8197;situ XRD confirmed the transformation of lithium intermediates during NRR. Au greatly improved electron transfer kinetics to catalyze metallic Li formation, and accordingly highly accelerated spontaneous NRR. The Faradaic efficiency of NRR on Au/CP reached 34.0&#8201;%, and NH3 yield was as high as 50&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;The key step of Li&#8208;mediated non&#8208;aqueous NRR is electrocatalytic Li reduction. Gold greatly improved Li adsorption energy and thus highly accelerated the domino&#8208;like nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green production of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, especially the Li&#8208;mediated electrochemical N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (NRR) in non&#8208;aqueous solutions, is attracting research interest. Controversies regarding the NRR mechanism greatly impede its optimization and wide applications. To understand the electrocatalytic process, we treated Au coated carbon fibrous paper (Au/CP) as the model catalyst. In&#8197;situ XRD confirmed the transformation of lithium intermediates during NRR. Au greatly improved electron transfer kinetics to catalyze metallic Li formation, and accordingly highly accelerated spontaneous NRR. The Faradaic efficiency of NRR on Au/CP reached 34.0&#8201;%, and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield was as high as 50&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Our research shows that the key step of Li&#8208;mediated non&#8208;aqueous NRR is electrocatalytic Li reduction and offers a novel electrocatalyst design method for Li reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Deeply Cycled Sodium Metal Anodes at Low Temperature and in Lean Electrolyte Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ether&#8211;ionic liquid composite electrolyte with fast ion transport, superior desolvation capability, and high electrochemical stability is exploited to suppress sodium dendrite growth at low temperatures ranging from 0 to &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This composite electrolyte enables a stable sodium metal anode to be deeply cycled with an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 50&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 500&#8197;hours at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C in lean electrolyte (1.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mAh&#8722;1) conditions.







Abstract
Enabling high&#8208;performing alkali metal anodes at low temperature and in lean electrolyte conditions is critical for the advancement of next&#8208;generation batteries with high energy density and improved safety. We present an ether&#8211;ionic liquid composite electrolyte to tackle the problem of dendrite growth of metallic sodium anode at low temperatures ranging from 0 to &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. This composite electrolyte enables a stable sodium metal anode to be deeply cycled at 2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 50&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 500&#8197;hours at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C in lean electrolyte (1.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mAh&#8722;1) conditions. Using the composite electrolyte, full cells with Na3V2(PO4)3 as cathode and sodium metal as anode present a high capacity retention of 90.7&#8201;% after 1,000 cycles at 2C at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. The sodium&#8211;carbon dioxide batteries also exhibit a reversible capacity of 1,000&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 50 cycles across a range of temperatures from &#8722;20 to 25&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Supramolecular Depolymerization in the Mixture of Two Poor Solvents: Mechanistic Insights and Modulation of Supramolecular Polymerization of Ionic &#960;&#8208;Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixtures of poor solvents are always not poor. Water and amphiphilic organic solvents (poor solvents), that individually promote the supramolecular polymerization of cationic &#960;&#8208;systems, readily depolymerize them into monomers in their mixtures (good solvent). Segregation of water and organic solvents around the molecular surface of the &#960;&#8208;system is the key for this surprising phenomenon.







Abstract
Solvents are fundamentally essential for the synthesis and processing of soft materials. Supramolecular polymers (SPs), an emerging class of soft materials, are usually stable in single and mixtures of poor solvents. In contrast to these preconceived notions, here we report the depolymerization of SPs in the mixture of two poor solvents. This surprising behavior was observed for well&#8208;known cationic perylene diimides (cPDIs) in the mixtures of water and amphiphilic organic solvents such as isopropanol (IPA). cPDIs form stable SPs in water and IPA but readily depolymerize into monomers in 50&#8211;70&#8197;vol% IPA containing water. This is due to the selective solvation of the &#960;&#8208;surface of cPDIs by alkyl chains of IPA and ionic side chains by water, as evidenced by molecular dynamic simulations. Moreover, by systematically changing the ratio between water and amphiphilic organic solvent, we could achieve an unprecedented supramolecular polymerization both by increasing and decreasing the solvent polarity.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;assembly of Discrete Metal&#8211;Organic Cages into Supramolecular Nanoparticles for Intracellular Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of Ada&#8208;MOC and host&#8211;guest interaction with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;&#946;CD) affords supramolecular nanoparticles. Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of Ada&#8208;MOC and PEI&#8208;&#946;CD maintains high efficiency and orthogonality in the presence of protein, enabling protein encapsulation into nanoparticles for intracellular protein delivery for therapeutic application and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.







Abstract
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly (HAS) is a powerful approach to create supramolecular nanostructures for biomedical applications. This potency, however, is generally challenged by the difficulty of controlling the HAS of biomacromolecules and the functionality of resulted HAS nanostructures. Herein, we report a modular approach for controlling the HAS of discrete metal&#8211;organic cages (MOC) into supramolecular nanoparticles, and its potential for intracellular protein delivery and cell&#8208;fate specification. The hierarchical coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of adamantane&#8208;functionalized M12L24 MOC (Ada&#8208;MOC) and the host&#8211;guest interaction of Ada&#8208;MOC with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;conjugated polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;&#946;CD) afford supramolecular nanoparticles in a controllable manner. HAS maintains high efficiency and orthogonality in the presence of protein, enabling the encapsulation of protein into the nanoparticles for intracellular protein delivery for therapeutic application and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing.

         <title>Prebiotic Peptide Synthesis and Spontaneous Amyloid Formation Inside a Proto&#8208;Cellular Compartment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;organization in a system of fatty acids and activated amino acids leads to vesicle&#8208;encapsulated amyloids. The fatty&#8208;acid vesicles act both as a filter, allowing the selective passage of activated amino acids, and as a barrier, blocking the diffusion of the amyloidogenic peptides that form spontaneously inside the vesicles. Hence, a simple mixture of prebiotically plausible starting materials leads to organizationally complex structures.







Abstract
Cellular life requires a high degree of molecular complexity and self&#8208;organization, some of which must have originated in a prebiotic context. Here, we demonstrate how both of these features can emerge in a plausibly prebiotic system. We found that chemical gradients in simple mixtures of activated amino acids and fatty acids can lead to the formation of amyloid&#8208;like peptide fibrils that are localized inside of a proto&#8208;cellular compartment. In this process, the fatty acid or lipid vesicles act both as a filter, allowing the selective passage of activated amino acids, and as a barrier, blocking the diffusion of the amyloidogenic peptides that form spontaneously inside the vesicles. This synergy between two distinct building blocks of life induces a significant increase in molecular complexity and spatial order thereby providing a route for the early molecular evolution that could give rise to a living cell.

         <title>A Fluorinated Carbanionic Substituent for Improving Water Solubility and Lipophilicity of Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated carbanionic substituent enhanced both water solubility and lipophilicity of organic fluorescence dyes, including BODIPYs, fluorescein, and aminocoumarin, without impairing the photophysical properties of the parent fluorophores. Considering that incorporation of conventional ionic substituents reduces the lipophilicity, the present carbanion structure is a new and promising candidate to tune such macroscopic properties.

Installation of a carbanionic substituent, that is strongly stabilized by two (trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl (Tf=SO2CF3) groups, into several fluorescence dyes including boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs), fluoresceins, and aminocoumarins has been achieved by the 2,2&#8208;bis(triflyl)ethylation reaction of the dye frameworks with highly electrophilic Tf2C=CH2, followed by neutralization with NaHCO3. Despite the contradiction between water solubility and lipophilicity, the carbanion&#8208;decorated dyes thus obtained showed significant enhancement of not only water solubility but also lipophilicity. This work clearly demonstrates that the fluorinated, highly stabilized carbanionic substituent is a new option for controlling the macroscopic property of chemical materials.

&lt;p&gt;A fluorinated carbanionic substituent enhanced both water solubility and lipophilicity of organic fluorescence dyes, including BODIPYs, fluorescein, and aminocoumarin, without impairing the photophysical properties of the parent fluorophores. Considering that incorporation of conventional ionic substituents reduces the lipophilicity, the present carbanion structure is a new and promising candidate to tune such macroscopic properties.

         <title>Thermally Activated n&#8208;Doping of Organic Semiconductors Achieved by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Based Dopant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, a thermally activated n&#8208;dopant with excellent air stability and high n&#8208;doping efficacy is developed. It can regenerate N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene in situ by decarboxylation for the subsequent n&#8208;doping. The thermally activated n&#8208;doping increases the air stability of n&#8208;dopants and permits n&#8208;dopants to be co&#8208;processed with polymer FBDPPV noninteractively before heating in air.







Abstract
Molecular doping plays an important role in the modification of carrier density of organic semiconductors thus enhancing their optoelectronic performance. However, efficient n&#8208;doping remains challenging, especially owing to the lack of strongly reducing and air&#8208;stable n&#8208;dopants. Herein, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursor, DMImC, is developed as a thermally activated n&#8208;dopant with the excellent stability in air. Its thermolysis in situ regenerates free NHC and subsequently dopes typical organic semiconductors. In sequentially doped FBDPPV films, DMImC does not disturb the &#960;&#8211;&#960; packing of the polymer and achieves good miscibility with the polymer. As a result, a high electrical conductivity of up to 8.4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is obtained. Additionally, the thermally activated doping and the excellent air stability permit DMImC to be noninteractively co&#8208;processed with polymers in air. Our results reveal that DMImC can be served as an efficient n&#8208;dopant suitable for various organic semiconductors.

         <title>Dearomatizing [4+1] Spiroannulation of Naphthols: Discovery of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dearomatizing [4+1] C&#8722;H spiroannulation of naphthols with cyclic diaryliodonium salts has been developed to rapidly deliver spirofluorenyl naphthalenones, which unlocks an opportunity to discover structurally new thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials.







Abstract
Disclosed here is a palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct [4+1] spiroannulation of ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of naphthols with cyclic diaryliodonium salts to construct spirofluorenyl naphthalenones (SFNP) under mild reaction conditions. This spiroannulation directly transforms the hydroxy group into a carbonyl group, and also tolerates reactive functional groups such as the halo groups, which provide an opportunity to rapidly assemble structurally new thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials that feature a carbonyl group with an adjacent spirofluorenyl unit as the acceptor. As an illustrated example, the OLED device utilizing the assembled DMAC&#8208;SFNP as the host material exhibits a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.5&#8197;V and an ultra&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 32.2&#8201;%. This work provides inspiration for structurally new TADF materials, and also displays the potential of C&#8722;H activation as a synthetic strategy for the innovation of optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Biocatalytic MOF Microreactor as a Versatile Platform towards Enhanced Multienzyme and Cofactor&#8208;Dependent Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically porous biocatalytic MOFs provide sufficient space for accommodation of enzymes to reorientate and spread in their lower surface energy state as well as to decrease the inherent barriers to accelerate the diffusion of reactants and intermediates. The promoted intermolecular correlation of enzymes and MOFs, and polyphenol coating, safeguards the enzymes from inactivation, showcasing their promise for diverse biotechnological applications.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as excellent hosting matrices for enzyme immobilization, offering superior physical and chemical protection for biocatalytic reactions. However, for multienzyme and cofactor&#8208;dependent biocatalysis, the subtle orchestration of enzymes and cofactors is largely disrupted upon immobilizing in the rigid crystalline MOF network, which leads to a much reduced biocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we constructed hierarchically porous MOFs by controlled structural etching to enhance multienzyme and cofactor&#8208;dependent enzyme biocatalysis. The expanded size of the pores can provide sufficient space for accommodated enzymes to reorientate and spread within MOFs in their lower surface energy state as well as to decrease the inherent barriers to accelerate the diffusion rate of reactants and intermediates. Moreover, the developed hierarchically porous MOFs demonstrated outstanding tolerance to inhospitable surroundings and recyclability.

The ROS of type I mechanism generated from AIEgen photosensitizers can reeducate the tumor&#8208;associated macrophages towards M1 phenotype, leading to a complete ablation of the tumor without recurrence through single PDT treatment.







Abstract
Reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to an antitumor M1 phenotype by photodynamic therapy is a promising strategy to overcome the immunosuppression of tumor microenvironment for boosted immunotherapy. However, it remains unclear how the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from type I and II mechanisms, relate to the macrophage polarization efficacy. Herein, we design and synthesize three donor&#8211;acceptor structured photosensitizers with varied ROS&#8208;generating efficiencies. Surprisingly, we discovered that the extracellular ROS generated from type I mechanism are mainly responsible for reprogramming the macrophages from a pro&#8208;tumor type (M2) to an anti&#8208;tumor state (M1). In&#8197;vivo experiments prove that the photosensitizer can trigger photodynamic immunotherapy for effective suppression of the tumor growth, while the therapeutic outcome is abolished with depleted macrophages. Overall, our strategy highlights the designing guideline of macrophage&#8208;activatable photosensitizers.
