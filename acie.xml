         <title>Inside Back Cover: Boosting the Catalase&#8208;Like Activity of SAzymes via Facile Tuning of the Distances between Neighboring Atoms in Single&#8208;Iron Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The versatile mechano&#8208;assisted in&#8208;situ MOF capsulation strategy enabled facile access to neighboring M2&#8208;SAzyme (M=Fe, Ir, Pt), even up to 1000 grams scale. Typically, Fe2&#8208;SAzyme mimicked catalase to efficiently trap and decompose H2O2 into O2, via cooperative hydrogen&#8208;bonding induced end&#8208;bridge adsorption, featuring double activity and ~6 times catalase/peroxidase selectivity than those of random Fe1&#8208;SAzyme, H2O2 affinity similar as bioenzyme. The precise manipulation of neighboring atomic distance dramatically switched the activity of Fe&#8208;SAzymes from generating to scavenging ROS, as reported by Hongyu Chen, Hongbing Ji et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202316779).

         <title>Cover Picture: Pt/MnO Interface Induced Defects for High Reverse Water Gas Shift Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanodesigned Pt/MnOx interface for enhanced activity in the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction is reported by Andr&#225;s S&#225;pi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202317343). As the result of edge dislocations generated at the Pt/MnO interface, linearly adsorbed CO is destabilized and released fast from the Pt nanoparticle. This leads to the enhanced catalytic performance of the Pt/MnO in the RWGS reaction.

         <title>Photocatalysis Meets Confinement: An Emerging Opportunity for Photoinduced Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photosensitive metal&#8208;organic cages (PMOCs) have emerged as highly promising dual&#8208;functional enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysts that can initiate the photochemical transformations and achieve distinctive selectivities with multiple noncovalent host&#8211;guest interactions as control forces. This review summaries recent advances of organic transformation using PMOCs as supramolecular reactors through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) and energy transfer (ET) processes.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembled metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) have been evolved as a paradigm of enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysts since they are able to synergize multifunctionalities inherent in metal and organic components and constitute microenvironments characteristic of enzymatic spatial confinement and versatile host&#8211;guest interactions, thus facilitating unconventional organic transformations via unique driving&#8208;forces such as weak noncovalent binding and electron/energy transfer. Recently, MOC&#8208;based photoreactors emerged as a burgeoning platform of supramolecular photocatalysis, displaying anomalous reactivities and selectivities distinct from bulk solution. This perspective recaps two decades journey of the photoinduced radical reactions by using photoactive metal&#8208;organic cages (PMOCs) as artificial reactors, outlining how the cage&#8208;confined photocatalysis was evolved from stoichiometric photoreactions to photocatalytic turnover, from high&#8208;energy UV&#8208;irradiation to sustainable visible&#8208;light photoactivation, and from simple radical reactions to multi&#8208;level chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivities. We will focus on PMOCs that merge structural and functional biomimicry into a single&#8208;cage to behave as multi&#8208;role photoreactors, emphasizing their potentials in tackling current challenges in organic transformations through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) or energy transfer (EnT) pathways in a simple, green while feasible manner.

         <title>Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 Oligomerization in Cell Membrane Revealed by Photo&#8208;Activated Localization Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insights from super&#8208;resolution microscopy: Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2), a widely used optogenetic tool, forms dimers, not higher oligomers, in human cell membranes. Disruption of inter&#8208;protein disulfide bonds leads to partial ChR2 monomerization, particularly in cells with lower ChR2 densities. This study enhances the understanding of ChR2 oligomerization and assists optogenetic tool design.







Abstract
Microbial rhodopsins are retinal membrane proteins that found a broad application in optogenetics. The oligomeric state of rhodopsins is important for their functionality and stability. Of particular interest is the oligomeric state in the cellular native membrane environment. Fluorescence microscopy provides powerful tools to determine the oligomeric state of membrane proteins directly in cells. Among these methods is quantitative photoactivated localization microscopy (qPALM) allowing the investigation of molecular organization at the level of single protein clusters. Here, we apply qPALM to investigate the oligomeric state of the first and most used optogenetic tool Channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2) in the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. ChR2 appeared predominantly as a dimer in the cell membrane and did not form higher oligomers. The disulfide bonds between Cys34 and Cys36 of adjacent ChR2 monomers were not required for dimer formation and mutations disrupting these bonds resulted in only partial monomerization of ChR2. The monomeric fraction increased when the total concentration of mutant ChR2 in the membrane was low. The dissociation constant was estimated for this partially monomerized mutant ChR2 as 2.2&#177;0.9 proteins/&#956;m2. Our findings are important for understanding the mechanistic basis of ChR2 activity as well as for improving existing and developing future optogenetic tools.

         <title>Artificial Homeostasis Systems Based on Feedback Reaction Networks: Design Principles and Future Promises</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review shows how to design feedback&#8208;controlled reaction networks in different molecular systems that have a range of non&#8208;linear functions. These networks are a useful set of tools for creating chemical systems and materials that are interactive and have homeostasis&#8208;like animate features. These discoveries pave the way for the development of forthcoming next&#8208;generation systems and materials.







Abstract
Feedback&#8208;controlled chemical reaction networks (FCRNs) are indispensable for various biological processes, such as cellular mechanisms, patterns, and signaling pathways. Through the intricate interplay of many feedback loops (FLs), FCRNs maintain a stable internal cellular environment. Currently, creating minimalistic synthetic cells is the long&#8208;term objective of systems chemistry, which is motivated by such natural integrity. The design, kinetic optimization, and analysis of FCRNs to exhibit functions akin to those of a cell still pose significant challenges. Indeed, reaching synthetic homeostasis is essential for engineering synthetic cell components. However, maintaining homeostasis in artificial systems against various agitations is a difficult task. Several biological events can provide us with guidelines for a conceptual understanding of homeostasis, which can be further applicable in designing artificial synthetic systems. In this regard, we organize our review with artificial homeostasis systems driven by FCRNs at different length scales, including homogeneous, compartmentalized, and soft material systems. First, we stretch a quick overview of FCRNs in different molecular and supramolecular systems, which are the essential toolbox for engineering different nonlinear functions and homeostatic systems. Moreover, the existing history of synthetic homeostasis in chemical and material systems and their advanced functions with self&#8208;correcting, and regulating properties are also emphasized.

         <title>Cover Picture: Rational Design of a Phosphorus&#8208;Centered Disbiradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ancient art of arranging diatoms (very small algae) under the microscope with a single hair is connected on the Cover picture with the research reported in this Communication (e202318210). The diatoms make up the formula of the disbiradical reported in the study and its characteristic three&#8208;line EPR signal. The milky way in the background represents the through&#8208;space interaction delivering the explanation for the peculiar EPR signal pattern. (Design and idea: Jan Rosenboom).

         <title>Cover Picture: Rapid Synthesis of Chiral Figure&#8208;Eight Macrocycles Using a Preorganized Natural Product&#8208;Based Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile modular synthetic platform was developed to generate chiral D2&#8208;symmetric figure&#8208;eight shaped macrocycles exhibiting excellent circularly polarized luminescence, as reported by Yasuchika Hasegawa, Junpei Yuasa, and Hiroki Oguri et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202318548). A preorganized C2&#8208;symmetric scaffold was designed based on natural products such as chimonanthine, isolated from Chimonanthus praecox, to rapidly generate a diverse range of chiral macrocycles, spanning from 14&#8208; to 66&#8208;membered rings, eliminating the need for optical resolution.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of Zn Metal via a Localized Conjugated Layer for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as promising and efficient energy storage systems owing to remarkable safety and satisfactory capacity. Nevertheless, the instability of zinc metal anodes, characterized by issues such as dendrite growth and parasitic side reactions, poses a significant barrier to widespread applications. Herein, we address this challenge by designing a localized conjugated structure comprising a cyclic polyacrylonitrile polymer (CPANZ), induced by a Zn2+&#8208;based Lewis acid (zinc trifluoromethylsulfonate) at a temperature of 120 &#176;C. The CPANZ layer on the Zn anode, enriched with appropriate pyridine nitrogen&#8208;rich groups (conjugated cyclic &#8722;C=N&#8722;), exhibits a notable affinity for Zn2+ with ample deposition sites. This zincophilic skeleton not only serves as a protective layer to guide the deposition of Zn2+ but also functions as proton channel blocker, regulating the proton flux to mitigate the hydrogen evolution. Additionally, the strong adhesion strength of the CPANZ layer guarantees its sustained protection to the Zn metal during long&#8208;term cycling. As a result, the modified zinc electrode demonstrates long cycle life and high durability in both half&#8208;cell and pouch cells. These findings present a feasible approach to designing high performance aqueous anodes by introducing a localized conjugated layer.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C4&#8208;selective Carboxylation of Pyridines with CO2 via Pyridylphosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyridine motifs are widespread pharmacophores in many drugs. Installing various substituents through pyridine C&#8722;H bond functionalization is significant for new drug design and discovery. Developments of late&#8208;stage functionalization reactions enrich the strategies for selective functionalization of pyridines. However, late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H carboxylation of pyridines is a long&#8208;standing challenge, especially selectively carboxylation with CO2 on pyridine motifs. Herein, we describe a practical method for C4&#8722;H carboxylation of pyridines via one&#8208;pot C&#8722;H phosphination and copper&#8208;catalyzed carboxylation of the resulted phosphonium salts with CO2. The reaction is conducted under mild conditions and compatible with multiple active groups and several pyridine drugs, providing diverse valuable isonicotinic acid compounds, demonstrating the application potential of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bioengineered Nanovesicle Vaccine Boosts T&#8208;B cell Interaction for Immunotherapy of Echinococcus multilocularis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a zoonotic parasitic disease, resulting from being infected with the metacestode larvae of the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. Novel prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are urgently needed since the current chemotherapy displays limited efficiency in AE treatment. Bioengineered nano cellular membrane vesicles are widely used for displaying the native conformational epitopes because of their unique structure and biocompatibility. In this study, four T&#8208;cells and four B&#8208;cells dominant epitope peptides of E. multilocularis with high immunogenicity were engineered into the Vero cell surface to construct a membrane vesicle nanovaccine for the treatment of AE. The results showed that the nanovesicle vaccine can efficiently activate dendritic cells, induce specific T/B cells to form a mutually activated circuit, and inhibit E. multilocularis infection. This study presents for the first time a nanovaccine strategy that can completely eliminate the burden of E. multilocularis.</dc:description>

         <title>Metastable Liquid Properties and Surface Flow Patterns of Ultrahigh Temperature Alloys Explored In&#160;Outer Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metastable liquid properties and chemical bonds beyond 2000 K remain a huge challenge for ground&#8208;based research on liquid materials chemistry. We show the strong undercooling capability, metastable liquid properties and surface wave patterns of refractory Nb&#8208;Si and Zr&#8208;V binary alloys explored in space environment. The floating droplet of Nb82.7Si17.3 eutectic alloy superheated up to 2388 K exhibited an extreme undercooling of 437 K, approaching the 0.2TE threshold for homogenous nucleation of liquid&#8208;solid reaction. The microgravity state endowed alloy droplets with nearly perfect sphericity and thus ensured the high accuracy to determine metastable undercooled liquid properties. A special kind of swirling flow was induced for liquid alloy owing to Marangoni convection, which resulted in the spiral microstructures on Zr64V36 alloy surface during liquid&#8208;solid phase transition. The coupled impacts of surface nucleation and surface flow brought in a novel olivary shape for these binary alloys. Furthermore, the chemical bonds and atomic structures of high temperature liquids were revealed to understand the liquid properties in outer space circumstances.</dc:description>

         <title>Guest&#8208;Regulated Generation&#160;of Reactive Oxygen Species from Porphyrin&#8208;Based Multicomponent Metallacages for Selective Photocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>The development of novel materials for highly efficient and&#160;selective photocatalysis is crucial for their practical applications.&#160; Herein, we employ the host&#8208;guest chemistry of porphyrin&#8208;based metallacages to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species and further use them for the selective photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohols.&#160; Upon irradiation, the sole metallacage (6) can generate singlet oxygen (1O2) effectively via excited energy transfer, while its complex with C70 (6&#8835;C70) opens a pathway for electron transfer to promote the formation of superoxide anion (O2&#183;&#8722;), producing both 1O2 and O2&#183;&#8722;.&#160; The addition of 4,4'&#8208;bipyridine (BPY) to complex 6&#8835;C70 forms a more stable complex (6&#8835;BPY) via the coordination of the Zn&#8208;porphyrin faces of 6&#160;and BPY, which drives fullerenes out of the cavities and restores the ability of 1O2 generation.&#160; Therefore, benzyl alcohols are oxidized into benzyl aldehydes upon irradiation in the presence of 6&#160;or 6&#8835;BPY, while they are oxidized into benzoic acids when 6&#8835;C70 is employed as the photosensitizing agent.&#160; This study demonstrates a highly efficient strategy that utilizes the host&#8208;guest chemistry of metallacages to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species for selective photooxidation reactions, which will promote the utilization of metallacages and their related host&#8208;guest complexes for photocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Proximity&#8208;Enhanced Functional Imaging Analysis of Engineered Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional imaging (FI) techniques have revolutionized tumor imaging by providing information on specific tumor functions, such as glycometabolism. However, tumor cells lack unique molecular characteristics at the molecular level and metabolic pathways, resulting in limited metabolic differences compared to normal cells and increased background signals from FI. To address this limitation, we developed a novel imaging technique termed proximity&#8208;enhanced functional imaging (PEFI) for accurate visualization of tumors. By using "two adjacent chemically labeled glycoproteins" as output signals, we significantly enhance the metabolic differences between tumor and normal cells by PEFI, thereby reducing the background signals for analysis and improving the accuracy of tumor functional imaging. Our results demonstrate that PEFI can accurately identify tumors at the cellular, tissue, and animal level, and has potential value in clinical identification and analysis of tumor cells and tissues, as well as in the guidance of clinical tumor resection surgery.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Cellulose Nanocrystals Electrolyte Additive Enable Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Anodes for Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of aqueous zinc (Zn) chemistry energy storage with high rate&#8208;capability and long serving life is a great challenge due to its inhospitable coordination environment and dismal interfacial chemistry. To bridge this big gap, herein, we build a highly reversible aqueous Zn battery by taking advantages of the biomass&#8208;derived cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) electrolyte additive with unique physical and chemical characteristics simultaneously. The CNCs additive not only serves as fast ion carriers for enhancing Zn2+ transport kinetics but regulates the coordination environment and interface chemistry to form dynamic and self&#8208;repairing protective interphase, resulting in building ultra&#8208;stable Zn anodes under extreme conditions. As a result, the engineered electrolyte system achieves a superior average coulombic efficiency of 97.27% under 140 mA cm&#8208;2, and steady charge&#8208;discharge for 982 h under 50 mA cm&#8208;2, 50 mAh cm&#8208;2, which proposes a universal pathway to challenge aqueous Zn chemistry in green, sustainable, and large&#8208;scale applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Salt Electrolyte Additive Enables High Moisture Tolerance and Favorable Electric Double Layer for Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The carbonate electrolyte chemistry is a primary determinant for the development of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Unfortunately, their implementation is greatly plagued by sluggish electrode interfacial dynamics and insufficient electrolyte thermodynamic stability. Herein, lithium trifluoroacetate&#8208;lithium nitrate (LiTFA&#8208;LiNO3) dual&#8208;salt additive&#8208;reinforced carbonate electrolyte (LTFAN) is proposed for stabilizing high&#8208;voltage LMBs. We reveal that 1) the in situ generated inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (EEI) enables rapid interfacial dynamics, 2) TFA&#8315; preferentially interacts with moisture over PF6&#8315; to strengthen the moisture tolerance of designed electrolyte, and 3) NO3&#8315; is found to be noticeably enriched at the cathode interface on charging, thus constructing Li+&#8208;enriched, solvent&#8208;coordinated, thermodynamically favorable electric double layer (EDL). The superior moisture tolerance of LTFAN and the thermodynamically stable EDL constructed at cathode interface play a decisive role in upgrading the compatibility of carbonate electrolyte with high&#8208;voltage cathode. The LMBs with LTFAN realize 4.3 V&#8208;NCM523/4.4 V&#8208;NCM622 superior cycling reversibility and excellent rate capability, which is the leading level of documented records for carbonate electrode.</dc:description>

         <title>Concentrated Formic Acid from CO2 Electrolysis for Directly Driving Fuel Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of formic acid via electrochemical CO2 reduction may serve as a key link for the carbon cycle in the formic acid economy, yet its practical feasibility is largely limited by the quantity and concentration of the product. Here we demonstrate continuous electrochemical CO2 reduction for formic acid production at 2 M at an industrial&#8208;level current densities (i.e., 200&#8201;mA cm&#8722;2) for 300 h on membrane electrode assembly using scalable lattice&#8208;distorted bismuth catalysts. The optimized catalysts also enable a Faradaic efficiency for formate of 94.2% at 1.16 A&#183;cm&#8722;2, reaching a production rate of 21.7&#8197;mmol&#183;cm&#8722;2&#183;h&#8722;1. To assess the practicality of this system, we perform a comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis and life cycle assessment, showing that our approach can potentially substitute conventional methyl formate hydrolysis for industrial formic acid production. Furthermore, the resultant formic acid serves as direct fuel for air&#8208;breathing formic acid fuel cells, boasting a power density of 55 mW cm&#8722;2 and an exceptional thermal efficiency of 20.1%.</dc:description>

         <title>Conditional Cooperativity in the RAS Assembly Pathway on Nanodiscs and Altered GTPase Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assemblies (i.e., nanoclusters) of the RAS GTPase on the membrane act as scaffolds that activate downstream RAF kinases and drive MAPK signaling for cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. However, the mechanistic details of nanoclustering remain largely unknown. Here, size&#8208;tunable nanodisc platforms and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) analyses revealed the structural basis of cooperative assembly processes of fully processed KRAS, mutated in a quarter of human cancers. The cooperativity is modulated by the mutation and nucleotide states of KRAS and the lipid composition in the membrane. Notably, the oncogenic mutants assemble in a nonsequential pathways with two mutually cooperative &#8216;&#945;/&#945;&#8217; and &#8216;&#945;/&#946;&#8217; interfaces, while &#945;/&#945; dimerization of wild&#8208;type KRAS promotes the secondary &#945;/&#946; interaction in a sequential manner. Mutation&#8208;based interface engineering was used to selectively trap the oligomeric intermediates of KRAS and to probe their favorable interface interactions. Transiently exposed interfaces are available for the assembly. Real&#8208;time NMR demonstrated that higher&#8208;order oligomers retain larger numbers of active GTP&#8208;bound protomers in KRAS GTPase cycling. These data provide a deeper understanding of the nanocluster&#8208;enhanced signaling in response to the environment. Furthermore, our methodology is applicable to assemblies of many other membrane GTPases and to lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based formulations of stable protein oligomers with enhanced cooperativity.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Rate Performance of Encapsulating Lithium&#8208;Polysulfide Electrolytes for Practical Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexyl methyl ether (HME) is proposed as a co&#8208;solvent to formulate encapsulating lithium&#8208;polysulfide electrolyte (EPSE). The sacrifice in specific capacity of S cathodes at a high rate in common EPSEs is circumvented in HME&#8208;EPSE while mitigating parasitic reactions of lithium polysulfides with lithium metal anodes. Both high energy density of 387&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and stable cycle life of 27&#8197;cycles were achieved in a lithium&#8722;sulfur pouch cell.

The cycle life of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is severely plagued by the incessant parasitic reactions between Li metal anodes and reactive Li polysulfides (LiPSs). Encapsulating Li&#8208;polysulfide electrolyte (EPSE) emerges as an effective electrolyte design to mitigate the parasitic reactions kinetically. Nevertheless, the rate performance of Li&#8722;S batteries with EPSE is synchronously suppressed. Herein, the sacrifice in rate performance by EPSE is circumvented while mitigating parasitic reactions by employing hexyl methyl ether (HME) as a co&#8208;solvent. The specific capacity of Li&#8722;S batteries with HME&#8208;based EPSE is nearly not decreased at 0.1&#8197;C compared with conventional ether electrolytes. With an ultrathin Li metal anode (50&#8197;&#956;m) and a high&#8208;areal&#8208;loading sulfur cathode (4.4&#8197;mgS&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a longer cycle life of 113&#8197;cycles was achieved in HME&#8208;based EPSE compared with that of 65&#8197;cycles in conventional ether electrolytes at 0.1&#8197;C. Furthermore, both high energy density of 387&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and stable cycle life of 27&#8197;cycles were achieved in a Li&#8722;S pouch cell (2.7&#8197;Ah). This work inspires the feasibility of regulating the solvation structure of LiPSs in EPSE for Li&#8722;S batteries with balanced performance.

&lt;p&gt;Hexyl methyl ether (HME) is proposed as a co-solvent to formulate encapsulating lithium-polysulfide electrolyte (EPSE). The sacrifice in specific capacity of S cathodes at a high rate in common EPSEs is circumvented in HME-EPSE while mitigating parasitic reactions of lithium polysulfides with lithium metal anodes. Both high energy density of 387&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and stable cycle life of 27&#8197;cycles were achieved in a lithium&#8722;sulfur pouch cell.

         <title>High Mobility Emissive Excimer Organic Semiconductor Towards Color&#8208;Tunable Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high mobility emissive excimer organic semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;anthryl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (2,7&#8208;DAF) was designed and synthesized. Comprehensive experimental characterizations demonstrated that 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal integrated the properties of high mobility of 2.16&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and a strong excimer emission (PLQY: 47.4&#8201;%). More importantly, color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting transistors were also demonstrated for an individual 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal.







Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) are highly integrated and minimized optoelectronic devices with significant potential superiority in smart displays and optical communications. To realize these various applications, it is urgently needed for color&#8208;tunable emission in OLETs, but remains a great challenge as a result of the difficulty for designing organic semiconductors simultaneously integrating high carrier mobility, strong solid&#8208;state emission, and the ability for potential tunable colors. Herein, a high mobility emissive excimer organic semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;anthryl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (2,7&#8208;DAF) was reasonably designed by introducing a rotatable carbon&#8211;carbon single bond connecting two anthracene groups at the 2,7&#8208;sites of fluorene, and the small torsion angles simultaneously guarantee effective conjugation and suppress fluorescence quenching. Indeed, the unique stable dimer arrangement and herringbone packing mode of 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal enables its superior integrated optoelectronic properties with high carrier mobility of 2.16&#8197;cm2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1, and strong excimer emission with absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 47.4&#8201;%. Furthermore, the voltage&#8208;dependent electrically induced color&#8208;tunable emission from orange to blue was also demonstrated for an individual 2,7&#8208;DAF single crystal based OLETs for the first time. This work opens the door for a new class of high mobility emissive excimer organic semiconductors, and provides a good platform for the study of color&#8208;tunable OLETs.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Formaldehyde&#8208;Nitrate Batteries for Wastewater Refining, Electricity Generation, and Production of Ammonia and Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a novel multi&#8208;functional formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery, which simultaneously realizes wastewater purification, electricity generation and the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added NH3 and formate. This battery exhibits an open&#8208;circuit potential of 0.75&#8197;V, a peak power density of 3.38&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. For simulated industrial wastewater, 99.9&#8201;% of nitrate and 99.8&#8201;% of formaldehyde are removed and an electricity of 2.03&#8197;W&#8901;h per day is generated.







Abstract
As bulky pollutants in industrial and agricultural wastewater, nitrate and formaldehyde pose serious threats to the human health and ecosystem. Current purification technologies including chemical and bio&#8208;/photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;chemical methods, are generally high&#8208;cost, time&#8208;consuming, or energy&#8208;intensive. Here, we report a novel formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery by pairing anodic formaldehyde oxidation with cathodic nitrate reduction, which simultaneously enables wastewater purification, electricity generation, and the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added ammonia and formate. As a result, the formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery remarkably exhibits an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.75&#8197;V, a peak power density of 3.38&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and the yield rates of 32.7&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for ammonia and 889.4&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for formate. In a large&#8208;scale formaldehyde&#8208;nitrate battery (25&#8197;cm2), 99.9&#8201;% of nitrate and 99.8&#8201;% of formaldehyde are removed from simulated industrial wastewater and the electricity of 2.03&#8197;W&#8901;h per day is generated. Moreover, the design of such a multi&#8208;functional battery is universally applicable to the coupling of NO3&#8722; or NO2&#8722; reduction with various aldehyde oxidization, paving a new avenue for wastewater purification and chemical manufacturing.

         <title>A Stable Extra&#8208;Large Pore and High&#8208;Silica Zeolite Derived from Ge&#8208;Rich Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;silica &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS, with a multidimensional 28&#8208;MR extra&#8208;large pore channel, has been hydrothermally synthesized from Ge&#8208;rich germanosilicate precursor, assisted by a small and commercially available piperidinium&#8208;type organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). Possessing not only superior crystallinity and hydrothermal stability, but also &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS is the high&#8208;silica zeolite containing the largest pore opening to date.







Abstract
A multidimensional extra&#8208;large pore zeolite with highly hydrothermal stability, denoted as &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS, has been developed successfully, starting from Ge&#8208;rich germanosilicate precursor hydrothermally directed by a small and commercially available piperidinium&#8208;type organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS, with the supermicropores, is structurally analogues to 28&#8208;membered ring &#8722;IRT topology as confirmed by various spectroscopic techniques. And it is the high&#8208;silica (Si/Ge=58) zeolite with the largest pore size as well. Notably, using acid&#8208;washed as&#8208;made Ge&#8208;rich &#8722;IRT precursor as the silicon source is crucial to restore partially collapsed structure into a stable framework by OSDA&#8208;assisted recrystallization. The calcined &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS maintains a high crystallinity, even when stored in a humid environment for extended periods or directly exposed to water. Additionally, high silica Al&#8208;containing analogue is also readily synthesized, serving as an active solid&#8208;acid catalyst in 1,3,5&#8208;triisopropylbenzene cracking reaction, yielding an impressive initial conversion up to 76.1&#8201;% much higher than conventional large&#8208;pore Beta zeolite (30.4&#8201;%). This work will pave the way for the designed synthesis of targeted high&#8208;silica zeolites with stable and extra&#8208;large pore frameworks, mimicking the structures of existing Ge&#8208;rich counterparts.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Direct Synthesis by Organic Acid&#8208;Etching and Reconstruction Disclosure as Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic acid&#8208;etching strategy (AES) is developed to realize the direct synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), allowing structural transformation to be uncovered during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using in situ characterizations. The reconstructed MOF shows an upshifted total d&#8208;band center, high bonding state occupancy, and localized electrons, leading to outstanding OER performance with a low overpotential and good stability.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Chemically bonded MOFs on supports are desirable yet lacking in routine synthesis, as they may allow variable structural evolution and the underlying structure&#8208;activity relationship to be disclosed. Herein, direct MOF synthesis is achieved by an organic acid&#8208;etching strategy (AES). Using &#960;&#8208;conjugated ferrocene (Fc) dicarboxylic acid as the etching agent and organic ligand, a series of MFc&#8208;MOF (M=Ni, Co, Fe, Zn) nanosheets are synthesized on the metal supports. The crystal structure is studied using X&#8208;ray diffraction and low&#8208;dose transmission electron microscopy, which is quasi&#8208;lattice&#8208;matched with that of the metal, enabling in situ MOF growth. Operando Raman and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy disclose that the NiFc&#8208;MOF features dynamic structural rebuilding during OER. The reconstructed one showing optimized electronic structures with an upshifted total d&#8208;band center, high M&#8722;O bonding state occupancy, and localized electrons on adsorbates indicated by density functional theory calculations, exhibits outstanding OER performance with a fairly low overpotential (130&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and good stability (144&#8197;h). The newly established approach for direct MOF synthesis and structural reconstruction disclosure stimulate the development of more prudent catalysts for advancing OER.

         <title>Tetrazine&#8208;Isonitrile Bioorthogonal Fluorogenic Reactions Enable Multiplex Labeling and Wash&#8208;Free Bioimaging of Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a series of tetrazine&#8208;functionalized bioorthogonal probes for multiplex imaging, by incorporating pyrazole adducts into the fluorophore scaffolds upon click reactions. These modifications are generalizable to various fluorophores, enabling a broad emission range from 473 to 659&#8197;nm, and high turn&#8208;on ratios up to 3184&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Developing fluorogenic probes for simultaneous live cell labeling of multiple targets is crucial for understanding complex cellular events. The emerging [4+1] cycloaddition between tetrazine and isonitriles holds promise as a bioorthogonal tool, yet existing tetrazine probes lack reactivity and fluorogenicity. Here, we present the development of a series of tetrazine&#8208;functionalized bioorthogonal probes. By incorporating pyrazole adducts into the fluorophore scaffolds, the post&#8208;reacted probes displayed remarkable fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratios, up to 3184&#8208;fold. Moreover, these modifications are generalizable to various fluorophores, enabling a broad emission range from 473 to 659&#8197;nm. Quantum chemical calculations further elucidate the turn&#8208;on mechanisms. These probes enable the simultaneous labeling of multiple targets in live cells, without the need for a washing step. Consequently, our findings pave the way for advanced multiplex imaging and detection techniques for cellular studies.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Continuous and In Situ Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide by Sulfur&#8208;Functionalized Polymer Catalyst for Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfur functionalized polymer photocatalyst for highly&#8208;efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production is synthesized through multi&#8208;component reactions. Continuous H2O2 production, photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton water treatment, and natural water sterilization are realized in the panel reactor system under natural sunlight irradiation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic H2O2 generation system based on polymer catalyst receives increasing attention in recent years; however, the insufficient charge separation efficiency and low oxygen adsorption/activation capacity severely limit their potential application. In this study, a sulfur (C=S) functionalized polymer catalyst is reported through a green water&#8208;mediated and catalyst&#8208;free multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs) route. The sulfur functional group endows the polymer with a suitable energy band and facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pair. The reported polymer achieves a high H2O2 production efficiency (3132&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) in pure water without oxygen aeration. To demonstrate their potential in in situ wastewater treatment, a panel reactor system (20&#215;20&#8197;cm) is constructed for large&#8208;scale production of H2O2, which realizes continuous degradation of emerging pollutants including antibiotics and bisphenol A under natural sunlight irradiation condition. The H2O2 utilization efficiency of the photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton system using in situ generated H2O2 is found 7.9&#8197;times higher than that of the traditional photo&#8208;Fenton system. This study offers new insights in green synthesis and design of functional polymer photocatalyst, and demonstrates the feasibility of panel reactor system for large&#8208;scale continuous H2O2 photocatalytic production and water treatment.

         <title>Initiating a High&#8208;Rate and Stable Aqueous Air Battery by Using Organic N&#8208;Heterocycle Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[+]	These authors contributed equally to this work.This work reports a strategy of organic&#8208;air batteries which is assembled with organic material as anode directly instead of the traditional metal&#8208;air batteries. Organic N&#8208;heterocycle compounds (NHCC) were synthesized and used as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept anode materials, which exhibits a low redox potential of &#8722;1.05&#8197;V vs. Hg/HgO. Coupling with a 4&#8197;M KOH+10&#8197;M KCF3SO3 electrolyte, the NHCC anode&#8208;air batteries exhibited a high voltage of 1.6&#8197;V and life time of 30,000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Alkaline metal&#8208;air batteries are advantageous in high voltage, low cost, and high safety. However, metal anodes are heavily eroded in strong alkaline electrolytes, causing serious side reactions including dendrite growth, passivation, and hydrogen evolution. To address this limitation, we successfully synthesized an organic N&#8208;heterocycle compound (NHCC) to serve as an alternative anode. This compound not only exhibits remarkable stability but also possesses a low redox potential (&#8722;1.04&#8197;V vs. Hg/HgO) in alkaline environments. To effectively complement the low redox potential of the NHCC anode, we designed a dual&#8208;salt highly concentrated electrolyte (4.0&#8197;M KOH+10.0&#8197;M KCF3SO3). This electrolyte expands the electrochemical stability window to 2.3&#8197;V through the robust interaction between the O atom in H2O molecule with the K+ of KCF3SO3 (H&#8722;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;KCF3SO3). We further demonstrated the K+ uptaken/extraction storage mechanism of NHCC anodes. Consequently, the alkaline aqueous NHCC anode&#8208;air batteries delivers a high battery voltage of 1.6&#8197;V, high&#8208;rate performance (101.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 100&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle ability (30,000&#8197;cycles). Our work offers a molecular engineering strategy for superior organic anode materials and develops a novel double superconcentrated conductive salt electrolyte for the construction of high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;cycle alkaline aqueous organic anode&#8208;air batteries.

Aromatic ketone Na&#8208;9&#8208;FN&#8208;DME is rationally designed as a mild presodiating reagent by introducing a carbonyl group into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to balance the conjugated and inductive effect, thus demonstrating versatile presodiating capability toward multiple Na uptake hosts, Na0.44MnO2 as an example achieves higher charge capacity and longer life after presodiation, and manifests structural stability upon prolonged presodiation time.







Abstract
Chemical presodiation (CP) is an effective strategy to enhance energy density of sodium ion batteries. However, the sodiation reagents reported so far are basically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) wth low reductive potential (~0.1&#8197;V vs. Na+/Na), which could easily cause over&#8208;sodiation and structural deterioration of the presodiated cathodes. In this work, Aromatic ketones (AKs) are rationally designed as mild presodiating reagents by introducing a carbonyl group (C=O) into PAHs to balance the conjugated and inductive effect. As the representatives, two compounds 9&#8208;Fluorenoneb (9&#8208;FN) and Benzophenone (BP) manifest favorable equilibrium potential of 1.55&#8197;V and 1.07&#8197;V (vs. Na+/Na), respectively. Note that 9&#8208;FN demonstrates versatile presodiating capability toward multiple Na uptake hosts (tunneled Na0.44MnO2, layered Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, polyanionic Na4Fe2.91(PO4)2P2O7, Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3), enabling greatly improved initial charging capacity of the cathode to balance the irrevisible capacity of the anode. Our results indicate that the Aromatic ketones are competitive presodiating cathodic reagents for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and will inspire more studies and application attempts in the future.

         <title>Unraveling the Chirality Transfer from Circularly Polarized Light to Single Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chirality transfer from light to matter was explored by proceeding with the plasmon&#8208;driven chemical reaction involving chirally distributed hot electrons with achiral Au nanoparticles and circularly polarized light. The chiral light&#8208;matter interactions were unraveled by circular differential scattering spectroscopy at the single particle level and theoretical simulations.







Abstract
Due to their broken symmetry, chiral plasmonic nanostructures have unique optical properties and numerous applications. However, there is still a lack of comprehension regarding how chirality transfer occurs between circularly polarized light (CPL) and these structures. Here, we thoroughly investigate the plasmon&#8208;assisted growth of chiral nanoparticles from achiral Au nanocubes (AuNCs) via CPL without the involvement of any chiral molecule stimulators. We identify the structural chirality of our synthesized chiral plasmonic nanostructures using circular differential scattering (CDS) spectroscopy, which is correlated with scanning electron microscopy imaging at both the single&#8208;particle and ensemble levels. Theoretical simulations, including hot&#8208;electron surface maps, reveal that the plasmon&#8208;induced chirality transfer is mediated by the asymmetric distribution of hot electrons on achiral AuNCs under CPL excitation. Furthermore, we shed light on how this plasmon&#8208;induced chirality transfer can also be utilized for chiral growth in bimetallic systems, such as Ag or Pd on AuNCs. The results presented here uncover fundamental aspects of chiral light&#8208;matter interaction and have implications for the future design and optimization of chiral sensors and chiral catalysis, among others.

         <title>Sequential Oxidation/Cyclization of Readily Available Imine Linkages to Access Benzoxazole&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoxazole&#8208;linked COFs were synthesized through the two&#8208;step sequential oxidation of readily available imine&#8208;linked COFs, eliminating the requirement for a predesigned OH. This innovative method has high conversion efficiency, crystallinity preservation, and broad applicability, marking a significant advancement in expanding the library of benzoxazole&#8208;linked COFs.







Abstract
Benzoxazole&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (BO&#8722;COFs), despite their exceptional chemical stability, are still in their infancy. This is primarily because the current prevalent methods require the use of special ortho&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;substituted aromatic amines as monomers. Herein, we report an innovative strategy to access BO&#8722;COFs directly from imine&#8208;linked COFs (Im&#8722;COFs) without pre&#8208;embedded OH groups, using a two&#8208;step sequential oxidation/cyclization process. The two&#8208;step process included the oxidation of Im&#8722;COFs into amide&#8208;linked COFs, followed by a copper&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization. Five representative BO&#8722;COFs were synthesized with retained crystallinity and high oxidization efficiency, offering the potential to convert a significant portion of Im&#8722;COFs into BO&#8722;COFs. The structural advantages of the newly designed BO&#8722;COFs were demonstrated through their application to photocatalytic organic transformations.

         <title>In Vitro Module Editing Of NRPS Enables Production Of Highly Potent Gq&#8208;Signaling Inhibitor FR900359 Derived From Unculturable Plant Symbiont</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
YM&#8208;254890, YM&#8208;254891 and FR900359 are potent selective G protein inhibitors. FR900359 which is originally discovered from plant&#8208;symbiont bacteria shows the strongest activity. While YM&#8208;254890 and YM&#8208;254891 are culturable bacteria derived, the BGC for them is not reported. Here, we identified the BGC for YM&#8208;254890 by heterologous expression. Furthermore, rational editing of the BGC led to the production of FR900359 in culturable host.







Abstract
Heterotrimeric G proteins are key mediators in the signaling of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCR) that are involved in a plethora of important physiological processes and thus major targets of pharmaceutical drugs. The cyclic depsipeptides YM&#8208;254890 and FR900359 are strong and selective inhibitors of the Gq subfamily of G proteins. FR900359 was first reported to be produced by unculturable plant symbiont, however, a culturable FR900359 producer was discovered recently by the standard strategy, screening of the producing strain from the environment. As another strategy, we introduce herein the different way to supply natural compounds of unculturable microorganism origin. We therefore embarked on constructing an artificial biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for FR900359 with YM&#8208;254890 BGC as a template using &#8220;in vitro module editing&#8221; technology, first developed for the modification of type&#8208;I PKS BGCs, to edit YM&#8208;254890 BGC. The resulting artificial BGCs coding FR900359 were heterologously expressed in the Pseudomonas putida KT2440 host strain.

         <title>Bioorthogonal &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; Reaction&#8208;Triggered Aggregation of Gold Nanoparticles Combined with Released Lonidamine for Enhanced Cancer Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer has been the most deadly disease, and 13 million cancer casualties are estimated to occur each year by 2030. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)&#8208;based photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted great interest due to its high spatiotemporal controllability and noninvasiveness. Due to the trade&#8208;off between particle size and photothermal efficiency of AuNPs, rational design is needed to realize aggregation of AuNPs into larger particles with desirable NIR adsorption in tumor site. Exploiting the bioorthogonal &#8220;Click and Release&#8221; (BCR) reaction between iminosydnone and cycloalkyne, aggregation of AuNPs can be achieved and attractively accompanied by the release of chemotherapeutic drug purposed to photothermal synergizing. We synthesize iminosydnone&#8208;lonidamine (ImLND) as a prodrug and choose dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) as the trigger of BCR reaction. A PEGylated AuNPs&#8208;based two&#8208;component nanoplatform consisting of prodrug&#8208;loaded AuNPs&#8208;ImLND and tumor&#8208;targeting peptide RGD&#8208;conjugated AuNPs&#8208;DBCO&#8208;RGD is designed. In the therapeutic regimen, AuNPs&#8208;DBCO&#8208;RGD are intravenously injected first for tumor&#8208;specific enrichment and retention. Once the arrival of AuNPs&#8208;ImLND injected later at tumor site, highly photothermally active nanoaggregates of AuNPs are formed via the BCR reaction between ImLND and DBCO. The simultaneous release of lonidamine further enhanced the therapeutic performance by sensitizing cancer cells to PTT.</dc:description>

         <title>Axial&#8211;Equatorial Halide Ordering in Layered Hybrid Perovskites from Isotropic&#8211;Anisotropic&#160;207Pb NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bandgap&#8208;tuneable mixed&#8208;halide 3D perovskites are of interest for multi&#8208;junction solar cells, but suffer from photoinduced spatial halide segregation. Mixed&#8208;halide 2D perovskites are more resistant to halide segregation and are promising coatings for 3D perovskite solar cells. The properties of mixed&#8208;halide compositions depend on the local halide distribution, which is challenging to study at the level of single octahedra. In particular, it has been suggested that there is a preference for occupation of the distinct axial and equatorial halide sites in mixed&#8208;halide 2D perovskites.&#160;207Pb NMR can be used to probe the atomic&#8208;scale structure of lead&#8211;halide materials, but although the isotropic&#160;207Pb shift is sensitive to halide stoichiometry, it cannot distinguish configurational isomers. Here, we use 2D isotropic&#8211;anisotropic correlation&#160;207Pb NMR and relativistic DFT calculations to distinguish the [PbX6] configurations in mixed iodide&#8211;bromide 3D FAPb(Br1&#8722;&#119909;I&#119909;)3&#160;perovskites and 2D BA2Pb(Br1&#8722;&#119909;I&#119909;)4&#160;perovskites based on formamidinium (FA+) and butylammonium (BA+), respectively. We find that iodide preferentially occupies the axial site in BA&#8208;based 2D perovskites, which may explain the suppressed halide mobility.</dc:description>

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Ratiometric Photoacoustic Probe for High&#8208;Spatiotemporal&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Copper(II) Dynamics in the Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper dysmetabolism is associated with various neurodegenerative disorders, making high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution imaging of Cu2+ in the brain essential for understanding the underlying pathophysiological processes. Nevertheless, the current probes encounter obstacles in crossing the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and providing high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution in deep tissues. Herein, we present a photoacoustic probe capable of imaging Cu2+ dynamics in the mouse brain with high&#8208;spatiotemporal&#8208;resolution. The probe demonstrates selective ratiometric and reversible responses to Cu2+, while also efficiently crossing the BBB. Using the probe as the imaging agent, we successfully visualized Cu2+ in the brain of Parkinson's disease (PD) model mouse with a remarkable micron&#8208;level resolution. The imaging results revealed a significant increase in Cu2+ levels in the cerebral cortex as PD progresses, highlighting the close association between Cu2+ alternations in the region and the disease. We also demonstrated that the probe can be used to monitor changes in Cu2+ distribution in the PD model mouse brain during L&#8208;dopa intervention. Mechanism studies suggest that the copper dyshomeostasis in the PD mouse brain was dominated by the expression levels of divalent metal transporter 1. The application of our probe in imaging Cu2+ dynamics in the mouse brain offers valuable insights into the copper&#8208;related molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Phenolic&#160;Nanocloaks on Cancer Cells Potentiate STING Pathway Activation for Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the presence of natural neoantigens, autologous tumor cells hold great promise as personalized therapeutic vaccines. Yet autologous tumor cell vaccines require multi&#8208;step production that frequently leads to the loss of immunoreactive antigens, causing insufficient immune activation and significantly hampering their clinical applications. Herein, we introduce a novel whole&#8208;cell cancer vaccine by cloaking cancer cells with lipopolysaccharide&#8208;decorated manganese(II)&#8208;phenolic networks (MnTA nanocloaks) to evoke tumor&#8208;specific immune response for highly efficacious synergistic cancer immunotherapy. The natural polyphenols coordinate with Mn2+ and immediately adhere to the surface of individual cancer cells, thereby forming a nanocloak and encapsulating tumor neoantigens. Subsequent decoration with lipopolysaccharide induces internalization by dendritic cells, where Mn2+ ions are released in the cytosol, further facilitating the activation of the stimulator of the interferon genes (STING) pathway. Highly effective tumor suppression was observed by combining the nanocloaked cancer cell treatment with anti&#8208;programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) antibodies&#8208;mediated immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our work demonstrates a universal yet simple strategy to engineer a cell&#8208;based nanobiohybrid system for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current transition alumina catalysts require the presence of significant amounts of toxic, environmentally deleterious dopants for their stabilization. Herein, we report a simple and novel strategy to engineer transition aluminas to withstand aging temperatures up to 1200&#176;C without inducing the transformation to low&#8208;surface&#8208;area &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and without requiring dopants. By judiciously optimizing the abundance of dominant facets and the interparticle distance, we can control the temperature of the phase transformation from &#952;&#8208;Al2O3 to &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and the specific surface sites on the latter.

         <title>Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6): A Multi&#8208;Chromophore Chalcogenide with Excellent Nonlinear Optical Property Designed by Group Grafting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) and polar materials capable of exhibiting many important functional properties are indispensable for electro&#8208;optical technologies, yet their rational structural design remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a &#8220;group grafting&#8221; strategy for designing the first multi&#8208;chromophore selenophosphate, Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6), that crystallizes in a NCS and polar space group of Cm. The structure features a unique basic building unit (BBU) [In(In4Se10)(P2Se6)], formed through &#8220;grafting [In4Se10] supertetrahedra on the root of [In(P2Se6)2] groups&#8221;. Theoretical calculations confirm that this [In(In4Se10)(P2Se6)] BBU can achieve a &#8220;1 + 1 &gt; 2&#8221; combination of properties from two chromophores, [In4Se10] supertetrahedron and ethane&#8208;like [P2Se6] dimer. That makes Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) exhibit excellent linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, including a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response (~6 &#215; AgGaS2), a large band gap (2.45 eV), broad infrared (IR) transmission (up to 19.5 &#956;m), a significant birefringence (0.26 @1064 nm) as well as the congruently&#8208;melting property at ~700 &#176;C. Therefore, Cs3In(In4Se7)(P2Se6) will be a promising NLO crystal, especially in the IR region, and this research also demonstrates that &#8220;group grafting&#8221; will be an effective strategy for constructing novel polar BBUs with multi&#8208;chromophore to design NCS structures and high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Oxidation in Aqueous&#160;Microdroplets: Water Radical Cation as Primary Oxidizing Agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploration of the unique chemical properties of interfaces can unlock new understanding. A striking example is the finding of accelerated reactions, particularly spontaneous oxidation reactions, that occur without assistance of catalysts or external oxidants at the air interface of both aqueous and organic solutions (provided they contain some water). This finding opened a new area of interfacial chemistry but also caused heated debate regarding the primary chemical species responsible for the observed oxidation. An overview of the literature covering oxidation in microdroplets with air interfaces is provided, together with a critical examination of previous findings and hypotheses. The water radical cation/radical anion pair, formed spontaneously and responsible for the electric field at or near the droplet/air interface, is suggested to constitute the primary redox species. Mechanisms of accelerated microdroplet reactions are critically discussed and it is shown that hydroxyl radical/hydrogen peroxide formation in microdroplets does not require that these species be the primary oxidant. Instead, we suggest that hydroxyl radical&#160;and hydrogen peroxide are the products of water radical cation decay in water. The importance of microdroplet chemistry in the prebiotic environment is sketched briefly and the role of partial solvation in reaction acceleration is noted.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Synergy Enables Silole Insertion into THF and the Synthesis of Erbium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potassium silole K2[SiC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Ph2] reacts with [M(&#951;8&#8208;COT)(THF)4][BPh4] (M = Er, Y; COT = cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl) in THF to give products that feature unprecedented insertion of the nucleophilic silicon centre into a carbon&#8208;oxygen bond of THF. The structure of the major product, [(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8208;COT)M(m&#8208;L1)K][[EQUATION]] (1M), consists of polymeric chains of sandwich complexes, where the spiro&#8208;bicyclic silapyran ligand [C4H8OSiC4(SiMe3)2Ph2]2&#8211; (L1) coordinates to potassium via the oxygen. The minor product [(&#956;&#8208;&#951;8:&#951;8&#8208;COT)M(m&#8208;L1)K(THF)]2 (2M) features coordination of the silapyran to the rare&#8208;earth metal. In forming 1M and 2M, silole insertion into THF only occurs in the presence of potassium and the rare&#8208;earth metal, highlighting the importance of bimetallic synergy. The lower nucleophilicity of germanium(II) leads to contrasting reactivity of the potassium germole K2[GeC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Me2] towards [M(&#951;8&#8208;COT)(THF)4][BPh4], with intact transfer of the germole occurring to give the coordination polymers [{&#951;5&#8208;GeC4(SiMe3)2Me2}M(h8&#8208;COT)K][[EQUATION]] (3M). Despite the differences in reactivity induced by the group 14 heteroatom, the single&#8208;molecule magnet properties of 1Er, 2Er and 3Er are similar, with thermally activated relaxation occurring via the first&#8208;excited Kramers doublet, subject to effective energy barriers of 122, 80 and 91 cm&#8211;1, respectively. Compound 1Er is also analysed by high&#8208;frequency dynamic magnetic susceptibility measurements up to 106 Hz.</dc:description>

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Mono&#8208;N&#8208;Methylation of Aliphatic Primary Amines without the Requirement of External High&#8208;Hydrogen Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of mono&#8208;N&#8208;methylated aliphatic primary amines has traditionally been challenging, requiring noble metal catalysts and high&#8208;pressure H2 for achieveing satisfactory yields and selectivity. Herein, we developed an approach for the selective coupling of methanol and aliphatic primary amines, without high&#8208;pressure hydrogen, using a manganese&#8208;based catalyst. Remarkably, up to 98% yields with broad substrate scope were achieved at low catalyst loadings. Notably, due to the weak base&#8208;catalyzed alcoholysis of formamide intermediates, our novel protocol not only obviates the addition of high&#8208;pressure H2 but also prevents side secondary N&#8208;methylation, supported by control experiments and density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambient Catalytic Spinning of Polyethylene Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalently immobilized single&#8208;atom Ni catalyst inside nano&#8208;channels of the anodized Al2O3 membrane enables direct catalytic&#8208;spinning of multifilament PE nanofibers near room temperature. Confinement in the nano&#8208;pores has a positive influence on ethylene extrusion polymerization, namely on the chain&#8208;growth and chain&#8208;walking process&#8211;producing high&#8208;performance microstructures and morphologies.







Abstract
A novel single&#8208;atom Ni(II) catalyst (Ni&#8208;OH) is covalently immobilized onto the nano&#8208;channels of mesoporous Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA)&#8208;15 particles and isotropic Anodized Aluminum Oxide (AAO) membrane for confined&#8208;space ethylene extrusion polymerization. The presence of surface&#8208;tethered Ni complexes (Ni@SBA&#8208;15 and Ni@AAO) is confirmed by the inductively coupled plasma&#8208;optical emission spectrometry (ICP&#8208;OES) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the catalytic spinning process, the produced PE materials exhibit very homogeneous fibrous morphology at nanoscale (diameter: ~50&#8197;nm). The synthesized PE nanofibers extrude in a highly oriented manner from the nano&#8208;reactors at ambient temperature. Remarkably high Mw (1.62&#215;106&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1), melting point (124&#8201;&#176;C), and crystallinity (41.8&#8201;%) are observed among PE samples thanks to the confined&#8208;space polymerization. The chain&#8208;walking behavior of surface tethered Ni catalysts is greatly limited by the confinement inside the nano&#8208;channels, leading to the formation of very low&#8208;branched PE materials (13.6/1000&#8197;C). Due to fixed supported catalytic topology and room temperature, the filaments are expected to be free of entanglement. This work signifies an important step towards the realization of a continuous mild catalytic&#8208;spinning (CATSPIN) process, where the polymer is directly synthesized into fiber shape at negligible chain branching and elegantly avoiding common limitations like thermal degradation or molecular entanglement.

         <title>BN&#8208;Isosteres of Nonacene with Antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 Heterocycles: Synthesis and Strong Luminescence
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hitherto longest nonacene BN&#8208;isosteres with antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 heterocycles embedded in the backbones have been synthesized. The position of the antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 rings remarkably affects the molecular orbital arrangement of the BN&#8208;nonacenes. BN&#8208;3 displays a favorable radiative transition and thus a high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F) of 92&#8201;%.







Abstract
Embedding both boron and nitrogen into the backbone of acenes to generate their isoelectronic structures has significantly enriched the acene chemistry to offer appealing properties. However, only small BN&#8208;heteroacenes have been extensively investigated, with BN&#8208;heptacenes as the hitherto longest homologue. Herein, we report the synthesis of three new nonacene BN&#8208;isosteres via incorporating a pair of antiaromatic B2C4 and N2C4 heterocycles, representing a new length record for BN&#8208;heteroacenes. The distance between the B2C4 and N2C4 rings affects the contribution of the charge&#8208;separated resonance forms, leading to tunable antiaromaticity of the two heterocycles. The adjusted local antiaromaticity manifests substantial influence on the molecular orbital arrangement, and consequently, the radiative transition rate of BN&#8208;3 is greatly enhanced compared with BN&#8208;1 and BN&#8208;2, realizing a high fluorescence quantum yield of 92&#8201;%. This work provides a novel design concept of large acene BN&#8208;isosteres and reveals the importance of BN/CC isosterism on their luminescent properties.

         <title>Advancements and Perspectives toward Lignin Valorization via O&#8208;Demethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
O&#8208;Demethylation (ODM) is a strategic tool to unlock lignin applications for drop&#8208;in and new commodity, fine &amp; specialty chemicals.







Abstract
Lignin represents the largest aromatic carbon resource in plants, holding significant promise as a renewable feedstock for bioaromatics and other cyclic hydrocarbons in the context of the circular bioeconomy. However, the methoxy groups of aryl methyl ethers, abundantly found in technical lignins and lignin&#8208;derived chemicals, limit their pertinent chemical reactivity and broader applicability. Unlocking the phenolic hydroxyl functionality through O&#8208;demethylation (ODM) has emerged as a valuable approach to mitigate this need and enables further applications. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the progress in the valorization of technical lignin and lignin&#8208;derived chemicals via ODM, both catalytic and non&#8208;catalytic reactions. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the properties and potential applications of the O&#8208;demethylated products is presented, accompanied by a systematic overview of available ODM reactions. This review primarily focuses on enhancing the phenolic hydroxyl content in lignin&#8208;derived species through ODM, showcasing its potential in the catalytic funneling of lignin and value&#8208;added applications. A comprehensive synopsis and future outlook are included in the concluding section of this review.

         <title>Water&#8208;Resistance&#8208;Based S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Deep Mineralization of Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel water resistant S&#8208;scheme ZnSn(OH)6&#8208;based heterojunction is in situ designed. The unique H2O&#8208;resistant AlOOH surface layer is conducive to steering the active species to form the dominant intermediates including benzoic acid and benzaldehyde instead of toxic phenols. These intermediates greatly decrease the ring&#8208;opening reaction barrier thus resulting an excellent toluene removal efficiency and a high mineralization rate.







Abstract
Deep mineralization of low concentration toluene (C7H8) is one of the most significant but challenging reactions in photocatalysis. It is generally assumed that hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) as the main reactive species contribute to the enhanced photoactivity, however, it remains ambiguous at this stage. Herein, a S&#8208;scheme ZnSn(OH)6&#8208;based heterojunction with AlOOH as water resistant surface layer is in situ designed for tuning the free radical species and achieving deep mineralization of C7H8. By employing a combination of in situ DRIFTS and materials characterization techniques, we discover that&#160;the dominant intermediates such as benzaldehyde and benzoic acid instead of toxic phenols are formed under the action of holes (h+) and superoxide radicals (&#8901;O2&#8722;). These dominant intermediates turn out to greatly decrease the ring&#8208;opening reaction barrier. This study offers new possibilities for rationally tailoring the active species and thus directionally producing dominant intermediates via designing water resistant surface layer.

         <title>DNA Framework&#8208;Templated Fabrication of Ultrathin Electroactive Gold Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale (width of ~20&#8197;&#956;m) and ultrathin (0.49&#8197;nm) amorphous Au nanosheets are synthesized at room temperature in an aqueous solution using DNA nanosheets with extended single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) with a larger spacing (16.7&#8197;nm) for the first time. The extended ssDNA induces metallization and enables further precise modification of the metalized nanostructures at predefined positions.







Abstract
Generally, two&#8208;dimensional gold nanomaterials have unique properties and functions that offer exciting application prospects. However, the crystal phases of these materials tend to be limited to the thermodynamically stable crystal structure. Herein, we report a DNA framework&#8208;templated approach for the ambient aqueous synthesis of freestanding and microscale amorphous gold nanosheets with ultrathin sub&#8208;nanometer thickness. We observe that extended single&#8208;stranded DNA on DNA nanosheets can induce site&#8208;specific metallization and enable precise modification of the metalized nanostructures at predefined positions. More importantly, the as&#8208;prepared gold nanosheets can serve as an electrocatalyst for glucose oxidase&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation, exhibiting enhanced electrocatalytic activity (~3&#8208;fold) relative to discrete gold nanoclusters owing to a larger electrochemical active area and wider band gap. The proposed DNA framework&#8208;templated metallization strategy is expected to be applicable in a broad range of fields, from catalysis to new energy materials.

         <title>Photocatalytic H2 Generation: Controlled and Optimized Dispersion of Single Atom Co&#8208;Catalysts Based on Pt&#8208;TCPP Planar Adsorption on TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially controlled TiO2 surface decoration with Pt single&#8208;atom (SA) active sites is achieved by self&#8208;organized planar adsorption of mixed TCPP/Pt&#8208;TCPP precursor compounds. Via a suitable thermal treatment, an optimal loading and distribution of SA co&#8208;catalytic sites are established, which is a key factor in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.







Abstract
When using single atoms (SAs) as a co&#8208;catalyst in photocatalytic H2 generation, achieving a well&#8208;dispersed, evenly distributed and adjustable SA surface density on a semiconductor surface is a challenging task. In the present work we use the planar adsorption of tetrakis&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TCPP) and its platinum coordinated analogue, Pt&#8208;TCPP, onto anatase TiO2 surfaces to establish a spatially controlled decoration of SAs. We show that the surface Pt SA density can be very well controlled by co&#8208;adsorption of Pt&#8208;TCPP and TCPP in the planar monolayer regime, and by adjusting the Pt&#8208;TCPP to TCPP ratio a desired well dispersed surface density of SAs up to 2.6&#215;105&#8197;atoms&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;2 can be established (which is the most effective Pt SA loading for photocatalysis). This distribution and the SA state are maintained after a thermal treatment in air, and an optimized SA density as well as a most active form of Pt for photocatalytic H2 evolution can be established and maintained.

         <title>LiNO3&#8208;Based Electrolytes via Electron&#8208;Donation Modulation for Sustainable Nonaqueous Lithium Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron donation modulation rules are proposed to elucidate the formation mechanism and stability principle of LiNO3 as the single salt for electrolytes of nonaqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries. High donor&#8208;number solvents with strong electron&#8208;donation ability dissolve LiNO3 while low donor&#8208;number solvents with weak electron&#8208;donation ability regulate the AI&#8208;ISC structure to stabilize the electrolyte. The LiNO3&#8208;DMSO@PC electrolyte enables remarkable long&#8208;term cycling performance by improving the solvent reduction tolerance.







Abstract
LiPF6 as a dominant lithium salt of electrolyte is widely used in commercial rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its well&#8208;balanced properties, including high solubility in organic solvents, good electrochemical stability, and high ionic conductivity. However, it suffers from several undesirable properties, such as high moisture sensitivity, thermal instability, and high cost. To address these issues, herein, we propose an electron&#8208;donation modulation (EDM) rule for the development of low&#8208;cost, sustainable, and electrochemically compatible LiNO3&#8208;based electrolytes. We employ high donor&#8208;number solvents (HDNSs) with strong electron&#8208;donation ability to dissolve LiNO3, while low donor&#8208;number solvents (LDNSs) with weak electron&#8208;donation ability are used to regulate the solvation structure to stabilize the electrolytes. As an example, we design the LiNO3&#8208;DMSO@PC electrolyte, where DMSO acts as an HDNS and PC serves as an LDNS. This electrolyte exhibits excellent electrochemical compatibility with graphite anodes, as well as the LiFePO4 and LiCoO2 cathodes, leading to stable cycling over 200&#8197;cycles. Through spectroscopy analyses and theoretical calculation, we uncover the underlying mechanism responsible for the stabilization of these electrolytes. Our findings provide valuable insights into the preparation of LiNO3&#8208;based electrolytes using the EDM rule, opening new avenues for the development of advanced electrolytes with versatile functions for sustainable rechargeable batteries.

We employ high donor-number solvents (HDNSs) with strong electron-donation ability to dissolve LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, while low donor-number solvents (LDNSs) with weak electron-donation ability are used to regulate the solvation structure to stabilize the electrolytes. As an example, we design the LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-DMSO@PC electrolyte, where DMSO acts as an HDNS and PC serves as an LDNS. This electrolyte exhibits excellent electrochemical compatibility with graphite anodes, as well as the LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes, leading to stable cycling over 200&#8197;cycles. Through spectroscopy analyses and theoretical calculation, we uncover the underlying mechanism responsible for the stabilization of these electrolytes. Our findings provide valuable insights into the preparation of LiNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based electrolytes using the EDM rule, opening new avenues for the development of advanced electrolytes with versatile functions for sustainable rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tip&#8208;like Fe&#8722;N4 Sites Induced Surface Microenvironments Regulation Boosts the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tip&#8208;like FeN4 structures on curved carbon surfaces are designed for highly efficient oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). The curved structure induced a strong local electric field and dense interfacial water layer, enhancing the kinetics of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps. The modulated electronic structures of Fe centers facilitate the ORR pathway transition from an associative to a dissociative process.







Abstract
Single atom catalysts with defined local structures and favorable surface microenvironments are significant for overcoming slow kinetics and accelerating O2 electroreduction. Here, enriched tip&#8208;like FeN4 sites (T&#8722;Fe SAC) on spherical carbon surfaces were developed to investigate the change in surface microenvironments and catalysis behavior. Finite element method (FEM) simulations, together with experiments, indicate the strong local electric field of the tip&#8208;like FeN4 and the more denser interfacial water layer, thereby enhancing the kinetics of the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. In situ spectroelectrochemical studies and the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results indicate the pathway transition on the tip&#8208;like FeN4 sites, promoting the dissociation of O&#8722;O bond via side&#8208;on adsorption model. The adsorbed OH* can be facilely released on the curved surface and accelerate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics. The obtained T&#8722;Fe SAC nanoreactor exhibits excellent ORR activities (E1/2=0.91&#8197;V vs. RHE) and remarkable stability, exceeding those of flat FeN4 and Pt/C. This work clarified the in&#8208;depth insights into the origin of catalytic activity of tip&#8208;like FeN4 sites and held great promise in industrial catalysis, electrochemical energy storage, and many other fields.

         <title>Tuning Shortwave&#8208;Infrared J&#8208;aggregates of Aromatic Ring&#8208;Fused Aza&#8208;BODIPYs by Peripheral Substituents for Combined Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapies at Ultralow Laser Power</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aromatic ring [b]&#8208;fused aza&#8208;BODIPYs are modified with multiple methoxyl groups to regulate the molecular surface electrostatic potential which successfully induced desirable J&#8208;aggregates. Importantly, BDP&#8208;a exhibits controllable J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregation behaviors with adjustable morphologies. Its self&#8208;assembled J&#8208;aggregated nanoparticles could be used for combined photothermal and photodynamic therapies under ultralow laser power density.







Abstract
Achieving photothermal therapy (PTT) at ultralow laser power density is crucial for minimizing photo&#8208;damage and allowing for higher maximum permissible skin exposure. However, this requires photothermal agents to possess not just superior photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), but also exceptional near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptivity. J&#8208;aggregates, exhibit a significant redshift and narrower absorption peak with a higher extinction coefficient. Nevertheless, achieving predictable J&#8208;aggregates through molecular design remains a challenge. In this study, we successfully induced desirable J&#8208;aggregation (&#955;absmax: 968&#8197;nm, &#1013;: 2.96&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, &#955;emmax: 972&#8197;nm, &#934;FL: 6.2&#8201;%) by tuning electrostatic interactions between &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular planes through manipulating molecular surface electrostatic potential of aromatic ring&#8208;fused aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes. Notably, by controlling the preparation method for encapsulating dyes into F&#8208;127 polymer, we were able to selectively generate H&#8208;/J&#8208;aggregates, respectively. Furthermore, the J&#8208;aggregates exhibited two controllable morphologies: nanospheres and nanowires. Importantly, the shortwave&#8208;infrared J&#8208;aggregated nanoparticles with impressive PCE of 72.9&#8201;% effectively destroyed cancer cells and mice&#8208;tumors at an ultralow power density of 0.27&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (915&#8197;nm). This phototherapeutic nano&#8208;platform, which generates predictable J&#8208;aggregation behavior, and can controllably form J&#8208;/H&#8208;aggregates and selectable J&#8208;aggregate morphology, is a valuable paradigm for developing photothermal agents for tumor&#8208;treatment at ultralow laser power density.

         <title>Vacancies&#8208;regulated Prussian Blue Analogues through Precipitation Conversion for Cathodes in Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries with Energy Densities over 500 Wh/kg</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been widely applied in many fields, especially as cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries on account of their low cost and open framework for fast ions transport. However, the capacity of reported PBAs has a great distance from its theoretical value. Herein, we proposed that [Fe(CN)6] vacancies are crucial point for the high specific capacity for the first time. The [Fe(CN)6] vacancies may create net electrons and reduce obstacles to ionic transport, which is conducive to rate performance of PBAs by increasing electronic and ionic conductivity to some extent. As a proof of concept, a series of PBAs have been prepared by co&#8208;precipitation method. And then, a novel precipitation conversion method has been designed, by which unique PBAs with a specific quantity of [Fe(CN)6] vacancies was successfully synthesized. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared PBAs possessing hierarchical hollow morphology have reached a unprecedent level of high capacity (168 mAh g&#8722;1 at 25 mA g&#8722;1, close to PBAs&#8217; theoretical capacity 170 mAh g&#8722;1), high rate performance (90 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1), and high energy density (over 500 Wh kg&#8722;1).</dc:description>

         <title>Supporting Information A Halogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Artificial Chloride&#8208;Selective Channel Constructed from 5&#8208;Iodoisophthalamide&#8208;based Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite considerable emphasis on advancing artificial ion channels, progress is constrained by the limited availability of small molecules with the necessary attributes of self&#8208;assembly and ion selectivity. In this study, a library of small molecules based on 5&#8208;haloisophthalamide and a non&#8208;halogenated isophthalamide were examined for their ion transport properties across the lipid bilayer membranes, and the finding demonstrates that the di&#8208;hexyl&#8208;substituted 5&#8208;iodoisophthalamide derivative exhibits the highest level of activity. Furthermore, it was established that the highest active compound facilitates the selective chloride transport that occurs via an antiport&#8208;mediated mechanism. The crystal structure of the compound unveils a distinctive self&#8208;assembly of molecules, forming a zig&#8208;zag channel pore that is well&#8208;suited for the permeation of anions. Planar bilayer conductance measurements proved the formation of chloride selective channels. A molecular dynamics simulation study, relying on the self&#8208;assembled component derived from the crystal structure, affirmed the paramount significance of intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the formation of supramolecular barrel&#8208;rosette structures that span the bilayer.&#160; Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the transport of chloride across the lipid bilayer membrane is facilitated by the synergistic effects of halogen bonding and hydrogen bonding within the channel.</dc:description>

In this study, a library of small molecules based on 5-haloisophthalamide and a non-halogenated isophthalamide were examined for their ion transport properties across the lipid bilayer membranes, and the finding demonstrates that the di-hexyl-substituted 5-iodoisophthalamide derivative exhibits the highest level of activity. Furthermore, it was established that the highest active compound facilitates the selective chloride transport that occurs via an antiport-mediated mechanism. The crystal structure of the compound unveils a distinctive self-assembly of molecules, forming a zig-zag channel pore that is well-suited for the permeation of anions. Planar bilayer conductance measurements proved the formation of chloride selective channels.

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of C&#8208;SCF3 Stereocenters via Nickel Catalyzed Asymmetric Negishi Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of the SCF3&#8208;containing 1,1&#8208;diaryl tertiary carbon stereocenters with high enantioselectivities is reported via a nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling strategy. This method demonstrates simple operations, mild conditions and excellent functional group tolerance, with newly designed SCF3&#8208;containing synthon, which can be easily obtained from commercially available benzyl bromide and trifluoromethylthio anion in a two&#8208;step manner. Further substrate exploration indicated that the reaction system could be extended to access diverse perfluoroalkyl sulfide (SC2F5, SC3F7, SC4F9, SCF2CO2Et)&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8208;diaryl compounds with excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic utility of this transformation was further demonstrated by convenient syntheses of optical SCF3&#8208;containing analogues of bioactive compounds without an apparent decrease in enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Flavin&#8208;N5OOH Functions as both a Powerful Nucleophile and a Base in the Superfamily of Flavoenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flavoenzymes can mediate a large variety of oxidation reactions via the activation of oxygen. However, the O2 activation chemistry by flavin enzymes is not yet fully exploited. Normally, the O2 activation occurs at the C4a site of the flavin cofactor, yielding the flavin C4a&#8208;(hydro)hydroperoxyl species in monooxygenases or oxidases. Using extensive MD simulations, QM/MM calculations and QM calculations, our studies reveal the formation of the common nucleophilic species, flavin&#8208;N5OOH, in two distinct flavoenzymes (RutA and EncM). Our studies show that flavin&#8208;N5OOH acts as a powerful nucleophile that promotes C&#8211;N cleavage of uracil in RutA, and a powerful base in the deprotonation of substrates in EncM. We reason that flavin&#8208;N5OOH can be a common reactive species in the superfamily of flavoenzymes, which accomplishes the generally selective general base catalysis, and the C&#8211;X (X= N, S, Cl, O) cleavage reactions that are otherwise challenging by solvated hydroxide ion base. These results expand our understanding of the chemistry and catalysis of flavoenzymes.</dc:description>

To date, only 4d and 5d transition complexes, but none of 3d counterparts, could realize such a transformation. Likewise, complexes {[Cp*Cr(dmpe)]2(&#956;&#8208;N2)}0/1+/2+ (1&#8208;3) are incapable to cleave N2, in contrast to their Mo congeners. Remarkably, cross this series the N&#8208;N bond length of the N2 ligand and the N&#8208;N stretching frequency exhibit unprecedented nonmonotonic variations, and complexes 1 and 2 in both solid and solution states display rare thermally activated ligand&#8208;mediated two&#8208;center spin transitions&#160;(STs), distinct from discrete dinuclear spin crossovers. In&#8208;depth analyses using wave function based ab initio calculations reveal that the Cr&#8208;N2&#8208;Cr bonding in complexes 1&#8208;3 is distinguished by strong multireference character and cannot be described by solely one electron configuration or Lewis structure, and that all intriguing spectroscopic observations originate in their sophisticate multireference electronic structures. More critical is that such multireference bonding of complexes 1&#8208;3 is at least a key factor that contributes to their kinetic inertness toward splitting N2. The mechanistic understanding is then used to rationalize the disparate reactivity of related 3d M(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2)M complexes compared to their 4d and 5d analogs.</dc:description>

         <title>Piezofluorochromism in Hierarchical Porous &#960;&#8208;stacked Supermolecular Spring Frameworks from Aromatic Chiral Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezochromic materials that exhibit pressure&#8208;dependent luminescence variations are attracting interest with wide potential applications in mechanical sensors, anticounterfeiting and storage devices. Crystalline porous materials (CPMs) have been widely studied in piezochromism for highly tunable luminescence. Nevertheless, reversible and high&#8208;contrast emission response with a wide pressure range is still challenging. Herein, the first example of hierarchical porous cage&#8208;based &#960;OF (Cage&#8208;&#960;OF&#8208;1) with spring structure was synthesized by using aromatic chiral cages as building blocks. Its elastic properties evaluated based on the bulk modulus (9.5 GPa) is softer than most reported CPMs and the collapse point (20.0 GPa) significantly exceeds ever reported CPMs. As smart materials, Cage&#8208;&#960;OF&#8208;1 displays linear pressure&#8208;dependent emission and achieves a high&#8208;contrast emission difference up to 154 nm. Pressure&#8208;responsive limit is up to 16 GPa, outperforming the CPMs reported so far. Dedicated experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions&#8208;dominated controllable structural shrinkage and porous&#8208;spring&#8208;structure&#8208;mediated elasticity is responsible for the outstanding piezofluorochromism.</dc:description>

         <title>Boundary&#8208;rich Carbon&#8208;based Electrocatalysts with Manganese(II)&#8208;coordinated Active Environment for Selective Synthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordinated manganese (Mn) electrocatalysts owing to their electronic structure flexibility, non&#8208;toxic and earth abundant features are promising for electrocatalytic reactions. However, achieving selective hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production through two electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8208;ORR) is a challenge on Mn&#8208;centered catalysts. Targeted this goal, we report on the creation of secondary&#160;Mn(II)&#8208;coordinated active environment with reactant enrichment effect&#160;on boundary&#8208;rich porous carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts,&#160;which facilitates the selective and rapid synthesis of H2O2 through 2e&#8208;ORR.&#160;The catalysts exhibit nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency and H2O2 productivity up to 15.1 mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 0.1 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, representing the record high activity for Mn&#8208;based electrocatalyst in H2O2 electrosynthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal that the epoxide and hydroxyl groups surrounding Mn(II) centers improve spin state by modifying electronic properties and charge transfer, thus tailoring the adsorption strength of *OOH intermediate. Multiscale simulations reveal that the high&#8208;curvature boundaries facilitate oxygen (O2) adsorption and result in local O2 enrichment due to the enhanced interaction between carbon surface and O2. These merits together ensure the efficient formation of H2O2 with high local concentration, which can directly boost the tandem reaction of hydrolysis of benzonitrile to benzamide with nearly 100% conversion rate and exclusive benzamide selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing The Extreme of Multicentre Bonding: Planar Pentacoordinate Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Planar hypercoordination has sparkled interest among the researchers from last few decades. Most of the elements in the Periodic Table have shown this remarkable structural feature. However, the smallest element, hydrogen, is missing in the list. No evidence is there in the literature. Herein, we introduce the first planar pentacoordinate hydrogen atom (ppH) in the global minimum geometry of Li5H6&#8209; cluster. Bonding analysis indicates that the central hydrogen atom is stabilized by multicentre bonding with five surrounding Li atoms. Natural charge analysis reveals that the central hydrogen is acting like a hydride which is strongly attracted by the positively charged surrounding lithium centres. The ppH structure is stabilized by strong electrostatic attraction as well as extensive multicentre bonding. Aromaticity has no role to play here.

Most of the elements in the Periodic Table have shown this remarkable structural feature. However, the smallest element, hydrogen, is missing in the list. No evidence is there in the literature. Herein, we introduce the first planar pentacoordinate hydrogen atom (ppH) in the global minimum geometry of Li5H6&#8209; cluster. Bonding analysis indicates that the central hydrogen atom is stabilized by multicentre bonding with five surrounding Li atoms. Natural charge analysis reveals that the central hydrogen is acting like a hydride which is strongly attracted by the positively charged surrounding lithium centres. The ppH structure is stabilized by strong electrostatic attraction as well as extensive multicentre bonding. Aromaticity has no role to play here. The cluster is dynamically stable and is expected to be detected in gas phase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>1D Covalent Organic Frameworks Triggering Highly Efficient Photosynthesis of H2O2 via Controllable Modular Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The topological diversity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) enables considerable space for exploring their structure&#8208;performance relationships. In this study, we report a sequence of novel 1D COFs (EO, ES, and ESe&#8208;COF) with typical 4&#8208;c sql topology that can be interconnected with VIA group elements (O, S, and Se) via a modular design strategy. It is found that the electronic structures, charge delivery property, light harvesting ability, and hydrophilicity of these 1D COFs can be profoundly influenced by the bridge&#8208;linked atom ordinal. Finally, EO&#8208;COF, possessing the highest quantity of active sites, the longest lifetime of the active electron, the strongest interaction with O2, and the lowest energy barrier of O2 reduction, exhibits exceptional photocatalytic O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 activity under visible light, with a production rate of 2675 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a high apparent quantum yield of 6.57% at 450 nm. This is the first systematic report on 1D COFs for H2O2 photosynthesis, which enriches the topological database in reticular chemistry and promotes the exploration of structure&#8208;catalysis correlation.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Postsynthetic Copolymerization of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks into a PolyHOF Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have shown promise in various fields; however, the construction of HOF/polymer hybrid membranes that can maintain both structural and functional integrity remains challenging. In this study, we here fabricated a new HOF (HOF&#8208;50) with reserved polymerizable allyl group via charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonds between the carboxylate anion and amidinium, and subsequently copolymerized the HOF with monomers to construct a covalently bonded HOF/polymer hybrid (polyHOF) membrane. The resulting polyHOF membrane not only exhibits customizable mechanical properties and extreme stability, but also shows an exceptional ratiometric luminescent temperature&#8208;sensing function with very high sensitivity and visibility even when the lanthanide content is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the reported mixed&#8208;lanthanide metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and lanthanide&#8208;doped covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This orthogonal postsynthesis copolymerization strategy may provide a general approach for preparing covalently connected HOF/polymer hybrid membranes for diverse applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Biodegradable Monometallic Aluminum as a Biotuner for Tumor Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyroptosis is an effective anti&#8208;tumor strategy. However, monometallic pyroptosis biotuners have not been explored until now. Here, we discover for the first time that biodegradable monometallic Al can as a pyroptosis biotuner for tumor therapy. pH&#8208;sensitive Al nanoparticles (Al@P) are obtained by equipping polyethylene glycol&#8208;b&#8208;(poly(methyl methacrylate)&#8208;co&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine), which can exert their effect at the tumor site without affecting normal cells. The H2 and Al3+ release by Al@P in the acidic environment of tumor disrupts the redox balance and ionic homeostasis in tumor cells, thus generating large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to caspase&#8208;1 activation, gasdermin D cleavage, and IL&#8208;1&#946;/LDH release, which induces canonical pyroptotic death. Meanwhile, prodrug Doxorubicin (Pro&#8208;DOX) is successfully loaded onto Al@P (Al@P&#8208;P) and can be activated by ROS to release DOX in the tumor cells, thus further improving the tumor&#8208;killing efficiency. Ultimately, Al@P&#8208;P has degradability and exhibits efficient tumor inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Upgrading of Polylactic Acid Waste into Alanine under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polylactic acid (PLA) has attracted increasing interest as a sustainable plastic because it can be degraded into CO2 and H2O in nature. However, this process is sluggish, and even worse, it is a CO2 emission and carbon resource waste process. Therefore, it is highly urgent to develop a novel strategy for recycling post&#8208;consumer PLA to achieve a circular plastics economy. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot photoreforming route for the efficient and selective amination of PLA waste into value&#8208;added alanine using CoP/CdS catalysts under mild conditions. Results show the alanine production rate can reach up to 2.4 mmol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, with a high selectivity (&gt;75%) and excellent stability. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectra (TAS) reveal that CoP in&#8208;situ grown on CdS can rapidly extract photogenerated electrons from CdS to accelerate proton reduction, favoring hole&#8208;dominated PLA oxidation for the coproduction of alanine. This study offers an appealing way for the PLA waste upcycling and creates new opportunities for the green synthesis of amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptisorption of Nonporous Polymer Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although our knowledge and understanding of adsorptions in natural and artificial systems has increased dramatically during the past century, adsorption associated with nonporous polymers remains something of a mystery, hampering applications. Here we demonstrate a model system for adaptisorption of nonporous polymers, wherein dative B&#8722;N bonds and host&#8722;guest binding units act as the kinetic and thermodynamic components, respectively. The coupling of these two components enables nonporous polymer crystals to adsorb molecules from solution and undergo recrystallization as thermodynamically favored crystals. Adaptisorption of nonporous polymer crystals not only extends the types of adsorption in which the sorbate molecules are integrated in a precise and order manner in the sorbent systems, but also provides a facile and accurate approach to the construction of polymeric materials with precise architectures and integrated functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Prolinyl Phosphoramidates of Nucleotides with Increased Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleoside monophosphates (NMPs) are the subunits of RNA. They are incorporated in growing complementary strands when sequences are copied in enzyme&#8208;free reactions using organic leaving groups at the phosphates. Amino acids are rarely considered as leaving groups, but proline can act as leaving group when N&#8208;linked to NMPs, so that prolinyl NMPs hydrolyze in aqueous buffer at 37 &#176;C, with half&#8208;life times as short as 2.4 h, and they act as monomers in enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. Still, their level of reactivity is insufficient for practical purposes, requiring months for some extensions. Here we report the synthesis of eight substituted prolinyl AMPs together with seven related compounds and the results of a study of their reactivity. A &#948;&#8208;carboxy prolinyl NMP was found to be converted with a half&#8208;life time of just 11 min in magnesium&#8208;free buffer, and a &#948;&#8208;isopropyl NMP was shown to react seven&#8208;fold faster than its prolinyl counterpart in enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying of RNA. Our results indicate that both anchimeric and steric effects can be employed to increase the reactivity of aminoacidyl nucleotides, i.e. compounds that combine two fundamental classes of biomolecules in one functional entity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The incorporation of non&#8208;benzenoid motifs in graphene nanostructures significantly impacts their properties, making them attractive for applications in carbon&#8208;based electronics. However, understanding how specific non&#8208;benzenoid structures influence their properties remains limited, and further investigations are needed to fully comprehend their implications. Here, we report an on&#8208;surface synthetic strategy toward fabricating non&#8208;benzenoid nanographenes containing different combinations of pentagonal and heptagonal rings. Their structure and electronic properties were investigated via scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, complemented by computational investigations. After thermal activation of the precursor P on the Au(111) surface, we detected two major nanographene products. Nanographene Aa&#8208;a embeds two azulene units formed through oxidative ring&#8208;closure of methyl substituents, while Aa&#8208;s contains one azulene unit and one Stone&#8208;Wales defect, formed by the combination of oxidative ring&#8208;closure and skeletal ring&#8208;rearrangement reactions. Aa&#8208;a exhibits an antiferromagnetic ground state with the highest magnetic exchange coupling reported up to date for a non&#8208;benzenoid containing nanographene, coexisting with side&#8208;products with &#160;closed shell configurations resulted from the combination of ring&#8208;closure and ring&#8208;rearragement reactions (Ba&#8208;a, Ba&#8208;s, Bs&#8208;a and Bs&#8208;s). Our results provide insights into the single gold atom assisted synthesis of novel NGs containing non&#8208;benzenoid motifs and their tailored electronic/magnetic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Converting Glycerol into Valuable Trioses by Cu&#948;+&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Decorated WO3 under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic selective oxidation under visible light presents a promising approach for the sustainable transformation of biomass&#8208;derived wastes. However, achieving both high conversion and excellent selectivity poses a significant challenge. In this study, two valuable trioses, glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone, are produced from glycerol over Cu&#948;+&#8208;decorated WO3 photocatalyst in the presence of H2O2. The photocatalyst exhibits a remarkable five&#8208;fold increase in the conversion rate (3.81 mmol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1) while maintaining a high selectivity towards two trioses (46.4% to glyceraldehyde and 32.9% to dihydroxyacetone). Through a comprehensive analysis involving X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements with and without light irradiation, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, and isotopic analysis, the critical role of Cu+ species has been explored as efficient hole acceptors. These species facilitate charge transfer, promoting glycerol oxidation by photoholes, followed by coupling with OH&#8208;, which are subsequently dehydrated to yield the desired glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Catalytic RNA Circuits for Construction of Artificial Signaling Pathways in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering of genetic networks with artificial signaling pathways (ASPs) can reprogram cellular responses and phenotypes under different circumstances for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. However, construction of ASPs between originally independent endogenous genes in mammalian cells is highly challenging. Here we report an amplifiable RNA circuit that can theoretically build regulatory connections between any endogenous genes in mammalian cells. We harness the system of catalytic hairpin assembly with combination of controllable CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 function to transduce the signals from distinct messenger RNA expression of trigger genes into manipulation of target genes. Through introduction of these RNA&#8208;based genetic circuits, mammalian cells are endowed with autonomous capabilities to sense the changes of RNA expression either induced by ligand stimuli or from various cell types and control the cellular responses and fates via apoptosis&#8208;related ASPs. Our design provides a generalized platform for construction of ASPs inside the genetic networks of mammalian cells based on differentiated RNA expression.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Solvents Regulated Crystallization&#8208;Limited Electrolytes for All&#8208;Climate Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel asymmetric solvents regulated crystallization limitation strategy is developed to lower electrolyte operation temperature windows for lithium metal batteries. Mixing asymmetric ethylene sulfite (ES) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) can reduce the molecular interaction and orientation arrangement dynamics, allowing the resulting electrolyte to show fast ion transport even at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Electrolytes that can keep liquid state are one of the most important physical metrics to ensure the ions transfer with stable operation of rechargeable lithium&#8208;based batteries at a wide temperature window. It is generally accepted that strong polar solvents with high melting points favor the safe operation of batteries above room temperatures but are susceptible to crystallization at low temperatures (&#8804;&#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C). Here, a crystallization limitation strategy was proposed to handle this issue. We demonstrate that, although the high melting points of ethylene sulfite (ES, &#8722;17&#8201;&#176;C) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC, &#8776;23&#8201;&#176;C), their mixtures can avoid crystallization at low temperatures, which can be attributed to low intermolecular interactions and altered molecular motion dynamics. A suitable ES/FEC ratio (10&#8201;% FEC) can balance the bulk and interface transport of ions, enabling LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2||lithium (NCM811||Li) full cells to deliver excellent temperature resilience and cycling stability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C to +70&#8201;&#176;C. More than 66&#8201;% of the capacity retention was achieved at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C compared to room temperature. The NCM811||Li pouch cells exhibit high cycling stability under realistic conditions (electrolyte weight to cathode capacity ratio (E/C)&#8804;3.5&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1, negative to positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P)&#8804;1.09) at different temperatures.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelling Macroscale Sheets Powered by Enzyme Pumps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedded nano&#8208;sized enzymes, in the presence of their respective substrates, can drive centimeter&#8208;scale polymer sheets along directed linear paths and rotational trajectories on the air/water interface.







Abstract
Nanoscale enzymes anchored to surfaces act as chemical pumps by converting chemical energy released from enzymatic reactions into spontaneous fluid flow that propels entrained nano&#8208; and microparticles. Enzymatic pumps are biocompatible, highly selective, and display unique substrate specificity. Utilizing these pumps to trigger self&#8208;propelled motion on the macroscale has, however, constituted a significant challenge and thus prevented their adaptation in macroscopic fluidic devices and soft robotics. Using experiments and simulations, we herein show that enzymatic pumps can drive centimeter&#8208;scale polymer sheets along directed linear paths and rotational trajectories. In these studies, the sheets are confined to the air/water interface. With the addition of appropriate substrate, the asymmetric enzymatic coating on the sheets induces chemically driven, buoyancy flows that controllably propel the sheet's motion on the air/water interface. The directionality and speed of the motion can be tailored by changing the pattern of the enzymatic coating, type of enzyme, and nature and concentration of the substrate. This work highlights the utility of biocompatible enzymes for generating motion in macroscale fluidic devices and robotics and indicates their potential utility for in vivo applications.

         <title>Reference&#8208;Quality Free Energy Barriers in Catalysis from Machine Learning Thermodynamic Perturbation Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Free energy barriers of acid&#8208;catalyzed cracking and isomerization reactions of alkenes are computed at an unprecedented level of theory, combining dynamic effects investigated by ab initio molecular dynamics and high&#8208;level electronic energy calculations with Machine Learning thermodynamic Perturbation Theory. The results are close to chemical accuracy.







Abstract
For the first time, we report calculations of the free energies of activation of cracking and isomerization reactions of alkenes that combine several different electronic structure methods with molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that the use of a high level of theory (here Random Phase Approximation&#8212;RPA) is necessary to bridge the gap between experimental and computed values. These transformations, catalyzed by zeolites and proceeding via cationic intermediates and transition states, are building blocks of many chemical transformations for valorization of long chain paraffins originating, e.g., from plastic waste, vegetable oils, Fischer&#8211;Tropsch waxes or crude oils. Compared with the free energy barriers computed at the PBE+D2 production level of theory via constrained ab initio molecular dynamics, the barriers computed at the RPA level by the application of Machine Learning thermodynamic Perturbation Theory (MLPT) show a significant decrease for isomerization reaction and an increase of a similar magnitude for cracking, yielding an unprecedented agreement with the results obtained by experiments and kinetic modeling.

&lt;p&gt;Free energy barriers of acid-catalyzed cracking and isomerization reactions of alkenes are computed at an unprecedented level of theory, combining dynamic effects investigated by ab initio molecular dynamics and high-level electronic energy calculations with Machine Learning thermodynamic Perturbation Theory. The results are close to chemical accuracy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we report calculations of the free energies of activation of cracking and isomerization reactions of alkenes that combine several different electronic structure methods with molecular dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that the use of a high level of theory (here Random Phase Approximation&#8212;RPA) is necessary to bridge the gap between experimental and computed values. These transformations, catalyzed by zeolites and proceeding via cationic intermediates and transition states, are building blocks of many chemical transformations for valorization of long chain paraffins originating, e.g., from plastic waste, vegetable oils, Fischer&#8211;Tropsch waxes or crude oils. Compared with the free energy barriers computed at the PBE+D2 production level of theory via constrained ab initio molecular dynamics, the barriers computed at the RPA level by the application of Machine Learning thermodynamic Perturbation Theory (MLPT) show a significant decrease for isomerization reaction and an increase of a similar magnitude for cracking, yielding an unprecedented agreement with the results obtained by experiments and kinetic modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cable Bacteria Skeletons as Catalytically Active Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological cables as electrodes: Electrically conducting filamentous cable bacteria skeletons were used as free&#8208;standing biological electrodes and displayed catalytic selectivity towards oxygen. The skeletons convert water to oxygen and oxygen back to water. We show that the reactions can be driven either by an external electric field or by simply exposing the cables to a gradient of oxygen concentration.







Abstract
Cable bacteria are multicellular, filamentous bacteria that use internal conductive fibers to transfer electrons over centimeter distances from donors within anoxic sediment layers to oxygen at the surface. We extracted the fibers and used them as free&#8208;standing bio&#8208;based electrodes to investigate their electrocatalytic behavior. The fibers catalyzed the reversible interconversion of oxygen and water, and an electric current was running through the fibers even when the potential difference was generated solely by a gradient of oxygen concentration. Oxygen reduction as well as oxygen evolution were confirmed by optical measurements. Within living cable bacteria, oxygen reduction by direct electrocatalysis on the fibers and not by membrane&#8208;bound proteins readily explains exceptionally high cell&#8208;specific oxygen consumption rates observed in the oxic zone, while electrocatalytic water oxidation may provide oxygen to cells in the anoxic zone.

         <title>Azonia&#8208;Naphthalene: A Cationic Hydrophilic Building Block for Stable N&#8208;Type Organic Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel hydrophobic building block, 4a&#8208;azonia&#8208;naphthalene (AN), for n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors. AN have the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability, and exhibit strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, leading to smaller &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, interesting ion diffusion behavior, and good morphology stability, resulting in improved ion diffusion/injection speed and operational stability of organic electrochemical transistors.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers that can efficiently transport both ionic and electronic charges have broad applications in next&#8208;generation optoelectronic, bioelectronic, and energy storage devices. To date, almost all the conjugated polymers have hydrophobic backbones, which impedes efficient ion diffusion/transport in aqueous media. Here, we design and synthesize a novel hydrophilic polymer building block, 4a&#8208;azonia&#8208;naphthalene (AN), drawing inspiration from biological systems. Because of the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of AN, the AN&#8208;based polymers show typical n&#8208;type charge transport behaviors. We find that cationic aromatics exhibit strong cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, leading to smaller &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, interesting ion diffusion behavior, and good morphology stability. Additionally, AN enhances the hydrophilicity and ionic&#8208;electronic coupling of the polymer, which can help to improve ion diffusion/injection speed, and operational stability of organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). The integration of cationic building blocks will undoubtedly enrich the material library for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type conjugated polymers.

         <title>A Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#8208;Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (MRI&#8208;CEST) Method for the Detection of Water Cycling across Cellular Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#8208;Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (MRI&#8208;CEST) method to image and quantify in vivo water cycling across cell membranes is reported. Parametric MRI&#8208;maps can be obtained that report, for each voxel, the degree of water permeability across cells. Cell membrane water permeability is a biomarker of cancer aggressiveness and can be used to monitor chemotherapy, as demonstrated in murine models of breast cancers.







Abstract
Water cycling across the membrane transporters is considered a hallmark of cellular metabolism and it could be of high diagnostic relevance in the characterization of tumors and other diseases. The method relies on the response of intracellular proton exchanging molecules to the presence of extracellular Gd&#8208;based contrast agents (GBCAs). Paramagnetic GBCAs enhances the relaxation rate of water molecules in the extracellular compartment and, through membrane exchange, the relaxation enhancement is transferred to intracellular molecules. The effect is detected at the MRI&#8208;CEST (Magnetic Resonance Imaging &#8208; Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer) signal of intracellular proton exchanging molecules. The magnitude of the change in the CEST response reports on water cycling across the membrane. The method has been tested on Red Blood Cells and on orthotopic murine models of breast cancer with different degree of malignancy (4T1, TS/A and 168FARN). The distribution of voxels reporting on membrane permeability fits well with the cells&#8217; aggressiveness and acts as an early reporter to monitor therapeutic treatments.

         <title>Selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Syngas Conversion Enabled by Bimetallic Gold/Zinc Sites in Partially Reduced Gold/Zinc Oxide Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For AuZn/ZnO nanoarrays, a bimetallic synergistic effect reduces the activation energy barrier of CO2 molecules and accelerates electron transfer. The dual metal active sites effectively electrocatalyze CO2 and H2O conversion to syngas with a tunable syngas CO/H2 ratios from 0.25 to 2.50.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas (gaseous mixture of CO and H2) is a promising way to curb excessive CO2 emission and the greenhouse gas effect. Herein, we present a bimetallic AuZn@ZnO (AuZn/ZnO) catalyst with high efficiency and durability for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and H2O, which enables a high Faradaic efficiency of 66.4&#8201;% for CO and 26.5&#8201;% for H2 and 3&#8197;h stability of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The CO/H2 ratios show a wide range from 0.25 to 2.50 over a narrow potential window (&#8722;0.7&#8197;V to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. RHE). In situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations reveals that the bimetallic synergistic effect between Au and Zn sites lowers the activation energy barrier of CO2 molecules and facilitates electronic transfer, further highlighting the potential to control CO/H2 ratios for efficient syngas production using the coexisting Au sites and Zn sites.

         <title>Discovery of Natural Potent HMG&#8208;CoA Reductase Degraders for Lowering Cholesterol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plant Schisandra macrocarpa was explored for the extraction of novel compounds from its fungal endophyte Penicillium sp. DG23. Of the indole diterpenoids and derivatives identified, biological evaluation highlighted schipenindolene A as a potent HMGCR degrader that further lowered cholesterol with statin (HMGCR inhibitor) by activating the endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;associated degradation pathway and inhibiting the compensatory effects of statin.







Abstract
Exploitation of key protected wild plant resources makes great sense, but their limited populations become the major barrier. A particular strategy for breaking this barrier was inspired by the exploration of a resource&#8208;saving fungal endophyte Penicillium sp. DG23, which inhabits the key protected wild plant Schisandra macrocarpa. Chemical studies on the cultures of this strain afforded eight novel indole diterpenoids, schipenindolenes A&#8722;H (1&#8211;8), belonging to six diverse skeleton types. Importantly, semisyntheses suggested some key nonenzymatic reactions constructing these molecules and provided targeted compounds, in particular schipenindolene A (Spid&#8197;A, 1) with low natural abundance. Remarkably, Spid&#8197;A was the most potent HMG&#8208;CoA reductase (HMGCR) degrader among the indole diterpenoid family. It degraded statin&#8208;induced accumulation of HMGCR protein, decreased cholesterol levels and acted synergistically with statin to further lower cholesterol. Mechanistically, transcriptomic and proteomic profiling suggested that Spid&#8197;A potentially activated the endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;associated degradation (ERAD) pathway to enhance the degradation of HMGCR, while simultaneously inhibiting the statin&#8208;activated expression of many key enzymes in the cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis pathways, thereby strengthening the efficacy of statins and potentially reducing the side effects of statins. Collectively, this study suggests the potential of Spid&#8197;A for treating cardiovascular disease.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthetic Ensembling Design of Hierarchically Ordered FAU&#8208;type Zeolite Frameworks for Vacuum Gas Oil Hydrocracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel post&#8208;synthetic ensembling design comprising methodical incision of conventional FAU&#8208;type zeolites into unit&#8208;cell level zeolitic fragments and their subsequent reorganization into hierarchically ordered zeolites exhibiting 2D&#8208;hexagonal/3D&#8208;cubic mesopore channels. This approach eludes the kinetic constraints of conventional crystallization to produce hierarchical zeolites having excellent catalytic properties in hydrocracking applications.







Abstract
Zeolites hold importance as catalysts and membranes across numerous industrial processes that produce most of the world's fuels and chemicals. In zeolite catalysis, the rate of molecular diffusion inside the micropore channels defines the catalyst's longevity and selectivity, thereby influencing the catalytic efficiency. Decreasing the diffusion pathlengths of zeolites to the nanoscopic level by fabricating well&#8208;organized hierarchically porous architecture can efficiently overcome their intrinsic mass&#8208;transfer limitations without losing hydrothermal stability. We report a rational post&#8208;synthetic design for synthesizing hierarchically ordered FAU&#8208;type zeolites exhibiting 2D&#8208;hexagonal (P6mm) and 3D&#8208;cubic (Ia
d) mesopore channels. The synthesis involves methodical incision of the parent zeolite into unit&#8208;cell level zeolitic fragments by in situ generated base and bulky surfactants. The micellar ensembles formed by these surfactant&#8208;zeolite interactions are subsequently reorganized into various ordered mesophases by tuning the micellar curvature with ion&#8208;specific interactions (Hofmeister effect). Unlike conventional crystallization, which offers poor control over mesophase formation due to kinetic constraints, crystalline mesostructures can be developed under dilute, mild alkaline conditions by controlled reassembly. The prepared zeolites with nanometric diffusion pathlengths have demonstrated excellent yields of naphtha and middle&#8208;distillates in vacuum gas oil hydrocracking with decreased coke deposition.

A joint theoretical and experimental study on 32 endohedral silafulleranes is presented. Template effects of Cl&#8722; are investigated for the [X@Si20Y20]&#8722; complexes that are classified as &#8220;confined Lewis pairs&#8221;.

Abstract
A joint theoretical and experimental study on 32 endohedral silafullerane derivatives [X@Si20Y20]&#8722; (X=F&#8208;I; Y=F&#8208;I, H, Me, Et) and 
&#8208;[Cl@Si20H12Y8]&#8722; (Y=F&#8208;I) is presented. First, we evaluated the structure&#8208;determining template effect of Cl&#8722; in a systematic series of concave silapolyquinane model systems. Second, we investigated the X&#8722;&#8594;Si20 interaction energy (
) as a function of X&#8722; and Y and found the largest 
 values for electron&#8208;withdrawing exohedral substituents&#8197;Y. Given that X&#8722; ions can be considered as Lewis bases and empty Si20Y20 clusters as Lewis acids, we classify our inseparable host&#8211;guest complexes [X@Si20Y20]&#8722; as &#8220;confined Lewis pairs&#8221;. Third, 35Cl NMR spectroscopy proved to be highly diagnostic for an experimental assessment of the Cl&#8722;&#8594;Si20 interaction as the paramagnetic shielding and, in turn, 
(35Cl) of the endohedral Cl&#8722; ion correlate inversely with 
. Finally, we disclose the synthesis of [PPN][Cl@Si20Y20] (Y=Me, Et, Br) and provide a thorough characterization of these new silafulleranes.

         <title>Werner Salt as Nickel and Ammonia Source for Photochemical Synthesis of Primary Aryl Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Werner salt [Ni(NH3)6]Cl2 can be used as both a nitrogen and a catalytic nickel source that allow for the efficient amination of aryl chlorides in the presence of a catalytic amount of bipyridine ligand under the irradiation of 390&#8211;395&#8197;nm light without the need of any additional catalysts, solving the problem of easy deactivation and difficult recovery of transition metal nickel catalysts.







Abstract
Cheap, stable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle Werner ammine salts have been known for more than a century; but they have been rarely used in organic synthesis. Herein, we report that the Werner hexammine complex [Ni(NH3)6]Cl2 can be used as both a nitrogen and a catalytic nickel source that allow for the efficient amination of aryl chlorides in the presence of a catalytic amount of bipyridine ligand under the irradiation of 390&#8211;395&#8197;nm light without the need of any additional catalysts. More than 80&#8197;aryl chlorides, including more than 20 drug molecules, were aminated, demonstrating the practicality and generality of this method in synthetic chemistry. A slow NH3 release mechanism is in operation, obviating the problem of catalyst poisoning. Still interestingly, we show that the Werner salt can be easily recovered and reused, solving the problem of difficult recovery of transition metal nickel catalysts. The protocol thus provides an efficient new strategy for the synthesis of primary aryl amines.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Trapezoids in Honeycomb Self&#8208;Assembly&#8212;Pathways between a Columnar Liquid Quasicrystal and its Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Approximants</title>

T&#8208;shaped polyphiles self&#8208;assemble into a liquid quasicrystal and a series of liquid&#8208;crystalline periodic approximants, all representing polygonal honeycombs formed by the stacking of p&#8208;terphenyls. Featuring giant octagonal motifs containing non&#8208;regular trapezoidal or pentagonal with regular triangular and square tiles, the phases assume a transition of motif orientation, triggered by the changing conformation and entropy of the alkyl end chains.







Abstract
Quasiperiodic patterns and crystals&#8212;having long range order without translational symmetry&#8212;have fascinated researchers since their discovery. In this study, we report on new p&#8208;terphenyl&#8208;based T&#8208;shaped facial polyphiles with two alkyl end chains and a glycerol&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded side group that self&#8208;assemble into an aperiodic columnar liquid quasicrystal with 12&#8208;fold symmetry and its periodic liquid&#8208;crystalline approximants with complex superstructures. All represent honeycombs formed by the self&#8208;assembly of the p&#8208;terphenyls, dividing space into prismatic cells with polygonal cross&#8208;sections. In the perspective of tiling patterns, the presence of unique trapezoidal tiles, consisting of three rigid sides formed by the p&#8208;terphenyls and one shorter, incommensurate, and adjustable side by the alkyl end chains, plays a crucial role for these phases. A delicate temperature&#8208;dependent balance between conformational, entropic and space&#8208;filling effects determines the role of the alkyl chains, either as network nodes or trapezoid walls, thus resulting in the order&#8208;disorder transitions associated with emergence of quasiperiodicity. In&#8208;depth analysis suggests a change from a quasiperiodic tiling involving trapezoids to a modified one with a contribution of trapezoid pair fusion. This work paves the way for understanding quasiperiodicity emergence and develops fundamental concepts for its generation by chemical design of non&#8208;spherical molecules, aggregates, and frameworks based on dynamic reticular chemistry.

         <title>Shearing Liquid&#8208;Crystalline MXene into Lamellar Membranes with Super&#8208;Aligned Nanochannels for Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene membrane with super&#8208;aligned nanochannels by applying shear forces to liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) MXene nanosheet dispersion. The as&#8208;prepared LC MXene membrane (LCMM) shows excellent in&#8208;plane stacking order and precise interlayer spacing of &#8776;6&#8197;&#197;, demonstrating ultrahigh selectivities toward Li+/Na+, Li+/K+, and Li+/Rb+ (&#8776;45, &#8776;49, and &#8776;59, respectively), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.







Abstract
Ion&#8208;selective membranes are crucial in various chemical and physiological processes. Numerous studies have demonstrated progress in separating monovalent/multivalent ions, but efficient monovalent/monovalent ion sieving remains a great challenge due to their same valence and similar radii. Here, this work reports a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXene membrane with super&#8208;aligned slit&#8208;shaped nanochannels with ultrahigh monovalent ion selectivity. The MXene membrane is prepared by applying shear forces to a liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) MXene dispersion, which is conducive to the highly&#8208;ordered stacking of the MXene nanosheets. The obtained LC MXene membrane (LCMM) exhibits ultrahigh selectivities toward Li+/Na+, Li+/K+, and Li+/Rb+ separation (&#8776;45, &#8776;49, and &#8776;59), combined with a fast Li+ transport with a permeation rate of &#8776;0.35&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. Theoretical calculations indicate that in MXene nanochannels, the hydrated Li+ with a tetrahedral shape has the smallest diameter among the monovalent ions, contributing to the highest mobility. Besides, the weakest interaction is found between hydrated Li+ and MXene channels which also contributes to the ultrafast permeation of Li+ through the super&#8208;aligned MXene channels. This work demonstrates the capability of MXene membranes in monovalent ion separation, which also provides a facile and general strategy to fabricate lamellar membranes in a large scale.

         <title>Dynamic Exchange in 3D Cell Culture Hydrogels Based on Crosslinking of Cyclic Thiosulfinates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic thiosulfinates can generate disulfide&#8208;crosslinked dynamic covalent hydrogels without additional stimuli to gain control over stress relaxation based on thiol content and mode of crosslinker application. Pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes can be 3D cultured in hydrogels containing macromonomers with this chemistry, displaying native behaviours, such as cell spreading and spontaneous beating.







Abstract
Dynamic polymer materials are highly valued substrates for 3D cell culture due to their viscoelasticity, a time&#8208;dependent mechanical property that can be tuned to resemble the energy dissipation of native tissues. Herein, we report the coupling of a cyclic thiosulfinate, mono&#8208;S&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;methyl asparagusic acid, to a 4&#8208;arm PEG&#8208;OH to prepare a disulfide&#8208;based dynamic covalent hydrogel with the addition of 4&#8208;arm PEG&#8208;thiol. Ring opening of the cyclic thiosulfinate by nucleophilic substitution results in the rapid formation of a network showing a viscoelastic fluid&#8208;like behaviour and relaxation rates modulated by thiol content through thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange, whereas its viscoelastic behaviour upon application as a small molecule linear crosslinker is solid&#8208;like. Further introduction of 4&#8208;arm PEG&#8208;vinylsulfone in the network yields a hydrogel with weeks&#8208;long cell culture stability, permitting 3D culture of cell types that lack robust proliferation, such as human pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC&#8208;CMs). These cells display native behaviours such as cell elongation and spontaneous beating as a function of the hydrogel's mechanical properties. We demonstrate that the mode of dynamic cyclic thiosulfinate crosslinker presentation within the network can result in different stress relaxation profiles, opening the door to model tissues with disparate mechanics in 3D cell culture.

         <title>Reversal of Regioselectivity in Asymmetric C&#8722;H Bond Annulation with Bromoalkynes under Cobalt Catalysis
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we demonstrate the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric desymmetrization of phosphinamides with haloalkynes with excellent enantioinduction and inverse regioselectivity. In a single step, the approach provides access to several P&#8208;chiral molecules. Based on control experiments and preliminary study, a plausible mechanism is provided.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H bond annulation strategy offers a versatile platform, allowing the construction of complex P&#8208;chiral molecules through atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical fashion. However, regioselective insertion of &#960;&#8208;coupling partner between M&#8722;C bond with high enantio&#8208;induction remain elusive. Using commercially available Co(II) salt and chiral&#8208;Salox ligands, we demonstrate an unusual protocol for the regio&#8208;reversal, enantioselective C&#8722;H bond annulation of phosphinamide with bromoalkyne through desymmetrization. The reaction proceeds through ligand&#8208;assisted enantiodetermining cyclocobaltation followed by regioselective insertion of bromoalkyne between Co&#8722;C, subsequent reductive elimination, and halogen exchange with carboxylate resulted in P&#8208;stereogenic compounds in excellent ee (up to &gt;99&#8201;%). The isolation of cobaltacycle involved in the catalytic cycle and the outcome of control experiments provide support for a plausible mechanism.

         <title>Zr&#8208;Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as nanoreactor for boosting the formation of hydrogen clathrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microwave&#8208;assisted PCN&#8208;222 nanocrystals has been successfully used as nanoreactors to promote the nucleation and growth of hydrogen clathrates. This research shows that hydrogen can be enclathrated at lower pressure than the bulk system, with fast kinetics and with a nearly complete water&#8208;to&#8208;hydrate conversion.







Abstract
We report the first experimental evidence for rapid formation of hydrogen clathrates under mild pressure and temperature conditions within the cavities of a zirconium&#8208;metalloporphyrin framework, specifically PCN&#8208;222. PCN&#8208;222 has been selected for its 1D mesoporous channels, high water&#8208;stability, and proper hydrophilic behavior. Firstly, we optimize a microwave (MW)&#8208;assisted method for the synthesis of nanosized PCN&#8208;222 particles with precise structure control (exceptional homogeneity in morphology and crystalline phase purity), taking advantage of MW in terms of rapid/homogeneous heating, time and energy savings, as well as potential scalability of the synthetic method. Second, we explore the relevance of the large mesoporous 1D open channels within the PCN&#8208;222 to promote the nucleation and growth of confined hydrogen clathrates. Experimental results show that PCN&#8208;222 drives the nucleation process at a lower pressure than the bulk system (1.35&#8197;kbar vs 2&#8197;kbar), with fast kinetics (minutes), using pure water, and with a nearly complete water&#8208;to&#8208;hydrate conversion. Unfortunately, PCN&#8208;222 cannot withstand these high pressures, which lead to a significant alteration of the mesoporous structure while the microporous network remains mainly unchanged.

         <title>A Systematic Investigation of Proteoforms with N&#8208;Terminal Glycine and Their Dynamics Reveals Its Impacts on Protein Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoenzymatic method based on sortase A catalyzed ligation was developed to characterize proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine in human cells and quantify their dynamics. Around 2000 proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine were identified, and most of them were previously unknown. Bioinformatic analyses reveal proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine with the fastest and slowest degradation rates have different functions and localizations.







Abstract
The N&#8208;termini of proteins can regulate their degradation, and the same protein with different N&#8208;termini may have distinct dynamics. Recently, it was found that N&#8208;terminal glycine can serve as a degron recognized by two E3 ligases, but N&#8208;terminal glycine was also reported to stabilize proteins. Here we developed a chemoenzymatic method for selective enrichment of proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine and integrated dual protease cleavage to further improve the enrichment specificity. Over 2000 unique peptides with protein N&#8208;terminal glycine were analyzed from &gt;1000 proteins, and most of them are previously unknown, indicating the effectiveness of the current method to capture low&#8208;abundance proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine. The degradation rates of proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine were quantified along with those of proteins from the whole proteome. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that proteoforms with N&#8208;terminal glycine with the fastest and slowest degradation rates have different functions and localizations. Membrane proteins with N&#8208;terminal glycine and proteins with N&#8208;terminal glycine from the N&#8208;terminal methionine excision degrade more rapidly. Furthermore, the secondary structures, adjacent amino acid residues, and protease specificities for N&#8208;terminal glycine are also vital for protein degradation. The results advance our understanding of the effects of N&#8208;terminal glycine on protein properties and functions.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;H Monoalkylation of Symmetric Polyols in the Presence of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transient carbonation of polyols under a CO2 atmosphere enables their C&#8722;H monoalkylation by photoredox catalysis. This reactivity results from an unprecedented C&#8722;H activation through intramolecular hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Achieving the selective modification of symmetric poly&#8208;hydroxylated compounds presents a significant challenge due to the presence of identical active sites. Herein, we address this challenge through the design of a ternary catalytic system that includes a photoredox catalyst, a hydrogen atom transfer promotor and a carbonation catalyst. This catalytic system enables the reversible carbonation of acyclic polyols under CO2 atmosphere, which modulates the reactivity of its distinct C&#8722;H bonds toward hydrogen atom transfers. An exquisite selectivity for the monoalkylation is achieved in a variety of unprotected light polyols, yielding valuable building blocks in short reaction times. Mechanistic and computational studies demonstrate that the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the transient carbonate and the free alcohol is pivotal for the kinetic and thermodynamic activation of a specific alcohol.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free Helical Covalent Inorganic Polymer: Preparation, Crystal Structure and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free helical covalent inorganic polymer (CityU&#8208;10) has been successfully prepared. Its crystal structure shows that the same&#8208;handed helical chains form a pseudo&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional layer via multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. Then, the left&#8208;handed layers and right&#8208;handed layers alternatively stack together to form a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular structure.







Abstract
Helical morphologies are widely observed in nature, however, it is very challenging to prepare artificial helical polymers. Especially, precisely understanding the structure information of artificial metal&#8208;free helical covalent inorganic polymers via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis is rarely explored. Here, we successfully prepare a novel metal&#8208;free helical covalent inorganic polymer ({[Te(C6H5)2] [PO3(OH)]}n, named CityU&#8208;10) by introducing angular anions (HOPO32&#8722;) into traditional tellurium&#8208;oxygen chains. The dynamic reversibility of the reaction is realized through the introduction of organic tellurium precursor and the slow hydrolysis of polyphosphoric acid. High&#8208;quality and large&#8208;size single crystals of CityU&#8208;10 have been successfully characterized via SCXRD, where the same&#8208;handed helical inorganic polymer chains form a pseudo&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional layer via multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The left&#8208;handed layers and right&#8208;handed layers alternatively stack together through weak hydrogen bonds to form a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular structure. The single crystals of CityU&#8208;10 are found to display promising optical properties with a large birefringence. Our results would offer new guidelines for designing and preparing new crystalline covalent polymers through tellurium&#8208;based chemistry.

         <title>Probing Degradation in Lithium Ion Batteries with On&#8208;Chip Electrochemistry Mass Spectrometry
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In batteries, the formation of gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide and ethylene accompanies degradation. Ultrasensitive on chip electrochemistry mass spectrometry reveals previously undetectable gas evolution in lithium ion batteries. The ensuing insight will enable battery scientists to predict degradation mechanisms and discover new strategies to stabilise device performance.







Abstract
The rapid uptake of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) for large scale electric vehicle and energy storage applications requires a deeper understanding of the degradation mechanisms. Capacity fade is due to the complex interplay between phase transitions, electrolyte decomposition and transition metal dissolution; many of these poorly understood parasitic reactions evolve gases as a side product. Here we present an on&#8208;chip electrochemistry mass spectrometry method that enables ultra&#8208;sensitive, fully quantified and time resolved detection of volatile species evolving from an operating LIB. The technique's electrochemical performance and mass transport is described by a finite element model and then experimentally used to demonstrate the variety of new insights into LIB performance. We show the versatility of the technique, including (a) observation of oxygen evolving from a LiNiMnCoO2 cathode and (b) the solid electrolyte interphase formation reaction on graphite in a variety of electrolytes, enabling the deconvolution of lithium inventory loss (c) the first direct evidence, by virtue of the improved time resolution of our technique, that carbon dioxide reduction to ethylene takes place in a lithium ion battery. The emerging insight will guide and validate battery lifetime models, as well as inform the design of longer lasting batteries.

The technique's electrochemical performance and mass transport is described by a finite element model and then experimentally used to demonstrate the variety of new insights into LIB performance. We show the versatility of the technique, including (a) observation of oxygen evolving from a LiNiMnCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode and (b) the solid electrolyte interphase formation reaction on graphite in a variety of electrolytes, enabling the deconvolution of lithium inventory loss (c) the first direct evidence, by virtue of the improved time resolution of our technique, that carbon dioxide reduction to ethylene takes place in a lithium ion battery. The emerging insight will guide and validate battery lifetime models, as well as inform the design of longer lasting batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Counterion Effect in Cobaltate&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The counterion makes a difference in alkene hydrogenations promoted by low&#8208;valence cobaltate salts. The best performing catalyst cleanly hydrogenated various alkenes (including tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted) under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies point toward a homotopic catalyst and show how counterion coordination to hydride intermediates modulates the barrier for the turnover&#8208;limiting migratory insertion.







Abstract
We show that countercations exert a remarkable influence on the ability of anionic cobaltate salts to catalyze challenging alkene hydrogenations. An evaluation of the catalytic properties of [Cat][Co(&#951;4&#8208;cod)2] (Cat=K (1), Na (2), Li (3), (Depnacnac)Mg (4), and N(nBu)4 (5); cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, Depnacnac={2,6&#8208;Et2C6H3NC(CH3)}2CH)]) demonstrated that the lithium salt 3 and magnesium salt 4 drastically outperform the other catalysts. Complex 4 was the most active catalyst, which readily promotes the hydrogenation of highly congested alkenes under mild conditions. A plausible catalytic mechanism is proposed based on density functional theory (DFT) investigations. Furthermore, combined molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and DFT studies were used to examine the turnover&#8208;limiting migratory insertion step. The results of these studies suggest an active co&#8208;catalytic role of the counterion in the hydrogenation reaction through the coordination to cobalt hydride intermediates.

         <title>Precise Methylation Yields Acceptor with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Network for High&#8208;Efficiency and Thermally Stable Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed four small&#8208;molecule acceptors (Qo1, Qo2, Qo3 and Qo4) by incorporating a methylation strategy. Solar cells fabricated with polymer donor PM6 and Qo2 realized the highest power conversion efficiency of 18.4&#8201;%, surpassing the efficiencies of devices based on Qo1 (15.8&#8201;%), Qo3 (16.7&#8201;%), and Qo4 (2.4&#8201;%).







Abstract
Utilizing intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions stands for an effective approach in advancing the efficiency and stability of small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) for polymer solar cells. Herein, we synthesized three SMAs (Qo1, Qo2, and Qo3) using indeno[1,2&#8208;b]quinoxalin&#8208;11&#8208;one (Qox) as the electron&#8208;deficient group, with the incorporation of a methylation strategy. Through crystallographic analysis, it is observed that two Qox&#8208;based methylated acceptors (Qo2 and Qo3) exhibit multiple hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted 3D network transport structures, in contrast to the 2D transport structure observed in gem&#8208;dichlorinated counterpart (Qo4). Notably, Qo2 exhibits multiple and stronger hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions compared with Qo3. Consequently, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Qo2 device realizes the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.4&#8201;%, surpassing the efficiencies of devices based on Qo1 (15.8&#8201;%), Qo3 (16.7&#8201;%), and Qo4 (2.4&#8201;%). This remarkable PCE in PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Qo2 device can be primarily ascribed to the enhanced donor&#8208;acceptor miscibility, more favorable medium structure, and more efficient charge transfer and collection behavior. Moreover, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Qo2 device demonstrates exceptional thermal stability, retaining 82.8&#8201;% of its initial PCE after undergoing annealing at 65&#8201;&#176;C for 250&#8197;hours. Our research showcases that precise methylation, particularly targeting the formation of intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions to tune crystal packing patterns, represents a promising strategy in the molecular design of efficient and stable SMAs.

         <title>Anion Sensing through Redox&#8208;Modulated Fluorescent Halogen Bonding and Hydrogen Bonding Hosts
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescence&#8208;spectroelectrochemical anion sensing is introduced as a powerful method to enable anion detection via simultaneous emission and voltammetry readouts. The combined advantages of both approaches facilitate anion sensing at very low sensor concentrations and in a competitive solvent system using a redox&#8208;active ferrocene&#8208;containing BODIPY anion receptor, wherein photoinduced electron transfer (PET) modulates fluorescence emission.







Abstract
Anion sensing via either optical or electrochemical readouts has separately received enormous attention, however, a judicious combination of the advantages of both modalities remains unexplored. Toward this goal, we herein disclose a series of novel, redox&#8208;active, fluorescent, halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) BODIPY&#8208;based anion sensors, wherein the introduction of a ferrocene motif induces remarkable changes in the fluorescence response. Extensive fluorescence anion titration, lifetime and electrochemical studies reveal anion binding&#8208;induced emission modulation through intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PET), the magnitude of which is dependent on the nature of both the XB/HB donor and anion. Impressively, the XB sensor outperformed its HB congener in terms of anion binding strength and fluorescence switching magnitude, displaying significant fluorescence turn&#8208;OFF upon anion binding. In contrast, redox&#8208;inactive control receptors display a turn&#8208;ON response, highlighting the pronounced impact of the introduction of the redox&#8208;active ferrocene on the optical sensing performance. Additionally, the redox&#8208;active ferrocene motif also serves as an electrochemical reporter group, enabling voltammetric anion sensing in competitive solvents. The combined advantages of both sensing modalities were further exploited in a novel, proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, fluorescence spectroelectrochemical anion sensing approach, enabling simultaneous and sensitive read out of optical and electrochemical responses in multiple oxidation states and at very low receptor concentration.

         <title>Ammonolysis of Glyoxal at the Air&#8208;Water Nanodroplet Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ammonolysis of glyoxal with dimethylamine occurs at the air&#8208;water nanodroplet interface with the stepwise pathways facilitated by the water dimers, which is highly feasible and plays a pivotal role in removing glyoxal.







Abstract
The reactions of glyoxal (CHO)2) with amines in cloud processes contribute to the formation of brown carbon and oligomer particles in the atmosphere. However, their molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Herein, we investigate the ammonolysis mechanisms of glyoxal with amines at the air&#8208;water nanodroplet interface. We identified three and two distinct pathways for the ammonolysis of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine by using metadynamics simulations at the air&#8208;water nanodroplet interface, respectively. Notably, the stepwise pathways mediated by the water dimer for the reactions of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine display the lowest free energy barriers of 3.6 and 4.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. These results showed that the air&#8208;water nanodroplet ammonolysis reactions of glyoxal with dimethylamine and methylamine were more feasible and occurred at faster rates than the corresponding gas phase ammonolysis, the OH+(CHO)2 reaction, and the aqueous phase reaction of glyoxal, leading to the dominant removal of glyoxal. Our results provide new and important insight into the reactions between carbonyl compounds and amines, which are crucial in forming nitrogen&#8208;containing aerosol particles.

         <title>Assembly of Luminescent Chiral Gold(I)&#8208;Sulfido Clusters via Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full potential of the chiral self&#8208;sorting in gold(I)&#8208;sulfido cluster system has been explored for the first time. Different combinations of axial chiral ligands give rise to distinct chiral gold(I)&#8208;sulfido clusters through different types of chiral self&#8208;assembly and self&#8208;sorting processes, evolving from homochiral assembly to heterochiral self&#8208;sorting and the unprecedented heterochiral and heteroleptic self&#8208;sorting.







Abstract
Due to the ubiquity of chirality in nature, chiral self&#8208;assembly involving self&#8208;sorting behaviors has remained as one of the most important research topics of interests. Herein, starting from a racemic mixture of SEG&#8208;based (SEG=SEGPHOS) chlorogold(I) precursors, a unique chiral butterfly&#8208;shape hexadecanuclear gold(I) cluster (Au16) with different ratios of RSEG and SSEG ligands is obtained via homoleptic and heterochiral self&#8208;sorting. More interestingly, by employing different chlorogold(I) precursors of opposite chirality (such as RSEG&#8208;Au2 and SBIN&#8208;Au2 (BIN=BINAP)), an unprecedented heteroleptic and heterochiral self&#8208;sorting strategy has been developed to give a series of heteroleptic chiral decanuclear gold(I) clusters (Au10) with propellor&#8208;shape structures. Heterochiral and heteroleptic self&#8208;sorting have also been observed between enantiomers of homoleptic chiral Au10 clusters to result in the heteroleptic chiral Au10 clusters via cluster&#8208;to&#8208;cluster transformation. Incorporation of heteroleptic ligands is found to decrease the symmetry from S4 of homoleptic meso Au10 to C2 of heteroleptic chiral Au10 clusters. The chirality has been transferred from the axial chiral ligands and stored in the heteroleptic gold(I) clusters.

         <title>Dynamic Oscillation and Motion of Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Water Emulsion Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intersection of surfactant partitioning, spontaneous emulsification, and substrate wettability generates a unique type of motion&#8212;droplet oscillation&#8212;rarely reported in the literature for oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsion systems. The effect of varying the concentration of the surfactant, substrate properties, and the chemical nature of the oil and surfactant on the oscillating droplets was studied.







Abstract
The interplay of interfacial tensions on droplets results in a range of self&#8208;powered motions that mimic those of living systems and serve as a tunable model to understand their complex non&#8208;equilibrium behavior. Spontaneous shape deformations and oscillations are crucial features observed in nature but difficult to incorporate in synthetic artificial systems. Here, we report sessile oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions that exhibit rapid oscillating behavior. The oscillations depend on the nature and concentration of the surfactant, the chemical composition of the oil, and the wettability of the solid substrate. The rapid changes in the contact angle per oscillation are observed using side&#8208;view optical microscopy. We propose that the changes in the interfacial tension of the oil droplets is due to the partitioning of the surfactant into the oil phase and the movement of self&#8208;emulsified oil out of the parent droplets giving rise to the rhythmic variation in droplet contact&#8208;line. The ability to control and understand droplet oscillation can help model similar oscillations in out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium systems in nature and reproduce biomimetic behavior in artificial systems for various applications, such as microfluidic lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and adaptive materials.

         <title>Diluting the Resistance of Built&#8208;in Electric Fields in Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;enriched Ru/NiMoO4&#8208;x for Enhanced Hydrogen Spillover in Alkaline Seawater Splitting</title>

The oxygen vacancy dilute the resistance of built&#8208;in electric field of Ru/NiMoO4&#8208;x to accelerate the hydrogen transfer step in hydrogen spillover, improving hydrogen evolution reaction performance in alkaline seawater.







Abstract
Recently, hydrogen spillover based binary (HSBB) catalysts have received widespread attention due to the sufficiently utilized reaction sites. However, the specific regulation mechanism of spillover intensity is still unclear. Herein, we have fabricated oxygen vacancies enriched Ru/NiMoO4&#8208;x to investigate the internal relationship between electron supply and mechanism of hydrogen spillover enhancement. The DFT calculations cooperate with in situ Raman spectrum to uncover that the H* spillover from NiMoO4&#8208;x to Ru. Meanwhile, oxygen vacancies weakened the electron supply from Ru to NiMoO4&#8208;x, which contributes to dilute the resistance of built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) for hydrogen spillover. In addition, the higher ion concentration in electrolyte will promote the H* adsorption step obviously, which is demonstrated by in situ EIS tests. As a result, the Ru/NiMoO4&#8208;x exhibits a low overpotential of 206&#8197;mV at 3.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 28.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and an excellent durability of 550&#8197;h at the current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for HER in 1.0&#8197;M KOH seawater.

         <title>Triggering Dual Two&#8208;electron Pathway for H2O2 Generation by Multiple [Bi&#8722;O]n Interlayers in Ultrathin Bi12O17Cl2 towards Efficient Piezo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi12O17Cl2 piezo&#8208;catalyst was prepared with peculiar [Bi3O4.25] layers. The existence of [Bi3O4.25] not only serves as active sites but also satisfies energy band structure for 2e&#8722; ORR and 2e&#8722; WOR, realizing the dual pathway for adequate H2O2 synthesis. Expectedly, the constructed Bi12O17Cl2&#8208;PESF emerges superior degradation activity for pollutants attributed to sufficient use of in situ produced H2O2 to abundant &#8901;OH.







Abstract
Piezo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton system (PESF) has been emerging as a promising water treatment technology but suffering from unsatisfied H2O2 production efficiency. Herein, we rationally design a Bi12O17Cl2 piezo&#8208;catalyst with multiple [Bi&#8722;O]n interlayers towards highly efficient H2O2 production. The introduction of [Bi3O4.25] layers initiates dual two&#8208;electron pathway for H2O2 generation by altering the interlayer properties. It is found that the additional [Bi3O4.25] layers not only enhance the polarization electric field but also serve as active sites for triggering dual pathways of two&#8208;electron O2 reduction and H2O oxidation reaction for H2O2 production. Therefore, the Bi12O17Cl2 exhibits an ultrahigh rate of H2O2 generation (7.76&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1) in pure water. Based on the adequate H2O2 yield, a PESF was constructed for acetaminophen (ACE) degradation with an apparent rate constant of 0.023&#8197;min&#8722;1. This work not only presents a potential strategy of tuning the activity of bismuth based piezo&#8208;catalysts but also provides a good example on the construction of highly efficient PESF for environmental remediation by using natural mechanical energy.

Therefore, the Bi&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits an ultrahigh rate of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation (7.76&#8197;mM&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in pure water. Based on the adequate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield, a PESF was constructed for acetaminophen (ACE) degradation with an apparent rate constant of 0.023&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work not only presents a potential strategy of tuning the activity of bismuth based piezo-catalysts but also provides a good example on the construction of highly efficient PESF for environmental remediation by using natural mechanical energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereoselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Olefination of Imines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new look at catalytic Wittig&#8208;type olefinations. We explored the use of transition metal catalysis to form ylide equivalents from readily available starting materials leading to the development of a highly E&#8208;selective copper&#8208;catalyzed olefination of imines with alkenyl boronate esters as coupling partners.







Abstract
Alkenes are an important class of organic molecules found among synthetic intermediates and bioactive compounds. They are commonly synthesized through stoichiometric Wittig&#8208;type olefination of carbonyls and imines, using ylides or their equivalents. Despite the importance of Wittig&#8208;type olefination reactions, their catalytic variants remain underdeveloped. We explored the use of transition metal catalysis to form ylide equivalents from readily available starting materials. Our investigation led to a new copper&#8208;catalyzed olefination of imines with alkenyl boronate esters as coupling partners. We identified a heterobimetallic complex, obtained by hydrocupration of the alkenyl boronate esters, as the key catalytic intermediate that serves as an ylide equivalent. The high E&#8208;selectivity observed in the reaction is due to the stereoselective addition of this intermediate to an imine, followed by stereospecific anti&#8208;elimination.

         <title>Direct Analysis of Complex Reaction Mixtures: Formose Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Online monitoring of formose reaction by ion&#8208;mobility&#8208;separation mass&#8208;spectrometry reveals the growth of the size and complexity of sugar molecules. Chemometrics analysis identified the key reaction mixture components and their contribution to the dynamic reaction changes. The results allowed the reconstruction of the reaction networks and analysis of the kinetics of early steps of formose reaction.







Abstract
Complex reaction mixtures, like those postulated on early Earth, present an analytical challenge because of the number of components, their similarity, and vastly different concentrations. Interpreting the reaction networks is typically based on simplified or partial data, limiting our insight. We present a new approach based on online monitoring of reaction mixtures formed by the formose reaction by ion&#8208;mobility&#8208;separation mass&#8208;spectrometry. Monitoring the reaction mixtures led to large data sets that we analyzed by non&#8208;negative matrix factorization, thereby identifying ion&#8208;signal groups capturing the time evolution of the network. The groups comprised &#8776;300 major ion signals corresponding to sugar&#8208;calcium complexes formed during the formose reaction. Multivariate analysis of the kinetic profiles of these complexes provided an overview of the interconnected kinetic processes in the solution, highlighting different pathways for sugar growth and the effects of different initiators on the initial kinetics. Reconstructing the network's topology further, we revealed so far unnoticed fast retro&#8208;aldol reaction of ketoses, which significantly affects the initial reaction dynamics. We also detected the onset of sugar&#8208;backbone branching for C6&#8197;sugars and cyclization reactions starting for C5&#8197;sugars. This top&#8208;down analytical approach opens a new way to analyze complex dynamic mixtures online with unprecedented coverage and time resolution.

         <title>Asymmetric Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation by a Versatile Chiral&#8208;Amide&#8208;Directing Strategy</title>

         <dc:description>
A versatile chiral amide directing group has been studied in the context of the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. Six transformations have been achieved, affording a series of valuable chiral products. With this tool, concise syntheses of many natural products and biologically active compounds (e.g., Montroumarin, Cyclosporone E, Cyclosporone Q, Concentricolide, Chuangxinol, and Eleutherol) were accomplished.







Abstract
A versatile and readily available chiral amide directing group has been developed for the ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation. Asymmetric C&#8722;H activation of the related chiral benzamides with various olefins, aldehydes and propargylic alcohols has been accomplished with high stereoselectivities, affording a series of chiral products including 3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarins (up to 96&#8201;%&#8201;ee), isocoumarins (up to 92&#8201;%&#8201;ee), phthalides (up to 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee), chiral bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr), 4&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroisocoumarins (up to 97&#8201;%&#8201;ee) and allenes (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;dr). Importantly, our methodologies enabled concise syntheses of many biologically active compounds and natural products (e.g., Montroumarin, Cyclosporone E, Cyclosporone Q, Concentricolide, Chuangxinol, and Eleutherol).

         <title>Manipulated Fluoro&#8208;Ether Derived Nucleophilic Decomposition Products for Mitigating Polarization&#8208;Induced Capacity Loss in Li&#8208;Rich Layered Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superior crosslinked products derived from HFE decomposition via nucleophilic O species attack serve as valuable sutures. They prevent fragmented substances from escaping CEI construction, providing an excellent foundation for the homogeneous deposition of LiF related species. Consequently, an effective CEI with both rigidity and flexibility is established, which reduces cell polarization, achieves long&#8208;lasting electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering is a fascinating choice to improve the performance of Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes (LRLO) for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, many existing electrolyte designs and adjustment principles tend to overlook the unique challenges posed by LRLO, particularly the nucleophilic attack. Here, we introduce an electrolyte modification by locally replacing carbonate solvents in traditional electrolytes with a fluoro&#8208;ether. By benefit of the decomposition of fluoro&#8208;ether under nucleophilic O&#8208;related attacks, which delivers an excellent passivation layer with LiF and polymers, possessing rigidity and flexibility on the LRLO surface. More importantly, the fluoro&#8208;ether acts as &#8220;sutures&#8221;, ensuring the integrity and stability of both interfacial and bulk structures, which contributed to suppressing severe polarization and enhancing the cycling capacity retention from 39&#8201;% to 78&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles for the 4.8&#8197;V&#8208;class LRLO. This key electrolyte strategy with comprehensive analysis, provides new insights into addressing nucleophilic challenge for high&#8208;energy anionic redox related cathode systems.

         <title>Catechol&#8208;Isolated Atomically Dispersed Nanocatalysts for Self&#8208;Motivated Cocatalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catechol&#8208;isolated mesoporous single iron atomic nanocatalysts (mSAFe NCs) with ligand&#8208;field&#8208;effect&#8208;promoted cocatalytic Fenton catalysis have been constructed. The catechols from dopamine serve as both an iron coordination site for atomic isolation and a reductive ligand to generate a field&#8208;effect&#8208;based cocatalytic system that instantly reduces FeIII species to FeII species within the mSAFe NCs, thereby promoting in vivo Fenton catalytic effects against tumors.







Abstract
Nanocatalytic tumor therapy based on Fenton nanocatalysts has attracted considerable attention because of its therapeutic specificity, enhanced outcomes, and high biocompatibility. Nevertheless, the rate&#8208;determining step in Fenton chemistry, which involves the transition of a high&#8208;valence metallic center (FeIII) to a Fenton&#8208;active low&#8208;valence metallic center (FeII), has hindered advances in nanocatalyst&#8208;based therapeutics. In this study, we constructed mesoporous single iron atomic nanocatalysts (mSAFe NCs) by employing catechols from dopamine to coordinate and isolate single iron atoms. The catechols also serve as reductive ligands, generating a field&#8208;effect&#8208;based cocatalytic system that instantly reduces FeIII species to FeII species within the mSAFe NCs. This self&#8208;motivated cocatalytic strategy enabled by mSAFe NCs accelerates the kinetics of the Fenton catalytic reaction, resulting in remarkable performance for nanocatalytic tumor therapy both in vitro and in vivo.

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly for Control over Helical Nanostructures and Topochemical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pathway&#8208;dependent supramolecular assemblies from a rationally designed glutamide derivative were found, which formed distinct chiral nanotwist and nanotube depending on the cooling rate. Pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly showed also the ability to control over the guest molecules with emergent blue or green circularly polarized luminescence and topochemical polymerization.







Abstract
Pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly, in which a single building block forms two or more types of self&#8208;assembled nanostructures, is an important topic due to its mimic to the complexity in biology and manipulation of diverse supramolecular materials. Here, we report a pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly using chiral glutamide derivatives (L or D&#8208;PAG), which form chiral nanotwist and nanotube through a cooperative slow cooling and an isodesmic fast cooling process, respectively. Furthermore, pathway&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly can be harnessed to control over the supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of PAG with a luminophore &#946;&#8208;DCS or a photopolymerizable PCDA. Fast cooling leads to the co&#8208;assembled PAG/&#946;&#8208;DCS nanotube exhibiting green circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), while slow cooling to nanofiber with blue CPL. Additionally, fast cooling process promotes the photopolymerization of PCDA into a red chiral polymer, whereas slow cooling inhibits the polymerization. This work not only demonstrates the pathway&#8208;dependent control over structural characteristics but also highlights the diverse functions emerged from the different assemblies.

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction of Pentlandite by High&#8208;Spin State Iron for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;spin state of Fe in Fe5Ni4S8 promotes the accumulation of surface OH&#8722; and accelerates the rate of electron transfer, thereby establishing a correlation with the kinetic rate of the reconstructive reaction.







Abstract
Triggering rapid reconstruction reactions holds the potential to approach the theoretical limits of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and spin state manipulation has shown great promise in this regard. In this study, the transition of Fe spin states from low to high was successfully achieved by adjusting the surface electronic structure of pentlandite. In situ characterization and kinetic simulations confirmed that the high&#8208;spin state of Fe promoted the accumulation of OH&#8722; on the surface and accelerated electron transfer, thereby enhancing the kinetics of the reconstruction reaction. Furthermore, theoretical calculations revealed that the lower d&#8208;band center of high&#8208;spin Fe optimized the adsorption of active intermediates, thereby enhancing the reconstruction kinetics. Remarkably, pentlandites with high&#8208;spin Fe exhibited ultra&#8208;low overpotential (245&#8197;mV&#8201;@&#8201;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and excellent stability. These findings provided new insights for the design and fabrication of highly active OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Mediated [3+1] Fragmentation of White Phosphorus: Access to Acylcyanophosphanides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
White phosphorus (P4) can be selectively activated and functionalized via low&#8208;valent cobalt complexes. Subsequent treatment of the acylated P4 ligands with cyanide induces a rare [3+1] fragmentation and yields cyanophosphanides (P1) and triphosphido cobaltate (P3). Additional experiments with neutral cyanide or isocyanide provide insight into a plausible fragmentation mechanism and allow the isolation of potential intermediates.







Abstract
Despite the accessibility of numerous transition metal polyphosphido complexes through transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mediated activation of white phosphorus, the targeted functionalization of Pn ligands to obtain functional monophosphorus species remains challenging. In this study, we introduce a new [3+1] fragmentation procedure for cyclo&#8208;P4 ligands, leading to the discovery of acylcyanophosphanides and &#8208;phosphines. Treatment of the complex [K(18c&#8208;6)][(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;4&#8208;P4)] ([K(18c&#8208;6)]3, 18c&#8208;6=[18]crown&#8208;6, Ar*=2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;isopropylphenyl, BIAN=1,2&#8208;bis(arylimino)acenaphthene diimine) with acyl chlorides results in the formation of acylated tetraphosphido complexes [(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;4&#8208;P4C(O)R)] (R=tBu, Cy, 1&#8208;Ad, Ph; 4&#8201;a&#8211;d). Subsequent reactions of 4&#8201;a&#8211;d with cyanide salts yield acylated cyanophosphanides [RC(O)PCN]&#8722; (9&#8201;a&#8211;d&#8722;) and the cyclo&#8208;P3 cobaltate anion [(Ar*BIAN)Co(&#951;3&#8208;P3)(CN)]&#8722; (8&#8722;). Further reactions of 4&#8201;a&#8211;d with trimethylsilyl cyanide (Me3SiCN) and isocyanides provide insight into a plausible mechanism of this [3+1] fragmentation reaction, as these reagents partially displace the P4C(O)R ligand from the cobalt center. Several potential intermediates of the [3+1] fragmentation were characterized. Additionally, the introduction of a second acyl substituent was achieved by treating [K(18c&#8208;6)]9b with CyC(O)Cl, resulting in the first bis(acyl)monocyanophosphine (CyC(O))2PCN (10).

         <title>Hydrated [3+2] Cyclotelomerization of Butafulvenes to Create Multiple Contiguous Fully Substituted Carbon Centers</title>

A hydrated [3+2] cyclotelomerization of butafulvenes has been developed to create spiro fused tricyclic rings with a contiguous fully substituted carbon motif.







Abstract
The construction of multiple continuous fully substituted carbon centers, which serve as unique structural motif in natural products, is a challenging topic in organic synthesis. Herein, we report a hydrated [3+2] cyclotelomerization of butafulvenes to create contiguous fully substituted carbon backbone. In the presence of scandium triflate, all&#8208;carbon skeleton with spiro fused tricyclic ring can be constructed in high diastereoselectivity by utilizing butafulvene as the synthon. Mechanistic studies suggest that this atom&#8208;economic reaction probably proceeds through a synergistic process containing butafulvenes dimerization and nucleophilic attack by water. In addition, the tricyclic product can undergo a series of synthetic derivatizations, which highlights the potential applications of this strategy. The recyclability of Sc(OTf)3 has also been demonstrated to show its robust performance in this hydrated cyclotelomerization.

         <title>Weak Solvation Effect Induced Optimal Interfacial Chemistry Enables Highly Durable Zn Anodes for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolyte with weak solvation effect is rationally developed for aqueous Zn ion batteries (AZIBs). Benefiting from the reduced solvated H2O, boosted desolvation kinetics and in situ formed solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, Zn anode cycled in this electrolyte can deliver enhanced cycling stability.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as one of the most reliable energy storage technologies for scale&#8208;up applications, but still suffer from the instability of Zn anode, which is mainly caused by the undesirable dendrite growth and side reactions. To tackle these issues, we formulate a new aqueous electrolyte with weak solvation effect by introducing low&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant acetone to achieve H2O&#8208;poor solvation structure of Zn2+. Experimental and theoretical calculation studies concurrently reveal that such solvation structure can: i)&#8197;relieve the solvated H2O related side reactions, ii)&#8197;suppress the dendrite growth by boosting the desolvation kinetics of Zn2+ and iii)&#8197;in situ form solid electrolyte interface (SEI) to synergistically inhibit the side reaction and dendrite growth. The synergy of these three factors prolongs the cycling life of Cu/Zn asymmetric cell from 30&#8197;h to more than 800&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and can work at more harsh condition of 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2/5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More encouragingly, Zn/V2O5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;nH2O full cell also shows enhanced cycling stability of 95.9&#8201;% capacity retention after 1000&#8197;cycles, much better than that with baseline electrolyte (failing at &#8776;700th&#8197;cycle).

         <title>Modulation of Singlet&#8208;Triplet Gap in Atomically Precise Silver Cluster&#8208;Assembled Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap was modulated by controlling the inter&#8208;cluster interaction defined by the supramolecular arrangements of Ag12 nanoclusters.







Abstract
Silver cluster&#8208;based solids have garnered considerable attention owing to their tunable luminescence behavior. While surface modification has enabled the construction of stable silver clusters, controlling interactions among clusters at the molecular level has been challenging due to their tendency to aggregate. Judicious choice of stabilizing ligands becomes pivotal in crafting a desired assembly. However, detailed photophysical behavior as a function of their cluster packing remained unexplored. Here, we modulate the packing pattern of Ag12 clusters by varying the nitrogen&#8208;based ligand. CAM&#8208;1 formed through coordination of the tritopic linker molecule and NC&#8208;1 with monodentate pyridine ligand; established via non&#8208;covalent interactions. Both the assemblies show ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMMCT) based cluster&#8208;centered emission band(s). Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectra exhibit blue shifts at higher temperatures, which is attributed to the extent of the thermal reverse population of the S1 state from the closely spaced T1 state. The difference in the energy gap (&#916;EST) dictated by their assemblies played a pivotal role in the way that Ag12 cluster assembly in CAM&#8208;1 manifests a wider &#916;EST and thus requires higher temperatures for reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) than assembly of NC&#8208;1. Such assembly&#8208;defined photoluminescence properties underscore the potential toolkit to design new cluster&#8208; assemblies with tailored optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Two&#8208;Electron Redox Reactivity of Thorium Supported by Redox&#8208;Active Tripodal Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two electrons can be stored in the arene anchor of robust tripodal siloxide frameworks by chemical reduction of their Th(IV) complexes. The two electrons become available at the metal center for the controlled two&#8208;electron reduction of a broad range of substrates (N2O, COT, CHT, Ph2N2, Ph3PS and O2) while the ligand framework is retained in its original form.







Abstract
The high stability of the + IVoxidation state limits thorium redox reactivity. Here we report the synthesis and the redox reactivity of two Th(IV) complexes supported by the arene&#8208;tethered tris(siloxide) tripodal ligands [(KOSiR2Ar)3&#8208;arene)]. The two&#8208;electron reduction of these Th(IV) complexes generates the doubly reduced [KTh((OSi(OtBu)2Ar)3&#8208;arene)(THF)2] (2OtBu) and [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)][Th((OSiPh2Ar)3&#8208;arene)(THF)2](2Ph&#8208;crypt) where the formal oxidation state of Th is +II. Structural and computational studies indicate that the reduction occurred at the arene anchor of the ligand. The robust tripodal frameworks store in the arene anchor two electrons that become available at the metal center for the two&#8208;electron reduction of a broad range of substrates (N2O, COT, CHT, Ph2N2, Ph3PS and O2) while retaining the ligand framework. This work shows that arene&#8208;tethered tris(siloxide) tripodal ligands allow implementation of two&#8208;electron redox chemistry at the thorium center while retaining the ligand framework unchanged.

         <title>Selenium&#8208;Based Catalytic Scavengers for Concurrent Scavenging of H2S and Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2S overproduction is linked to various disease states while chemical tools that can precisely downregulate H2S are still lacking. In this work, selenoxide&#8208;containing compounds were found to be potent H2S scavengers with promising antidotal effects for H2S poisoning. Several diselenides were further developed as catalytic scavengers for both H2S and H2O2.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter that plays important roles in redox signaling. H2S overproduction has been linked to a variety of disease states and therefore, H2S&#8208;depleting agents, such as scavengers, are needed to understand the significance of H2S&#8208;based therapy. It is known that elevated H2S can induce oxidative stress with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, such as in H2S acute intoxication. We explored the possibility of developing catalytic scavengers to simultaneously remove H2S and ROS. Herein, we studied a series of selenium&#8208;based molecules as catalytic H2S/H2O2 scavengers. Inspired by the high reactivity of selenoxide compounds towards H2S, 14 diselenide/monoselenide compounds were tested. Several promising candidates such as S6 were identified. Their activities in buffers, as well as in plasma&#8208; and cell lysate&#8208;containing solutions were evaluated. We also studied the reaction mechanism of this scavenging process. Finally, the combination of the diselenide catalyst and photosensitizers was used to achieve light&#8208;induced H2S removal. These Se&#8208;based scavengers can be useful tools for understanding H2S/ROS regulations.

&lt;p&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S overproduction is linked to various disease states while chemical tools that can precisely downregulate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S are still lacking. In this work, selenoxide-containing compounds were found to be potent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S scavengers with promising antidotal effects for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S poisoning. Several diselenides were further developed as catalytic scavengers for both H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter that plays important roles in redox signaling. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S overproduction has been linked to a variety of disease states and therefore, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-depleting agents, such as scavengers, are needed to understand the significance of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-based therapy. It is known that elevated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S can induce oxidative stress with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, such as in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S acute intoxication. We explored the possibility of developing catalytic scavengers to simultaneously remove H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and ROS. Herein, we studied a series of selenium-based molecules as catalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; scavengers. Inspired by the high reactivity of selenoxide compounds towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, 14 diselenide/monoselenide compounds were tested. Several promising candidates such as &lt;b&gt;S6&lt;/b&gt; were identified. Their activities in buffers, as well as in plasma- and cell lysate-containing solutions were evaluated. We also studied the reaction mechanism of this scavenging process. Finally, the combination of the diselenide catalyst and photosensitizers was used to achieve light-induced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S removal. These Se-based scavengers can be useful tools for understanding H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/ROS regulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystalline Dual&#8208;Porous Covalent Triazine Frameworks as a New Platform for Efficient Electrocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Crystalline dual&#8208;porous pyridine&#8208;based CTF with in situ generated Fe&#8208;N3 single&#8208;atom active sites has been synthesized for the first time. Benefiting from the unique structure of Fe&#8208;N3 and the dynamic reversible microenvironment of metal active centers, few&#8208;layer Fe&#8208;CTF nanosheets exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic and Zn&#8208;air battery performance.







Abstract
Crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) have gained considerable interest in energy and catalysis owing to their well&#8208;defined nitrogen&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;conjugated porosity and superior physicochemical properties, however, suffer from very limited molecular structures. Herein we report a novel solvent&#8208;free FeCl3&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of 2, 6&#8208;pyridinedicarbonitrile (DCP) to achieve the first synthesis of crystalline, dual&#8208;porous, pyridine&#8208;based CTF (Fe&#8208;CTF). The FeCl3 could not only act as a highly active Lewis acid catalyst for promoting the two&#8208;dimensional ordered polymerization of DCP monomers, but also in situ coordinate with the tridentate chelators generated between pyridine and triazine groups to yield unique Fe&#8208;N3 single&#8208;atom active sites in Fe&#8208;CTF. Abundant few&#8208;layer crystalline nanosheets (Fe&#8208;CTF NSs) could be prepared through simple ball&#8208;milling exfoliation of the bulk layered Fe&#8208;CTF and exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a half&#8208;wave potential and onset potential up to 0.902 and 1.02&#8197;V respectively, and extraordinary Zn&#8208;air battery performance with an ultrahigh specific capacity and power density of 811&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 230&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 respectively. By combining operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, we revealed a dynamic and reversible evolution of Fe&#8208;N3 to Fe&#8208;N2 during the electrocatalytic process, which could further accelerate the electrocatalytic reaction.

         <title>Using Redox&#8208;Switchable Polymerization Catalysis to Synthesize a Chemically Recyclable Thermoplastic Elastomer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triblock copolymers containing poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) hard blocks and poly(tetrahydrofuran&#8208;co&#8208;cyclohexene oxide) soft blocks were synthesized using redox&#8208;switchable catalysis. The polymers demonstrated improved flexibility and mechanical properties similar to thermoplastic elastomers and underwent depolymerization under reactive distillation using Lewis acid catalysts, showing the material can be chemically recycled for a circular plastics economy.







Abstract
In an effort to synthesize chemically recyclable thermoplastic elastomers, a redox&#8208;switchable catalytic system was developed to synthesize triblock copolymers containing stiff poly(lactic acid) (PLA) end blocks and a flexible poly(tetrahydrofuran&#8208;co&#8208;cyclohexene oxide) (poly(THF&#8208;co&#8208;CHO) copolymer as the mid&#8208;block. The orthogonal reactivity induced by changing the oxidation state of the iron&#8208;based catalyst enabled the synthesis of the triblock copolymers in a single reaction flask from a mixture of monomers. The triblock copolymers demonstrated improved flexibility compared to poly(l&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA) and thermomechanical properties that resemble thermoplastic elastomers, including a rubbery plateau in the range of &#8722;60 to 40&#8201;&#176;C. The triblock copolymers containing a higher percentage of THF versus CHO were more flexible, and a blend of triblock copolymers containing PLLA and poly(d&#8208;lactic acid) (PDLA) end&#8208;blocks resulted in a stereocomplex that further increased polymer flexibility. Besides the low cost of lactide and THF, the sustainability of this new class of triblock copolymers was also supported by their depolymerization, which was achieved by exposing the copolymers sequentially to FeCl3 and ZnCl2/PEG under reactive distillation conditions.

         <title>Binary Atomic Sites Enable a Confined Bidirectional Tandem Electrocatalytic Sulfur Conversion for Low&#8208;Temperature All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Na&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bifunctional hollow sulfur matrix consisting binary atomically dispersed MnN4 and CoN4 hotspots was fabricated. And the catalytic matrix facilitated confined tandem electrocatalysis effects render the successive reversible conversion of both long&#8208; and short&#8208;chain polysulfide intermediators and mitigate the cathodic passivation within the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic membrane architectured solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S cells.







Abstract
The broader implementation of current all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S batteries is still plagued by high operation temperature and inefficient sulfur utilization. And the uncontrollable sulfur speciation pathway along with the sluggish polysulfide redox kinetics further compromise the theoretical potentials of Na&#8722;S chemistry. Herein, we report a confined bidirectional tandem electrocatalysis effect to tune polysulfide electrochemistry in a novel low&#8208;temperature (80&#8201;&#176;C) all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S battery that utilizes Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic membrane as a platform. The bifunctional hollow sulfur matrix consisting binary atomically dispersed MnN4 and CoN4 hotspots was fabricated using a sacrificial template process. Upon discharge, CoN4 sites activate sulfur species and catalyze long&#8208;chain to short&#8208;chain polysulfides reduction, while MnN4 centers substantially accelerate the low&#8208;kinetic Na2S4 to Na2S directly conversion, manipulating the uniform deposition of electroactive Na2S and avoiding the formation of irreversible products (e.g., Na2S2). The intrinsic synergy of two catalytic centers benefits the Na2S decomposition and minimizes its activation barrier during battery recharging and then efficiently mitigate the cathodic passivation. As a result, the stable cycling of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8722;S cell delivers an attractive reversible capacity of 1060&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a high CE of 98.5&#8201;% and a high energy of 1008&#8197;Wh&#8201;kgcathode&#8722;1, comparable to the liquid electrolyte cells.

         <title>A Breast Cancer Stem Active Cobalt(III)&#8208;Cyclam Complex Containing Flufenamic Acid with Immunogenic Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the first investigation into the cytotoxic and immunogenic potential of a cobalt complex within the context of anti&#8208;cancer stem cell (CSC) drug discovery. The cobalt complex is able to deliver flufenamic acid to CSCs, which perturbs the inhibitory damage&#8208;associated molecular pattern axis and promotes immunogenic cell death. This subsequently leads to the phagocytosis of CSCs by macrophages.







Abstract
The cytotoxic and immunogenic&#8208;activating properties of a cobalt(III)&#8208;cyclam complex bearing the non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, flufenamic acid is reported within the context of anti&#8208;cancer stem cell (CSC) drug discovery. The cobalt(III)&#8208;cyclam complex 1 displays sub&#8208;micromolar potency towards breast CSCs grown in monolayers, 24&#8208;fold and 31&#8208;fold greater than salinomycin (an established anti&#8208;breast CSC agent) and cisplatin (an anticancer metallopharmaceutical), respectively. Strikingly, the cobalt(III)&#8208;cyclam complex 1 is 69&#8208;fold and 50&#8208;fold more potent than salinomycin and cisplatin towards three&#8208;dimensionally cultured breast CSC mammospheres. Mechanistic studies reveal that 1 induces DNA damage, inhibits cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 expression, and prompts caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. Breast CSCs treated with 1 exhibit damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns characteristic of immunogenic cell death and are phagocytosed by macrophages. As far as we are aware, 1 is the first cobalt complex of any oxidation state or geometry to display both cytotoxic and immunogenic&#8208;activating effects on breast CSCs.

         <title>Adjusting the Architecture of Heptagonal Metallo&#8208;Macrocycles by Embedding Metal Nodes into the Backbone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two giant metallo&#8208;macrocycles with double&#8208;layer and triple&#8208;layer concentric heptagonal structures (DA and TA, respectively) have been successfully assembled by embedding coordination sites in the ligand backbone. The angle between the two arms at position 4 of the central terpyridine (tpy) units increased after complexation with metal ions, leading to precise control over the topology.







Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly has been extensively employed for the bottom&#8208;up construction of discrete metallo&#8208;macrocycles. However, the prevalent use of benzene rings as the backbone limits the formation of large metallo&#8208;macrocycles with more than six edges. Herein, by embedding metal nodes into the ligand backbone, we successfully regulated the ligand arm angle and assembled two giant heptagonal metallo&#8208;macrocycles with precise control. The angle between two arms at position 4 of the central terpyridine (tpy) extended after complexation with metal ions, leading to ring expansion of the metallo&#8208;macrocycle. The assembled structures were straightforwardly identified through multi&#8208;dimensional NMR spectroscopy (1H, COSY, NOESY), multidimensional mass spectrometry analysis (ESI&#8208;MS and TWIM&#8208;MS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In addition, the catalytic performances of metallo&#8208;macrocycles in the oxidation of thioanisole were studied, with both supramolecules exhibiting good conversion rates. Furthermore, fiber&#8208;like nanostructures were observed from single&#8208;molecule heptagons by hierarchical self&#8208;assembly.

A series of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;decorated noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic frameworks [PCN&#8208;(BPY&#8208;CuI)&#8208;(TPDC&#8208;Fx), x=3, 5, 7, 11] are rationally fabricated through the stepwise solvent&#8208;assisted linker installation, post&#8208;synthetic fluorination and metalation, which showed excellent performance in catalyzing the one&#8208;pot four&#8208;component tandem reaction between alkyne, aldehyde, amine and flue gas CO2 for the facile preparation of 2&#8208;oxazolidinones.







Abstract
The non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysed&#8208;multicomponent reactions between flue gas CO2 and cheap industrial raw stocks into high value&#8208;added fine chemicals is a promising manner for the ideal CO2 utilization route. To achieve this, the key fundamental challenge is the rational development of highly efficient and facile reaction pathway while establishing compatible catalytic system. Herein, through the stepwise solvent&#8208;assisted linker installation, post&#8208;synthetic fluorination and metalation, we report the construction of a series of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;decorated noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) PCN&#8208;(BPY&#8208;CuI)&#8208;(TPDC&#8208;Fx) [BPY=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylate, TPDC&#8208;NH2=2&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;[1,1&#8242;:4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid] that can catalyze the one&#8208;pot four&#8208;component reaction between alkyne, aldehyde, amine and flue gas CO2 for the preparation of 2&#8208;oxazolidinones. Such assembly endows the MOFs with superhydrophobic microenvironment, superior water resistance and highly stable catalytic site, leading to 21 times higher turnover numbers than that of homogeneous counterparts. Mechanism investigation implied that the substrates can be efficiently enriched by the MOF wall and then the adsorbed amine species act as an extrinsic binding site towards dilute CO2 through their strong preferential formation to carbamate acid. Moreover, density functional theory calculations suggest the tetrahedral geometry of Cu in MOF offers special resistance towards amine poisoning, thus maintaining its high efficiency during the catalytic process.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction via Self&#8208;Relaxation of Asymmetric Coordination in Fe&#8208;Based Single Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We implemented an asymmetric coordination Fe&#8722;S1N3 SAC with significant geometric distortion. The Fe&#8722;S1N3 sites demonstrate distinctive self&#8208;relaxation behavior in response to different adsorption intermediates during the CO2RR process. The dynamic change in bond length enabled independent regulation of the *COOH and *CO intermediates adsorption energies, effectively breaking the linear scale relationship and enhancing the intrinsic activity.







Abstract
Addressing the limitations arising from the consistent catalytic behavior observed for various intermediates during the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) poses a significant challenge in the optimization of catalytic activity. In this study, we aimed to address this challenge by constructing an asymmetric coordination Fe single atom catalyst (SCA) with a dynamically evolved structure. Our catalyst, consisting of a Fe atom coordinated with one S atom and three N atoms (Fe&#8722;S1N3), exhibited exceptional selectivity (CO Faradaic efficiency of 99.02&#8201;%) and demonstrated a high intrinsic activity (TOF of 7804.34&#8197;h&#8722;1), and remarkable stability. Using operando XAFS spectra and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidated the self&#8208;relaxation of geometric distortion and dynamic evolution of bond lengths within the catalyst. These structure changes enabled independent regulation of the *COOH and *CO intermediate adsorption energies, effectively breaking the linear scale relationship and enhancing the intrinsic activity of CO2RR. This study provides valuable insights into the dynamic evolution of SACs and paves the way for targeted catalyst designs aimed to disrupt the linear scaling relationships.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different lateral functionalized pillar[n]arenes can be obtained using Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation. The irreversible nature of acylation results in the macrocycles being obtained selectively in terms of ring sizes and functional positions. Further derivatization of the ketones is also possible to afford various laterally modified pillar[n]arenes that cannot be accessed by general Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reactions.







Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes can be constructed using a Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation process. However, due to the reversible nature of the alkylation, mixture of large pillar[n]arenes (n&#8805;7) are obtained as minor products, and thus laborious purification are necessary to isolate the larger pillar[n]arenes. Moreover, inert methylene bridges are introduced during the alkylation process, and the multi&#8208;functionalization of the bridges has never been investigated. Herein, an irreversible Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation is used to prepare pillar[n]arenes. Due to the irreversible nature of the acylation, the reaction of precursors bearing carboxylic acids and electron&#8208;rich arene rings results in a size&#8208;exclusive formation of pillar[n]arenes, in which the ring&#8208;size is determined by the precursor length. Because of this size&#8208;selective formation, laborious separation of undesired macrocycles is not necessary. Moreover, the bridges of pillar[n]arenes are selectively installed with reactive carbonyl groups using the acylation method, whose positions are determined by the precursor used. The carbonyl bridges can be easily converted into versatile functional groups, leading to various laterally modified pillar[n]arenes, which cannot be accessed by the alkylation strategy.

         <title>The Diterpenoid Substrate Analogue 19&#8208;nor&#8208;GGPP Reveals Pronounced Methyl Group Effects in Diterpene Cyclisations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
19&#8208;nor&#8208;Geranylgeranyldiphosphate (with a methyl group removed) has been synthesised and converted into diterpene analogues with 20&#8197;diterpene synthases. In some cases only the desmethyl derivatives of the natural enzyme products were obtained, but with several enzymes a dramatic change in the reactivity was observed. The newly opened reaction paths to compounds with unknown skeletons reveal an intriguing methyl group effect in diterpene biosynthesis.







Abstract
The substrate analogue 19&#8208;nor&#8208;geranylgeranyl diphosphate (19&#8208;nor&#8208;GGPP) was synthesised and incubated with 20&#8197;diterpene synthases, resulting in the formation of diterpenoids in all cases. A total of 23&#8197;different compounds were isolated from these enzyme reactions and structurally characterised, if possible including the experimental determination of absolute configurations through a stereoselective deuteration approach. In several cases the missing 19&#8208;Me group in the substrate analogue resulted in opening of completely new reaction paths towards compounds with novel skeletons. DFT calculations were applied to gain a deeper understanding of these observed methyl group effects in diterpene biosynthesis.

         <title>Revealing the Dominance of the Dissolution&#8208;Deposition Mechanism in Aqueous Zn&#8722;MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pinpointed the cause of the capacity degradation of Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries and established the dominance of the MnO2/Mn2+ dissolution&#8208;deposition mechanism. Such a methodology circumvents the complicated characterization methods used in previous studies and provides a universal approach to accurately identify the reaction mechanism of other aqueous batteries.







Abstract
Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries have attracted extensive attention for grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications, however, the energy storage chemistry of MnO2 in mild acidic aqueous electrolytes remains elusive and controversial. Using &#945;&#8208;MnO2 as a case study, we developed a methodology by coupling conventional coin batteries with customized beaker batteries to pinpoint the operating mechanism of Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries. This approach visually simulates the operating state of batteries in different scenarios and allows for a comprehensive study of the operating mechanism of aqueous Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries under mild acidic conditions. It is validated that the electrochemical performance can be modulated by controlling the addition of Mn2+ to the electrolyte. The method is utilized to systematically eliminate the possibility of Zn2+ and/or H+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation reactions, thereby confirming the dominance of the MnO2/Mn2+ dissolution&#8208;deposition mechanism. By combining a series of phase and spectroscopic characterizations, the compositional, morphological and structural evolution of electrodes and electrolytes during battery cycling is probed, elucidating the intrinsic battery chemistry of MnO2 in mild acid electrolytes. Such a methodology developed can be extended to other energy storage systems, providing a universal approach to accurately identify the reaction mechanism of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries as well.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Live Imaging of Osteoclast Activation via Cathepsin K Activity in Bone Diseases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new two&#8208;photon fluorogenic probe, CatKP1, has been developed to detect cathepsin K and enable the real&#8208;time monitoring of osteoclast activity in hindlimb long bones during pathologic bone loss. This highlights the importance of CatKP1 as a valuable tool for studying aberrant osteoclast behavior and exploring new therapeutic strategies.







Abstract
Intravital fluorescence imaging of functional osteoclasts within their intact disease context provides valuable insights into the intricate biology at the microscopic level, facilitating the development of therapeutic approaches for osteoclast&#8208;associated bone diseases. However, there is a lack of studies investigating osteoclast activity within deep&#8208;seated bone lesions using appropriate fluorescent probes, despite the advantages offered by the multi&#8208;photon excitation system in enhancing deep tissue imaging resolution. In this study, we report on the intravital tracking of osteoclast activity in three distinct murine bone disease models. We utilized a cathepsin K (CatK)&#8208;responsive two&#8208;photon fluorogenic probe (CatKP1), which exhibited a notable fluorescence turn&#8208;on response in the presence of active CatK. By utilizing CatKP1, we successfully monitored a significant increase in osteoclast activity in hindlimb long bones and its attenuation through pharmacological intervention without sacrificing mice. Thus, our findings highlight the efficacy of CatKP1 as a valuable tool for unraveling pathological osteoclast behavior and exploring novel therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide by Cyano&#8208;Containing Covalent Organic Frameworks from Water, Air and Sunlight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work not only provides new insights into the design of COFs by regulating the amount of charge transfer channels and enhancing the rate&#8208;determining two&#8208;electron water oxidation to boost H2O2 photosynthesis, but also paves the way for the practical application of COFs&#8208;based photocatalysts in solar&#8208;driven synthesis.







Abstract
The insufficient exciton (e&#8722;&#8208;h+ pair) separation/transfer and sluggish two&#8208;electron water oxidation are two main factors limiting the H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) photocatalysts. Herein, we present an alternative strategy to simultaneously facilitate exciton separation/transfer and reduce the energy barrier of two&#8208;electron water oxidation in COFs via a dicyano functionalization. The in situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the dicyano functionalization improves the amount of charge transfer channels between donor and acceptor units from two in COF&#8208;0CN without cyano functionalization to three in COF&#8208;1CN with mono&#8208;cyano functionalization and four in COF&#8208;2CN with dicyano functionalization, leading to the highest separation/transfer efficiency in COF&#8208;2CN. More importantly, the dicyano group activates the neighbouring C atom to produce the key *OH intermediate for effectively reducing the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining two&#8208;electron water oxidation in H2O2 photosynthesis. The simultaneously enhanced exciton separation/transfer and two&#8208;electron water oxidation in COF&#8208;2CN result in high H2O2 yield (1601&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) from water and oxygen without using sacrificial reagent under visible&#8208;light irradiation. COF&#8208;2CN can effectively yield H2O2 in water with wide pH range, in different real water samples, in scaled&#8208;up reactor under natural sunlight irradiation, and in continuous&#8208;flow reactor for consecutively producing H2O2 solution for water decontamination.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pair) separation/transfer and sluggish two-electron water oxidation are two main factors limiting the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthetic efficiency of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) photocatalysts. Herein, we present an alternative strategy to simultaneously facilitate exciton separation/transfer and reduce the energy barrier of two-electron water oxidation in COFs via a dicyano functionalization. The in situ characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the dicyano functionalization improves the amount of charge transfer channels between donor and acceptor units from two in COF-0CN without cyano functionalization to three in COF-1CN with mono-cyano functionalization and four in COF-2CN with dicyano functionalization, leading to the highest separation/transfer efficiency in COF-2CN. More importantly, the dicyano group activates the neighbouring C atom to produce the key *OH intermediate for effectively reducing the energy barrier of rate-determining two-electron water oxidation in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis. The simultaneously enhanced exciton separation/transfer and two-electron water oxidation in COF-2CN result in high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield (1601&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) from water and oxygen without using sacrificial reagent under visible-light irradiation. COF-2CN can effectively yield H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in water with wide pH range, in different real water samples, in scaled-up reactor under natural sunlight irradiation, and in continuous-flow reactor for consecutively producing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution for water decontamination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Confinement of p&#8208;Xylene in the Pores of a Bilanthanide Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Highly Selective Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The porosity's significance in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has often been overlooked in luminescent sensing applications. A luminescent MOF NKU&#8208;999 was synthesized with tailored pores for highly selective and quantitative p&#8208;xylene recognition. The sensing mechanism was investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and dynamic magnetic susceptibilities.







Abstract
The rapid and accurate sensing of p&#8208;xylene, an essential raw material with a multi&#8208;billion&#8208;dollar market, in xylene mixture is of great significance in industry; however, the highly similar molecular structures, energy levels, and spectral characteristics of xylene isomers make the selective recognition extremely challenging. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibiting tailorable pores and potential binding sites provide prospects for xylene sensing but a comprehensive understanding of the pore effect is still elusive, primarily due to the intricacies involved in the sensing process. Herein, we reported a robust bilanthanide MOF NKU&#8208;999&#8208;EuTb with precisely engineered pores to accommodate p&#8208;xylene, of which the binding sites were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and dynamic magnetic susceptibilities. NKU&#8208;999&#8208;EuTb exhibits high&#8208;performance in selective recognition for p&#8208;xylene towards its isomers. Through a systematical study, it was revealed that absorbing p&#8208;xylene into the pores governs the sensing performance. This work provides insights for developing advanced sensing materials for complex isomers.

         <title>Aqueous Electroreduction of Nitric Oxide to Ammonia at Low Concentration via Vacancy Engineered FeOCl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cl vacancy strategy results in a lower Fe oxidation state with sharp d&#8208;states characteristics to enhance the adsorption and activation of NO, which overcomes the sluggish kinetics of NORR and competitive HER over FeOCl&#8208;VCl, especially at low concentrations of NO, and improves the catalytic activity and selectivity towards NORR.







Abstract
Electroreduction of nitric oxide (NO) to NH3 (NORR) has gained extensive attention for the sake of low carbon emission and air pollutant treatment. Unfortunately, NORR is greatly hindered by its sluggish kinetics, especially under low concentrations of NO. Herein, we developed a chlorine (Cl) vacancy strategy to overcome this limitation over FeOCl nanosheets (FeOCl&#8208;VCl). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the Cl vacancy resulted in defective Fe with sharp d&#8208;states characteristics in FeOCl&#8208;VCl to enhance the absorption and activation of NO. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) and attenuated total reflection&#8208;infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR) verified the lower average oxidation state of defective Fe to enhance the electron transfer for NO adsorption/activation and facilitate the generation of key NHO and NHx intermediates. As a result, the FeOCl&#8208;VCl exhibited superior NORR activities with the NH3 Faradaic efficiency up to 91.1&#8201;% while maintaining a high NH3 yield rate of 455.4&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 under 1.0&#8197;vol&#8201;% NO concentration, competitive with those of previously reported literatures under higher NO concentration. Further, the assembled Zn&#8208;NO battery utilizing FeOCl&#8208;VCl as cathode delivered a record peak power density of 6.2&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, offering a new route for simultaneous NO removal, NH3 production, and energy supply.

         <dc:description>
Polyoxometalate nanozyme&#8208;integrated polydopamine&#8208;conjugated nanomotors (POMotors) were constructed. They show peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity and NIR&#8208;triggered photothermal properties, therefore exhibiting enzyme&#8208;powered enhanced Brownian motion and NIR&#8208;triggered self&#8208;propulsion. Based on these properties of POMotors, a highly efficient self&#8208;propulsion&#8208;enhanced photothermal&#8208;catalytic synergistic tumor therapy was achieved.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;powered nanomotors have demonstrated promising potential in biomedical applications, especially for catalytic tumor therapy, owing to their ability of self&#8208;propulsion and bio&#8208;catalysis. However, the fragility of natural enzymes limits their environmental adaptability and also therapeutic efficacy in catalysis&#8208;enabled tumor therapy. Herein, polyoxometalate&#8208;nanozyme&#8208;based light&#8208;driven nanomotors were designed and synthesized for targeted synergistic photothermal&#8208;catalytic tumor therapy. In this construct, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the P2W18Fe4 polyoxometalates&#8208;based nanomotors can provide self&#8208;propulsion and facilitate their production of reactive oxygen species thus killing tumor cells, even in the weakly acidic tumor microenvironment. Conjugated polydopamine endows the nanomotors with the capability of light&#8208;driven self&#8208;propulsion behavior. After 10&#8197;min of NIR (808&#8197;nm) irradiation, along with the help of epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, the targeted accumulation and penetration of nanomotors in the tumor enabled highly efficient synergistic photothermal&#8208;catalytic therapy. This approach overcomes the disadvantages of the intrinsically fragile nature of enzyme&#8208;powered nanomotors in physiological environments and, more importantly, provides a motility&#8208;behavior promoted synergistic anti&#8208;tumor strategy.

Introducing PAnt a significant advance in quantitative PLIM bioimaging: PAnt (&#8220;phosphonic acid antenna&#8221;) is a small water&#8208;soluble lanthanide antenna tailored to dynamically self&#8208;assemble with lanthanide ions, serving as exchangeable probe to overcome photobleaching in PLIM microscopy in cellulo. Lanthanide complexes that may be photobleached during acquisition are continuously replenished by intact PAnt antennas from a large reservoir, exhibiting remarkable photostability compared to traditional lanthanide cryptates, as reported by Angel Orte, Juan A. Gonz&#225;lez&#8208;Vera et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202314595). Artwork by M. Eugenio V&#225;zquez, Univ. of Santiago de Compostela.

The generation of a dodecagonal columnar liquid quasicrystal is revealed by Carsten Tschierske, Feng Liu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202314454). Constructed by the T&#8208;shaped facial polyphiles, a special trapezoid tile with three aromatic walls and one flexible aliphatic wall becomes crucial for reaching the delicate balance between steric and entropic effects required by quasiperiodicity.

In nature, chiral selectivity mainly occurs between different species, such as the production of proteins, enzyme catalysis, or therapeutics using chiral drugs. Thus, there is great demand to explore the full potential of chiral self&#8208;sorting. In their Research Article (e202316200), Vivian Wing&#8208;Wah Yam et&#8197;al. report different combinations of axial chiral ligands giving rise to distinct chiral gold(I) sulfido clusters through different types of chiral self&#8208;assembly and self&#8208;sorting processes, evolving from homochiral assembly to heterochiral self&#8208;sorting and the unprecedented heterochiral and heteroleptic self&#8208;sorting.

         <title>Visualizing the Structure, Composition and Activity of Single Catalyst Particles for Olefin Polymerization and Polyolefin Decomposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A variety of laboratory&#8208; and synchrotron&#8208;based chemical imaging techniques can be employed to study heterogeneous catalysts at high spatial and temporal resolutions. This review discusses related advances in the fields of olefin polymerization and polyolefin decomposition catalysis and highlights future research directions that can ultimately deliver more detailed insights into structure&#8208;performance relationships in relevant catalyst materials.







Abstract
The structural and morphological characterization of individual catalyst particles for olefin polymerization, as well as for the reverse process of polyolefin decomposition, can provide an improved understanding for how these catalyst materials operate under relevant reaction conditions. In this review, we discuss an emerging analytical toolbox of 2D and 3D chemical imaging techniques that is suitable for investigating the chemistry and reactivity of related catalyst systems. While synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray microscopy still provides unparalleled spatial resolutions in 2D and 3D, a number of laboratory&#8208;based techniques, most notably focused ion beam&#8208;scanning electron microscopy, confocal fluorescence microscopy, infrared photoinduced force microscopy and laboratory&#8208;based X&#8208;ray nano&#8208;computed tomography, have helped to significantly expand the arsenal of analytical tools available to scientists in heterogeneous catalysis and polymer science. In terms of future research, the review outlines the role and impact of in situ and operando (spectro&#8722;)microscopy experiments, involving sophisticated reactors as well as online reactant and product analysis, to obtain real&#8208;time information on the formation, decomposition, and mobility of polymer phases within single catalyst particles. Furthermore, the potential of fluorescence microscopy, X&#8208;ray microscopy and optical microscopy is highlighted for the high&#8208;throughput characterization of olefin polymerization and polyolefin decomposition catalysts. By combining these chemical imaging techniques with, for example, chemical staining methodologies, selective probe molecules as well as particle sorting approaches, representative structure&#8211;activity relationships can be derived at the level of single catalyst particles.

         <title>Precision Sequence&#8208;Defined Polymers: From Sequencing to Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent advances in sequence&#8208;defined synthetic polymers (SDPs), focusing on newly developed sequencing methods including tandem mass spectrometry (MS) based on bond&#8208;selective cleavage and biased ionization, and primary MS based on cascade degradation. Their biological functions are also highlighted, and future perspectives of SDPs outlined.







Abstract
Precise sequence&#8208;defined polymers (SDPs) with uniform chain&#8208;to&#8208;chain structure including chain length, unit sequence, and end functionalities represent the pinnacle of sophistication in the realm of polymer science. For example, the absolute control over the unit sequence of SDPs allows for the bottom&#8208;up design of polymers with hierarchical microstructures and functions. Accompanied with the development of synthetic techniques towards precision SDPs, the decoding of SDP sequences and construction of advanced functions irreplaceable by other synthetic materials is of central importance. In this Minireview, we focus on recent advances in SDP sequencing techniques including tandem mass spectrometry (MS), chemically assisted primary MS, as well as other non&#8208;destructive sequencing methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD), and nanopore sequencing. Additionally, we delve into the promising prospects of SDP functions in the area of cutting&#8208;edge biological research. Topics of exploration include gene delivery systems, the development of hybrid materials combining SDPs and nucleic acids, protein recognition and regulation, as well as the interplay between chirality and biological functions. A brief outlook towards the future directions of SDPs is also presented.

         <title>Molecularly generated light and its biomedical applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Is it possible that light can be formulated as capsules, injection solutions, and packed into polymers? Yes, if the light is generated from molecules. The concept of &#8220;molecular light&#8221; has the potential to significantly expand our perspectives on the potential applications of light.







Abstract
Molecularly generated light, referred to here as &#8220;molecular light&#8221;, mainly includes bioluminescence, chemiluminescence, and Cerenkov luminescence. Molecular light possesses unique dual features of being both a molecule and a source of light. Its molecular nature enables it to be delivered as molecules to regions deep within the body, overcoming the limitations of natural sunlight and physically generated light sources like lasers and LEDs. Simultaneously, its light properties make it valuable for applications such as imaging, photodynamic therapy, photo&#8208;oxidative therapy, and photobiomodulation. In this review article, we provide an updated overview of the diverse applications of molecular light and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of molecular light across various domains. Lastly, we present forward&#8208;looking perspectives on the potential of molecular light in the realms of molecular imaging, photobiological mechanisms, therapeutic applications, and photobiomodulation. While some of these perspectives may be considered bold and contentious, our intent is to inspire further innovations in the field of molecular light applications.

         <title>Molecular Rotors: Fluorescent Sensors for Microviscosity and Conformation of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we describe recent advances in the development of fluorescence&#8208;based viscosity sensors, termed Molecular Rotors, and discuss how these dyes can be exploited to quantify the microviscosity of biological environment, probe lipid membranes and non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid architectures and track dynamic processes, including protein aggregation.







Abstract
The viscosity and crowding of biological environment are considered vital for the correct cellular function, and alterations in these parameters are known to underly a number of pathologies including diabetes, malaria, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, to name a few. Over the last decades, fluorescent molecular probes termed molecular rotors proved extremely useful for exploring viscosity, crowding, and underlying molecular interactions in biologically relevant settings. In this review, we will discuss the basic principles underpinning the functionality of these probes and will review advances in their use as sensors for lipid order, protein crowding and conformation, temperature and non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid structures in live cells and other relevant biological settings.

         <title>Activatable Near&#8208;Infrared Versatile Fluorescent and Chemiluminescent Dyes Based on the Dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran Scaffold: From Design to Imaging and Theranostics</title>

         <dc:description>
This review discusses the molecular design strategies, recognition mechanisms, and both in vitro and in vivo bio&#8208;applications (especially for diagnosis and therapy of tumors) of activatable dyes based on the dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran (DCM) scaffold.







Abstract
Activatable fluorescent and chemiluminescent dyes with near&#8208;infrared emission have indispensable roles in the fields of bioimaging, molecular prodrugs, and phototheranostic agents. As one of the most popular fluorophore scaffolds, the dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran scaffold has been applied to fabricate a large number of versatile activatable optical dyes for analytes detection and diseases diagnosis and treatment by virtue of its high photostability, large Stokes shift, considerable two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section, and structural modifiability. This review discusses the molecular design strategies, recognition mechanisms, and both in vitro and in vivo bio&#8208;applications (especially for diagnosis and therapy of tumors) of activatable dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran dyes. The final section describes the current shortcomings and future development prospects of this topic.

         <title>Interfacial Preparation of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Hybrid Supramolecular Polymers by Orthogonal Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient strategy is developed to prepare polyoxometalate&#8208;based hybrid supramolecular polymers (POM&#8208;SPs) by interfacial orthogonal self&#8208;assembly. Owing to the dynamic nature of noncovalent interactions, POM&#8208;SP&#8208;based interfacial assemblies with redox or competitive agent responsiveness can be achieved.







Abstract
The construction of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid supramolecular polymers using polyoxometalate (POM) as building block is expected to bring new opportunities to the functionalization of supramolecular polymers and the development of novel POM&#8208;based soft materials. Here, by using the orthogonal self&#8208;assembly based on host&#8211;guest interactions and metal&#8208;ligand interactions, we report the in situ construction of a novel POM&#8208;based hybrid supramolecular polymer (POM&#8208;SP) at the oil&#8208;water interface, while the redox and competitive responsiveness can be triggered independently. Moreover, the binding energy of POM&#8208;SP at the interface is sufficiently strong so that the assembly of POM&#8208;SP jams, allowing the stabilization of liquids in nonequilibrium shapes, offering the possibility of fabricating all&#8208;liquid constructs with reconfigurability.

Topochemical reduction of LaSrCoRuO6 yields LaSrCoRuO5 a phase containing Co3+O6, Co1+O4 and Ru3+O5 units, consistent with the coordination&#8208;geometry&#8208;driven disproportionation of Co2+ in an extended oxide.







Abstract
Complex transition&#8208;metal oxides exhibit a wide variety of chemical and physical properties which are a strong function the local electronic states of the transition&#8208;metal centres, as determined by a combination of metal oxidation state and local coordination environment. Topochemical reduction of the double perovskite oxide, LaSrCoRuO6, using Zr, yields LaSrCoRuO5. This reduced phase contains an ordered array of apex&#8208;linked square&#8208;based pyramidal Ru3+O5, square&#8208;planar Co1+O4 and octahedral Co3+O6 units, consistent with the coordination&#8208;geometry driven disproportionation of Co2+. Coordination&#8208;geometry driven disproportionation of d7 transition&#8208;metal cations (e.g. Rh2+, Pd3+, Pt3+) is common in complex oxides containing 4d and 5d metals. However, the weak ligand field experienced by a 3d transition&#8208;metal such as cobalt leads to the expectation that d7+ Co2+ should be stable to disproportionation in oxide environments, so the presence of Co1+O4 and Co3+O6 units in LaSrCoRuO5 is surprising. Low&#8208;temperature measurements indicate LaSrCoRuO5 adopts a ferromagnetically ordered state below 120&#8197;K due to couplings between S=1/2 Ru3+ and S=1 Co1+.

         <title>Electrochemical Azidocyanation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical alkene azidocyanation reaction that is compatible with both alkyl and aryl alkenes was developed. The reactions involving aryl alkenes could be obtained with good enantioselectivities by employing a chiral ligand. Notably, this method of alkene difunctionalization employs readily accessible reagents and is distinguished by its demonstrated functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The difunctionalization of alkenes&#8212;a process that installs two functional groups in a single operation and transforms chemical feedstocks into value&#8208;added products&#8212;is one of the most appealing synthetic methods in contemporary chemistry. However, the introduction of two distinct functional groups via two readily accessible nucleophiles remains a formidable challenge. Existing intermolecular alkene azidocyanation methods, which primarily focus on aryl alkenes and rely on stoichiometric chemical oxidants. We report herein an unprecedented electrochemical strategy for alkene azidocyanation that is compatible with both alkyl and aryl alkenes. This is achieved by harnessing the finely&#8208;tuned anodic electron transfer and the strategic selection of copper/ligand complexes. The reactions of aryl alkenes were rendered enantioselective by employing a chiral ligand. Crucially, the mild conditions and well&#8208;regulated electrochemical process assure exceptional tolerance for various functional groups and substrate compatibility with both terminal and internal alkyl alkenes.

         <title>Selective Hemin Binding by a Non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex Aptamer with Higher Affinity and Better Peroxidase&#8208;like Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using capture&#8208;SELEX, a non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer for selective hemin binding was obtained, and it did not bind to closely related protoporphyrin IX. The new aptamer doubled heat release compared to a classical G&#8208;quadruplex aptamer, indicating a fundamentally different way of hemin binding.







Abstract
Previous aptamers for porphyrins and metalloporphyrins were all guanine&#8208;rich sequences that can fold in G&#8208;quadruplex structures. Due to stacking&#8208;based binding, these aptamers can hardly tell different porphyrins apart, and they can also bind other planar molecules, hindering their practical applications. In this work, we used the capture selection method to obtain aptamers for hemin and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). The hemin aptamer (Hem1) features two highly conserved repeating binding loops, and it cannot form a G&#8208;quadruplex, which was supported by its Mg2+&#8208;dependent but K+&#8208;independent hemin binding and CD spectroscopy. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed much higher enthalpy change for the new aptamer, and the best aptamer showed a Kd of 43&#8197;nM hemin. Hem1 can also enhance the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of hemin. This work demonstrates that aptamers have alternative ways to bind porphyrins allowing selective recognition of different porphyrins.

         <title>Exchangeable Self&#8208;Assembled Lanthanide Antennas for PLIM Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a small aqueous&#8208;soluble lanthanide antenna (PAnt) specifically designed to dynamically interact with lanthanide ions and act as an exchangeable dye, aiming at mitigating photobleaching in PLIM microscopy in cellulo. Our self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complex exhibited an exceptional photostability compared to traditional lanthanide cryptates, marking a significant advance in quantitative PLIM bioimaging.







Abstract
Lanthanides have unique photoluminescence (PL) emission properties, including very long PL lifetimes. This makes them ideal for biological imaging applications, especially using PL lifetime imaging microscopy (PLIM). PLIM is an inherently multidimensional technique with exceptional advantages for quantitative biological imaging. Unfortunately, due to the required prolonged acquisitions times, photobleaching of lanthanide PL emission currently constitutes one of the main drawbacks of PLIM. In this study, we report a small aqueous&#8208;soluble, lanthanide antenna, 8&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrahydrocyclopenta[de]quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;phosphonic acid, PAnt, specifically designed to dynamically interact with lanthanide ions, serving as exchangeable dye aimed at mitigating photobleaching in PLIM microscopy in cellulo. Thus, self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complexes that may be photobleached during image acquisition are continuously replenished by intact lanthanide antennas from a large reservoir. Remarkably, our self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complex clearly demonstrated a significant reduction of PL photobleaching when compared to well&#8208;established lanthanide cryptates, used for bioimaging. This concept of exchangeable lanthanide antennas opens new possibilities for quantitative PLIM bioimaging.

         <title>Diadenosine Tetraphosphate (Ap4A) Serves as a 5&#8242; RNA Cap in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diadenosine tetraphosphate&#8208;RNA (Ap4A&#8208;RNA) is found in human and rat cell lines. Its amount is not dependent on the intracellular concentration of Ap4A. Ap4A&#8208;RNA is decapped by two enzymes, NUDT2 and DXO. Even though Ap4A&#8208;RNA is present in the same fraction as mRNA, it is not translated. However, it is recognized as self RNA by the innate immune system, as it does not elicit an immune response.







Abstract
The recent expansion of the field of RNA chemical modifications has changed our understanding of post&#8208;transcriptional gene regulation. Apart from internal nucleobase modifications, 7&#8208;methylguanosine was long thought to be the only eukaryotic RNA cap. However, the discovery of non&#8208;canonical RNA caps in eukaryotes revealed a new niche of previously undetected RNA chemical modifications. We are the first to report the existence of a new non&#8208;canonical RNA cap, diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A), in human and rat cell lines. Ap4A is the most abundant dinucleoside polyphosphate in eukaryotic cells and can be incorporated into RNA by RNA polymerases as a non&#8208;canonical initiating nucleotide (NCIN). Using liquid chromatography&#8208;mass spectrometry (LC&#8211;MS), we show that the amount of capped Ap4A&#8208;RNA is independent of the cellular concentration of Ap4A. A decapping enzyme screen identifies two enzymes cleaving Ap4A&#8208;RNA,NUDT2 and DXO, both of which also cleave other substrate RNAs in vitro. We further assess the translatability and immunogenicity of Ap4A&#8208;RNA and show that although it is not translated, Ap4A&#8208;RNA is recognized as self by the cell and does not elicit an immune response, making it a natural component of the transcriptome. Our findings open a previously unexplored area of eukaryotic RNA regulation.

Even though Ap&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;A-RNA is present in the same fraction as mRNA, it is not translated. However, it is recognized as self RNA by the innate immune system, as it does not elicit an immune response.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent expansion of the field of RNA chemical modifications has changed our understanding of post-transcriptional gene regulation. Apart from internal nucleobase modifications, 7-methylguanosine was long thought to be the only eukaryotic RNA cap. However, the discovery of non-canonical RNA caps in eukaryotes revealed a new niche of previously undetected RNA chemical modifications. We are the first to report the existence of a new non-canonical RNA cap, diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;A), in human and rat cell lines. Ap&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;A is the most abundant dinucleoside polyphosphate in eukaryotic cells and can be incorporated into RNA by RNA polymerases as a non-canonical initiating nucleotide (NCIN). Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC&#8211;MS), we show that the amount of capped Ap&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;A-RNA is independent of the cellular concentration of Ap&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;A. A decapping enzyme screen identifies two enzymes cleaving Ap&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;A-RNA,NUDT2 and DXO, both of which also cleave other substrate RNAs in vitro. We further assess the translatability and immunogenicity of Ap&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;A-RNA and show that although it is not translated, Ap&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;A-RNA is recognized as self by the cell and does not elicit an immune response, making it a natural component of the transcriptome. Our findings open a previously unexplored area of eukaryotic RNA regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We report examples of C(sp2)&#8722;N, C(sp2)&#8722;S, and C(sp2)&#8722;P bond formations in water microdroplets at room temperature and without catalyst.







Abstract
We report examples of C(sp2)&#8722;N, C(sp2)&#8722;S, and C(sp2)&#8722;P bond&#8208;forming transformations in water microdroplets at room temperature and atmospheric pressure using N2 as a nebulizing gas. When an aqueous solution of vinylic acid and amine is electrosprayed (+3&#8197;kV), the corresponding C(sp2)&#8722;N product is formed in a single step, which was characterized using mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS2). The scope of this reaction was extended to other amines and other unsaturated acids, including acrylic (CH2=CHCOOH) and crotonic (CH3CH=CHCOOH) acids. We also found that thiols and phosphines are viable nucleophiles, and the corresponding C(sp2)&#8722;S and C(sp2)&#8722;P products are observed in positive ion mode using MS and MS2.

         <title>Acyl and CO Ligands in the [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Cofactor Scramble upon Photolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase cofactor contains an acyl&#8208; and two CO&#8208;ligands. Biosynthesis using stable isotopes demonstrated the formation of the acyl ligand from the carboxy group of the precursor, and MS/MS analysis indicated that the acyl and CO ligands exchanged during photolysis. Time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy revealed the presence of an acyl&#8208;Fe(CO)3 intermediate during photolysis, which could explain the acyl/CO ligand exchange.







Abstract
[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase harbors the iron&#8208;guanylylpyridinol (FeGP) cofactor, in which the Fe(II) complex contains acyl&#8208;carbon, pyridinol&#8208;nitrogen, cysteine&#8208;thiolate and two CO as ligands. Irradiation with UV&#8208;A/blue light decomposes the FeGP cofactor to a 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;4&#8208;guanylyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridone (GP) and other components. Previous in vitro biosynthesis experiments indicated that the acyl&#8208; and CO&#8208;ligands in the FeGP cofactor can scramble, but whether scrambling occurred during biosynthesis or photolysis was unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the [18O1&#8208;carboxy]&#8208;group of GP is incorporated into the FeGP cofactor by in vitro biosynthesis. MS/MS analysis of the 18O&#8208;labeled FeGP cofactor revealed that the produced [18O1]&#8208;acyl group is not exchanged with a CO ligand of the cofactor, indicating that the acyl and CO ligands are scrambled during photolysis rather than biosynthesis, which ruled out any biosynthesis mechanisms allowing acyl/CO ligands scrambling. Time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy indicated that an acyl&#8208;Fe(CO)3 intermediate is formed during photolysis, in which scrambling of the CO and acyl ligands can occur. This finding also suggests that the light&#8208;excited FeGP cofactor has a higher affinity for external CO. These results contribute to our understanding of the biosynthesis and photosensitive properties of this unique H2&#8208;activating natural complex.

         <title>Photochemical Deoxygenative Hydroalkylation of Unactivated Alkenes Promoted by a Nucleophilic Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photochemical method for deoxygenative hydroalkylation of a wide range of alkenes and lactic acid derivatives is reported. This approach utilizes thiophenol as a nucleophilic organic catalyst which forms the key intermediate of this transformation via an SN2 process.







Abstract
The direct utilization of simple and abundant feedstocks in carbon&#8208;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions to embellish sp3&#8208;enriched chemical space is highly desirable. Herein, we report a novel photochemical deoxygenative hydroalkylation of unactivated alkenes with readily available carboxylic acid derivatives. The reaction displays broad functional group tolerance, accommodating carboxylic acid&#8208;, alcohol&#8208;, ester&#8208;, ketone&#8208;, amide&#8208;, silane&#8208;, and boronic ester groups, as well as nitrile&#8208;containing substrates. The reaction is operationally simple, mild, and water&#8208;tolerant, and can be carried out on multigram&#8208;scale, which highlights the utility of the method to prepare value&#8208;added compounds in a practical and scalable manner. The synthetic application of the developed method is further exemplified through the synthesis of suberanilic acid, a precursor of vorinostat, a drug used for the treatment of cutaneous T&#8208;cell lymphoma. A novel mechanistic approach was identified using thiol as a nucleophilic catalyst, which forms a key intermediate for this transformation. Furthermore, electrochemical studies, quantum yield, and mechanistic experiments were conducted to support a proposed catalytic cycle for the transformation.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive (3+2) Annulation of Lactams Enabling the Rapid Total Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Eburnamonine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reductive (3+2) annulation of lactams was developed through a sequential process consisting of iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of the lactam carbonyl group followed by iridium&#8208;catalyzed photoredox coupling with &#945;&#8208;bromoacetic acid. The method was successfully applied to the four&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;eburnamonine.







Abstract
A reductive (3+2) annulation of lactams through iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and photoredox coupling with &#945;&#8208;bromoacetic acid was developed. The iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of the lactam carbonyl group and subsequent elimination provide a transient cyclic enamine, which undergoes iridium&#8208;catalyzed photoredox coupling with &#945;&#8208;bromoacetic acid in a one&#8208;pot process. The developed conditions show high functional&#8208;group tolerance and provide cyclic N,O&#8208;acetals containing a quaternary carbon center. The resulting N,O&#8208;acetals undergo a variety of acid&#8208;mediated nucleophilic addition reactions via iminium ions to give substituted cyclic amines. The developed sequence including reductive (3+2) annulation and acid&#8208;mediated nucleophilic addition was successfully applied to the four&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;eburnamonine.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Generation of Tertiary Anions from Primary Amines via a Radical Polar Crossover</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deaminative radical&#8208;polar crossover strategy generating carbanions is reported. This so called &#8220;aza&#8208;Reformatsky&#8221; reaction leverages the use of redox&#8208;active imines and an iridium photocatalyst to generate a wide array of tertiary benzylic, heteroarylbenzylic and &#945;&#8208;ester anions, which can be trapped with different electrophiles.







Abstract
A method for the generation of tertiary carbanions via a deaminative radical&#8208;polar crossover is reported using redox active imines from &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines. A variety of benzylic amines and amino esters can be used in this approach, with the latter engaging in a novel &#8220;aza&#8208;Reformatsky&#8221; reaction. Electronic trends correlate the stability of the resulting carbanion with reaction efficiency. The anions can be trapped with different electrophiles including aldehydes, ketones, imines, Michael acceptors, and H2O/D2O. Selective anion formation can be achieved in the presence of another equivalent or more acidic C&#8722;H bond in both an inter&#8208; and intramolecular fashion. Mechanistic studies suggest the intermediacy of a discrete carbanion intermediate.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Regioselective Diborylation of Aryllithium with Tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst&#8208;free highly regioselective and efficient o&#8208;diborylation of aryllithium with tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) has been developed, leading to a family of o&#8208;diborylarenes in very good yields under mild reaction conditions. Density functional theory calculations reveal that an aromatic nucleophilic C(sp2)&#8722;H substitution pathway may be involved.







Abstract
A catalyst&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;diborylation of aryllithium with tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) has been achieved, giving a series of 1,2&#8208;diborylaryl lithium species in excellent yields under mild reaction conditions, which leads to 1,2&#8208;di(tolyl)borylarenes in 60&#8211;91&#8201;% yields upon treatment with the hydride&#8208;abstracting reagent. In these transformations, one sp2 C&#8722;H of arene is activated and both boryl units are utilized to build two new (sp2)C&#8722;B bonds. This represents a new strategy for selective arene diborylation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that an aromatic nucleophilic substitution is a key step in the formation of the products.

Abstract
We report herein an unprecedented enantioselective (4+4) cycloaddition of simple 1,3&#8208;dienes with azadienes for the construction of fused eight&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles. In this transformation, the &#960;&#8208;Lewis basic Pd(0) catalyst achieves activation of 1,3&#8208;dienes to induce nucleophilic addition to azadienes followed by ring cyclization via a selective terminal allylic substitution. Furthermore, highly efficient and diastereoselective derivatizations of the eight&#8208;membered rings provide a facile access to diverse enantiopure fused tetra&#8208; to hexacyclic compounds with potential application in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Decarboxylative Radical Sulfilimination via Photoredox, Copper, and Br&#248;nsted Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the protocol for decarboxylative radical sulfilimination reactions between sulfenamides and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl carboxylic acids, which were achieved via a combination of photoredox, copper, and Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. The mild, operationally simple reaction has good functional group compatibility. Our findings provide a Br&#248;nsted base activation strategy for metallaphotoredox catalysis.







Abstract
Sulfilimines, the aza&#8208;variants of sulfoxides, are key structural motifs in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals; and sulfilimine synthesis is therefore important in organic chemistry. However, methods for radical sulfilimination remain elusive, and as a result, the structural diversity of currently available sulfilimines is limited. Herein, we report the first protocol for decarboxylative radical sulfilimination reactions between sulfenamides and N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl carboxylic acids, which were achieved via a combination of photoredox, copper, and Br&#248;nsted base catalysis. This novel protocol provided a wide variety of sulfilimines, in addition to serving as an efficient route for the synthesis of S&#8208;alkyl/S&#8208;aryl homocysteine sulfilimines and S&#8208;(4&#8208;methylphenyl) homocysteine sulfoximine. Moreover, it could be used for late&#8208;stage introduction of a sulfilimine group into structurally complex molecules, thereby avoiding the need to preserve labile organosulfur moieties through multistep synthetic sequences. A mechanism involving photocatalytic substrate transformation and copper&#8208;mediated C(sp3)&#8722;S bond formation is proposed.

         <title>In Situ Chiral Template Approach to Synthesize Homochiral Lead Iodides for Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ chiral template approach has been developed for the synthesis of homochiral lead iodides, demonstrating the advantage of using two different chiral templates over a single chiral template in enhancing the second&#8208;harmonic generation response.







Abstract
Homochiral halide perovskites have gained increasing attention because of their fascinating optoelectronic properties and prospective applications in laser technologies. However, the limited choice of chiral organic templates severely restricts their structural diversity and second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) effects. Here, we present an in situ chiral template approach for the synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) homochiral lead iodides. A chiral imine (L&#8208;ipp) template was generated in situ by reacting L&#8208;proline (L&#8208;pro) and acetone under ambient conditions. Notably, L&#8208;ipp can cooperate with L&#8208;pro to direct the formation of a homochiral lead iodide with dual chiral templates, which is unprecedented in crystalline metal halides. The homochiral lead iodide containing both L&#8208;ipp and L&#8208;pro shows a strong SHG response of 8.0&#8197;times that of KH2PO4 (8.0&#215;KDP). The SHG efficiency is one of the largest values reported to date for any homochiral lead halides under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. A comparative study shows that homochiral 1D lead iodides containing either L&#8208;ipp or L&#8208;pro exhibit relatively weak SHG responses (&#8804;1.0&#215;KDP). This work demonstrates the advantage of using two different chiral templates over a single chiral template in enhancing the SHG responses of halide materials.

&lt;p&gt;Homochiral halide perovskites have gained increasing attention because of their fascinating optoelectronic properties and prospective applications in laser technologies. However, the limited choice of chiral organic templates severely restricts their structural diversity and second-harmonic generation (SHG) effects. Here, we present an in situ chiral template approach for the synthesis of one-dimensional (1D) homochiral lead iodides. A chiral imine (L-ipp) template was generated in situ by reacting L-proline (L-pro) and acetone under ambient conditions. Notably, L-ipp can cooperate with L-pro to direct the formation of a homochiral lead iodide with dual chiral templates, which is unprecedented in crystalline metal halides. The homochiral lead iodide containing both L-ipp and L-pro shows a strong SHG response of 8.0&#8197;times that of KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (8.0&#215;KDP). The SHG efficiency is one of the largest values reported to date for any homochiral lead halides under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. A comparative study shows that homochiral 1D lead iodides containing either L-ipp or L-pro exhibit relatively weak SHG responses (&#8804;1.0&#215;KDP). This work demonstrates the advantage of using two different chiral templates over a single chiral template in enhancing the SHG responses of halide materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Synthesis and Functionalization of an Acyclic Methylene&#8208;Bridged&#8208;Arene Trimer in a Cage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 6, February 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise control of repeating reactions to form oligomeric compounds is challenging because such reactions are controlled only statistically. Here, we show that a coordination cage serves as a nano&#8208;reaction vessel in the iteroselective condensation of a simple aromatic compound and formaldehyde to form a methylene&#8208;bridged arene trimer. The confinement effect for the kinetic protection is also demonstrated by the subsequent iodination of the trimer within the cage.







Abstract
Arene&#8208;formaldehyde condensation is a versatile reaction for producing various oligomeric/polymeric materials. However, the precise control of oligomerization degree is still challenging because the starting materials and intermediates have similar reactivities. Here, we demonstrate the selective synthesis of a methylene&#8208;bridged arene trimer using the confined cavity of a coordination cage. The limited space of the cavity prevents unregulated polymerization. The confinement effect for the kinetic protection is also demonstrated by the subsequent site&#8208;selective iodination of the trimer product within the cage.

         <title>Amphiphilic Covalent Organic Framework Nanoparticles for Pickering Emulsion Catalysis with Size Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting advanced amphiphilic solid catalysts is crucial to the development of Pickering emulsion catalysis. Herein, covalent organic framework (COF) nanoparticles constructed using highly hydrophobic monomers as linkers were found to show superior amphiphilicity and they were then developed as a new class of solid surfactants for Pickering emulsion catalysis. Employing amphiphilic COFs as solid emulsifiers, Pickering emulsions with controllable emulsion type and droplet sizes were obtained. COF materials have also been demonstrated to serve as porous surface coatings to replace traditional surface modifications for stabilizing Pickering emulsions. After implanting Pd nanoparticles into amphiphilic COFs, the obtained catalyst displayed a 3.9 times higher catalytic efficiency than traditional amphiphilic solid catalysts with surface modifications in the biphasic oxidation reaction of alcohols. Such an enhanced activity was resulted from the high surface area and regular porous structure of COFs. More importantly, because of their tunable pore diameters, Pickering emulsion catalysis with remarkable size selectivity was achieved. This work is the first example that COFs were applied in Pickering emulsion catalysis, providing a platform for exploring new frontiers of Pickering emulsion catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Bifunctional Chemoselective Metabolome Analysis of Liver Disease Plasma Using the Reagent 4&#8208;Nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid functional group transformation of carboxylic acids into a new ketone under mild conditions using the reagent 4&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine. The newly formed ketone was captured by our chemical probe methodology for quantification with enhanced mass spectrometric sensitivity. This bifunctional methodology is a new chemical biology tool for biomarker discovery and metabolomics.







Abstract
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bile ducts that has been associated with diverse metabolic carboxylic acids. Mass spectrometric techniques are the method of choice for their analysis. However, the broad investigation of this metabolite class remains challenging. Derivatization of carboxylic acids represents a strategy to overcome these limitations but available methods suffer from diverse analytical challenges. Herein, we have designed a novel strategy introducing 4&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine as a new chemoselective moiety for the first time for carboxylic acid metabolites. This moiety was selected as it rapidly forms a stable amide bond and also generates a new ketone, which can be analyzed by our recently developed quant&#8208;SCHEMA method specific for carbonyl metabolites. Optimization of this new method revealed a high reproducibility and robustness, which was utilized to validate 102&#8197;metabolic carboxylic acids using authentic synthetic standard conjugates in human plasma samples including nine metabolites that were newly detected. Using this sequential analysis of the carbonyl&#8208; and carboxylic acid&#8208;metabolomes revealed alterations of the ketogenesis pathway, which demonstrates the vast benefit of our unique methodology. We anticipate that the developed azirine moiety with rapid functional group transformation will find broad application in diverse chemical biology research fields.

         <title>Enhancing Plasmonic Hot Electron Energy on Ag Surface by Amine Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface coordination induces a substantial enhancement in plasmonic hot electron energy, thereby enabling the achievement of previously inaccessible visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven cleavage of C&#8722;X (X=F, Cl) bonds using individual plasmonic metal.







Abstract
Plasmonic catalysis has emerged as a promising approach to solar&#8208;chemical energy conversion. Notably, hot carriers play a decisive role in plasmonic catalysis since only when their energy matches with the LUMO or HOMO energy of the reactant molecule, can the reaction be activated. However, the hot carrier energy depends on the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the plasmonic metal substrate and the interaction with incident light. Tuning the hot carrier energy is of great significance for plasmonic catalysis but remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the energy of hot electrons can be significantly elevated to an unprecedented level through the coordination of amines on Ag surface. The bonding of amines and Ag reduces the work function of nanoparticles, leading to the increase of hot electron energy by 0.4&#8197;eV. This enhancement of energy promotes the cleavage of C&#8722;X (X=Cl, F) bonds upon excitation by visible light. This study provides new insights for promoting plasmonic charge transfer and enhancing the photocatalytic performance of plasmon&#8208;mediated systems.

This study provides new insights for promoting plasmonic charge transfer and enhancing the photocatalytic performance of plasmon-mediated systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Incarnatapeptins A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the photoredox&#8208;mediated decarboxylative 1,4&#8208;addition reaction and the unusual use of silver carbonate to promote N&#8208;acylation, the first total synthesis of incarnatapeptins A and B has been achieved, which unambiguously confirmed the structure of these natural products.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of incarnatapeptins A and B, two novel marine natural products, was accomplished from readily available (S)&#8208;1&#8208;benzyloxycarbonylhexahydropyridazine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid. This route, whose longest linear sequence was 12 steps, provided the incarnatapeptins A and B in yields of 26.5&#8201;% and 19.7&#8201;%, respectively, and enabled the structure and stereochemistry of both natural products to be unambiguously confirmed. Highlights of our synthesis include the photoredox&#8208;mediated decarboxylative 1,4&#8208;addition reaction and a novel and practical N&#8208;acylation paradigm promoted by silver carbonate. The unusual facile atropisomerism of some linear peptidic intermediates was also observed by TLC analysis in the course of this work.

         <title>Unraveling the &#8220;Gap&#8208;Filling&#8221; Mechanism of Multiple Charge Carriers in Aqueous Zn&#8208;MoS2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MoS2/(reduced graphene quantum dots) hybrid featuring ultra&#8208;large interlayer spacing, superior electrical conductivity/hydrophilicity, and robust layered structure demonstrates highly reversible NH4+/Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction chemistry in aqueous Zn&#8208;based batteries, where NH4+ and H+ can serve as &#8220;gap&#8208;filling&#8221; ions to improve the utilization rate of active sites and screen electrostatic interactions to facilitate the Zn2+ diffusion.







Abstract
The utilization rate of active sites in cathode materials for Zn&#8208;based batteries is a key factor determining the reversible capacities. However, a long&#8208;neglected issue of the strong electrostatic repulsions among divalent Zn2+ in hosts inevitably causes the squander of some active sites (i.e., gap sites). Herein, we address this conundrum by unraveling the &#8220;gap&#8208;filling&#8221; mechanism of multiple charge carriers in aqueous Zn&#8208;MoS2 batteries. The tailored MoS2/(reduced graphene quantum dots) hybrid features an ultra&#8208;large interlayer spacing (2.34&#8197;nm), superior electrical conductivity/hydrophilicity, and robust layered structure, demonstrating highly reversible NH4+/Zn2+/H+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction chemistry in the 1&#8197;M ZnSO4+0.5&#8197;M (NH4)2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The NH4+ and H+ ions can act as gap fillers to fully utilize the active sites and screen electrostatic interactions to accelerate the Zn2+ diffusion. Thus, unprecedentedly high rate capability (439.5 and 104.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1 and 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively) and ultra&#8208;long cycling life (8000 cycles) are achieved.

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes for Wide&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Range Aluminum&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte formed via diluting ionic liquid electrolytes with non&#8208;solvating 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn) co&#8208;solvent is proposed for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range Al&#8722;S batteries. It presents better fluidity and ionic conductivity without affecting the AlCl4&#8722;/Al2Cl7&#8722; equilibrium, as well as a faster kinetics, enabling a long&#8208;life&#8208;span Al&#8722;S batteries under &#8722;20&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Aluminum&#8722;sulfur (Al&#8722;S) batteries are promising energy storage devices due to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and high safety. However, the high viscosity and inferior ion transport of conventionally used ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) limit the kinetics of Al&#8722;S batteries, especially at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. Herein, locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILE) formed via diluting the ILEs with non&#8208;solvating 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn) co&#8208;solvent are proposed for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range Al&#8722;S batteries. The addition of dFBn effectively promotes the fluidity and ionic conductivity without affecting the AlCl4&#8722;/Al2Cl7&#8722; equilibrium, which preserves the reversible stripping/plating of aluminum and further promotes the overall kinetics of Al&#8722;S batteries. As a result, Al&#8722;S cells employing the LCILE exhibit higher specific capacity, better cyclability, and lower polarization with respect to the neat ILE in a wide temperature range from &#8722;20 to 40&#8201;&#176;C. For instance, Al&#8722;S batteries employing the LCILE sustain a remarkable capacity of 507&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles at 20&#8201;&#176;C, while only 229&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 is delivered with the dFBn&#8208;free electrolyte under the same condition. This work demonstrates the favorable use of LCILEs for wide&#8208;temperature Al&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Enabling Stable and low&#8208;strain Lithium Plating/Stripping with 2D Layered Transition Metal Carbides by Forming Li&#8208;Zipped MXenes and a Li halide&#8208;rich Solid Electrolyte Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered materials demonstrate prominent advantage in regulating lithium plating/stripping behavior by confining lithium diffusion/plating within interlayer gaps. However, achieving effective interlayer confined lithium diffusion/plating without compromising the stability of bulk&#8208;structural and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) remains a considerable challenge. This paper presents an electrochemical scissor and Li zipper&#8208;driven protocol for realizing interlayer confined Li plating with pretty&#8208;low strain and volume change. In this protocol, lithium serves as a &#8220;zipper&#8221; to reunite the adjacent MXene back to MAX&#8208;like phase to markedly enhance the structural stability, and a Li halide&#8208;rich SEI is formed by electrochemically removing the terminals of halogenated MXenes to maintain the stability and rapid Li+ diffusion of SEI. When the Ti3C2I2 serves as the host for lithium plating, the average coulomb efficiency exceeds 97.0% after 320 lithium plating/stripping cycles in conventional ester electrolyte. Furthermore, a full cell comprising of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and Ti3C2I2@Li exhibits a capacity retention rate of 73.4% after 200 cycles even under high cathode mass&#8208;loading (20 mg cm&#8208;2) and a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.4. Our findings advance the understanding of interlayer confined lithium plating in 2D layered materials and provide a new direction in regulating the Li and other metal plating/stripping behaviors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fast charging technology for electric vehicles (EVs), offering rapid charging times similar to conventional vehicle refueling, holds promise but faces obstacles owing to kinetic issues within lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Specifically, the significance of cathode materials in fast charging has grown because Ni&#8208;rich cathodes are employed to enhance the energy density of LIBs. Herein, the mechanism behind the loss of fast charging capability of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes during extended cycling is investigated through a comparative analysis of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes with different microstructures. The results revealed that microcracks and the resultant cathode deterioration significantly compromised the fast charging capability over extended cycling. When thick rocksalt impurity phases form throughout the particles owing to electrolyte infiltration via microcracks, the limited kinetics of Li+ ions create electrochemically unreactive areas under high&#8208;current conditions, resulting in the loss of fast charging capability. Hence, preventing microcrack formation by tailoring microstructures is essential to ensure stability in fast charging capability. Understanding the relationship between microcracks and the loss of fast charging capability is essential for developing Ni&#8208;rich cathodes that facilitate stable fast charging upon extended cycling, thereby promoting widespread EV adoption.</dc:description>

         <title>CO&#8208;induced dimer decay responsible for gem&#8208;dicarbonyl formation on a model single&#8208;atom catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to coordinate multiple reactants at the same active site is important for the wide&#8208;spread applicability of single&#8208;atom catalysis. Model catalysts are ideal to investigate the link between active site geometry and reactant binding, because the structure of single&#8208;crystal surfaces can be precisely determined, the adsorbates imaged by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and direct comparisons made to density functional theory. In this study, we follow the evolution of Rh1 adatoms and minority Rh2 dimers on Fe3O4(001) during exposure to CO using time&#8208;lapse STM at room temperature. CO adsorption at Rh1 sites results exclusively in stable Rh1CO monocarbonyls, because the Rh atom adapts its coordination to create a stable pseudo&#8208;square planar environment. Rh1(CO)2 gem&#8208;dicarbonyl species are also observed, but these form exclusively through the breakup of Rh2 dimers via an unstable Rh2(CO)3 intermediate. Overall, our results illustrate how minority species invisible to area&#8208;averaging spectra can play an important role in catalytic systems, and show that the decomposition of dimers or small clusters can be an avenue to produce reactive, metastable configurations in single&#8208;atom catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Injection Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) Analysis of Proteins with High Matrix Content: Utilizing Taylor&#8208;Aris Dispersion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This is the first work demonstrating the utility of the Taylor&#8208;Aris (TA) dispersion in avoiding serious interference issues commonly occurring in the electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometric (ESI&#8208;MS) determination of therapeutic protein pharmaceuticals undergoing no pre&#8208;separation or sample purification. It was also pointed out that the TA dispersion conditions and its analytical utilization for proteomics can be easily accomplished in a commercial CE&#8208;MS instrument. In the proposed Taylor&#8208;Aris dispersion&#8208;assisted mass spectrometry (TADA&#8208;MS) analysis 0.5 &#181;L sample is injected into a 65 cm long 50 &#181;m i.d. capillary and pumped with 1 bar toward the MS. The procedure is efficient for the direct injection analysis of components having low diffusion coefficients (proteins) that are present in complex matrices of small organic and inorganic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifold Post&#8208;Modification of Macrocycles and Cages by Isocyanate&#8208;Induced Azadefluorination Cyclisation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the multiple post&#8208;modification of organic macrocycles and cages, introducing functional groups into two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular scaffolds bearing fluorine substituents, which opens up new possibilities in multi&#8208;step supramolecular chemistry employing the vast chemical space of readily available isocyanates. The mechanism and scope of the reaction that proceeds after isocyanate addition to the benzylamine motif&#160;via&#160;an azadefluorination cyclisation (ADFC) were investigated using DFT calculations, and a series of aromatic isocyanates with different electronic properties were tested. The compounds show excellent chemical stability and were fully characterised. They can be used for subsequent cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and ADFC can be used directly to generate cross&#8208;linked membranes from macrocycles or cages when using ditopic isocyanates. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray (SC&#8208;XRD) analysis shows the proof of the formation of the desired supramolecular entity together with the connectivity predicted by calculations and from 19F NMR shifts, allowing the late&#8208;stage functionalisation of self&#8208;assembled macrocycles and cages by ADFC.</dc:description>

         <title>Matched Kinetics Process Over Fe2O3&#8208;Co/NiO Heterostructure Enables Highly Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tandem nitrate electroreduction reaction (NO3&#8208;RR) is a promising method for green ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, the mismatched kinetics processes between NO3&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8208; and NO2&#8208;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 results in poor selectivity for NH3 and excess NO2&#8208; evolution in electrolyte solution. Herein, a Ni2+ substitution strategy for developing oxide heterostructure in Co/Fe layered double oxides (LDOs) was designed and employed as tandem electrocataltysts for NO3&#8208;RR. (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe exhibited a high NH3 yield rate of 50.4 mg&#183;cm&#8208;2&#183;h&#8208;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 97.8% at &#8208;0.42 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a pulsed electrolysis test. By combining with in situ/operando characterization technologies and theoretical calculations, we observed the strong selectivity of NH3 evolution over (Co0.83Ni0.16)2Fe, with Ni playing a dual role in NO3&#8208;RR by i) modifying the electronic behavior of Co, and ii) serving as complementary site for active hydrogen (*H) supply. Therefore, the adsorption capacity of *NO2 and its subsequent hydrogenation on the Co sites became more thermodynamically feasible. This study shows that Ni substitution promotes the kinetics of the NO3&#8208;RR and provides insights into the design of tandem electrocatalysts for NH3 evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>A Semisynthesis Platform for the Efficient Production and Exploration of Didemnin&#8208;Based Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plitidepsin (or dehydrodidemnin B), an approved anti&#8208;cancer drug, belongs to the didemnin family of cyclic depsipeptides, which are found in limited quantities in marine tunicate extracts. Here, we introduce a new approach that integrates microbial and chemical synthesis to generate plitidepsin and its analogues. We screened a Tistrella strain library to identify a potent didemnin B producer, and then introduced a second copy of the didemnin biosynthetic gene cluster into its genome, resulting in a didemnin B titre of approximately 75 mg/L. Next, we developed two straightforward chemical strategies to convert didemnin B to plitidepsin, one of which involved a one&#8208;step synthetic route giving over 90% overall yield. Furthermore, we synthesised 13 new didemnin derivatives and three didemnin probes, enabling research into structure&#8211;activity relationships and interactions between didemnin and proteins. Our study highlights the synergistic potential of biosynthesis and chemical synthesis in overcoming the challenge of producing complex natural products sustainably and at scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyrrole&#8208;Based Fully Non&#8208;fused Acceptor for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) are still suffering from the low light utilization and unstable under ultraviolet irradiation. To tackle these challenge s, we design and synthesize a non&#8208;fused acceptor based on 1&#8208;(2&#8208;butyloctyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole as &#960;&#8208;bridge unit, denoted as GS70, which serves as active layer in the front&#8208;cell for constructing tandem OSCs with a parallel configuration. Benefiting from the well&#8208;complementary absorption spectra with the rear&#8208;cell, GS70&#8208;based parallel tandem OSCs exhibit an improved photoelectron response over the range between 600&#8208;700 nm, yielding a high short&#8208;circuit current density of 28.4 mA cm&#8722;2. The improvement in light utilization translates to a power conversion efficiency of 19.4%, the highest value among all parallel tandem OSCs. Notably, owing to the intrinsic stability of GS70, the manufactured parallel tandem OSCs retain 84.9% of their initial PCE after continuous illumination for 1000 hours. Overall, this work offers novel insight into the molecular design of low&#8208;cost and stability non&#8208;fused acceptors, emphasizing the importance of adopting a parallel tandem configuration for achieving efficient light harvesting and improved photostability in OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Turn&#8208;On Strategy to Profile E2&#8208;Specific Ubiquitination Events in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A cascade of three enzymes, E1&#8208;E2&#8208;E3, is responsible for transferring ubiquitin to target proteins, which controls many different aspects of cellular signaling. The role of the E2 has been largely overlooked, despite influencing substrate identity, chain multiplicity, and topology. Here we report a method &#8211; targeted charging of ubiquitin to E2 (tCUbE) &#8211; that can track a tagged ubiquitin through its entire enzymatic cascade in living mammalian cells. We use this approach to reveal new targets whose ubiquitination depends on UbcH5a E2 activity. We demonstrate that tCUbE can be broadly applied to multiple E2s and in different human cell lines. tCUbE is uniquely suited to examine E2&#8208;E3&#8208;substrate cascades of interest and/or piece together previously unidentified cascades, thereby illuminating entire branches of the UPS and providing critical insight that will be useful for identifying new therapeutic targets in the UPS.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Formate on Copper Electrodes Modified by Cationic Gemini Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity and activity of formate over the copper electrode are dramatically promoted by the modification of cationic Gemini surfactants. Furthermore, on a Gemini surfactant modified Bi2O3 electrode, a formate FE of 91&#8201;% was achieved at a current density of 510&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This improvement in formate production was attributed to the combined effects of the cations and alkyl chains present in the Gemini surfactants.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels is a promising strategy to mitigate energy and environmental problems. However, it usually suffers from unsatisfactory selectivity for a single product and inadequate electrochemical stability. Herein, we report the first work to use cationic Gemini surfactants as modifiers to boost CO2 electroreduction to formate. The selectivity, activity and stability of the catalysts can be all significantly enhanced by Gemini surfactant modification. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate could reach up to 96&#8201;%, and the energy efficiency (EE) could achieve 71&#8201;% over the Gemini surfactants modified Cu electrode. In addition, the Gemini surfactants modified commercial Bi2O3 nanosheets also showed an excellent catalytic performance, and the FE of formate reached 91&#8201;% with a current density of 510&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 using the flow cell. Detailed studies demonstrated that the double quaternary ammonium cations and alkyl chains of the Gemini surfactants played a crucial role in boosting electroreduction CO2, which can not only stabilize the key intermediate HCOO* but also provide an easy access for CO2. These observations could shine light on the rational design of organic modifiers for promoted CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Multivariate Machine Learning Models of Nanoscale Porosity from Ultrafast NMR Relaxometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoporous materials are of great interest in many applications, such as catalysis, separation, and energy storage. The performance of these materials is closely related to their pore sizes, which are inefficient to determine through the conventional measurement of gas adsorption isotherms. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry has emerged as a technique highly sensitive to porosity in such materials. Nonetheless, streamlined methods to estimate pore size from NMR relaxometry remain elusive. Previous attempts have been hindered by inverting a time domain signal to relaxation rate distribution, and dealing with resulting parameters that vary in number, location, and magnitude.&#160;Here we invoke well&#8208;established machine learning techniques to directly correlate time domain signals to BET surface areas for a set of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) imbibed with solvent at varied concentrations. We employ this series of MOFs to establish a correlation between NMR signal and surface area&#160;via partial least squares (PLS), following screening with principal component analysis, and apply the PLS model to predict surface area&#160;of various nanoporous materials. This approach offers a high&#8208;throughput, non&#8208;destructive way to assess porosity in c.a. one minute. We anticipate this work will contribute to the development of new materials with optimized pore sizes for various applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrooxidative Rhodium(III)/Chiral Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8210;H Annulation of Sulfoximines with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of achiral Cp*Rh(III) with chiral carboxylic acids (CCAs) represents an efficient catalytic system in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8211;H activation. However, this hybrid catalysis is limited to redox&#8208;neutral C&#8208;H activation reactions and the adopt to oxidative enantioselective C&#8211;H activation remains elusive and pose a significant challenge. Herein, we describe the development of an electrochemical Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8210;H annulation of sulfoximines with alkynes enabled by chiral carboxylic acid (CCA) in an operationally friendly undivided cell at room temperature. A broad range of enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;benzothiazines were obtained in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield and 98:2 er). The practicality of this method was demonstrated by scale&#8208;up reaction in a batch reactor with external circulation. A crucial chiral Cp*Rh(III) intermediate was isolated, characterized, and transformed, providing rational support for a Rh(III)/Rh(I) electrocatalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Binary Organic Solar Cells with over 19% Efficiency and Enhanced Morphology Stability Enabled by Asymmetric Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The simultaneous improvement of efficiency and stability of organic solar cells (OSCs) for commercialization remains a challenging task. Herein, we designed asymmetric acceptors DT&#8208;C8Cl and DT&#8208;C8BTz with functional haloalkyl chains, in which the halogen atoms could induce noncovalent interactions with heteroatoms like O, S, and Se, etc., thus leading to appropriately manipulated film morphology. Consequently, binary devices based on D18: DT&#8208;C8Cl achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.40%. The higher PCE of D18: DT&#8208;C8Cl could be attributed to the enhanced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, improved charge transport, and reduced recombination losses. In addition, the noncovalent interactions induced by haloalkyl chains could effectively suppress unfavorable morphology evolutions and thereby reduce trap density of states, leading to improved thermal and storage stability. Overall, our findings reveal that the rational design of asymmetric acceptors with functional haloalkyl chains is a novel and powerful strategy for simultaneously enhancing the efficiency and stability of OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Approach for Z&#8208;Vinyl Fluorides by Hydrofluorination of Alkynes bearing SF4 and SF5 Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and stereoselective approach for the synthesis of Z&#8208;vinyl fluorides from alkynes containing unexplored SF5 and SF4 groups has been reported. TBAF&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O exhibits high compatibility, allowing for easy incorporation of fluoride into SF5 and SF4 alkynes at room temperature. Competitive experiments and DFT calculations verify that SF5 alkynes react much faster than SF4 alkynes.







Abstract
The synthesis of vinyl fluorides plays a crucial role in various scientific disciplines, including pharmaceutical and materials sciences. Herein, we present a direct and stereoselective hydrofluorination method for the synthesis of Z isomers of vinyl fluorides from alkynes containing unexplored SF5 and SF4 groups. Our strategy employed tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) as a fluorine source. It demonstrates high compatibility with aryls, biaryls, heteroaryls, and tert&#8208;alkyl groups, allowing facile incorporation of SF5 and SF4 groups across the triple bond without any transition&#8208;metal catalysts. This approach avoids the potential decomposition of the SF5 or SF4 units via coordination with transition metals or acidic protic sources. Remarkably, this transformation proceeded at room temperature without any additional additives, providing the Z isomer of vinyl fluorides in excellent yield and high selectivity. The presence of a water molecule as a hydrate in TBAF is essential for efficient conversion. This methodology opens new avenues for the synthesis of enchanting SF5&#8208; and SF4&#8208;containing fluorinated vinylic scaffolds, thereby providing advanced opportunities for novel drug discovery and fluorinated polymers.

         <title>Ultrastable, Superrobust, and Recyclable Supramolecular Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of a noncovalent cooperative network (NCoN) to strengthen and stabilize the supramolecular polymer network is reported. The superb multivalence cooperation makes the hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinks in the NCoN display a covalent crosslinking effect, resulting in a superroubst and recyclable supramolecular polymer network with remarkably high resistance to heat up to 120&#8201;&#176;C, water soaking, and H&#8208;bond&#8208;destructive solvents.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs), crosslinked by noncovalent bonds, have emerged as reorganizable and recyclable polymeric materials with unique functionality. However, poor stability is an imperative challenge faced by SPNs, because SPNs are susceptible to heat, water, and/or solvents due to the dynamic and reversible nature of noncovalent bonds. Herein, the design of a noncovalent cooperative network (NCoN) to simultaneously stabilize and reinforce SPNs is reported, resulting in an ultrastable, superrobust, and recyclable SPN. The NCoN is constructed by multiplying the H&#8208;bonding sites and tuning the conformation/geometry of the H&#8208;bonding segment to optimize the multivalence cooperativity of H&#8208;bonds. The rationally designed H&#8208;bonding segment with high conformational compliance favors the formation of tightly packed H&#8208;bond arrays comprising higher&#8208;density and stronger H&#8208;bonds. Consequently, the H&#8208;bonded crosslinks in the NCoN display a covalent crosslinking effect but retain on&#8208;demand dynamics and reversibility. The resultant ultrastable SPN not only displays remarkable resistance to heat up to 120&#8201;&#176;C, water soaking, and a broad spectrum of solvents, but also possesses a superhigh true stress at break (1.1&#8197;GPa) and an ultrahigh toughness (406&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3). Despite the covalent&#8208;network&#8208;like stability, the SPN is recyclable through activating its reversibility in a high&#8208;polarity solvent heated to a threshold temperature.

         <title>Senolysis Enabled by Senescent Cell&#8208;Sensitive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal chemistry&#8208;based senolytic strategy for the selective treatment of senescent cells has been developed. We demonstrate that a dihydrotetrazine&#8208;galactose conjugate (Gal&#8208;Tz) can be selectively converted into the free tetrazine by senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase. This strategy can be harnessed for bioorthogonal imaging as well as prodrug delivery and activation in senescent cancer cells.







Abstract
Although the clearance of senescent cells has been proven to slow down the aging process and promote anti&#8208;cancer chemotherapy, the development of senolytics remains challenging. Herein, we report a senolytic strategy enabled by senescent cell&#8208;sensitive bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation. Our design is based on linking dihydrotetrazine (Tz) to a galactose (Gal) moiety that serves both as a recognition moiety for senescence&#8208;associated &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and a caging group for the control of tetrazine activity. Gal&#8208;Tz enables efficient click&#8208;release of a fluorescent hemicyanine and doxorubicin from a trans&#8208;cyclooctene&#8208;caged prodrug to detect and eliminate senescent HeLa and A549 cells over non&#8208;senescent counterparts with a 16.44 senolytic index. Furthermore, we leverage the strategy for the selective activation and delivery of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as senolytics. PROTAC prodrug TCO&#8208;ARV&#8208;771 can be selectively activated by Gal&#8208;Tz and delivered into senescent HeLa and A549 cells to induce the degradation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4. Senolytic PROTACs may offer an efficient way for intervention on cell senescence thanks to their unique capacity to degrade target proteins in a sub&#8208;stoichiometric and catalytic fashion. The results of this study establish the bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation approach as a viable strategy for selective removal of senescent cells.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered W18O49&#8722;x Nanobrush with a Suitable Band Structure for Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush with a band gap of 2.79&#8197;eV was prepared by a solvothermal method for efficient sonodynamic therapy. Abundant oxygen vacancies were introduced into the nanobrush through a one&#8208;step thermal reduction reaction and can serve as charge traps to inhibit e&#8722;&#8208;h+ recombination. The almost ideal band structures of the nanobrush endow it with the potential to simultaneously produce 1O2, &#8901;O2&#8722;, and &#8901;OH under ultrasound irradiation.







Abstract
With the rapid development of external minimally invasive or noninvasive therapeutic modalities, ultrasound&#8208;based sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a new alternative for treating deep tumors. However, inadequate sonosensitizer efficiency and poor biosecurity limit clinical applications. In this study, we prepared an oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush with a band gap of 2.79&#8197;eV for highly efficient SDT using a simple solvothermal method. The suitable band structures of the W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush endows it with the potential to simultaneously produce singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide anions (&#8901;O2&#8722;), and hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) under ultrasound irradiation. Additionally, abundant oxygen vacancies that serve as further charge traps that inhibit electron&#8208;hole recombination are incidentally introduced through one&#8208;step thermal reduction. Collectively, the in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered W18O49&#8722;x nanobrush delivers highly efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) for SDT in a very biosafe manner. Overall, this study provides a new avenue for discovering and designing inorganic nanosonosensitizers with enhanced therapeutic efficiencies for use in SDT.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics with a Membrane&#8208;Embedded Electron Shuttle Mimics the Bioenergy Anabolism of Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced bioenergy anabolism is achieved by synthetic electron shuttle&#8208;activated transmembrane chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions in a mitochondria&#8208;like nanoarchitecture. It offers a new and efficient route to realize artificial bioenergy production, holding great promise in ATP&#8208;powered bioapplications.







Abstract
Enhanced bioenergy anabolism through transmembrane redox reactions in artificial systems remains a great challenge. Here, we explore synthetic electron shuttle to activate transmembrane chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions in a mitochondria&#8208;like nanoarchitecture for augmenting bioenergy anabolism. In this nanoarchitecture, a dendritic mesoporous silica microparticle as inner compartment possesses higher load capacity of NADH as proton source and allows faster mass transfer. In addition, the outer compartment ATP synthase&#8208;reconstituted proteoliposomes. Like natural enzymes in the mitochondrion respiratory chain, a small synthetic electron shuttle embedded in the lipid bilayer facilely mediates transmembrane redox reactions to convert NADH into NAD+ and a proton. These facilitate an enhanced outward proton gradient to drive ATP synthase to rotate for catalytic ATP synthesis with improved performance in a sustainable manner. This work opens a new avenue to achieve enhanced bioenergy anabolism by utilizing a synthetic electron shuttle and tuning inner nanostructures, holding great promise in wide&#8208;range ATP&#8208;powered bioapplications.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Diaza[7]helicenes with Dual Negatively Curved Heptagons: Extensive Synthesis and Spontaneous Resolution into Strippable Homochiral Lamellae with Helical Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinctive &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes with fused negative curvature and helicity have been facilely synthesized by twofold heptagonal cyclization. In addition to intriguing features arising from the dynamic chiral skeleton, the molecular packing of these curved helicenes can be modulated by the periphery groups and the extension of the skeleton. This leads to the formation of crystals with 31 helices and also homochiral nanosheets upon exfoliation.







Abstract
We report a unique category of &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes with double negative curvatures. This is achieved by two&#8208;fold regioselective heptagonal cyclization of the oligoarylene&#8208;carbazole precursors through either intramolecular C&#8722;H arylation or Scholl reaction. The fusion of two heptagonal rings in the helical skeleton dramatically increases the intramolecular strain and forces the two terminal carbazole moieties to stack in a compressed fashion. The presence of the deformable negatively curved heptagonal rings endows the resulting diaza[7]helicenes with dynamic chiral skeletons, aggregation&#8208;induced emission feature and relatively low racemization barrier of ca. 25.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Further &#960;&#8208;extension on the carbazole moieties subsequently leads to a more sophisticated C2&#8208;symmetric homochiral triple helicene. Notably, these &#960;&#8208;extended diaza[7]helicenes show structure&#8208;dependent stacking upon crystallization, switching from heterochiral packing to intra&#8208;layer homochiral stacking. Interestingly, the C2&#8208;symmetric triple helicene molecules spontaneously resolve into a homochiral lamellar structure with 31 helix symmetry. Upon ultrasonication in a nonsolvent, the crystals can be readily exfoliated into large&#8208;area ultrathin nanosheets with height of ca. 4.4&#8197;nm corresponding to two layers of stacked triple helicene molecules and relatively thicker nanosheets constituted by even&#8208;numbered molecular lamellae. Moreover, regular hexagonal thin platelets with size larger than 30&#8197;&#956;m can be readily fabricated by flash aggregation.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Trace Hydroxyl&#8208;Rich Electrolyte Additives for High&#8208;Rate and Stable Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace hydroxyl&#8208;rich electrolyte additives are inspired by frost&#8208;resistant plants, which implements a dual remodeling effect on Zn2+ solvation shell and Zn surface molecules, facilitating long&#8208;term stable and high&#8208;rate Zn&#8208;ion batteries at ultra&#8208;low temperatures.







Abstract
High&#8208;rate and stable Zn&#8208;ion batteries working at low temperatures are highly desirable for practical applications, but are challenged by sluggish kinetics and severe corrosion. Herein, inspired by frost&#8208;resistant plants, we report trace hydroxyl&#8208;rich electrolyte additives that implement a dual remodeling effect for high&#8208;performance low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The additive with high Zn absorbability not only remodels Zn2+ primary solvent shell by alternating H2O molecules, but also forms a shielding layer thus remodeling the Zn surface, which effectively enhances fast Zn2+ de&#8208;solvation reaction kinetics and prohibits Zn anode corrosion. Taking trace &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose (&#945;DG) as a demonstration, the electrolyte obtains a low freezing point of &#8722;55.3&#8201;&#176;C, and the Zn//Zn cell can stably cycle for 2000&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C, with a high cumulative capacity of 5000&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A full battery that stably operates for 10000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C is also demonstrated.

         <title>Lithiophilic Covalent Organic Framework as Anode Coating for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a stable polyimide 2D covalent organic framework (COF), which has abundant lithiophilic quinoxaline and phthalimide units within the 1D channels. The COF can serve as an intermediate layer to guide the uniform electrodeposition of lithium ion, leading to the formation of dense and smooth lithium deposition layer in a cylindrical morphology and steady lithium plating/stripping behaviors.







Abstract
The growth of disorganized lithium dendrites and weak solid electrolyte interphase greatly impede the practical application of lithium metal batteries. Herein, we designed and synthesized a new kind of stable polyimide covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which have a high density of well&#8208;aligned lithiophilic quinoxaline and phthalimide units anchored within the uniform one&#8208;dimensional channels. The COFs can serve as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase on lithium metal anode, effectively guiding the uniform deposition of lithium ions and inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites. The unsymmetrical Li||COF&#8722;Cu battery exhibits a Coulombic efficiency of 99&#8201;% at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which can be well retained up to 400&#8197;cycles. Meanwhile, the Li&#8208;COF||LFP full cell shows a Coulombic efficiency over 99&#8201;% at a charge of 0.3&#8197;C. And its capacity can be well maintained up to 91&#8201;% even after 150&#8197;cycles. Therefore, the significant electrochemical cycling stability illustrates the feasibility of employing COFs in solving the disordered deposition of lithium ions in lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Rapid Synthesis of MOF&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Ni Catalyst for CO2 Electroreduction at Ampere&#8208;Level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and facile microwave&#8208;assisted rapid pyrolysis method is developed to afford carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts within 3&#8197;min. Specifically, the optimized single&#8208;atom Ni implanted N&#8208;doped carbon materials (Ni1&#8722;N&#8722;C) based on a metal&#8211;organic framework precursor showcases a tremendous CO partial current density of 1.06&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a CO Faradaic efficiency up to 96&#8201;% in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted tremendous interest in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the common electric heating techniques to produce carbon&#8208;based SACs usually suffer from prolonged heating time and tedious operations. Herein, a general and facile microwave&#8208;assisted rapid pyrolysis method is developed to afford carbon&#8208;based SACs within 3&#8197;min without inert gas protection. The obtained carbon&#8208;based SACs present high porosity and comparable carbonization degree to those obtained by electric heating techniques. Specifically, the single&#8208;atom Ni implanted N&#8208;doped carbon (Ni1&#8722;N&#8722;C) derived from a Ni&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8) exhibits remarkable CO Faradaic efficiency (96&#8201;%) with a substantial CO partial current density (jCO) up to 1.06&#8197;A/cm2 in CO2 electroreduction, far superior to the counterpart obtained by traditional pyrolysis with electric heating. Mechanism investigations reveal that the resulting Ni1&#8722;N&#8722;C presents abundant defective sites and mesoporous structure, greatly facilitating CO2 adsorption and mass transfer. This work establishes a versatile approach to rapid and large&#8208;scale synthesis of SACs as well as other carbon&#8208;based materials for efficient catalysis.

Herein, a general and facile microwave-assisted rapid pyrolysis method is developed to afford carbon-based SACs within 3&#8197;min without inert gas protection. The obtained carbon-based SACs present high porosity and comparable carbonization degree to those obtained by electric heating techniques. Specifically, the single-atom Ni implanted N-doped carbon (Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;N&#8722;C) derived from a Ni-doped metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni-ZIF-8) exhibits remarkable CO Faradaic efficiency (96&#8201;%) with a substantial CO partial current density (j&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt;) up to 1.06&#8197;A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction, far superior to the counterpart obtained by traditional pyrolysis with electric heating. Mechanism investigations reveal that the resulting Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;N&#8722;C presents abundant defective sites and mesoporous structure, greatly facilitating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and mass transfer. This work establishes a versatile approach to rapid and large-scale synthesis of SACs as well as other carbon-based materials for efficient catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Shape Change of Liquid Crystal Polymer Based on An Order&#8208;Order Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monodomain liquid crystal polymer exhibits dynamic shape changes, undergoing extension first and then contraction during both heating and cooling. This behavior is driven by a dynamic order&#8208;order smectic C to smectic A phase transition.







Abstract
Liquid crystal actuators conventionally undergo shape changes across an order&#8208;disorder phase transition between liquid crystal (LC) and isotropic phases. In this study, we introduce an innovative Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) actuator harnessing an order&#8208;order LC phase transition mechanism. The LCP film is easily stretchable within the LC phase, facilitated by the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of phenyl groups serving as robust physical crosslinking points, and thereby transforms to a stable monodomain structure. The resultant monodomain LCP actuator shows a distinctive reversible dynamic shape change, exhibiting extension followed by contraction along the LC director on cooling. The extension is propelled by the reversible smectic C to smectic A phase transition, and the contraction is attributed to the re&#8208;entry to the smectic C phase from smectic A phase. Thermal annealing temperature determines this peculiar dynamic shape change, which occurs during both heating and cooling processes. This pivotal attribute finds manifestation in gripper and flower&#8208;shaped actuators, adeptly executing grabbing and releasing as well as blooming and closure motions within a single thermal stimulation. In essence, our study introduces an innovative approach to the realm of LCP actuators, ushering in a new avenue for the design and fabrication of versatile and dynamically responsive LCP actuators.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Counterion Strategy toward Organic Cocrystal Engineering for Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Conversion and Solar&#8208;Driven Water Evaporation</title>

Anion&#8208;counterion strategy is proposed to construct charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals synthesized by one&#8208;step mechanochemical method for high&#8208;efficiency photo&#8208;thermal conversion and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation.

Abstract
An anion&#8208;counterion strategy is proposed to construct organic mono&#8208;radical charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals for near&#8208;infrared photothermal conversion and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation. Ionic compounds with halogen anions as the counterions serve as electron donors, providing the necessary electrons for efficient charge transfer with unchanged skeleton atoms and structures as well as the broad red&#8208;shifted absorption (200&#8211;2000&#8197;nm) and unprecedented photothermal conversion efficiency (~90.5&#8201;%@808&#8197;nm) for the cocrystals. Based on these cocrystals, an excellent solar&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation rate up to 6.1&#177;1.1&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 under 1&#8197;sun is recorded due to the comprehensive evaporation effect from the cocrystal loading in polyurethane foams and chimney addition, such performance is superior to the reported results on charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals or other materials for solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation. This prototype exhibits the great potential of cocrystals prepared by the one&#8208;step mechanochemistry method in practical large&#8208;scale seawater desalination applications.

         <dc:description>Herein, we have synthesized multifunctionalized 2&#8208;oxa&#8208;3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, which are considered potential bioisosteres for meta&#8208;substituted arenes, through Eu(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed formal dipolar [4&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with nitrones. This methodology represents the initial instance of fabricating bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes adorned with multiple heteroatoms. The protocol exhibits both mild reaction conditions and a good tolerance for various functional groups. Computational density functional theory calculations support that the reaction mechanism likely involves a nucleophilic addition of nitrones to bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, succeeded by an intramolecular cyclization. The synthetic utility of this novel protocol has been demonstrated in the concise synthesis of the analogue of Rupatadine.</dc:description>

         <title>A Programmable DNAzyme for the Sensitive Detection of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acids in biofluids are emerging biomarkers for the molecular diagnostics of diseases, but their clinical use has been hindered by the lack of sensitive detection assays. Herein, we report the development of a sensitive nucleic acid detection assay named SPOT (sensitive loop&#8208;initiated DNAzyme biosensor for nucleic acid detection) by rationally designing a catalytic DNAzyme of endonuclease capability into a unified one&#8208;stranded allosteric biosensor. SPOT is activated once a nucleic acid target of a specific sequence binds to its allosteric module to enable continuous cleavage of molecular reporters. SPOT provides a highly robust platform for sensitive, convenient and cost&#8208;effective detection of low&#8208;abundance nucleic acids. For clinical validation, we demonstrated that SPOT could detect serum miRNAs for the diagnostics of breast cancer, gastric cancer and prostate cancer. Furthermore, SPOT exhibits potent detection performance over SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA from clinical swabs with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally, SPOT is compatible with point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing modalities such as lateral flow assays. Hence, we envision that SPOT may serve as a robust assay for the sensitive detection of a variety of nucleic acid targets enabling molecular diagnostics in clinics.</dc:description>

         <title>Diphenylphoshinylhydroxylamine (DPPH) Affords Late&#8208;Stage S&#8208;Imination To Access Free&#8208;NH Sulfilimines and Sulfoximines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfilimines, as potential aza&#8208;isosteres of sulfoxides, are valued as building blocks, auxiliaries, ligands, bioconjugation handles, and as precursors to versatile S(VI) scaffolds including sulfoximines and sulfondiimines. Here, we report a thioether imination methodology that exploits O&#8208;(diphenylphosphinyl)hydroxyl amine (DPPH). Under mild, metal&#8208;free, and biomolecule&#8208;compatible conditions, DPPH enables late&#8208;stage S&#8208;imination on peptides, natural products, and a clinically trialled drug, and shows both excellent chemoselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. This methodological report is extended to an efficient and high&#8208;yielding one&#8208;pot reaction for accessing free&#8208;NH sulfoximines with diverse substrates including ones of potential clinical importance. In the presence of a rhodium catalyst, sulfoxides are S&#8208;iminated in higher yields to afford free&#8208;NH sulfoximines. S&#8208;imination was validated on an oxidatively delicate amatoxin to give sulfilimine and sulfoximine congeners. Interestingly, these new sulfilimine and sulfoximine&#8208;amatoxins show cytotoxicity. This is further extended to create sulfilimine and sulfoximine&#8208;Fulvestrant and Buthionine analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>The Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional Hexagonal Boron Nitride as the Reinforcing Phase of Polymer&#8208;Based Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Powdery hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), as an important material for electrochemical energy storage, has been typically synthesized in bulk and one/two&#8208;dimensional (1/2D) nanostructured morphologies. However, until now, no method has been developed to synthesize powdery three&#8208;dimensional (3D) h&#8208;BN. This work introduces a novel NaCl&#8208;glucose&#8208;assisted strategy to synthesize micron&#8208;sized 3D h&#8208;BN with a honeycomb&#8208;like structure and its proposed formation mechanism. We propose that NaCl acts as the template of 3D structure and promotes the nitridation reaction by adsorbing NH3. Glucose facilitates the homogenous coating of boric acid onto the NaCl surface via functionalizing the NaCl surface. During the nitridation reaction, boron oxides (BO4 and BO3) form from a dehydration reaction of boric acid, which is then reduced to O2&#8208;B&#8208;N and O&#8208;B&#8208;N2 intermediates before finally being reduced to BN3 by NH3. When incorporated into polyethylene oxide&#8208;based electrolytes for Li metal batteries, 5 wt% of 3D h&#8208;BN significantly enhances ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. Consequently, this composite electrolyte demonstrates superior electrochemical stability. It delivers 300 h of stable cycles in the Li//Li cell at 0.1 mA cm&#8208;2 and retains 89 % of discharge capacity (138.9 mAh g&#8208;1) after 100 cycles at 1 C in the LFP//Li full cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Pulse&#160;Electrolysis Turns on CO2 Methanation through N&#8208;Confused Cupric Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Breaking the D4h symmetry in the square&#8208;planar M&#8208;N4 configuration of macrocycle molecular catalysts has witnessed enhanced electrocatalytic activity, but at the expense of electrochemical stability. Herein, we hypothesize that the lability of the active Cu&#8208;N3 motifs in the N&#8208;confused copper (II) tetraphenylporphyrin (CuNCP) could be overcome by applying pulsed potential electrolysis (PPE) during electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. We find that applying PPE can indeed enhance the CH4 selectivity on CuNCP by 3 folds to reach the partial current density of 170 mA cm&#8208;2 at &gt;60% Faradaic efficiency (FE) in flow cell. However, combined ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), infrared (IR), Raman, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) characterizations reveal that, in a prolonged time scale, the decomplexation of CuNCP is unavoidable, and the promoted water dissociation under high anodic bias with lowered pH and enriched protons facilitates successive hydrogenation of *CO on the irreversibly reduced Cu nanoparticles, leading to the improved CH4 selectivity. As a key note, this study signifies the adaption of electrolytic protocol to the catalyst structure for tailoring local chemical environment towards efficient CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Ion&#8208;Coordinated Bipolar Organodichalcogenide Cathodes Enabling High&#8208;Energy and Durable Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bipolar organic cathode materials (OCMs) implementing cation/anion storage mechanisms are promising for high&#8208;energy aqueous Zn batteries (AZBs). However, conventional organic functional group active sites in OCMs usually fail to sufficiently unlock the high&#8208;voltage/capacity merits. Herein, we initially report dynamically ion&#8208;coordinated bipolar OCMs as cathodes with chalcogen active sites to solve this issue. Unlike conventional organic functional groups, chalcogens bonded with conjugated group undergo multielectron&#8208;involved positive&#8208;valence oxidation and negative&#8208;valence reduction, affording higher redox potentials and reversible capacities. With phenyl diselenide (PhSe&#8208;SePh, PDSe) as a proof of concept, it exhibits a conversion pathway from (PhSe)&#8208; to (PhSe&#8208;SePh)0 and then to (PhSe)+ as unveiled by characterization and theoretical simulation, where the diselenide bonds are periodically broken and healed, dynamically coordinating with ions (Zn2+ and OTF&#8208;). When confined into ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK&#8208;3), the dissolution of PDSe intermediates is greatly inhibited to obtain an ultralong lifespan without voltage/capacity compromise. The PDSe/CMK&#8208;3||Zn batteries display high reversibility capacity (621.4 mAh gPDSe&#8208;1), distinct discharge plateau (up to 1.4 V), high energy density (578.3 Wh kgPDSe&#8208;1), and ultralong lifespan (12 000 cycles) at 10 A g&#8208;1, far outperforming conventional bipolar OCMs. This work sheds new light on conversion&#8208;type active site engineering for high&#8208;voltage/capacity bipolar OCMs towards high&#8208;energy AZBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Broken Ru Nanoparticles with Parasitic Ru&#8211;Co Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atoms Overcome the Volmer Step of Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts are crucial for enhancing atomic efficiency and promoting the commercialization of fuel cells, but addressing the sluggish kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline media and achieving facile dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom site generation remains formidable challenges. Here, we break the local symmetry of ultra&#8208;small Ru nanoparticles by embedding Co single atoms which results in the release of Ru single atoms from Ru nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (Co1Ru1,n/rGO). In situ operando spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the oxygen&#8208;affine Co atom disrupts the symmetry of ultra&#8208;small Ru nanoparticles, resulting in parasitic Ru and Co dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom within Ru nanoparticles. The interaction between Ru single atoms and nanoparticles forms effective active centers. The parasitism of Co atoms modulates the adsorption of OH intermediates on Ru active sites, accelerating HOR kinetics through faster formation of *H2O. As anticipated, Co1Ru1,n/rGO exhibits ultrahigh mass activity (7.68 A mgRu&#8208;1) at 50 mV and exchange current density (0.68 mA cm&#8208;2), which are 6 and 7 times higher than those of Ru/rGO, respectively. Notably, it also displays exceptional durability surpassing that of commercial Pt catalysts. This investigation provides valuable insights into hybrid multi&#8208;single&#8208;atom and metal nanoparticle catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Substantial Impact of Built&#8208;in Electric Field and Electrode Potential on the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction of Ru&#8208;CoP Urchin Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although great efforts on the delicate construction of a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) to modify the electronic properties of active sites have been conducted, the substantial impact of BIEF coupled with electrode potential on the electrochemical reactions has not been clearly investigated. Herein, we designed an alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst composed of heterogeneous Ru&#8208;CoP urchin arrays on carbon cloth (Ru&#8208;CoP/CC) with a strong BIEF with the guidance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Impressively, despite its unsatisfactory activity at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 (overpotential of 44 mV), Ru&#8208;CoP/CC exhibited better activity (357 mV) than the benchmark Pt/C catalyst (505 mV) at 1 A cm&#8208;2. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that strong hydrogen adsorption on the interfacial Ru atoms created a high energy barrier for hydrogen desorption and spillover, resulting in unsatisfactory activity at low current densities. However, as the electrode potential became more negative (i.e., the current density increased), the barrier for hydrogen spillover from the interfacial Ru to the Co site, which had near&#8208;zero hydrogen adsorption energy, significantly decreased, thus greatly accelerating the whole alkaline HER process. This explains why the activity of Ru&#8208;CoP is relatively susceptible to the electrode potential compared to Pt/C.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructing Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network for Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in acidic conditions is a pressing demand for proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis. Manipulating proton character at the electrified interface, as the crux of all proton&#8208;coupled electrochemical reactions, is highly desirable but elusive. Herein we present a promising protocol, which reconstruct a connected hydrogen&#8208;bond network beween the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface by coupling hydrophilic units to boost acidic OER activity. Modelling on N&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon&#8208;layer clothed Mn&#8208;doped&#8208;Co3O4 (Mn&#8208;Co3O4@CN), we unravel that the hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between CN units and H2O molecule not only drags the free water to enrich the surface of Mn&#8208;Co3O4 but also serves as a channel to promote the dehydrogenation process. Meanwhile, the modulated local charge of the Co sites from CN units/Mn dopant lowers the OER barrier. Therefore, Mn&#8208;Co3O4@CN surpasses RuO2 at high current density (100 mA cm&#8208;2 @ ~538 mV).</dc:description>

         <title>Nanocatalytic Anti&#8208;Tumor Immune Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, we discuss how nanocatalysts specifically regulate anti&#8208;tumor immunity through the tumor microenvironment, and the key is to use unique components or redox status in solid tumors to initiate catalytic reactions for selective release of immune regulators at the tumor site. The biological mechanism of nanocatalytic reaction in regulating antitumor immunity was discussed in detail and the prospects were prospected.







Abstract
Immunotherapy has brought a new dawn for human being to defeat cancer. Although existing immunotherapy regimens (CAR&#8208;T, etc.) have made breakthroughs in the treatments of hematological cancer and few solid tumors such as melanoma, the therapeutic efficacy on most solid tumors is still far from being satisfactory. In recent years, the researches on tumor immunotherapy based on nanocatalytic materials are under rapid development, and significant progresses have been made. Nanocatalytic medicine has been demonstrated to be capable of overcoming the limitations of current clinicnal treatments by using toxic chemodrugs, and exhibits highly attractive advantages over traditional therapies, such as the enhanced and sustained therapeutic efficacy based on the durable catalytic activity, remarkably reduced harmful side&#8208;effects without using traditional toxic chemodrugs, and so on. Most recently, nanocatalytic medicine has been introduced in the immune&#8208;regulation for disease treatments, especially, in the immunoactivation for tumor therapies. This article presents the most recent progresses in immune&#8208;response activations by nanocatalytic medicine&#8208;initiated chemical reactions for tumor immunotherapy, and elucidates the mechanism of nanocatalytic medicines in regulating anti&#8208;tumor immunity. By reviewing the current research progress in the emerging field, this review will further highlight the great potential and broad prospects of nanocatalysis&#8208;based anti&#8208;tumor immune&#8208;therapeutics.

         <title>Intrinsic Solubilization of Lithium Nitrate in Ester Electrolyte by Multivalent Low&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Penalty Design for Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We correlated the fundamental role of entropy with the limited LiNO3 solubility in ester electrolytes and proposed a new multivalent low&#8208;entropy&#8208;penalty design to achieve intrinsic LiNO3 solubilization. Linear esters with higher multivalency leads to more stable solvation structures and a monotonic increase in LiNO3 solubility of up to 0.8&#8197;M. Our findings offer new fundamental insights into the LiNO3 solvation chemistry.







Abstract
LiNO3 is a remarkable additive that can dramatically enhance the stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes at lithium metal anodes. However, it has long been constrained by its incompatibility with commercially used ester electrolytes. Herein, we correlated the fundamental role of entropy with the limited LiNO3 solubility and proposed a new low&#8208;entropy&#8208;penalty design that achieves high intrinsic LiNO3 solubility in ester solvents by employing multivalent linear esters. This strategy is conceptually different from the conventional enthalpic methods that relies on extrinsic high&#8208;polarity carriers. In this way, LiNO3 can directly interact with the primary ester solvents and fundamentally alters the electrolyte properties, resulting in substantial improvements in lithium&#8208;metal batteries with high Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability. This work illustrates the significance of regulating the solvation entropy for high&#8208;performance electrolyte design.

         <title>Coupling Ferricyanide/Ferrocyanide Redox Mediated Recycling Spent LiFePO4 with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water electrolysis coupling spent LFP&#8208;assisted ferricyanide/ferrocyanide redox reaction realizes energy&#8208;efficient hydrogen production at low electricity costs, while realizing spent LFP materials to value&#8208;added LiOH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and FePO4 for cost&#8208;effective and environment&#8208;friendly recycling of end&#8208;of&#8208;life LFP batteries.







Abstract
Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with thermodynamically more favorable alternative oxidation reactions offers a promising alternative to reduce the energy consumption of hydrogen production. However, questions remain regarding the economic viability of alternative oxidation reactions for industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production. Here, we propose an innovative cost&#8208;effective, environment&#8208;friendly and energy&#8208;efficient strategy for simultaneous recycling of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries and hydrogen production by coupling the spent LFP&#8208;assisted ferricyanide/ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;) redox reaction. The onset potential for the electrooxidation of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; is low at 0.87&#8197;V. Operando Raman and UV/Visible spectroscopy confirm that the presence of LFP in the electrolyte allows for the rapid reduction of [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; to [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;, thereby completing the [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; redox cycle as well as facilitating the conversion of spent LiFePO4 into LiOH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and FePO4. The electrolyzer consumes 3.6&#8197;kWh of electricity per cubic meter of H2 produced at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is 43&#8201;% less than conventional water electrolysis. Additionally, this recycling pathway for spent LFP batteries not only minimizes chemical consumption and prevents secondary pollution but also presents significant economic benefits.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Guangnanmycin A Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant ring strain has to be built up in pursuit of guangnanmycin A, a congener of the anticancer drug lead leinamycin. The challenge was met by liaising ring closing alkyne metathesis with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed redox isomerization. The signature disulfide was introduced by a thia&#8208;Michael addition reaction followed by an unusual thioether&#8208;to&#8208;disulfide swap. In the dense array, however, final oxidation of the primary alcohol was unsuccessful.







Abstract
Guangnanmycin A is a recently discovered congener of the well&#8208;known antitumor drug lead leinamycin; its macrolactam ring, however, is even more strained than that of the parent compound. The first synthetic foray towards this challenging target is reported, which relies on molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed macrocyclization by ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) followed by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed redox isomerization of the propargyl alcohol thus formed; the resulting enone enabled the introduction of the yet missing exo&#8208;methylene group by a modified Peterson olefination. The signature disulfide moiety of guangnanmycin A was installed by strain&#8208;driven thia&#8208;Michael addition followed by conversion of the thioether thus formed into an unsymmetric disulfide with the aid of (methylthio)dimethylsulfonium tetrafluoroborate and MeSSMe. While this sequence furnished racemic guangnanmycin A alcohol in good overall yield, the final oxidation to the corresponding acid failed, most likely because of the exceptional sensitivity of the strained scaffold.

         <title>Helitwistacenes&#8212;Combining Lateral and Longitudinal Helicity Results in Solvent&#8208;Induced Inversion of Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining helicenes with twistacenes, in which the extent of twisting can be tuned, has led to the new family of helitwistacenes. The combination of lateral and longitudinal helicity results in polarity&#8208;induced and twisting&#8208;induced sign inversion of both the electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence signals. This sign inversion could be explained by differences in the relative orientation of the helicene and twistacene moieties.







Abstract
Helicity is expressed differently in ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;fused acenes&#8212;helicenes and twistacenes, respectively. While the extent of helicity is constant in helicenes, it can be tuned in twistacenes, and the handedness of flexible twistacenes is often determined by more rigid helicenes. Here, we combine helicenes with rigid twistacenes consisting of a tunable degree of twisting, forming helitwistacenes. While the X&#8208;ray structures reveal that the connection does not affect the helicity of each moiety, their electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra are strongly affected by the helicity of the twistacene unit, resulting in solvent&#8208;induced sign inversion. ROESY&#8197;NMR and TD&#8208;DFT calculations support this observation, which is explained by differences in the relative orientation of the helicene and twistacene moieties.

While the extent of helicity is constant in helicenes, it can be tuned in twistacenes, and the handedness of flexible twistacenes is often determined by more rigid helicenes. Here, we combine helicenes with rigid twistacenes consisting of a tunable degree of twisting, forming helitwistacenes. While the X-ray structures reveal that the connection does not affect the helicity of each moiety, their electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra are strongly affected by the helicity of the twistacene unit, resulting in solvent-induced sign inversion. ROESY&#8197;NMR and TD-DFT calculations support this observation, which is explained by differences in the relative orientation of the helicene and twistacene moieties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic editing reaction through the tandem BBr3&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening of tertiary cyclic amine, intramolecular C&#8722;H borylation, and Ni&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular B&#8722;Br/C&#8722;Br reductive coupling was developed. This method represents a simple route to construct the fused&#8208;BN&#8208;heterocycles.







Abstract
Skeletal editing of N&#8208;heterocycles has recently received considerable attention, and the introduction of boron atom into heterocycles often results in positive property changes. However, direct enlargement of N&#8208;heterocycles through boron atom insertion is rarely reported in the literature. Here, we report a N&#8208;heterocyclic editing reaction through the combination boron atom insertion and C&#8722;H borylation, accessing the fused&#8208;BN&#8208;heterocycles. The synthetic potential of this chemistry was demonstrated by substrate scope and late&#8208;stage diversification of products.

         <title>Facile Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Assisted Crystallization Modulation for Large&#8208;area High&#8208;quality CsPbI2Br Films and Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile hydrogen bonding&#8208;modulated crystallization strategy is developed to achieve highly&#8208;crystalline, uniform, and large&#8208;area CsPbI2Br films, enabling CsPbI2Br solar cells with record&#8208;high efficiencies of 18.14&#8201;% and 16.46&#8201;% for 0.1&#8197;cm2 and 1&#8197;cm2 active area, respectively. The efficiency of 38.24&#8201;% under indoor illumination suggests its potential in the applications of powering the Internet of Things, etc.







Abstract
The thermally stable inorganic cesium&#8208;based perovskites promise efficient and stable photovoltaics. Unfortunately, the strong ionic bonds lead to uncontrollable rapid crystallization, making it difficult in fabricating large&#8208;area black&#8208;phase film for photovoltaics. Herein, we developed a facile hydrogen&#8208;bonding assisted strategy for modulating the crystallization of CsPbI2Br to achieve uniform large&#8208;area phase&#8208;pure films with much&#8208;reduced defects. The simple addition of methylamine acetate in precursors not only promotes the formation of intermediate phase via hydrogen bonding to circumvent the direct crystallization of CsPbI2Br from ionic precursors but also widens the film processing window, thus enabling to fabricate large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality phase&#8208;pure CsPbI2Br film under benign conditions. Combining with stable dopant&#8208;free poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), the CsPbI2Br solar cells achieve the record&#8208;high efficiencies of 18.14&#8201;% and 16.46&#8201;% for 0.1&#8197;cm2 and 1&#8197;cm2 active area, respectively. The obtained high efficiency of 38.24&#8201;% under 1000&#8197;lux illumination suggests its potential in indoor photovoltaics for powering the Internet of Things, etc.

         <title>Local Water Content in Polymer Gels Measured with Super&#8208;Resolved Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous polymer systems play a key role in many applications and technological innovations. The fluorescence lifetime of a dye provides access to the number of water molecules in its vicinity, allowing the local water content of aqueous polymer networks to be studied with super&#8208;resolved fluorescence imaging. This method was applied to thermoresponsive microgels to study the water content in their swollen and collapsed state.







Abstract
Water molecules play an important role in the structure, function, and dynamics of (bio&#8208;)&#8201;materials. A direct access to the number of water molecules in nanoscopic volumes can thus give new molecular insights into materials and allow for fine&#8208;tuning their properties in sophisticated applications. The determination of the local water content has become possible by the finding that H2O quenches the fluorescence of red&#8208;emitting dyes. Since deuterated water, D2O, does not induce significant fluorescence quenching, fluorescence lifetime measurements performed in different H2O/D2O&#8208;ratios yield the local water concentration. We combined this effect with the recently developed fluorescence lifetime single molecule localization microscopy imaging (FL&#8208;SMLM) in order to nanoscopically determine the local water content in microgels, i.e. soft hydrogel particles consisting of a cross&#8208;linked polymer swollen in water. The change in water content of thermo&#8208;responsive microgels when changing from their swollen state at room temperature to a collapsed state at elevated temperature could be analyzed. A clear decrease in water content was found that was, to our surprise, rather uniform throughout the entire microgel volume. Only a slightly higher water content around the dye was found in the periphery with respect to the center of the swollen microgels.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Species Surface Reconstruction for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Nanocrystal Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly oriented, smooth and nearly defect&#8208;free perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) thin films are obtained by reconstructing perovskite surface with GASCN/NaSCN. This surface reconstruction can repair surface defects of PNC, maintain the integrity of crystal structure, and suppress F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer, thus enabling highly efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes with a peak external quantum efficiency of 24.5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Although colloidal perovskite nanocrystal (PNC) solution has exhibited near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), the luminance would be severely quenched when the PNC solution is assembled into thin films due to the agglomeration and fusion of NCs caused by the exfoliation of surface ligands and non&#8208;radiative F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from small to large particle sizes, which seriously affected the performances of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, we used Guanidine thiocyanate (GASCN) and Sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) to achieve effective CsPbI3 PNC surface reconstruction. Due to the strong coordination ability of these small molecules with the anions and cations on the surface of the PNCs, they can provide strong surface protection against PNC fusion during centrifugal purification process and repair the surface defects of PNCs, so that the original uniform size distribution of PNCs can be maintained and FRET between close&#8208;packed PNC films is effectively suppressed, which allows the emission characteristics of the films to be preserved. As a result, highly oriented, smooth and nearly defect&#8208;free high&#8208;quality PNC thin films are obtained, with PLQY as high as 95.1&#8201;%, far exceeding that of the original film, and corresponding LEDs exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency of 24.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Regulating Crystallinity Mismatch Between Donor and Acceptor to Improve Exciton/Charge Transport in Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach to reduce the crystallinity difference between donor and acceptor has been proposed by incorporating a novel liquid crystal small molecule, BDTPF4&#8208;C6, which balances charge transport and suppresses charge recombination in organic solar cells. Intriguingly, dual F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer was firstly observed between guest molecule and host donor and acceptor, resulting in increased charge generation in ternary blend.







Abstract
Achieving a more balanced charge transport by morphological control is crucial in reducing bimolecular and trap&#8208;assisted recombination and enhancing the critical parameters for efficient organic solar cells (OSCs).

&lt;p&gt;A facile approach to reduce the crystallinity difference between donor and acceptor has been proposed by incorporating a novel liquid crystal small molecule, BDTPF4-C6, which balances charge transport and suppresses charge recombination in organic solar cells. Intriguingly, dual F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer was firstly observed between guest molecule and host donor and acceptor, resulting in increased charge generation in ternary blend.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving a more balanced charge transport by morphological control is crucial in reducing bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination and enhancing the critical parameters for efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). Hence, a facile strategy is proposed to reduce the crystallinity difference between donor and acceptor by incorporating a novel multifunctional liquid crystal small molecule (LCSM) BDTPF4-C6 into the binary blend. BDTPF4-C6 is the first LCSM based on a tetrafluorobenzene unit and features a low liquid crystal phase transition temperature and strong self-assembly ability, conducive to regulating the active layer morphology. When BDTPF4-C6 is introduced as a guest molecule into the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 binary, it exhibits better compatibility with the donor PM6 and primarily resides within the PM6 phase because of the similarity-intermiscibility principle. Moreover, systematic studies revealed that BDTPF4-C6 could be used as a seeding agent for PM6 to enhance its crystallinity, thereby forming a more balanced and favourable charge transport with suppressed charge recombination. Intriguingly, dual F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer was observed between the guest molecule and the host donor and acceptor, resulting in an improved current density. This study demonstrates a facile approach to balance the charge mobilities and offers new insights into boosting the efficiency of single-junction OSCs beyond 20&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Giant Heterometallic Polyoxometalate Nanocluster for Enhanced Brain&#8208;Targeted Glioma Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

A gigantic transition&#8208;metal&#8211;lanthanide co&#8208;encapsulated polyoxometalate cluster {[Ce10Ag6(DMEA)(H2O)27W22O70][B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;TeW9O33]9}288&#8722; featuring 238 metal centers was obtained and used for enhanced brain&#8208;targeted glioma therapy for the first time.







Abstract
Giant heterometallic polyoxometalate (POM) clusters with precise atom structures, flexibly adjustable and abundant active sites are promising for constructing functional nanodrugs. However, current POM drugs are almost vacant in orthotopic brain tumor therapy due to the inability to effectively penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and low drug activity. Here, we designed the largest (3.0&#8197;nm &#215; 6.0&#8197;nm) transition&#8208;metal&#8211;lanthanide co&#8208;encapsulated POM cluster {[Ce10Ag6(DMEA)(H2O)27W22O70][B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;TeW9O33]9}288&#8722; featuring 238 metal centers via synergistic coordination between two geometry&#8208;unrestricted Ce3+ and Ag+ linkers with tungsten&#8208;oxo cluster fragments. This POM was combined with brain&#8208;targeted peptide to prepare a brain&#8208;targeted nanodrug that could efficiently traverse BBB and target glioma cells. The Ag+ active centers in the nanodrug specifically activate reactive oxygen species to regulate the apoptosis pathway of glioma cells with a low half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (5.66&#8197;&#956;M). As the first brain&#8208;targeted POM drug, it efficiently prolongs the survival of orthotopic glioma&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Tuning the Mechanical Properties of 3D&#8208;printed Objects by the RAFT Process: From Chain&#8208;Growth to Step&#8208;Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization of xanthate&#8208;based RAFT agent and vinyl acetate&#8208;based monomer was developed and applied in photoinduced 3D printing, presenting a facile way to tune the mechanical properties of the printed objects.







Abstract
Photoinduced 3D printing based on the reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process has emerged as a robust method for creating diverse functional materials. However, achieving precise control over the mechanical properties of these printed objects remains a critical challenge for practical application. Here, we demonstrated a RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization of a bifunctional xanthate and bifunctional vinyl acetate. Additionally, we demonstrated photoinduced 3D printing through RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization with a tetrafunctional xanthate and a bifunctional vinyl acetate. By adjusting the molar ratio of the components in the printing resins, we finely tuned the polymerization mechanism from step&#8208;growth to chain&#8208;growth. This adjustment resulted in a remarkable range of tunable Young's moduli, ranging from 7.6&#8197;MPa to 997.1&#8197;MPa. Moreover, post&#8208;functionalization and polymer welding of the printed objects with varying mechanical properties opens up a promising way to produce tailor&#8208;made materials with specific and tunable properties.

         <title>HClO&#8208;Mediated Photoelectrochemical Epoxidation of Alkenes with Near 100&#8201;% Conversion Rate and Selectivity by Regulating Lattice Chlorine Cycle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice Cl&#8722; cyclic process of Co2(OH)3Cl was demonstrated to facilitate photoelectrochemical Cl&#8722; oxidative Cl2 generation in a salt electrolyte. The on&#8208;site produced HClO, by reacting Cl2 with H2O, can be a mediator to oxidize various alkenes to generate the corresponding epoxides with conversion ratios and selectivities of almost 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Directional organic transformation via a green, sustainable catalytic reaction has attracted a lot of attention. Herein, we report a photoelectrochemical approach for highly selective epoxidation of alkenes in a salt solution using Co2(OH)3Cl (CoOCl) as a bridge of photo&#8208;generated charge, where the lattice Cl&#8722; of CoOCl can be oxidized to generate HClO by the photo&#8208;generated holes of BiVO4 photoanode and be spontaneously recovered by Cl&#8722; of a salt solution, which then oxidizes the alkenes into the corresponding epoxides. As a result, a series of water&#8208;soluble alkenes, including 4&#8208;vinylbenzenesulfonic acid sodium, 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;propene&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonic acid sodium, and 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;buten&#8208;1&#8208;ol can be epoxidized with near 100&#8201;% conversion rate and selectivity. Through further inserting a MoOx protection layer between BiVO4 and CoOCl, the stability of CoOCl&#8722;MoOx/BiVO4 can be maintained for at least 120&#8197;hours. This work opens an avenue for solar&#8208;driven organic epoxidation with a possibility of on&#8208;site reaction around the abundant ocean.

         <title>Massive Molecular Motion in Crystal Leads to an Unexpected Helical Covalent Polymer in a Solid&#8208;state Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topochemical reactions are attractive due to their greener reaction conditions, and ability to yield unique products. Such reactions are feasible when the reacting groups are pre&#8208;organized in the crystal. We present a crystal that avoids a ready&#8208;to&#8208;react arrangement but reacts after a massive molecular motion leading to an unexpected product. This alerts that one has to be cautious in predicting the topochemical reactions based on crystal packing.







Abstract
We designed a proline&#8208;derived monomer with azide and alkene functional groups to enable topochemical ene&#8208;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) polymerization. In its crystal, the monomer forms supramolecular helices along the &#8216;a&#8217; axis through various non&#8208;covalent interactions. Along the &#8216;c&#8217; axis, the molecules arrange themselves head&#8208;to&#8208;tail in a wave&#8208;like pattern, positioning the azide and alkene groups of adjacent molecules in close proximity and anti&#8208;parallel orientation, complying with Schmidt's criteria for topochemical reaction. This prearranged configuration was expected to facilitate smooth topochemical polymerization, resulting in a 1,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;linked polymer. Upon heating, the monomer underwent TEAC polymerization in a remarkable single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion, but, to our surprise, it yielded an unexpected covalent helical polymer linked by 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazoline units. Remarkably, the crystal avoids the ready&#8208;to&#8208;react arrangement for polymerization, but connects monomer molecules within the supramolecular helix through the cycloaddition of azide and alkene groups, even though they are not in close proximity nor in the expected orientation. This unexpected path, involving a substantial 134&#176; rotation of the alkene group, yields hitherto unknown 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazoline product regiospecifically. This study serves as a cautionary reminder that relying solely on topochemical postulates for predicting reactivity can sometimes be misleading.

Along the &#8216;c&#8217; axis, the molecules arrange themselves head-to-tail in a wave-like pattern, positioning the azide and alkene groups of adjacent molecules in close proximity and anti-parallel orientation, complying with Schmidt's criteria for topochemical reaction. This prearranged configuration was expected to facilitate smooth topochemical polymerization, resulting in a 1,4-triazoline-linked polymer. Upon heating, the monomer underwent TEAC polymerization in a remarkable single-crystal-to-single-crystal fashion, but, to our surprise, it yielded an unexpected covalent helical polymer linked by 1,5-disubstituted triazoline units. Remarkably, the crystal avoids the ready-to-react arrangement for polymerization, but connects monomer molecules within the supramolecular helix through the cycloaddition of azide and alkene groups, even though they are not in close proximity nor in the expected orientation. This unexpected path, involving a substantial 134&#176; rotation of the alkene group, yields hitherto unknown 1,5-disubstituted triazoline product regiospecifically. This study serves as a cautionary reminder that relying solely on topochemical postulates for predicting reactivity can sometimes be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
