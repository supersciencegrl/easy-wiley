      <title>Maximization of Spatial Charge Density: An Approach to Ultrahigh Energy Density of Capacitive Charge Storage</title>
      <dc:description>Capacitive energy storage possesses the advantages of high power density, long lifespan, and good security, but is severely restricted by its low energy density. Inspired by the charge storage mechanism of batteries, we develop a spatial charge density (SCD) maximization strategy to compensate this shortage by densely and neatly packing the ionic charges in capacitive materials. Accordingly, a record high SCD of ~550 C cm&#8722;3  was achieved by balancing the valance and size of charge&#8208;carrier ions and matching the ion sizes with the pore structure of electrode materials, which is nearly five times higher than those of conventional ones (~120 C cm&#8722;3  ). The maximization of SCD was confirmed by Monte Carlo calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy. As a result, a full&#8208;cell supercapacitor was constructed and it delivers an ultrahigh energy density of 165 W h L&#8722;1  at the power density of 150 W L&#8722;1  , and retains 120 W h L&#8722;1  even at 36 kW L&#8722;1  , opening a pathway towards high energy density capacitive energy storages.</dc:description>

      <title>Mixed Anionic and Cationic Redox Chemistry in a Tetrathiomolybdate Amorphous Coordination Framework</title>
      <dc:description>We report the electrochemistry of a hitherto unexplored Na2MoS4  phase as conversion electrode material for Na&#8208; and Li&#8208;cation reversible storage. The material adopts an amorphous coordination polymer structure, with mixed Mo and S valences. Ex&#8208;situ XPS and in&#8208;situ XRD analysis reveal a complex interplay between Mo and S redox, while excluding the formation of free sulfur, lithium sulfide or other crystalline phases. Na2MoS4  behaves as a mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor, with electronic conductivity of 6.1 &#215; 10  &#8208;4  S cm  &#8208;1  , that allowed the use of this material without any conductive carbon in an electrochemical cell. A reversible capacity of 500 mAh g  &#8208;1  is attained corresponding to 5&#8208;electron redox exchange, with the end&#8208;member reaching from Na&lt;1MoS4  to Na&gt;5MoS4  . This study not only emphasizes on the excellent charge storage performances of Na2MoS4  for Li or Na batteries, but also enriches the emerging library and knowledge of sulfide phases with mixed anionic and cationic redox.</dc:description>

      <title>Core@Satellite Janus Nanomotors with pH&#8208;Responsive Multi&#8208;Phoretic Propulsion</title>
      <dc:description>We report core@satellite Janus mesoporous silica&#8211;Pt@Au (JMPA) nanomotors that are capable of pH&#8208;responsive multi&#8208;phoretic propulsion. The JMPA nanomotors first undergo self&#8208;diffusiophoretic propulsion in 3.0% H2O2 due to the isolated status between Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and PtNPs layer. Then the weak acidity of H2O2 can trigger the disassembly and reassembly of AuNPs, resulting in the Janus distribution of large AuNPs aggregates. Such reconstruction of JMPA leads to the contact between PtNPs and AuNPs aggregates, thus tailoring the propulsion mechanism to self&#8208;electrophoresis. The asymmetric and aggregated AuNPs also enable the generation of thermal gradient under laser irradiation, which propels the JMPA nanomotors by self&#8208;thermophoresis. Such multi&#8208;phoretic propulsion offers considerable promise for developing advanced nanomachines with a stimuli&#8208;responsive switch of propulsion modes in biomedical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrochromic CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
      <dc:description>Hydrochromic materials that can reversibly change color upon water treatment have attracted much attention due to their potential applications in diverse fields. Here, for the first time, we report that space&#8208;confined CsPbBr  3  &#160;nanocrystals (NCs) are hydrochromic. When CsPbBr  3  &#160;NCs are loaded into a porous matrix, reversible transition between luminescent CsPbBr  3  &#160;and non&#8208;luminescent CsPb  2  Br  5  &#160;can be achieved upon the exposure/removal of water. The potential applications of hydrochromic CsPbBr  3  &#160;NCs in anti&#8208;counterfeiting are demonstrated by using CsPbBr  3  &#160;NCs@mesoporous silica nanospheres (around 100 nm) as the starting material. Due to the small particle size and negatively charged surface, the as&#8208;prepared particles can be laser&#8208;jet printed with high precision and high speed. We demonstrate the excellent stability over repeated transformation cycles without color fade. This new discovery may not only deepen the understanding of CsPbX  3  , but also open a new way to design CsPbX  3  &#160;materials for new applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Covalent Organic Framework for Improving Near&#8208;Infrared Light Induced Fluorescence Imaging through Two&#8208;Photon Induction</title>
      <dc:description>
A new image: A benzothiadiazole&#8208;based covalent organic framework is reported to promote two&#8208;photon induction and to overcome the aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching of the chromophores. The design improves upon current near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon induced fluorescence imaging techniques.







Abstract
Fluorescent materials exhibiting two&#8208;photon induction (TPI) are used for nonlinear optics, bioimaging, and phototherapy. Polymerizations of molecular chromophores to form &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures were hindered by the lack of long&#8208;range ordering in the structure and strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between the chromophores. Reported here is the rational design of a benzothiadiazole&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) for promoting TPI and obtaining efficient two&#8208;photon induced fluorescence emissions. Characterization and spectroscopic data revealed that the enhancement in TPI performance is attributed to the donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor configuration and regular intervals of the chromophores, the large &#960;&#8208;conjugation domain, and the long&#8208;range order of COF crystals. The crystalline structure of TPI&#8208;COF attenuates the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between the layers, and overcomes aggregation&#8208;caused emission quenching of the chromophores for improving near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon induced fluorescence imaging.

      <title>Crosstalk&#8208;Free Patterning of Cooperative&#8208;Thermoresponse Images by the Synergy of the AIEgen with the Liquid Crystal</title>
      <dc:description>
Cooperation without talking: An AIEgen/liquid crystal (LC) system with unique synergistic interactions was designed to pattern noninterference images (holographic and fluorescent) with unprecedented cooperative thermoresponse. The AIEgen's fluorescence intensity is controlled by the LC, while the LC's phase transition is in turn promoted by the AIEgen.







Abstract
Patterning multiple images within a single element without crosstalk can significantly increase the information capacity and security, but it is challenging to enable the response capability in each image. Now, the patterning of crosstalk&#8208;free yet cooperative&#8208;thermoresponse images (holographic and fluorescent images) is successfully achieved by designing a liquid crystal (LC)/AIEgen system with a unique synergy. The AIEgen's fluorescence intensity is controlled by the LC, while the LC's phase transition is in turn promoted by the AIEgen. The fluorescent image contrast is significantly boosted by efficient energy transfer (&#934;ET: 96&#8201;%) from the LC to the AIEgen. The AIEgen's photocyclization for fluorescent patterning occurs in a zero&#8208;order kinetic manner and can be completed within several minutes when assisted by the LC. The photocyclization conversion is quantitatively dependent on the aggregation size: &#945;&#8764;exp(&#8208;d), and able to reach as high as 98&#8201;%.

      <dc:description>
Highly stable coordination cages with trinuclear zirconium vertices and flexible carboxyl&#8208;decorated tetraphenylethylene (TPE) spacers were formed by self&#8208;assembly.

Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of highly stable zirconium(IV)&#8208;based coordination cages with aggregation induced emission (AIE) molecular rotors for in&#8197;vitro bio&#8208;imaging is reported. The two coordination cages, NUS&#8208;100 and NUS&#8208;101, are assembled from the highly stable trinuclear zirconium vertices and two flexible carboxyl&#8208;decorated tetraphenylethylene (TPE) spacers. Extensive experimental and theoretical results show that the emissive intensity of the coordination cages can be controlled by restricting the dynamics of AIE&#8208;active molecular rotors though multiple external stimuli. Because the two coordination cages have excellent chemical stability in aqueous solutions (pH stability: 2&#8211;10) and impressive AIE characteristics contributed by the molecular rotors, they can be employed as novel biological fluorescent probes for in&#8197;vitro live&#8208;cell imaging.

      <title>A Supramolecular Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting System with Two&#8208;Step Sequential Energy Transfer for Photochemical Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
It takes two to FRET: An artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with a two&#8208;step sequential energy&#8208;transfer process in a relay mode was fabricated using a supramolecular strategy. It can be used as a nanoreactor for efficient photochemical catalysis. Moreover, bright white light emission can be successfully achieved with a CIE coordinate of (0.33, 0.33).







Abstract
An artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with sequential energy&#8208;transfer process was fabricated based on a supramolecular strategy. Self&#8208;assembled from the host&#8211;guest complex formed by water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene (WP5), a bola&#8208;type tetraphenylethylene&#8208;functionalized dialkyl ammonium derivative (TPEDA), and two fluorescent dyes, Eosin Y (ESY) and Nile Red (NiR), the supramolecular vesicles achieve efficient energy transfer from the AIE guest TPEDA to ESY.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It takes two to FRET &lt;/b&gt;: An artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with a two&#8208;step sequential energy&#8208;transfer process in a relay mode was fabricated using a supramolecular strategy. It can be used as a nanoreactor for efficient photochemical catalysis. Moreover, bright white light emission can be successfully achieved with a CIE coordinate of (0.33, 0.33).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with sequential energy&#8208;transfer process was fabricated based on a supramolecular strategy. Self&#8208;assembled from the host&#8211;guest complex formed by water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene (WP5), a bola&#8208;type tetraphenylethylene&#8208;functionalized dialkyl ammonium derivative (TPEDA), and two fluorescent dyes, Eosin Y (ESY) and Nile Red (NiR), the supramolecular vesicles achieve efficient energy transfer from the AIE guest TPEDA to ESY. ESY can function as a relay to further transfer the energy to the second acceptor NiR and realize a two&#8208;step sequential energy&#8208;transfer process with good efficiency. By tuning the donor/acceptor ratio, bright white light emission can be successfully achieved with a CIE coordinate of (0.33, 0.33). To better mimic natural photosynthesis and make full use of the harvested energy, the WP5&#8835;TPEDA&#8208;ESY&#8208;NiR system can be utilized as a nanoreactor: photocatalyzed dehalogenation of &#945;&#8208;bromoacetophenone was realized with 96&#8201;% yield in aqueous medium.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crystallization&#8208;Induced Reversal from Dark to Bright Excited States for Construction of Solid&#8208;Emission&#8208;Tunable Squaraines</title>
      <dc:description>
A unique squaraine, CIEE&#8208;SQ, exhibits strong emission in the crystal, undergoing crystallization&#8208;induced reversal from dark 1(n+&#963;,&#960;*) to bright 1(&#960;,&#960;*) excited states. Such an excited state can be tuned by an unexpected temperature&#8208;triggered single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal reversible transformation. Co&#8208;crystallization between CIEE&#8208;SQ and chloroform largely boosts the fluorescence.







Abstract
Squaraines (SQs) with tunable emission in the solid state is of great importance for various demands; however a remaining challenge is emission quenching upon aggregation. Herein, a unique SQ, named as CIEE&#8208;SQ, is designed to exhibit strong emission in crystal, undergoing crystallization&#8208;induced reverse from dark 1(n+&#963;,&#960;*) to bright 1(&#960;,&#960;*) excited states. Such an excited state of CIEE&#8208;SQ can be subtly tuned by molecular conformation changes during the unexpected temperature&#8208;triggered single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) reversible transformation. Furthermore, co&#8208;crystallization between CIEE&#8208;SQ and chloroform largely stabilize the 1(&#960;,&#960;*) state, enhancing the transition dipole moment and decreasing the reorganization energy to boost the fluorescence, which is promising in data encryption and decryption.

      <title>AIE Triggers the Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Atomically Precise Enantiomeric Copper(I) Alkynyl Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomically precise chiral CuI alkynyl nanoclusters R/S&#8208;Cu14 with inherent chirality were synthesized for the first time. Crystallization&#8208; and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (CIE and AIE, respectively) trigger circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with an unprecedented luminescence anisotropy factor (glum).







Abstract
Atomically precise enantiomeric metal clusters are scarce, and copper(I) alkynyl clusters with intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) responses have not been reported. A pair of chiral alkynyl ligands, (R/S)&#8208;2&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxylmethylpyrrolidine&#8208;1&#8208;propyne (abbreviated as R/S&#8208;DPM) we successfully prepared and single crystals were characterized of optically pure enantiomeric pair of atomically&#8208;precise copper(I) clusters, [Cu14(R/S&#8208;DPM)8](PF6)6 (denoted as R/S&#8208;Cu14), which feature bright red luminescence and CPL with a high luminescence anisotropy factor (glum). A dilute solution containing R/S&#8208;Cu14 was nonluminescent and CPL inactive at room temperature. Crystallization&#8208; and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (CIE and AIE, respectively) contribute to the triggering of the CPL of R/S&#8208;Cu14 in the crystalline and aggregated states. Their AIE behavior and good biocompatibility indicated applications of these copper(I) clusters in cell imaging in HeLa and NG108&#8208;15 cells.

      <title>Hydration&#8208;Facilitated Fine&#8208;Tuning of the AIE Amphiphile Color and Application as Erasable Materials with Hot/Cold Dual Writing Modes</title>
      <dc:description>
Just add water: Hydration water on metal ions can be utilized to reversibly fine&#8208;tune the emission color of organic luminescent groups for aggregation induced emission. The hydration water can be removed by heating or mechanical grinding and re&#8208;gained by solvent fuming.







Abstract
Hydration water greatly impacts the color of inorganic crystals, but it is still unknown whether hydration water can be utilized to systematically manipulate the emission color of organic luminescent groups. Now, metal ions with different hydration ability allow fine&#8208;tuning the emission color of a fluorescent group displaying aggregation induced emission (AIE). Because the hydration water can be removed easily by gentle heating or mechanical grinding and re&#8208;gained by solvent fuming, rewritable materials can be fabricated both in the hot&#8208;writing and cold&#8208;writing modes. This hydration&#8208;facilitated strategy will open up a new vista in fine&#8208;tuning the emission color of AIE molecules based on one synthesis and in the design of smart luminescent devices.

      <title>BowtieArene: A Dual Macrocycle Exhibiting Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence</title>
      <dc:description>
Colorful bowtie: The novel fluorescent dual macrocycle BowtieArene features a central tetraphenylethylene&#8208;derived fluorophore, double pillar&#8208;like cavities, and solvent&#8208;, vapor&#8208;, and mechano&#8208;induced fluorochromism. The switchable fluorescence is closely related to changes in the molecular packing mode.







Abstract
Although highly useful in supramolecular chemistry, pillararenes lack a fluorophore in their skeleton. Here we present BowtieArene, a novel fluorescent dual macrocycle, featuring a central tetraphenylethylene&#8208;derived fluorophore and two pillar&#8208;like, pentagon&#8208;shaped cavities which are comparable to pillar[5]arene. This concisely prepared, figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight molecule exhibits vapor absorption and host&#8211;guest capabilities, as well as intriguing switchable fluorescence. The fluorochromism of BowtieArene can be triggered by multiple external stimuli including solvent, vapor, and mechanical force, with excellent reversibility and stability. Experimental and theoretical evidence indicate that the fluorochromism should be closely related to molecular packing.

      <title>Host&#8211;Guest Recognition and Fluorescence of a Tetraphenylethene&#8208;Based Octacationic Cage</title>
      <dc:description>
Two&#8208;in&#8208;one: A three&#8208;dimensional tetraphenylethene&#8208;based octacationic cage (see structure), which successfully integrates the properties of fluorescence and host&#8211;guest recognition in one molecule, was synthesized in a straightforward manner. The cage was shown to bind polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as coronene, in organic media and the water&#8208;soluble dye sulforhodamine&#8197;101 in aqueous media.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of a three&#8208;dimensional tetraphenylethene&#8208;based octacationic cage that shows host&#8211;guest recognition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. coronene) in organic media and water&#8208;soluble dyes (e.g. sulforhodamine&#8197;101) in aqueous media through CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;, &#960;&#8211;&#960;, and/or electrostatic interactions. The cage&#8835;coronene exhibits a cuboid internal cavity with a size of approximately 17.2&#215;11.0&#215;6.96&#8197;&#197;3 and a &#8220;hamburger&#8221;&#8208;type host&#8211;guest complex, which is hierarchically stacked into 1D nanotubes and a 3D supramolecular framework. The free cage possesses a similar cavity in the crystalline state. Furthermore, a host&#8211;guest complex formed between the octacationic cage and sulforhodamine&#8197;101 had a higher absolute quantum yield (&#934;F=28.5&#8201;%), larger excitation&#8211;emission gap (&#916;&#955;ex&#8208;em=211&#8197;nm), and longer emission lifetime (&#964;=7.0&#8197;ns) as compared to the guest (&#934;F=10.5&#8201;%; &#916;&#955;ex&#8208;em=11&#8197;nm; &#964;=4.9&#8197;ns), and purer emission (&#916;&#955;FWHM=38&#8197;nm) as compared to the host (&#916;&#955;FWHM=111&#8197;nm).

      <title>Quantitative Design of Bright Fluorophores and AIEgens by the Accurate Prediction of Twisted Intramolecular Charge Transfer (TICT)</title>
      <dc:description>
A generalizable and reliable computational approach is formulated for modeling the twisted intramolecular charge transfer. Applying this approach in combination with experimental validations, azetidinyl&#8208;substituted PRODAN and BODIPY derivatives were designed for bioimaging and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) applications with enhanced performance.







Abstract
Inhibition of TICT can significantly increase the brightness of fluorescent materials. Accurate prediction of TICT is thus critical for the quantitative design of high&#8208;performance fluorophores and AIEgens. TICT of 14 types of popular organic fluorophores were modeled with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT). A reliable and generalizable computational approach for modeling TICT formations was established. To demonstrate the prediction power of our approach, we quantitatively designed a boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based AIEgen which exhibits (almost) barrierless TICT rotations in monomers. Subsequent experiments validated our molecular design and showed that the aggregation of this compound turns on bright emissions with ca. 27&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement, as TICT formation is inhibited in molecular aggregates.

      <title>Strategy for the Construction of Diverse Poly&#8208;NHC&#8208;Derived Assemblies and Their Photoinduced Transformations</title>
      <dc:description>
Silver links: Tetrakis(1,2,4&#8208;triazolium) salts H4&#8208;L(PF6)4, featuring different N4&#8197;substituents, react with Ag2O to give, depending on the length of the N4&#8197;alkyl substituent, tetranuclear metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies of type [Ag4(L)2](PF6)4 or octanuclear assemblies of type [Ag8(L)4](PF6)8. Both types of assemblies, upon irradiation, undergo oxidative photocyclization of the central tetrakisarylethylene unit to yield the complexes with a 9,10&#8208;phenyl&#8208;substituted phenanthrene bridge.







Abstract
A series of supramolecular assemblies of types [Ag8(L)4](PF6)8 and [Ag4(L)2](PF6)4, obtained from the tetraphenylethylene (TPE) bridged tetrakis(1,2,4&#8208;triazolium) salts H4&#8208;L(PF6)4 and AgI ions, is described. The assembly type obtained dependends on the N&#8208;wingtip substituents of H4&#8208;L(PF6)4. Changes in the lengths of the N4&#8208;wingtip substituents enables controlled formation of assemblies with either [Ag4(L)2](PF6)4 or [Ag8(L)4](PF6)8 stoichiometry. The molecular structures of selected [Ag8(L)4](PF6)8 and [Ag4(L)2](PF6)4 assemblies were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. While H4&#8208;L(PF6)4 does not exhibit fluorescence in solution, their tetra&#8208;NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) assemblies do upon NHC&#8211;metal coordination. Upon irradiation, all assemblies undergo a light&#8208;induced, supramolecule&#8208;to&#8208;supramolecule structural transformation by an oxidative photocyclization involving phenyl groups of the TPE core, resulting in a significant change of the luminescence properties.

      <title>Nanoaggregate Probe for Breast Cancer Metastasis through Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography and Aggregation&#8208;Induced NIR&#8208;I/II Fluorescence Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
An activatable nanoprobe with AIE has been developed as a dual&#8208;mode probe for monitoring breast cancer metastasis optoacoustically and fluorescently. The focus of orthotopic breast tumors can be located through 3D multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging, and the sequential metastases of primary tumors to lymph nodes and the lung can be mapped spatiotemporally.







Abstract
An activatable nanoprobe for imaging breast cancer metastases through near infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I)/NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging was designed. With a dihydroxanthene moiety serving as the electron donor, quinolinium as the electron acceptor and nitrobenzyloxydiphenylamino as the recognition element, the probe can specifically respond to nitroreductase and transform into an activated D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A structure with a NIR emission band extending beyond 900&#8197;nm. The activated nanoprobe exhibits NIR emission enhanced by aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and produces strong optoacoustic signal. The nanoprobe was used to detect and image metastases from the orthotopic breast tumors to lymph nodes and then to lung in two breast cancer mouse models. Moreover, the nanoprobe can monitor the treatment efficacy during chemotherapeutic course through fluorescence and MSOT imaging.

      <title>Photoactivated Fluorescence Enhancement in F,N&#8208;Doped Carbon Dots with Piezochromic Behavior</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoactivated fluorescence enhancement in F and N co&#8208;doped carbon dots is presented. The F,N&#8208;doped CDs exhibit fluorescence enhancement when exposed to UV and reversible piezochromic behavior while applying increasing pressure (1.0&#8197;atm to 9.98&#8197;GPa), with pressure&#8208;triggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission in the range 1.0&#8197;atm&#8211;0.65&#8197;GPa.







Abstract
Photoactivation in CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) on UV/Vis light exposure improves photoluminescence (PL) and photostability. However, it was not observed in fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CDs). Now, photoactivated fluorescence enhancement in fluorine and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon dots (F,N&#8208;doped CDs) is presented. At 1.0&#8197;atm, the fluorescence intensity of F,N&#8208;doped CDs increases with UV light irradiation (5&#8197;s&#8211;30&#8197;min), accompanied with a blue&#8208;shift of the fluorescence emission from 586&#8197;nm to 550&#8197;nm. F,N&#8208;doped CDs exhibit photoactivated fluorescence enhancement when exposed to UV under high pressure (0.1&#8197;GPa). F,N&#8208;doped CDs show reversible piezochromic behavior while applying increasing pressure (1.0&#8197;atm to 9.98&#8197;GPa), showing a pressure&#8208;triggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission in the range 1.0&#8197;atm&#8211;0.65&#8197;GPa. The photoactivated CDs with piezochromic fluorescence enhancement broadens the versatility of CDs from ambient to high&#8208;pressure conditions and enhances their anti&#8208;photobleaching.

      <title>9,9&#8208;Dimethylxanthene Derivatives with Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence: Substituent Effects and Emissive Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
A lifetime: Substituent effects are highlighted in 9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene derivatives for the modulation of intermolecular interactions and molecular configurations, resulting in increased room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) lifetimes ranging from 52 to 601&#8197;ms. This molecular design of persistent RTP materials provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the relationship among molecular structures, intermolecular interactions, and RTP properties.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emitters with ultralong lifetimes are emerging as attractive targets because of their potential applications in bioimaging, security, and other areas. But their development is limited by ambiguous mechanisms and poor understanding of the correlation of the molecular structure and RTP properties. Herein, different substituents on the 9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene core (XCO) result in compounds with RTP lifetimes ranging from 52 to 601&#8197;ms, which are tunable by intermolecular interactions and molecular configurations. XCO&#8208;PiCl shows the most persistent RTP because of its reduced steric bulk and multiple sites of the 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;methylpropan&#8208;2&#8208;yl (PiCl) moiety for forming intermolecular interactions in the aggregated state. The substituent effects reported provide an efficient molecular design of organic RTP materials and establishes relationships among molecular structures, intermolecular interactions, and RTP properties.

      <title>Unraveling the Impact of Gold(I)&#8211;Thiolate Motifs on the Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission of Gold Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>
Tuning gold: The aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) of Au nanoclusters (NCs) is adjustable from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared II region by controlling the length of the AuI&#8211;thiolate motifs on the NC surface. Decreasing the length of AuI&#8208;SR motifs also changes the origin of cluster luminescence from AIE&#8208;type phosphorescence to Au0&#8208;core&#8208;dictated fluorescence.







Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) provides an efficient strategy to synthesize highly luminescent metal nanoclusters (NCs), however, rational control of emission energy and intensity of metal NCs is still challenging. This communication reveals the impact of surface AuI&#8208;thiolate motifs on the AIE properties of Au NCs, by employing a series of water&#8208;soluble glutathione (GSH)&#8208;coordinated Au complexes and NCs as a model ([Au10SR10], [Au15SR13], [Au18SR14], and [Au25SR18]&#8722;, SR=thiolate ligand). Spectroscopic investigations show that the emission wavelength of Au NCs is adjustable from visible to the near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) region by controlling the length of the AuI&#8208;SR motifs on the NC surface. Decreasing the length of AuI&#8208;SR motifs also changes the origin of cluster luminescence from AIE&#8208;type phosphorescence to Au0&#8208;core&#8208;dictated fluorescence. This effect becomes more prominent when the degree of aggregation of Au NCs increases in solution.

      <title>Calixarene&#8208;Based Supramolecular AIE Dots with Highly Inhibited Nonradiative Decay and Intersystem Crossing for Ultrasensitive Fluorescence Image&#8208;Guided Cancer Surgery</title>
      <dc:description>
Calix[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular AIE nanodots were synthesized with high quantum yields in water by virtue of the host&#8211;guest complexation. The absorbed excitation energy was mostly focused on fluorescence emission, leading to an ultrahigh signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio in fluorescence&#8208;image&#8208;guided cancer surgery.







Abstract
Host&#8211;guest complexation between calix[5]arene and aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) can significantly turn off both the energy dissipation pathways of intersystem crossing and thermal deactivation, enabling the absorbed excitation energy to mostly focus on fluorescence emission. The co&#8208;assembly of calix[5]arene amphiphiles and AIEgens affords highly emissive supramolecular AIE nanodots thanks to their interaction severely restricting the intramolecular motion of AIEgens, which also show negligible generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. In&#8197;vivo studies with a peritoneal carcinomatosis&#8208;bearing mouse model indicate that such supramolecular AIE dots have rather low in&#8197;vivo side toxicity and can serve as a superior fluorescent bioprobe for ultrasensitive fluorescence image&#8208;guided cancer surgery.

      <title>5,6,12,13&#8208;Tetraazaperopyrenes as Unique Photonic and Mechanochromic Fluorophores</title>
      <dc:description>
Regioselective N&#8208;doping of peropyrenes for fluorescent tailored microcrystals was achieved. 5,6,12,13&#8208;Tetraazaperopyrene derivatives were synthesized, the crystals of which showed excellent optical waveguide properties and exceptional mechanochromic fluorescence.







Abstract
5,6,12,13&#8208;Tetraazaperopyrenes with different number of tert&#8208;butyl groups (c&#8208;TAPP&#8208;T, c&#8208;TAPP&#8208;H) were synthesized, via four&#8208;fold Bischler&#8211;Napieralski cyclization as the key step. As deduced from the single&#8208;crystal structures and optical properties, N&#8208;doping and substitution type allow for a precise control of intermolecular interactions. Compared to the reported 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetraazaperopyrenes, significantly different packing modes were found in 5,6,12,13&#8208;tetraazaperopyrenes. Going from c&#8208;TAPP&#8208;T to c&#8208;TAPP&#8208;H, two additional tert&#8208;butyl groups lead to different preferential growth directions, affording 1D and 2D microcrystals, respectively. Most importantly, both microcrystals exhibit excellent optical waveguide properties with extraordinarily low loss coefficients and unique polarization features. Although c&#8208;TAPP&#8208;H possesses a rigid and planar core, its crystals display an exceptional mechanochromic fluorescence, which, again, depends on the mode of molecular packing.

      <title>Crystal Engineering of Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Organic Solids</title>
      <dc:description>
Solid state packing in a series of azatriangulenetrione (TANGO) derivatives controls their luminescence properties.

Abstract
We report a series of highly emissive azatriangulenetrione (TANGO) solids in which the luminescent properties are controlled by engineering the molecular packing by adjusting the steric size of substituents. The co&#8208;alignment of &#8220;phosphorogenic&#8221; carbonyl groups within the &#960;&#8208;stacks results in an almost pure triplet emission in HTANGO, TCTANGO, TBTANGO and TITANGO, while their rotation by &#8776;60&#176; in the sterically hindered tBuTANGO leads to an almost pure singlet emission. Despite strong &#960;&#8208;interactions, aggregation&#8208;induced quenching and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation are avoided in HTANGO and TCTANGO which display efficient phosphorescence in the solid state. To our knowledge, HTANGO with the solid&#8208;state phosphorescence quantum yield of 42&#8201;% at room temperature is the most efficient phosphor composed of the 1st/2nd raw elements only.

      <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Long&#8208;Life Luminescent Polymeric Systems under Ambient Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>
Lucky blue&#8208;red clovers: A strategy for achieving excitation&#8208;dependent long&#8208;life luminescent polymer systems under ambient conditions by tuning the aggregation state of phosphors in polyvinyl alcohol films is developed. The developed polymers show promise in multicolor patterning for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.







Abstract
Organic room temperature luminescent materials present a unique phosphorescence emission with a long lifetime. However, many of these materials only emit single blue or green color in spite of external stimulation, and their color tunability is limited. Herein, we report a rational design to extend the emission color range from blue to red by controlling the doping of simple pyrene derivatives into a robust polymer matrix. The integration of these pyrene molecules into the polymer films enhances the intersystem crossing pathway, decreases the first triplet level of the system, and ensures the films show a sensitive response to excitation energy, finally yielding excitation&#8208;dependent long&#8208;life luminescent polymeric systems under ambient conditions. These materials were used to construct anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns with multicolor interconversion, presenting a promising application potential in the field of information security.

      <title>In Vitro Light&#8208;Up Visualization of a Subunit&#8208;Specific Enzyme by an AIE Probe via Restriction of Single Molecular Motion</title>
      <dc:description>
The fluorescent probe TPEMA with aggregation&#8208;induced emission is presented. It is used for in&#8197;vitro specific discrimination of the B subunit of cytosolic creatine kinase isoenzyme in live cells by restriction of single molecular motion.







Abstract
Enzymes contain several subunits to maintain different biological functions. However, it remains a great challenge for specific discrimination of one subunit over another. Toward this end, the fluorescent probe TPEMA is now presented for highly specific detection of the B subunit of cytosolic creatine (CK) kinase isoenzyme (CK&#8208;B). Owing to its aggregation&#8208;induced emission property, TPEMA shows highly boosted emission toward CK&#8208;B with a fast response time and very low interference from other analytes, including the M subunit of CK (CK&#8208;M). With the aid of a Job plot assay, ITC assay and molecular dynamics simulation, it was directly confirmed that the remarkably enhanced fluorescence of TPEMA in the presence of CK&#8208;B results from the restriction of single molecular motion in the cavity. Selective wash&#8208;free fluorescence imaging of CK&#8208;B in macrophages under different treatments was successfully demonstrated.

      <title>An AIE&#8208;Based Probe for Rapid and Ultrasensitive Imaging of Plasma Membranes in Biosystems</title>
      <dc:description>
Insane in the membrane: A plasma membrane (PM)&#8208;specific probe with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics for wash&#8208;free PM imaging is presented. This is the first time that erythrocytes have been visualized in the brain through a fluorescence&#8208;based method. Moreover, a partial view of the eyeball structure of live zebrafish was obtained through the in&#8197;situ labelling of the epidermal PM.







Abstract
The abnormality of the plasma membrane (PM) is an important biomarker for cell status and many diseases. Hence, visualizing the PM, especially in complex systems, is an emerging field in the life sciences, especially in low&#8208;resource settings. Herein, we developed a water&#8208;soluble PM&#8208;specific probe utilizing electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction strategies with aggregation&#8208;induced emission as the signal output. The probe could image the PM with many advanced features (wash&#8208;free, ultrafast staining process, excellent PM specificity, and good biocompatibility), which were demonstrated by the PM imaging of neurons. The probe allowed for the first time the imaging of erythrocytes in the complex brain environment through a fluorescence&#8208;based method. Moreover, the PM of the epidermal and partial view of the eyeball structure of live zebrafish are also revealed.

      <title>Dual Enhancement of Gold Nanocluster Electrochemiluminescence: Electrocatalytic Excitation and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
      <dc:description>
Drying enabled the electrocatalytic excitation and aggregation&#8208;induced emission of ligand&#8208;capped gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), allowing a record high solid&#8208;phase electrochemiluminescence (ECL) yield of 78&#8201;% and visual ECL. This work supports the in&#8208;depth design and study of ECL in AuNCs and other materials in aqueous solutions.







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) have emerged as a new class of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) luminophores for their interesting catalytic and emission properties, although their quantum yield (&#934;ECL) in aqueous medium is low with a poor mechanistic understanding of the ECL process. Now it is shown that drying AuNCs on electrodes enabled both enhanced electrochemical excitation by an electrocatalytic effect, and enhanced emission by aggregation&#8208;induced ECL (AIECL) for 6&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8208;thiothymine (ATT) protected AuNCs with triethylamine (TEA) as a coreactant. The dried ATT&#8208;AuNCs/TEA system resulted in highly stable visual ECL with a &#934;ECL of 78&#8201;%, and a similar enhancement was also achieved with methionine&#8208;capped AuNCs. The drying enabled dual&#8208;enhancement mechanism has solved a challenging mechanistic problem for AuNC ECL probes, and can guide further rational design of ECL emitters.

      <title>Two&#8208;Step Oxidation Synthesis of Sulfur with a Red Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
      <dc:description>
Red&#8208;emissive sulfur was synthesized through a two&#8208;step oxidation strategy using elemental sulfur and Na2S as starting materials. It possesses aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies providing additional energy states in the red spectral region.







Abstract
Sulfur is not normally considered a light&#8208;emitting material, even though there have been reports of a dim luminescence of this compound in the blue&#8208;to&#8208;green spectral region. Now, it is shown how to make red&#8208;emissive sulfur by a two&#8208;step oxidation approach using elemental sulfur and Na2S as starting materials, with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 7.2&#8201;%. Polysulfide is formed first and is partially transformed into Na2S2O3 in the first step, and then turns back to elemental S in the second step. The elevated temperature and relatively oxygen&#8208;deficient environment during the second step transforms Na2S2O3 into Na2SO3 incorporated with oxygen vacancies, thus resulting in the formation of a solid&#8208;state powder consisting of elemental S embedded in Na2SO3. It shows aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, attributed to the influence of oxygen vacancies on the emission dynamics of sulfur by providing additional lower energy states that facilitate the radiative relaxation of excitons.

      <title>Trackable Supramolecular Fusion: Cage to Cage Transformation of Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Metalloassemblies</title>
      <dc:description>
A Pt in a cage: Inspired by natural systems, a trackable supramolecular platinum(II) cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation is presented. It takes advantage of programmable metal coordination chemistry as well as unique photophysical properties of AIE&#8208;active metalloassemblies.







Abstract
Herein, the trackable supramolecular transformation of a two&#8208;component molecular cage to a three&#8208;component cage through supramolecular fusion with another two&#8208;component molecular square is described. The use of tetraphenylethene (TPE), a chromophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) character, as a component for the molecular cages enables facile fluorescence monitoring of the transformation process: while both cages exhibit fluorescence emission via the restriction of intramolecular motion of the TPE motif, the interactions between TPE and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine introduced in the supramolecular fusion process result in partial fluorescence quenching and shifts in the emission maximum. This study provides a simple and efficient approach towards complex supramolecular cages with emergent functions and demonstrates that AIE features could provide unique opportunities for the characterization of complex, dynamic supramolecular transformation processes.

      <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Gold Clustoluminogens for Enhanced Low&#8208;Dose X&#8208;ray&#8208;Induced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Cancer&#8208;killing clusters: Aggregation&#8208;induced emission gold clustoluminogens (AIE&#8208;Au) for X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced photodynamic therapy (X&#8208;PDT) were designed. Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, AIE&#8208;Au strongly absorbed X&#8208;rays and efficiently generated hydroxyl radicals, which enhanced the radiotherapy effect. Additionally, AIE&#8208;AuX&#8208;ray&#8208;induced luminescence excited the conjugated photosensitizers, resulting in a PDT effect.







Abstract
The use of gold nanoparticles as radiosensitizers is an effective way to boost the killing efficacy of radiotherapy while drastically limiting the received dose and reducing the possible damage to normal tissues. Herein, we designed aggregation&#8208;induced emission gold clustoluminogens (AIE&#8208;Au) to achieve efficient low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced photodynamic therapy (X&#8208;PDT) with negligible side effects. The aggregates of glutathione&#8208;protected gold clusters (GCs) assembled through a cationic polymer enhanced the X&#8208;ray&#8208;excited luminescence by 5.2&#8208;fold. Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, AIE&#8208;Au strongly absorbed X&#8208;rays and efficiently generated hydroxyl radicals, which enhanced the radiotherapy effect. Additionally, X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced luminescence excited the conjugated photosensitizers, resulting in a PDT effect. The in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments demonstrated that AIE&#8208;Au effectively triggered the generation of reactive oxygen species with an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude reduction in the X&#8208;ray dose, enabling highly effective cancer treatment.

The aggregates of glutathione&#8208;protected gold clusters (GCs) assembled through a cationic polymer enhanced the X&#8208;ray&#8208;excited luminescence by 5.2&#8208;fold. Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, AIE&#8208;Au strongly absorbed X&#8208;rays and efficiently generated hydroxyl radicals, which enhanced the radiotherapy effect. Additionally, X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced luminescence excited the conjugated photosensitizers, resulting in a PDT effect. The in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments demonstrated that AIE&#8208;Au effectively triggered the generation of reactive oxygen species with an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude reduction in the X&#8208;ray dose, enabling highly effective cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular Design of Non&#8208;doped OLEDs Based on a Twisted Heptagonal Acceptor: A Delicate Balance between Rigidity and Rotatability</title>
      <dc:description>
Power of twist: A twisted heptagonal diimide acceptor with well&#8208;balanced structural rigidity and rotatability has been developed for the synthesis of a highly efficient aggregation&#8208;induced delayed fluorescence material, which was used to make state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance non&#8208;doped OLEDs.







Abstract
The development of efficient non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is highly desired but very challenging because of a severe aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect. Herein, we present a heptagonal diimide acceptor (BPI), which can restrict excessive intramolecular rotation and inhibit close intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking due to well&#8208;balanced rigidity and rotatability of heptagonal structure. The BPI&#8208;based luminogen (DMAC&#8208;BPI) shows significant aggregation&#8208;induced delayed florescence with an extremely high photoluminescence quantum yield (95.8&#8201;%) of the neat film, and the corresponding non&#8208;doped OLEDs exhibit outstanding electroluminescence performance with maximum external quantum efficiency as high as 24.7&#8201;% and remarkably low efficiency roll&#8208;off as low as 1.0&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, which represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for non&#8208;doped OLEDs. In addition, the synthetic route to DMAC&#8208;BPI is greatly streamlined and simplified through oxidative Ar&#8722;H/Ar&#8722;H homo&#8208;coupling reaction.

      <title>A Conjugated Polymeric Supramolecular Network with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement: An Efficient Light&#8208;Harvesting System with an Ultrahigh Antenna Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
You're the antenna: A conjugated polymeric supramolecular network with aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement has been developed as an excellent light&#8208;harvesting system with an unprecedented antenna effect (35.9 in solution and 90.4 in solid film). Moreover, the emission of this network could be tuned, reaching 96&#8201;% sRGB area.







Abstract
Superior artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems (ALHSs) require exceptional capacity in harvesting light and transferring energy. In this work, we report a novel strategy to build ALHSs with an unprecedented antenna effect (35.9 in solution and 90.4 in solid film). The ALHSs made use of a conjugated polymeric supramolecular network (CPSN), a crosslinked network obtained from the self&#8208;assembly of a pillar[5]arene&#8208;based conjugated polymeric host (CPH) and conjugated ditopic guests (Gs). The excellent performance of the CPSN could be attributed to the following factors: 1)&#8197;The &#8220;molecular wire effect&#8221; of the conjugated polymeric structure, 2)&#8197;aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AEE) moieties in the CPH backbone, and 3)&#8197;high capacity of donor&#8211;acceptor energy transfer, and 4)&#8197;crosslinked structures triggered by the host&#8211;guest binding between Gs and CPH. Moreover, the emission of the CPSN could be tuned by using different Gs or varying the host/guest ratio, thus reaching a 96&#8201;% sRGB area.

      <title>Synthesis of Tetraarylethene Luminogens by C&#8722;H Vinylation of Aromatic Compounds with Triazenes</title>
      <dc:description>
Glowing couple: A simple and versatile coupling method to make tetraarylethenes, which display active aggregation&#8208;induced emission, from aromatic compounds and vinyl triazenes is described. The novel C&#8722;H vinylation approach allows installation of the triarylethenyl group onto simple unactivated arenes, heteroarenes, supramolecular hosts, bioactive molecules, and polymers.







Abstract
Tetraarylethenes are obtained by acid&#8208;induced coupling of vinyl triazenes with aromatic compounds. This new C&#8722;H activation route for the synthesis of aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens is simple, fast, and versatile. It allows the direct grafting of triarylethenyl groups onto a variety of aromatic compounds, including heterocycles, supramolecular hosts, biologically relevant molecules, and commercial polymers.

      <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;induced gelation of Ag nanoclusters with atomic precision has been achieved. The metal&#8211;organic gel exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission with fluorescence&#8208;to&#8208;phosphorescence switching and reversible changes upon heating&#8208;&#8208;cooling cycles.







Abstract
Luminescent metal nanoclusters (NCs) are emerging as a new class of functional materials that have rich physicochemical properties and wide potential applications. In recent years, it has been found that some metal NCs undergo aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and an interesting fluorescence&#8208;to&#8208;phosphorescence (F&#8208;P) switching in solutions. However, insights of both the AIE and the F&#8208;P switching remain largely unknown. Now, gelation of water soluble, atomically precise Ag9 NCs is achieved by the addition of antisolvent. Self&#8208;assembly of Ag9 NCs into entangled fibers was confirmed, during which AIE was observed together with an F&#8208;P switching occurring within a narrow time scale. Structural evaluation indicates the fibers are highly ordered. The self&#8208;assembly of Ag9 NCs and their photoluminescent property are thermally reversible, making the metal&#8211;organic gels good candidates for luminescent ratiometric thermometers.

      <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excited Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Water by Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Mediated Supramolecular Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
True colors: An assembly&#8208;induced emission strategy was utilized to endow a simple dye molecule with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and tunable photoluminescence in aqueous solution. The obtained supramolecular assembly structure has intriguing photophysical properties and enables the fabrication of multicolor hydrogels and cell imaging.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state materials with efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emissions have found widespread applications in materials science, while liquid or solution&#8208;phase pure organic RTP emission systems has been rarely reported, because of the nonradiative decay and quenchers from the liquid medium. Reported here is the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;excited pure organic RTP in aqueous solution by using a supramolecular host&#8208;guest assembly strategy. The unique cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated quaternary stacking structure allows tunable photoluminescence and visible&#8208;light excitation, enabling the fabrication of multicolor hydrogels and cell imaging. The present assembly&#8208;induced emission approach, as a proof of concept, contributes to the construction of novel metal&#8208;free RTP systems with tunable photoluminescence in aqueous solution, providing broad opportunities for further applications in biological imaging, detection, optical sensors, and so forth.

     alt="Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excited Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Water by Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Mediated Supramolecular Assembly"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;True colors &lt;/b&gt;: An assembly&#8208;induced emission strategy was utilized to endow a simple dye molecule with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and tunable photoluminescence in aqueous solution. The obtained supramolecular assembly structure has intriguing photophysical properties and enables the fabrication of multicolor hydrogels and cell imaging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid&#8208;state materials with efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emissions have found widespread applications in materials science, while liquid or solution&#8208;phase pure organic RTP emission systems has been rarely reported, because of the nonradiative decay and quenchers from the liquid medium. Reported here is the first example of visible&#8208;light&#8208;excited pure organic RTP in aqueous solution by using a supramolecular host&#8208;guest assembly strategy. The unique cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;mediated quaternary stacking structure allows tunable photoluminescence and visible&#8208;light excitation, enabling the fabrication of multicolor hydrogels and cell imaging. The present assembly&#8208;induced emission approach, as a proof of concept, contributes to the construction of novel metal&#8208;free RTP systems with tunable photoluminescence in aqueous solution, providing broad opportunities for further applications in biological imaging, detection, optical sensors, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>Organic materials with long&#8208;lived, color&#8208;tunable phosphorescence are potentially used for optical recording, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and bioimaging. Herein, we develop a series of novel host&#8208;guest organic phosphors allowing dynamic color tuning from the cyan (502 nm) to orange red (608 nm). Guest materials are employed to tune the phosphorescent color, while the host materials show a synergistic effect to the guest to activate the phosphorescence emission. These organic phosphors have an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 0.7 s and a maximum phosphorescence efficiency of 18.2%. Although color tunable inks have already been developed using visible dyes, solution&#8208;processed security inks that are temperature dependent and display time&#8208;resolved printed images are unprecedented.

      <title>Conformational Panorama and Chirality Controlled Structure&#8208;Energy Relationship in a Chiral Carboxylic Acid Dimer</title>
      <dc:description>Chirality recognition in dimers of  tetrahydro&#8208;2&#8208;furoic acid  (THFA), a biologically active carboxylic acid, was studied in a conformer&#8208;specific manner using rotational spectroscopy and theoretical approaches. The THFA monomer is known to have a strong preference for the  trans  &#8208; over the  cis  &#8208;COOH configuration.  Two drastically different scenarios are possible for the detectable THFA dimer: the kinetically controlled formation of a dimer bound by feeble interactions between two  trans  subunits or the thermodynamically controlled formation of a dimer with a double hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring structure between two  cis  subunits.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chirality recognition in dimers of  tetrahydro&#8208;2&#8208;furoic acid  (THFA), a biologically active carboxylic acid, was studied in a conformer&#8208;specific manner using rotational spectroscopy and theoretical approaches. The THFA monomer is known to have a strong preference for the  trans  &#8208; over the  cis  &#8208;COOH configuration.  Two drastically different scenarios are possible for the detectable THFA dimer: the kinetically controlled formation of a dimer bound by feeble interactions between two  trans  subunits or the thermodynamically controlled formation of a dimer with a double hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring structure between two  cis  subunits.  To identify the conformers responsible for the extremely dense, broadband rotational spectra, it was essential not only to locate several hundred homo/heterochiral (THFA)  2  minima but also to evaluate the energetic connectivities among the minima.

      <title>Irreversible amide&#8208;linked covalent organic framework for selective and ultrafast gold recovery</title>
      <dc:description>Design of stable adsorbents for selective gold recovery with large capacity and fast kinetics is of great challenge, but significant for economy and environment. Here, we show the design and preparation of an irreversible amide&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) JNU&#8208;1 via a building block exchange strategy for efficient recovery of gold. JNU&#8208;1 was synthesized through the exchange of 4,4'&#8208;biphenyldicarboxaldehyde (BA) in mother COF TzBA consisting of 4,4',4''&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)trianiline (Tz) and BA with terephthaloyl chloride. The irreversible amide linked JNU&#8208;1 gave good stability, unprecedented fast kinetics, excellent selectivity and outstanding adsorption capacity for gold recovery. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy along with thermodynamic study and quantum mechanics calculation reveals that the excellent performance of JNU&#8208;1 for gold recovery results from the formation of hydrogen bonds C(N)&#8208;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl and coordinate interaction of O and Au.

      <title>Reagents for Selective Fluoromethylation: A Challenge in Organofluorine Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Reagents that introduce the CH2F group into organic molecules operate via electrophilic, nucleophilic, or radical routes. New stable, easy to handle, and efficient reagents for fluoromethylation provide access to organic CH2F derivatives of academic interest and industrial importance. While CH2F transfer to heteroatoms is straightforward, carbon fluoromethylation still remains a challenge.







Abstract
The introduction of a monofluoromethyl moiety has undoubtedly become a very important area of research in recent years. Owing to the beneficial properties of organofluorine compounds, such as their metabolic stability, the incorporation of the CH2F group as a bioisosteric substitute for various functional groups is an attractive strategy for the discovery of new pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the monofluoromethyl unit is also widely used in agrochemistry, in pharmaceutical chemistry, and in fine chemicals. The problems associated with climate change and the growing need for environmentally friendly industrial processes mean that alternatives to the frequently used CFC and HFBC fluoromethylating agents (CH2FCl and CH2FBr) are urgently needed and also required by the Montreal Protocol. This has recently prompted many researchers to develop alternative fluoromethylation agents. This Minireview summarizes both the classical and new generation of fluoromethylating agents. Reagents that act via electrophilic, nucleophilic, and radical pathways are discussed, in addition to their precursors.

      <title>A Single&#8208;Atom Manipulation Approach for Synthesis of Atomically Mixed Nanoalloys as Efficient Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
The atoms went in one by one: Atomically mixed AuPt, AuPd, PtPd, AuPdPt nanoalloys are prepared by the solid solvent method via single&#8208;atom level manipulation. The supported nanoalloys/CeO2 with ultra&#8208;low noble metal content exhibit remarkable catalytic performance towards CO oxidation at room temperature and robust thermostability.







Abstract
Synthesis of well&#8208;defined atomically mixed alloy nanoparticles on desired substrates is an ultimate goal for their practical application. Herein we report a general approach for preparing atomically mixed AuPt, AuPd, PtPd, AuPtPd NAs(nanoalloys) through single&#8208;atom level manipulation. By utilizing the ubiquitous tendency of aggregation of single atoms into nanoparticles at elevated temperatures, we have synthesized nanoalloys on a solid solvent with CeO2 as a carrier and transition&#8208;metal single atoms as an intermediate state. The supported nanoalloys/CeO2 with ultra&#8208;low noble metal content (containing 0.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% Au and 0.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt) exhibit enhanced catalytic performance towards complete CO oxidation at room temperature and remarkable thermostability. This work provides a general strategy for facile and rapid synthesis of well&#8208;defined atomically mixed nanoalloys that can be applied for a range of emerging techniques.

Heteroatom&#8208;stabilized transition&#8208;metal carbene complexes are useful building blocks for organic synthesis, but their catalytic generation from substrates with common functional groups is still challenging. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002710), F.

Haloesterifications using easily obtainable alkenes and carboxylic acids have unique industrial benefits. The first general catalytic asymmetric iodoesterification of simple alkenes was achieved by T. Arai et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003886) by using a dinuclear zinc&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;(R,S,S)&#8208;bis(aminoimino)binaphthoxide (di&#8208;Zn) complex.

      <title>Unprecedented Kinetic Inertness for a Mn2+&#8208;Bispidine Chelate: A Novel Structural Entry for Mn2+&#8208;Based Imaging Agents</title>
      <dc:description>
Mn2+ complexes are more biocompatible alternatives to Gd3+&#8208;based MRI agents, and 52Mn is an emerging radionuclide for positron emission tomography. Both applications require highly inert chelates which, given the labile nature of Mn2+, remains a challenge. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003685), L. Charbonni&#232;re, &#201;. T&#243;th and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that a strongly preorganized 2,4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;disubstituted bispidol ligand provides exceptional kinetic inertness to its Mn2+ complex.

     alt="Unprecedented Kinetic Inertness for a Mn2+&#8208;Bispidine Chelate: A Novel Structural Entry for Mn2+&#8208;Based Imaging Agents"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes are more biocompatible alternatives to Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;based MRI agents, and &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Mn is an emerging radionuclide for positron emission tomography. Both applications require highly inert chelates which, given the labile nature of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, remains a challenge. In their Research Article (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.20200368510.1002/anie.202003685&lt;/a&gt;), L. Charbonni&#232;re, &#201;. T&#243;th and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that a strongly preorganized 2,4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;disubstituted bispidol ligand provides exceptional kinetic inertness to its Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; complex.

      <dc:description>Aqueous zinc (Zn) battery has been considered as a promising candidate for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, their cycle stability is generally limited by the structure collapse of cathode materials and the dendrite formation coupled with undesired hydrogen evolution on Zn anode.

Furthermore, the organic cathode can store Zn2+ through reversible coordination reaction with fast kinetics. Therefore, this battery can be cycled for 20,000 times with negligible capacity fading.

      <title>Deuteriodifluoromethylation and gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenylation of Aldehydes Using ClCF2H in Continuous Flow</title>
      <dc:description>
ClCF2H gas is used in the continuous&#8208;flow deuteriodifluoromethylation and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenylation of aldehydes. Mechanistic studies reveal the difluorinated oxaphosphetane intermediate can proceed via alkaline hydrolysis in the presence of D2O to provide &#945;&#8208;deuteriodifluoromethylated benzyl alcohols or undergo a retro [2+2] cycloaddition under thermal conditions to provide the gem&#8208;difluoroalkenylated product.







Abstract
The deuteriodifluoromethyl group (CF2D) represents a challenging functional group due to difficult deuterium incorporation and unavailability of precursor reagents. Herein, we report the use of chlorodifluoromethane (ClCF2H) gas in the continuous flow deuteriodifluoromethylation and gem&#8208;difluoroalkenylation of aldehydes. Mechanistic studies revealed that the difluorinated oxaphosphetane (OPA) intermediate can proceed via alkaline hydrolysis in the presence of D2O to provide &#945;&#8208;deuteriodifluoromethylated benzyl alcohols or undergo a retro [2+2] cycloaddition under thermal conditions to provide the gem&#8208;difluoroalkenylated product.

      <title>Unexpected Acetylation of Endogenous Aliphatic Amines by Arylamine N&#8208;Acetyltransferase NAT2</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;Acetyltransferases play critical roles in the deactivation and clearance of xenobiotics, including clinical drugs. NAT2 has previously been classified as an arylamine N&#8208;acetyltransferase that mainly converts aromatic amines, hydroxylamines and hydrazines. Here, we demonstrate that the human arylamine N&#8208;acetyltransferase NAT2 also acetylates a series of aliphatic endogenous amines. Metabolomic analysis and chemical synthesis revealed significantly increased intracellular concentrations of mono&#8208; and diacetylated spermidine in human cell lines expressing the rapid compared to the slow acetylator NAT2 phenotype. The regioselective N  8  &#8208;acetylation of monoacetylated spermidine by NAT2 answers the long&#8208;standing question in polyamine metabolism of the source of diacetylspermidine. We also identified selective acetylation of structurally diverse alkylamine&#8208;containing commonly used drugs by NAT2. Such moieties are present in 21% of prescribed drugs in the US and acetylation by NAT2 may contribute to variations in patient responses. The results demonstrate a previously unknown functionality and potential regulatory role for NAT2 and we therefore suggest that this enzyme should be considered for re&#8208;classification.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Radical Ring&#8208;Opening polymerization (rROP) of Cyclic Ketene Acetals (CKAs) combines the advantages of both ring&#8208;opening polymerization and radical polymerization thereby allowing the robust production of polyesters coupled with the mild polymerization conditions of a radical process. rROP was recently rejuvenated by the possibility to copolymerize CKAs with classic vinyl monomers leading to the insertion of cleavable functionality into a vinyl&#8208;based copolymer backbone and thus imparting (bio)degradability. Such materials are suitable for a large scope of applications, particularly within the biomedical field. The competition between the ring&#8208;opening and ring&#8208;retaining propagation routes is a major complication in the development of efficient CKA monomers, ultimately leading to the use of only four monomers that are known to completely ring&#8208;open under all experimental conditions. In this article we investigate in detail the radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of model CKA monomers and demonstrate by the combination of DFT calculations and kinetic modeling using PREDICI software that we are now able to predict in silico the ring&#8208;opening ability of CKA monomers.</dc:description>

      <title>S&#8208;modified oxygen vacancies in iron&#8208;cobalt oxide nanosheets: Enabling extremely high activity of oxygen evolution reaction for achieving industrial water splitting benchmark</title>
      <dc:description>Water electrolysis is a promising strategy for high&#8208;purity hydrogen production but restrained by the high electricity cost. Developing an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst with excellent activity and low price is indispensable for reducing water electrolysis cost. The modulation of electronic structure of catalysts can be an efficient strategy to boost their activities. Herein, the oxygen vacancies of defective iron&#8208;cobalt oxide (FeCoO  x  &#8208;Vo) nanosheets are modified by the homogeneously distributed sulfur (S) atoms. S atoms can not only effectively stabilize oxygen vacancies (Vo), but also form the Co&#8208;S coordination with Co active site in the Vo, which can modulate the electronic structure of the active site, enabling FeCoO  x  &#8208;Vo&#8208;S to exhibit much superior OER activity. Remarkably, FeCoO  x  &#8208;Vo&#8208;S exhibits a mass activity of 2440.0 A g  &#8208;1  at the voltage of 1.5 V vs. RHE in 1.0 M KOH, which is 25.4 times higher than that of RuO  2  (96.0 A g  &#8208;1  ). Meanwhile, its Tafel slope can as low as 21.0 mV dec  &#8208;1  , indicative of its excellent charge transfer rate. When FeCoO  x  &#8208;Vo&#8208;S (anode catalyst) is paired with the defective CoP  3  /Ni  2  P (cathode catalyst) for overall water splitting, the current densities can be achieved as high as 249.0 mA cm  &#8208;2  and 406.0 mA cm  &#8208;2  at the cell voltage of 2.0 V and 2.3 V, respectively, which meet well the requirement of industrial water splitting.</dc:description>

      <title>Stringing the PDI Bow</title>
      <dc:description>This study explores a new mode of contortion in perylene diimides where the molecule is bent, like a bow along its long axis. We synthesize these bowed PDIs through a facile 4&#8208;fold Suzuki macrocyclization with aromatic linkers and a tetraborylated perylene diimide that introduces strain and results in a bowed structure. By&#160;&#8208;altering&#160;the strings of the bow, the degree of bending can be controlled from flat to highly&#160;bent. Through spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations, we demonstrate that the energy of the lowest unoccupied orbital can be controlled by the degree of bending in the structures and the energy of the highest occupied orbital can be controlled to a large extent by the constitution of the aromatic linkers.&#160;The important finding is that the bowing results not only in red&#8208;shifted absorptions but also more facile reductions.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantiomeric discrimination through tip&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering using a chemically modified silver tip with an asymmetric atomic arrangement</title>
      <dc:description>Enantiomeric discrimination is achieved by tip&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) using a silver tip chemically modified by an achiral  para  &#8208;mercaptopyridine (  p  MPY) probe molecule. Differences in the relative intensities of the  p  MPY spectra were monitored for three pairs of enantiomers containing hydroxyl (&#8211;OH) and/or amino (&#8211;NH  2  ) groups. The N: or N  +  &#8211;H functionality of the  p  MPY&#8208;modified tip participates in hydrogen bond interactions with a particular molecular orientation of each chiral isomer. The asymmetric arrangement of silver atoms at the apex of the tip induces an asymmetric electric field, which causes the tip to become a chiral center. Differences in the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) states of the metal&#8211;achiral probe system in conjunction with the asymmetric electric field produce different enhancements in the Raman signals of the two enantiomers. The near&#8208;field effect of the asymmetric electric field, which depends on the number of analyte functional groups capable of hydrogen bond formation, improves the degree of discrimination.</dc:description>

      <title>Compressing Double [7]Helicene by Successive Charging with Electrons</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical reduction of a benzo&#8208;fused double [7]helicene (  1  ) with two alkali metals, K and Rb, provided access to three different reduced states of  1  . The doubly&#8208;reduced helicene  1  2&#8722;  has been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction as a solvent&#8208;separated ion triplet with two potassium counterions. The triply&#8208; and tetra&#8208;reduced helicenes,  1  3&#8722;  and  1  4&#8722;  , have been crystallized together in an equimolar ratio and both form the contact&#8208;ion complexes with two Rb  +  ions each, leaving three remaining Rb  +  ions wrapped by crown ether and THF molecules. As structural consequence of the stepwise reduction of  1  , the central axis of helicene becomes more compressed upon electron addition (1.42 &#197; in  1  4&#8211;  vs  . 2.09 &#197; in  1  ). This is accompanied by an extra core twist, as the peripheral dihedral angle increases from 16.5&#186; in  1  to 20.7&#186; in  1  4&#8211;  .

      <title>How to Make Nitroaromatics Glow: Next Generation Large, &#967;&#8212;Shaped, Centrosymmetric Diketopyrrolopyrroles</title>
      <dc:description>This article describes a synthetic approach to a new structurally diverse family of &#960;&#8208;expanded diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPPs). These red&#8208;emissive dyes, based on a previously unknown skeleton, can be easily synthesized via a three&#8208;step strategy involving the preparation of diketopyrrolopyrrole followed by N&#8208;arylation and subsequent intramolecular palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct arylation.
A careful selection of the aryl substituents on DPP gives access to a
&#960;&#8208;extended DPP derivative with intense fluorescence reaching 750 nm. The fact that NO2 groups do not engage in the excited states is responsible for the lack of fluorescence quenching when this functional group is present. Comprehensive spectroscopic assays combined with first principle calculations corroborated that both N&#8208;arylated and fused DPPs reach a locally excited (S1) state after excitation, followed by internal conversion to states with solvent and structural relaxation, before eventually undergoing intersystem crossing. Only the structurally relaxed state is fluorescent with lifetimes in the range of several nanoseconds and tens of picoseconds in non&#8208;polar and polar solvents, respectively. The aforementioned lifetimes correlate with fluorescence quantum yields, which range from 6% to 88% in non&#8208;polar solvents and from 0.4% and 3.2% in polar solvents. For the fully fused DPP a very inefficient (T1) population is responsible for fluorescence quantum yields as high as 88% in polar solvents, which is among the uppermost ever recorded for nitro&#8208;aromatics. These findings demonstrate the immense importance of the ability to design, build and fine&#8208;tune the structure of large, &#960;&#8208;expanded functional dyes so that the strong polarization of centrosymmetric structures is achieved.</dc:description>

      <title>Anisotropic Poisson&#8217;s Effect and Deformation&#8208;induced Fluorescence Change of Elastic 9,10&#8208;Dibromoanthrathene Single Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>Elastic organic crystals have attracted considerable attention as next&#8208;generation flexible smart materials. However, the detailed information on both molecular packing change and macroscopic mechanical crystal deformations upon applied stress are still insufficient. Here we report that fluorescent single crystals of 9,10&#8208;dibromoanthracene are elastically bendable and stretchable, which allows a detailed investigation of the deformation behavior. We clearly observed a Poisson&#8217;s effect for the crystal, where the short axes (i.e., b and c&#8208;axes) of the crystal are contracted upon elongation along the long axis (i.e., a&#8208;axis). Moreover, we found that the Poisson&#8217;s ratios along the b&#8208;axis and c&#8208;axis are largely different (i.e., anisotropic Poisson&#8217;s effect). Theoretical molecular simulation suggests that the tilting motion of the anthracene may be responsible for the large deformation along the c&#8208;axis. Spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurement of the bent elastic crystals reveal that the PL spectra at the outer (elongated), central (neutral) and inner (contracted) sides are different from each other. Furthermore, we observe a reversible change in the PL spectra upon applying and releasing the elongation stress.</dc:description>

      <title>Ineffective OH&#8208;pinning of the flipping dynamics of a spherical guest within a tight&#8208;fitting tube</title>
      <dc:description>A supramolecular/synthetic method was devised to affix a sterically hindered substituent onto a fullerene guest encapsulated in a tubular host. A two&#8208;wheeled complex of (C  59  N)&#8211;(C  59  N) with a tubular host was oxidatively bisected to afford the C  59  N  +  &#160;cation captured in the tube. The C  59  N  +  &#160;cation in the tube was then trapped by ethanol or water, which led to an oxy substituent pinned on the guest. The guest motions within the tube were modulated by the pinned substituent, and up&#8208;and&#8208;down flipping motions were halted by an ethoxy substituent. A hydroxy substituent, however, was ineffective in halting the flipping motions despite the tight&#8208;fitting relationship between the tubular host and the spherical guest. Theoretical calculations of the dynamics revealed that the flipping motions were assisted by OH&#8208;&#960; hydrogen bonds between the guest and the carbon&#8208;rich wall and that sliding motions of the OH group were also facilitated by deformations of the tube.</dc:description>

      <title>Scalable Photoelectrochemical Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Heteroarenes with Aliphatic C&#8211;H Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Heteroarenes are structural motifs found in many bioactive compounds and functional materials. Dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes with aliphatic C&#8211;H bonds provides straightforward access to functionalized heteroarenes from readily available materials. Established methods employ stoichiometric chemical oxidants under conditions of heating or light irradiation. By merging electrochemistry and photochemistry, we have achieved efficient photoelectrochemical dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of heteroarenes and C(sp3)&#8211;H donors through H2  evolution, without the addition of metal catalysts or chemical oxidants. Mechanistically, the C(sp3)&#8211;H donor is converted to a nucleophilic C&#8208;radical through H&#8208;atom transfer with chlorine atom, which is produced by light irradiation of anodically generated Cl2  from Cl&#8722;. The C&#8208;radical then undergoes radical substitution to the heteroarene to afford alkylated heteroarene products.</dc:description>

      <title>Free Radical Chemistry of Phosphasilenes</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the characteristics of radicals formed from silicon&#8208;containing heavy analogues of alkenes is of great importance for their application in radical polymerization. Bulky and electronic substituent effects in such compounds as phosphasilenes not only stabilize the Si=P double bond, but also influence the structure and species of the formed radicals. Herein we report our first investigations of radicals derived from phosphasilenes with Mes (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl), Tip (2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl), Dur (2,3,5,6&#8208;tetramethylphenyl) and NMe  2  (dimethylamino) substituents on the P atom, using muon spin spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Adding muonium (a light isotope of hydrogen) to phosphasilenes reveals that: a) the electron&#8208;donor NMe  2  and the bulkiest Tip&#8208;substituted phosphasilenes form several muoniated radicals with different rotamer conformations; b) bulky Dur&#8208;substituted phosphasilene forms two radicals (Si&#8208; and P&#8208;centred); and c) Mes&#8208;substituted phosphasilene mainly forms one species of radical, at the P centre. These significant differences result from intramolecular substituent effects.</dc:description>

      <title>Reconciling Electrostatic and n&#8594;&#960;* Orbital Contributions in Carbonyl Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Attractive interactions between carbonyl groups have been studied extensively, primarily due to their prevalence in protein structure. However, prior investigations have pointed to conflicting origins; earlier investigations identified dominant electrostatic dipolar interactions, while others have implicated lone pair n&#8594;&#960;* orbital delocalisation.

      <title>Nature of the Arsonium&#8208;Ylide Ph3As=CH2 and a Uranium(IV) Arsonium&#8208;Carbene Complex</title>
      <dc:description>Treatment of [Ph3EMe][I] with [Na{N(SiMe3)2}] affords the ylides [Ph3E=CH2] (E = As, 1As; P, 1P). For 1As this overcomes prior difficulties in the synthesis of this classical arsonium&#8208;ylide that have historically impeded its wider study. The structure of 1As has now been determined, 45 years after it was first convincingly isolated, and compared to 1P, confirming the long&#8208;proposed hypothesis of increasing pyramidalisation of the ylide&#8208;carbon, highlighting the increasing dominance of E+&#8208;C&#8208; dipolar resonance form (sp3&#8208;C) over the E=C ene p&#8208;bonded form (sp2&#8208;C), as group 15 is descended. The uranium(IV)&#8208;cyclometallate complex [U{N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)2(CH2CH2SiPri2CH(Me)CH2)}] reacts with 1As and 1P by a&#8208;proton abstraction to give [U(TrenTIPS)(CHEPh3)] (TrenTIPS = N(CH2CH2NSiPri3)3; E = As, 2As; P, 2P), where 2As is an unprecedented structurally characterised arsonium&#8208;carbene complex. The short U&#8208;C distances and obtuse U&#8208;C&#8208;E angles suggest significant U=C double bond character. A shorter U&#8208;C distance is found for 2As than 2P, consistent with increased uranium&#8208; and reduced pnictonium&#8208;stabilisation of the carbene as group 15 is descended, which is supported by quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Prediction of CO2/N2 Selectivity in Porous Carbons from N2 Adsorption Isotherm at 77 K via Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <dc:description>Porous carbons are an important class of porous materials with many applications including gas separation, while N  2  adsorption isotherm at 77 K is the most widely used approach to characterize porosity. Conventionally, textual properties such as surface area and pore volumes are derived from the N  2  adsorption isotherm at 77 K via fitting to an adsorption theory and then correlated to gas separation performance (uptake and selectivity). Here we use the N  2  isotherm at 77 K directly as input (representing feature descriptors for the porosity) to train convolutional neural networks that predict gas separation performance (using CO  2  /N  2  as a test case) for porous carbons more accurately. We then explore the porosity space for porous carbons for higher CO  2  /N  2  selectivity. We find that porous carbons with a bimodal pore&#8208;size distribution of well&#8208;separated mesopores (3 &#8211; 7 nm) and micropores (&lt; 2 nm) are most promising. This work will be useful in guiding experimental research of porous carbons with desired porosity for gas separation and other applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Twisted Surfaces in Mesoporous Single Crystals Deliver Enhanced Catalytic activity and Stability</title>
      <dc:description>Porous single crystals which combine ordered lattice structures and disordered inter&#8208;connected pores would provide an alternative to create twisted surface in porous microstructures. Here we grow transition metal nitrides Nb4N5 and MoN single crystals at 2 cm scale to create well&#8208;defined active structures at twisted surfaces and we present high catalytic activity and stability toward non&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. Unsaturated metal&#8208;nitrogen coordination structures including Nb&#8208;N1/5, Nb&#8208;N2/5, Mo&#8208;N1/3 and Mo&#8208;N1/6 at twisted surface mainly account for the C&#8208;H activation with chemisorption of H in molecular ethane at twisted surface, which not only improves dehydrogenation performance but also avoids the deep cracking of ethane to enhance coking resistance. We demonstrate ~11&#8208;25% ethane conversion and ~98&#8208;99% ethylene selectivity without degradation being observed even after the operation of 50 hours.</dc:description>

      <title>Optimization of Active Sites via Crystal Phase, Composition and Morphology for Efficient Low&#8208;Iridium Oxygen Evolution Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Reducing the amount of iridium in oxygen evolution electrocatalysts without compromising their catalytic performances is one of the major requirements in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. Here, with the help of theoretical studies, we show that anatase&#8208;type TiO  2  &#8208;IrO  2  solid solutions possess more active iridium catalytic sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than IrO  2  , the benchmark OER catalyst. It is worth adding that the same is not observed for their rutile&#8208;type counterparts. However, due to their thermodynamic metastablity, anatase&#8208;type TiO  2  &#8208;IrO  2  solid solutions are generally hard to synthesize. Our additional theoretical studies demonstrate that such catalytically active anatase&#8208;type solid&#8208;solution phases can be created  in situ  on the surfaces of readily available SrTiO  3  &#8208;SrIrO  3  solid solutions during electrocatalysis in acidic solution as the solution can etch away Sr atoms. We experimentally show this with porous SrTiO  3  &#8208;SrIrO  3  solid&#8208;solution nanotubes synthesized by a facile synthetic route that comprise 56% lower iridium than IrO  2  yet show an order of magnitude higher apparent catalytic activity for OER in acidic solution. Due to their crystal phase and chemical composition, the materials possess surface iridium sites with optimized oxygen&#8208;binding capability, thereby excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER.</dc:description>

      <title>Cross&#8208;Linked Polyphosphazene Hollow Nanosphere Derived N/P&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon with Single Nonprecious Metal Atoms for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Heteroatom&#8208;doped polymers or carbon nanospheres have attracted a broad research interest because of their fascinating properties. However, rational synthesis of these nanospheres with controllable uniform morphologies, small particle sizes, and well&#8208;designed functionalities is still a great challenge. Herein, we develop an approach to construct cross&#8208;linked polyphosphazene nanospheres with tunable hollow structures via a facile template&#8208;free one&#8208;step method. As comonomers, hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene provides N and P atoms, tannic acid can coordinate with metal ions, and the replaceable third comonomer can endow the materials with various properties. After the carbonization, N/P&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres were obtained. In addition to the hollow structure, small particle size (~50 nm), and high surface area (411.60 m  2  g  &#8208;1  ), atomic structural characterizations confirmed that the single atom transition metal sites (  i.e.  , Co&#8208;N  2  P  2  ) were uniformly dispersed in the carbon shell containing N and P dual coordination. The electrochemical measurements and theoretical simulations revealed the superior oxygen reduction reaction performance of the obtained Co&#8208;N  2  P  2  active sites. This work provides a solution for fabricating diverse heteroatom&#8208;containing polymer nanospheres and their derived single metal atom doped carbon catalysts toward various applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Hydrogenation Using Covalent Triazine Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived organic molecules transforms solar energy to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density chemical bonds, and may enable the production of industrial building&#8208;block chemicals with great economical values. Despite its great potential, photocatalytic hydrogenation remains poorly explored up to now. Existing researches are mostly based on broad bandgap inorganic semiconductors and require the assistance of noble metal based cocatalysts. Herein, we report the preparation of thiophene&#8208;containing covalent triazine polymer as the photocatalyst with unique donor&#8208;acceptor units, and for the first time demonstrate the metal&#8208;free photocatalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated organic molecules exemplified by maleic acid and furfural. Under the visible light illumination, our polymeric photocatalyst enables the transformation of maleic acid to succinic acid with an incredible production rate of ~2 mmol g  &#8208;1h  &#8208;1  , and furfural to furfuryl alcohol with a production rate of ~0.5 mmol g  &#8208;1h  &#8208;1  . Great catalyst stability and recyclability are also measured. Given the structural diversity of polymeric photocatalysts and their readily tunable optical and electronic properties, metal&#8208;free photocatalytic hydrogenation represents a highly promising approach for solar energy conversion.</dc:description>

Herein, multifunctional active&#8208;center&#8208;transferable heterostructured electrocatalysts, platinum/lithium cobalt oxide (Pt/LiCoO2) composites with Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) anchored on LiCoO2 nanosheets, are designed towards highly efficient water splitting. In this electrocatalyst system, the active center can be alternatively switched between Pt species and LiCoO2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Specifically, Pt species are the active centers and LiCoO2 acts as the co&#8208;catalyst for HER, whereas the active center transfers to LiCoO2 and Pt turns into the co&#8208;catalyst for OER. The unique architecture of Pt/LiCoO2 heterostructure provides abundant interfaces with favorable electronic structure and coordination environment towards optimal adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates. The 30% Pt/LiCoO2 heterostructured electrocatalyst delivers low overpotentials of 61 and 285 mV to achieve 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for HER and OER in alkaline medium, respectively. This study will diversify the design strategies for the development of efficient electrocatalysts via interface engineering towards water splitting and beyond.</dc:description>

      <title>Profiling and identification of biocatalyzed transformation of sulfoxaflor in vivo</title>
      <dc:description>In the present study, we investigated the biotransformation of the neonicotinoid pesticide sulfoxaflor and the metabolic responses in Sprague&#8208;Dawley rats. Sulfoxaflor was catalyzed by cytochrome P450 while five phase I and four phase II metabolites were identified for the first time  in vivo  . The experimental results demonstrated that sulfoxaflor brought about the metabolic profiling disturbances in liver and bile. Exposure to sulfoxaflor caused dysregulation of bile acid synthesis and reabsorption by the expression of farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Our data provided insights into biotransformation of chemicals while enabling the implementation of a new toolbox for sulfoximine&#160;compounds design.</dc:description>

      <title>MnOx Nanospikes as Nanoadjuvants and Immuogenic Cell Death Drugs with Enhanced Antitumor Immunity and Antimetastatic Effect</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the widespread applications of manganese oxide nanomaterials (MONs) in biomedicine, the intrinsic immunogenicity of MONs is still unclear. Herein, MnOx  nanospikes (NSs) as tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanoadjuvants and immuogenic cell death (ICD) drugs are proposed firstly for cancer nanovaccine&#8208;based immunotherapy. MnOx  NSs with large mesopores structures show ultrahigh loading efficiencies for ovalbumin and tumor cell fragment. The combination of&#160; ICD via chemodynamic therapy and ferroptosis inductions as well as antigen stimulations presents a better synergistic immunopotentiation action. Furthermore, the obtained nanovaccines can not only achieve TME&#8208;responsive magnetic resonance/photoacoustic dual&#8208;mode imaging contrasts, but also effectively inhibit primary/distal tumor growth as well as tumor metastasis.</dc:description>

      <title>Building up Strain in One Step: Synthesis of an Edge&#8208;Fused Double Silacyclobutene from an Extensively Trichlorosilylated Butadiene Dianion</title>
      <dc:description>The exhaustive trichlorosilylation of hexachloro&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene was achieved in one step by using a mixture of Si  2  Cl  6  and [  n  Bu  4  N]Cl (7:2 equiv) as the silylation reagent. The corresponding butadiene dianion salt [  n  Bu  4  N]  2  [  1  ] was isolated in 36% yield after recrystallization. The negative charges of [  1  ]  2&#8211;  are mainly delocalized across its two carbanionic (Cl  3  Si)  2  C termini (&#945; effect of silicon) such that the central bond possesses largely C=C double&#8208;bond character. Upon treatment with 4 equiv of HCl, [  1  ]  2&#8211;  is converted to neutral 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrakis(trichlorosilyl)but&#8208;2&#8208;ene,  3  . The Cl  &#8211;  acceptor AlCl  3  , induces a twofold ring&#8208;closure reaction of [  1  ]  2&#8211;  to form a six&#8208;membered bicycle  4  in which two silacyclobutene rings are fused along a shared C=C double bond (84%). Compound  4  , which was structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, undergoes partial ring opening to a monocyclic silacyclobutene  2  in the presence of HCl, but is thermally stable up to at least 180 &#176;C.</dc:description>
